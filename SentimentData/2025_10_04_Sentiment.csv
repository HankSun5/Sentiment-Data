CleanSpark Bitcoin production for September totaled 629 BTC, with 445 BTC sold for approximately $48.7 million and the company holding 13,011 BTC in its treasury. The update also highlighted a 26% year‑over‑year improvement in fleet efficiency and an average operating hashrate of 45.6 EH/s. COINOTAG reviewed the company’s disclosed figures and comparable industry data to contextualize the results. Sales are consistent with CleanSpark’s stated strategy to monetize production for liquidity. How did CleanSpark’s efficiency and sales affect its treasury and liquidity? CleanSpark sold 445 BTC in September at an average realized price of about $109,568, generating roughly $48.7 million in proceeds. The company ended the month with 13,011 BTC after the sale, reflecting a balance between accumulation and cash-generation objectives. Fleet-level efficiency improved 26% year over year, which supports lower unit costs per BTC mined. Average operating hashrate of 45.6 EH/s sustained production despite rising network difficulty. CleanSpark shares performance. Source: Yahoo Finance Why are miners facing new pressures? Bitcoin miners face higher energy costs and potential tariffs on imported mining rigs, which can materially affect margins and capital expense forecasts. Tariff exposure has been reported as a significant risk for several publicly traded miners. Customs allegations that some rigs were manufactured in China have created potential tariff liabilities for firms, with reported exposures reaching into the hundreds of millions for certain companies. Tariff rates reported in industry commentary vary by origin and may reach an effective duty of over 50% for China‑origin machines. Network mining difficulty also reached record highs in September and October, increasing the computational work required per BTC and pressuring energy consumption and cost per coin. Bitcoin mining difficulty over 3 years. Source: Coinwarz.com When did CleanSpark change its sales strategy and why? CleanSpark began selling a portion of monthly production in April to pursue greater financial self-sufficiency. The firm also opened an institutional Bitcoin trading desk to facilitate scheduled sales and improve execution. In August, CleanSpark sold 533.5 BTC for about $60.7 million, illustrating the company’s recurring liquidity approach. Management framed sales as a tool to support operations and capital needs rather than a change in long‑term accumulation policy. Frequently Asked Questions How many BTC does CleanSpark hold now? CleanSpark reported 13,011 BTC in its treasury at the end of September after mining 629 BTC and selling 445 BTC during the month. Does selling monthly production mean miners are abandoning accumulation? Selling part of monthly output is a cash-management tactic. Many miners balance accumulation with sales to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures while still retaining strategic BTC reserves. How do tariffs affect miner economics? Tariffs on imported mining rigs increase upfront capital costs and extend payback periods. Reported potential liabilities and duties can materially change project IRRs and equipment replacement cycles. Key Takeaways Production and sales: 629 BTC mined in September; 445 BTC sold for ~ $48.7M. Operational improvement: Fleet efficiency +26% YoY; 45.6 EH/s average operating hashrate. Industry pressures: Rising energy costs, tariffs on rigs, and record mining difficulty are key headwinds. Conclusion CleanSpark Bitcoin production strengthened in September, combining improved fleet efficiency with an active sales program to support liquidity. COINOTAG analysis shows the company balancing accumulation (treasury 13,011 BTC) with operational funding amid rising difficulty and tariff risks.

If approved, this will make it the first major U.S.-regulated exchange to offer around-the-clock access to crypto derivatives, aligning it with DeFi standards. Rising Client Demand The derivatives marketplace announced in a Thursday statement that, subject to regulatory green light, it plans to offer customers the ability to trade cryptocurrency futures and options “24 hours a day, seven days a week” starting in early 2026. The initiative is driven by growing user demand for continuous risk management and liquidity. “While not all markets lend themselves to operating 24/7, client demand for around-the-clock cryptocurrency trading has grown as market participants need to manage their risk every day of the week,” said Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equities, FX and Alternative Products at CME Group. The expanded operation hours will apply to CME’s suite of crypto products, including Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options. Trading will be available continuously via the CME Globex electronic platform, except for a two-hour maintenance window on weekends. On the other hand, weekend and holiday trades will be done on the next business day, with clearing, settlement, and regulatory reporting processed in the same way. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said the development shows that traditional finance is quickly conforming to DeFi practices, stressing that it was “just the beginning.” At a joint roundtable hosted by the SEC and CFTC this week, CEO Terrence Duffy said he expects demand for around-the-clock trading to grow, noting that crypto offers the clearest path to achieving it. Other executives shared the same views, with Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeff Sprecher highlighting that markets should determine which assets are suited for continuous trading. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman explained that her firm is working toward 24/5 equities but still faces practical challenges. Crypto Derivatives Hit Record Highs CME’s initiative might attract institutions seeking the security of a regulated exchange while avoiding the limitations of standard market hours. If approved, it could position the platform ahead of offshore rivals that already run nonstop but operate with less regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, the company’s crypto derivatives have reached new highs in 2025, with notional open interest hitting a record $39 billion in September. In August, average daily open interest rose by 95% from last year to 335,200 contracts, while average daily volume jumped 230% to 411,000 contracts. The exchange also reported a record of more than 1,010 large open interest holders across its crypto offerings.

The coin design was ordered by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, who currently oversees the Mint. It shows Trump’s face on one side, and his fist raised before an American flag on the other, with the words: “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.” The project stems from bipartisan legislation passed in 2020, which Trump signed during his first term. That law gives the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $1 coins in 2026 that must reflect the United States’ semiquincentennial. While the design isn’t final, a spokesperson said the draft “reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.” They added, “Despite the radical left’s forced shutdown of our government, the facts are clear: Under the historic leadership of President Donald J. Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before.” Brandon Beach commented in a post on X that more details would be released “once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.” Trump pushes $1,000 to $2,000 rebate checks from tariffs On Thursday, Trump floated new checks for Americans, paid for with tariff revenues from his trade agenda. In an interview with One America News Network, Trump said the tariffs imposed on foreign countries are now starting to kick in, and he claimed they’d soon total “over a trillion dollars a year.” He added, “We’re thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000 — it would be great,” referring to the payments being considered. He’s previously called it “a dividend to the people of America.” But he acknowledged that Congress must approve any disbursement. The idea comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case next month on whether the president has the power to carry out global tariffs without congressional consent. Trump’s proposal is tied directly to that ongoing legal battle. According to Treasury data cited by Fox Business, the federal government has pulled in around $214.9 billion in tariff income so far this year. In September, $31.3 billion was collected, which was $73 million lower than August’s record. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the U.S. is expected to hit $300 billion in total tariff revenue by the end of 2025. Trump uses shutdown to target Democratic-led agencies As the federal government shutdown entered day two, Trump made it clear he sees it as a chance to slash funding for agencies he calls partisan. Speaking Thursday, Trump said Democrats handed him an “unprecedented opportunity” to start dismantling what he describes as wasteful parts of government. He pointed the blame directly at Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York and leading the opposition to his agenda. Just a day earlier, the Trump administration froze $18 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects in New York City, and canceled another $8 billion in climate-related funding for Democrat-controlled states. These cuts were announced not by the departments involved, but by Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Trump said he’d soon sit down with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut.” He also said they’ll decide “whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” On Truth Social, Trump posted, “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-03 21:53:10

Judge ruled NFTs were consumable collectibles, not investment contracts Judge Fernando M. Olguin found no common enterprise or explicit profit promise tied to Yuga’s NFT sales. Court cited precedent that most digital assets are not securities and noted independent fees and public blockchain trading data. Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge rules BAYC NFTs not securities under Howey Test — read the ruling and implications for NFT buyers and markets. What is the ruling in the Yuga Labs lawsuit? Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed by Judge Fernando M. Olguin concluded the plaintiffs failed to show Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ApeCoin (APE) and other Yuga NFTs qualify as securities under the Howey Test. The court held purchasers bought consumable digital collectibles and membership perks, not investment contracts tied to Yuga’s efforts. How did the court apply the Howey Test to BAYC and ApeCoin? The judge assessed the three Howey prongs—an investment of money, a common enterprise, and an expectation of profit produced by others—and found the plaintiffs proved none. The ruling noted Yuga marketed NFTs as collectibles with membership benefits and did not make explicit profit promises to buyers. Judge Olguin dismisses investor lawsuit against Yuga Labs. Source: Court Listener Why did the court find no common enterprise or profit expectation? Judge Olguin determined the NFTs’ trading on public blockchains and the transactional structure did not create the ongoing, dependent financial relationship required for a common enterprise. Fees paid to Yuga were treated as independent charges, and the roadmap and promotional statements did not equate to enforceable profit promises. The court emphasized: “Statements about a product’s inherent or intrinsic value are not necessarily statements about profit.” Even references to past prices or trading volumes were insufficient to establish an actionable expectation of profit under Howey. What evidence and precedent influenced the decision? The ruling referenced legal precedent that most digital assets are not automatically securities and examined specific contractual and marketing language from Yuga. Commentary from market participants and attorneys — including public posts by industry lawyers — were discussed as factual context without altering the court’s statutory analysis. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge finds BAYC and ApeCoin not securities under Howey Test"", ""description"": ""Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge rules BAYC NFTs not securities under the Howey Test and finds no common enterprise or explicit profit promises."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199abe3-4502-79f8-bcbf-3bfe50df810b"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/yuga-labs-lawsuit-dismissed"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the court applied the Howey Test to Yuga Labs NFTs"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step summary of how Judge Olguin evaluated whether Yuga Labs NFTs are investment contracts under the Howey Test."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199abe3-4502-79f8-bcbf-3bfe50df810b"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the investment of money"", ""text"": ""The court reviewed whether purchasers provided money or its functional equivalent when buying NFTs."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess common enterprise"", ""text"": ""The judge examined whether buyers’ fortunes were linked to Yuga Labs through an ongoing dependent financial relationship."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate expectation of profit"", ""text"": ""The court analyzed marketing, roadmaps and public statements to determine if Yuga promised profits derived from others’ efforts."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin securities after this ruling?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The court dismissed the lawsuit, finding plaintiffs did not show BAYC NFTs or ApeCoin met the Howey Test requirements to be securities."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What did the court say about promises of profit?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The judge ruled that product-value statements and mentions of trading volumes alone did not constitute explicit promises of profit sufficient to meet Howey’s expectation-of-profit prong."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does this ruling change SEC policy on digital assets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""This decision is a federal court ruling applying Howey to specific facts; it provides judicial analysis but does not unilaterally change SEC regulation or enforcement policy."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Do the court’s findings apply to all NFTs? The decision applies to the specific facts of the Yuga Labs case. It reinforces that classification depends on contractual terms, marketing, purchaser expectations and how tokens function in practice. What role did the project roadmap play in the ruling? The roadmap and forward-looking statements were reviewed but the court found they did not create enforceable promises of profit tied to Yuga’s efforts, and thus did not satisfy the Howey expectation-of-profit prong. Key Takeaways Legal outcome : Federal judge dismissed investor claims that BAYC and related NFTs are securities. Howey Test application : Plaintiffs failed to show a common enterprise or clear expectation of profit produced by Yuga. Market implication : The ruling underscores that NFT classification is fact-specific; creators should clarify marketing and purchaser expectations. Conclusion The Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissal clarifies how a federal court applied the Howey Test to iconic NFTs, emphasizing that marketing as consumable collectibles and the absence of explicit profit promises weigh against securities classification. Market participants should document product features and communications to reduce regulatory ambiguity.

Ripple (XRP) remains a favorite, with its strong position in cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory progress maintaining it firmly in the crosshairs of institutional investors. Attention is now, however, trending more in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at a mere $0.035 in its Phase 6 presale, now over 55% sold out, MUTM is generating colossal hype among early adopters and whales alike. With 16,710+ addresses and $16.7 million raised, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be a DeFi altcoin with the potential to overshadow industry stalwarts like XRP, making it one of the most promising cryptos to buy now. XRP Experiences Symmetrical Triangle Breakout as SEC ETF Gives Updates XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, which would represent a breakout after recent price action higher. Price currently is trading in this pattern, where the breakout zone is at approximately $3.15, and a confirmed move above this point would seek to reach $3.50 and beyond based on previous momentum. Close resistance is seen around $3.08, and a heavy volume breakout would signal bullish continuation and good trading entries. With the US SEC withdrawing delay notices for XRP and other crypto ETFs, the market is poised for potential upside, and XRP is a key stock to watch on the watchlist. Meanwhile, investor focus is also turning towards emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is drawing rising interest in addition to established rivals. MUTM Presale Momentum Expands Velocity MUTM tokens currently cost $0.035 during Presale Round 6, a 16.17% rise from the previous round. Extremely firm investor appetite persists with over 16,710 investors moving over $16.7 million into the project so far. As a further step in enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat developers and hackers are welcome to report bugs. Four levels of severity of bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are made available so that bugs could be detected early and remediated. It is based on robust collateral management to protect the network and participants. Unlimited deposit limits, lending limits, and collateral ratios are some of the properties that secure it. Undercollateral position real-time closing and remediation charges and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the very center of the design of Mutuum Finance. Through LTV ratio optimization and assuming overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages as much capital as possible with effective guards. Reserve requirements are employed to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, and reserves overlying can be employed to hedge volatility in risk assets. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance on three axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is bringing DeFi to the retail and institutional investor bases. As a gesture to its growing base, Mutuum Finance launched a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 winners would be given $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The move is an indication of the platform’s intent to reward early adopters, as well as showcase its vision more prominently. Position Early for the ETF-Driven Surge With the ETF approval environment growing as rapidly as it is, both Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are set to benefit. XRP’s proven track record as a major international payment contender and regulatory progress keep it among the institutional exposure leaders. Yet those hoping for even greater upside have a limited early-stage window in MUTM. The project has already raised more than $16.7 million from more than 16,710 investors so far, with Phase 6 of its presale more than 55% sold and tokens still at $0.035. Its dual lending ecosystem, collateral optimization, and $50,000 bug bounty contribute to platform security and long-term upside, while a $100,000 giveaway encourages early adoption. Since ETF approvals drive market expansion at an accelerating pace, securing a stake in MUTM today might provide substantial returns during the next notable bull cycle.

MAGACOIN FINANCE can be seen as one of the highest analyst picks that is expected to have an ROI of 55x at the end of 2025. XRP is in the meantime clinging to major support, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing the interest of whales from ETFs. Analysts indicate that the next altcoin season might be determined by these three coins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE becoming one of the best presale opportunities to deliver high returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale Analysts place MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best crypto presale that could bring a 55x ROI by the end of 2025. This is an early-stage project that operates on the Ethereum blockchain with a deflationary token model and a transaction burn rate of 12% , meant to lower supply and push demand long term. It has independent smart contract audits, adding credibility to it, while aiding in ensuring investors of transparency and security in a time when trust is critical. Future exchange listings increase the presale momentum. By offering early buyers a potential return from increased demand when listings become available, analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE to have a healthy debut. Its mix of proven smart contracts, tokenomics based on scarcity, and aggressive growth strategy makes it stand out among dozens of speculative crypto presales on the market. In addition to technical strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in line with the major market trends. History has demonstrated that quality projects with strong fundamentals and a supportive community can perform well during the altcoin season. The project is anchoring its value proposition on both scarcity and adoption, thus creating a place of sustainable relevance. XRP price holds support as analysts monitor october move XRP is still under the watch of analysts, retaining the $2.67 support level , which has been defended over the months. Starting around $3.65 in July, XRP calmed down following Bitcoin, which went down to a low of about $109,000 after reaching a high of $125,000. However, analysts suggest the pullback is a good rest before possible upside to $7 in October. Supported by many macro and regulatory triggers, the spot crypto ETF application is undergoing review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, while the MiCA framework in Europe is progressing towards bringing digital asset clarity. Also, a speculation by traders that the Federal Reserve rate may be cut to $3.75-$4.00 could open up institutional inflows. Such advances would raise liquidity and trust in crypto markets, and XRP would have the catalyst to break out. Under this larger construct, MAGACOIN FINANCE will attract investors willing to have an early exposure with high growth prospects, rather than well-established projects such as XRP. With analysts estimating the Ethereum-based presale to yield 55x ROI , some traders are cashing in on XRP profits to purchase outsized presales to earn disproportionate profits. DOGE price steadies as whales accumulate and ETF buzz builds Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing attention from analysts, having withstood volatilities in the market and held the support level of $0.22 . On-chain data show that whales purchased 2 billion DOGE in 48 hours , contributing almost $480 million to its market value. This aggressive buildup has been a historical precursor of price rallies, which is an indicator of a possible bullish action in the coming weeks. On the other hand, sentiment is also driven by institutional adoption. The recently introduced REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF had inflows in excess of $8.7 million, and corporate investors like Thumzup Media are introducing DOGE to treasury reserves. Moreover, such moves, coupled with technical arrangements towards $0.30 and $0.35, according to analysts, indicate a stronger long-term development. With this bullish backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a presale opportunity that strengthens the upside of established names such as Dogecoin by having greater early-stage growth prospects. Conclusion According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale with a 55x ROI expectation , whose smart contracts and tokenomics are audited. As both XRP and Dogecoin remain strong contenders with institutional-level engagement and solid price action, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents an exceptional opportunity to get outsized returns before mainstream listings, placing the altcoin at the center stage in the next altcoin season.

It has clear resilience in one coin but overall weakness. Even during bouts of volatility, it is evident that the bull market shows no sign of dying. The conditions for expansion continue to be in place, from broad accumulation and undervalued altcoins to macro tailwinds, sentiment cycles and narrative rotation. If you aren’t looking at Bitcoin or Ethereum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could potentially benefit greatly as capital looks for profit upside. In the following paragraphs, I will highlight five major signs of durability this cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s role within the larger ecosystem, and provide tactical guardrails for participation. 1. High Proportion of Altcoins Below Key Moving Averages The altcoin universe is rife with latent upside, which is one of the most promising signals for bull market longevity. Despite a wider rally in crypto, 76 % of utcoins on major exchanges are still trading below their 200-day simple moving average (SMA), latest data indicates. This suggests that much of the market could still be in accumulation/discount zones instead of overbought areas. This difference means that if the feeling and money availability are right, many altcoins can go up. Furthermore, it lowers the odds of a straight reversal because strong bull markets tend to rally off weakness, meaning capital rotations in from laggards after leading assets confirm strength. 2. Declining Selling Pressure and Stabilizing Accumulation A strong bull market comes from confidence, not just momentum. A drop in selling pressure by long-term holders is one subtle but strong sign, paired with steady accumulation. Based on on-chain and exchange metrics, large level distributions appear to have slowed, whereas mid-tier wallets are seeing inflows. In other words, that kind of behavior indicates building of patience behind the moving averages, not panic buying at tops. In this market, crypto does not necessarily have to keep making new highs, but must avoid aggressive breakdowns. That ability to be resilient under pressure is a sign of deeper cycles. When accumulation zones hold, confidence returns and rotation into speculation becomes possible. 3. Macro Liquidity Tailwinds & Rate Dynamics Supporting Risk Assets Bull markets in crypto rarely exist in a vacuum. The situation with macro backdrops, especially liquidity flows and central bank policy direction affects strength. The latest investor expectations regarding interest rate cuts for late 2025 could lessen discounting pressures on the growth assets. Liquidity across the global markets is loosening and money flows from equities, private markets, and institutional allocations are eyeing digital assets. That cross-asset momentum can amplify crypto cycles. In previous runs, a considerable amount of the strongest legs came from macro/sector alignment. Speculators are aggressive when the risk appetite arises and rates fall. 4. Narrative Rotation and Expanding Themes Analysts are pointing to five key signals showing the bull market remains intact, from ETF inflows to rising retail participation. Within that framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining mention as a presale embodying the speculative wealth-creation angle. With contract audits from CertiK and HashEx , it avoids the pitfalls of many short-lived launches, while still carrying scenarios of 100x-style generational wealth outcomes under extreme bullish conditions. For long-term investors, the takeaway is clear: combining secure majors with small presale bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE is a way to capture both safety and exponential potential. As signals confirm bull strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being highlighted as the speculative ticket that could transform modest entries into cycle-defining wealth stories. Rather than competing with top alts, MAGACOIN FINANCE acts as a high-reward complement, an asset where flows looking for hidden alpha might concentrate once macro and narrative conditions are favorable. 5. Institutional & Retail Flows Still Entering – Not Exiting One of the easiest distinctions between a bull market that is tired and one that has matured is large flows. At the high points in the market cycle, we see exits and liquidations. For the time being, we’re seeing flows into Bitcoin and early-stage speculative allocations. ETF trackers are indicating sustained demand for spot Bitcoin funds. Retail and small cap interest remains healthy. Metrics show people are just re-engaging, not capitulating. In addition, retail search trends and social sentiment show this. The so-called “stable core inflows” plus speculative appetites form a stable core around which other financial systems can revolve. It indicates that there is more than just momentum driving the market, but new capital. Putting the Signs Together: Bull Market Underlying Strength A combination of five items including selling pressure, altcoins trading below long-term averages, macro tailwinds, narrative expansion, and institutional/retail flows can provide a blueprint for a bull market with legs. These signals show structural resilience, rather than a single breakout or hype event. Many cycles fail when one or more of these pillars breaks—the macro tightening, the narrative exhaustion, and the wholesale exits. But for now, the architecture remains intact. Tactical Strategy & Risk Management To position yourself through such a phase, here’s a disciplined approach: Anchor a core portfolio in BTC/ETH and market leaders. Allocate a growth bucket to promising alts with fundamentals. Reserve a tactical optional bucket for high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Use layered entries in speculative assets – don’t rush all capital at once. Watch confirmation triggers : volume breakouts, listing announcements, accumulation bursts. Maintain tight stop or reallocation zones to guard against sharp reversals. Track macro and narrative inflection points closely – liquidity, rate shifts, regulatory developments matter. Conclusion The crypto bull market still shows signs of life in the midst of noise. The entire cycle architecture is still intact, from undervalued alts and decreasing selling to macro support and narrative rotation and consistent inflows. Now, the real difference comes from where capital allocates next. During this stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE type projects are not very core holdings rather leveraged optionality at this stage. When the cycle expands outwards, they often capture disproportionate upside. For traders and allocators who are ready to balance the structured as well as the asymmetric bets; this stage could be one of the most rich when it comes to opportunities in the evolving history of crypto.

According to crypto analyst Kevin, the historical risk levels that usually mark cycle tops are currently nowhere near flashing red for Dogecoin. Chart analysis of Dogecoin’s historical risk levels shows that the meme coin is still sitting in what looks like a mid-cycle phase, and the kind of overheated price action that preceeds exhaustion has not yet appeared. Dogecoin Historical Risk Levels Point To More Upside Kevin’s latest post on the social media platform X showcased Dogecoin’s historical risk levels in a color-coded chart between 0 and 1, with 0 being the lowest risk and 1 being the highest risk. The chart, which covers many cycles going as far back as 2014, shows moments when risk was at extreme levels and prices were near exhaustion. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Dogecoin Investors Should Expect Price-Wise This Month Periods of high market exhaustions are classified in warm colors, with red being the highest. For instance, Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021 was classified by a red risk level. On the other hand, those of low market activity are classified in cool colors, with deep blue being the lowest level of activity. The current reading of 0.52 is far from those red danger zones, which have historically aligned with blow-off tops. Instead, Dogecoin is currently in what Kevin describes as a mid-cycle state. That assessment aligns with the latest price action, which shows Dogecoin now holding above $0.25 after last week’s consolidation between $0.22 and $0.23. Dogecoin’s Biggest Move Still Ahead? With the latest Dogecoin risk level sitting at around 0.52, this suggests that Dogecoin has not yet entered the type of frenzy that often defines the final phase of a cycle. Therefore, it means that the king of meme coin still has a lot of rally to play out, and there’s the possibility of charting a path to a new all-time high if crypto market conditions provide the right backdrop. We have not had that type of price action yet this cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs Kevin’s latest update builds on observations he made earlier in August, where he noted the importance of monthly Stoch RSI crosses during bull market environments. Whenever Dogecoin registered such crosses outside of bear markets, the result was a massive upside rally. At that time, the Stoch RSI was climbing from the 13 level, and this is associated with weak momentum turning into strength. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2554, meaning it is up by about 12.5% in the past 24 hours. Given the current setup and the possibility of a Spot Dogecoin ETF hitting the US market soon, it is reasonable to expect that Dogecoin could climb much higher before it enters the overheated territory. In this case, hitting the $1 price level is not out of the question.

Solana’s ongoing upward trend in price has coincided with a remarkable surge in the blockchain’s on-chain activity and adoption. Q3 Blockchain Revenue Race Heats Up, And Solana Is Leading Following a recent rally in the price of SOL, there has been a strong uptick in on-chain activity and engagement. Specifically, the Solana blockchain is experiencing substantial inflows, as revenue increases sharply. The report from Solana’s official page on the social media platform X reveals that the blockchain is witnessing one of the fastest revenue growth rates in history. A surge in user activity, active DeFi participation, and a surge in demand for on-chain applications likely drive this sharp growth in revenue . Furthermore, the development highlights the blockchain’s competitive advantage and durability in a dense market. While competitors have found it difficult to keep up, Solana’s effectiveness and scalability keep drawing in developers and funding, putting it at the vanguard of blockchain ecosystem expansion and profitability. According to the data, Solana has cemented its position as a top-performing blockchain in the third quarter of this year in terms of overall revenue generated in the quarter. With over $222 million in revenue recorded in Q3, the blockchain has surpassed all major crypto networks in the sector. It is worth noting that after dominating Q3 of 2025, Solana has now led all major crypto networks for 4 consecutive quarters as number 1. SOL’s persistent dominance in revenue for the past four quarters is obviously sending a strong message about SOL’s place in the future of decentralized finance and scalable blockchain infrastructure. Over the last year, the platform highlighted that users on the SOL blockchain have paid the network more than $2.1 billion for blockspace. Interestingly, data shows that over 46% of the entire fees were paid in cryptocurrency. SOL Blockchain Is Becoming The Hub For Stablecoins The Solana blockchain’s adoption and interest are evidenced by the large number of stablecoin flows on the chain. In another X post from the official Solana page, stablecoin adoption on SOL is surging at an unprecedented pace when compared to other chains. In terms of stablecoin inflows , the SOL blockchain is at the top, outpacing all layer 1 and layer 2 chains over a period of 24 hours. This development implies that SOL is becoming the go-to settlement layer for stablecoin transfers due to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and incredibly cheap costs, which encourage record inflows and on-chain activity. With this dramatic increase in stablecoin inflows, SOL’s role in global crypto payments and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is clearly growing. In addition, it solidifies the network’s standing as the leading hub for dollar-pegged assets in the dynamic blockchain market.",Solana|decentralized finance|DeFi|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Blockchain|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|stablecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 22:00:30

The charter would allow Coinbase to build on its existing custody business by offering services such as payments and settlement, without seeking a charter as a full-service bank. ""Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank,"" Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase, said in a blog post. ""It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security."" Today, the U.S. crypto exchange's main regulated custody service is run through Coinbase Custody Trust Company (CCTC), which is licensed under New York state’s BitLicense regime. That framework, introduced in 2015, was one of the earliest state-level regulatory models for crypto in the U.S. A federal trust charter would give the company more flexibility to launch new financial services such as crypto payments without needing state-by-state approvals.

World Liberty Financial Sets Its Sights on Expansion Witkoff, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, made the announcement alongside WLF co-founder Donald Trump Jr. at the Singapore-based crypto event on October 1. “We’ll be rolling out a pilot program here in the next quarter, and that debit card will either be live Q4 or Q1 ‘26,” Witkoff said. The WLF CEO also touted that the organization is “actively working” on the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, oil, and gas.

In March 2025, WLF launched USD1, a dollar-pegged stablecoin that the digital asset organization dubs “the US dollar…for a new era.” In May, WLF announced that MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi firm, planned to invest $2 billion worth of USD1 into crypto exchange Binance. Critics have argued that the deal poses serious ethics violations , with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley calling it “a staggering conflict of interest.” “This deal raises the troubling prospect that the Trump and Witkoff families could expand the use of their stablecoin as an avenue to profit from foreign corruption,” the U.S. lawmakers said. Despite concerns, it appears that WLF is pressing ahead with its tokenization and crypto payment ventures.

In a statement released on October 2, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), chaired by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, pointed out vulnerabilities in so-called “third country multi-issuer” stablecoin models and called for immediate policy action. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a steady value by pegging to fiat currencies or government securities, have surged over the past five years into a market worth more than $300 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The sector is dominated by dollar-backed tokens, with Tether’s USDT controlling more than 58% of the market. Euro-backed tokens, by contrast, account for just 0.15% of the global total. The ESRB, during its 59th General Board meeting on September 25, stressed that interchangeable tokens issued both within and outside the EU contain “built-in vulnerabilities.” Lagarde Pushes Back on Offshore Stablecoin Structures Under MiCA Gaps Under this structure, EU-regulated issuers must hold reserves locally, while non-EU partners manage identical tokens backed abroad. Regulators warn that during times of stress, investors could rush to redeem in the EU, overwhelming local reserves and leaving the bloc exposed to offshore liabilities. According to people familiar with discussions, the ESRB endorsed a recommendation to ban such models. Though non-binding, the move places pressure on EU authorities to either impose restrictions or outline other protections. At its meeting on 25 September, the General Board assessed the main risks to EU financial stability. Read the press release https://t.co/WHx4JHyIWc pic.twitter.com/YmVEGSIB4D — European Systemic Risk Board (@ESRBofficial) October 2, 2025 Both the ECB and ESRB declined to comment on the proposal, but Lagarde has repeatedly shown concern that the bloc’s regulatory framework, known as MiCA, leaves gaps in coverage for cross-border schemes. Lagarde compared the risk to past banking crises, where liquidity mismatches and inadequate reserves destabilized institutions across borders. She argued that unless strong equivalence regimes and safeguards for cross-border transfers are introduced, multi-issuer models should not be permitted to operate in Europe. The warnings come as global financial risks remain elevated. The ESRB noted that investor optimism has pushed asset valuations to record highs, leaving markets vulnerable to reversals. While stress tests show European banks are resilient, weak growth prospects and rising fiscal pressures continue to weigh on stability. The board pointed to ongoing geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies as additional challenges for Europe’s financial outlook. Stablecoins Face Rising Global Scrutiny as Regulators Warn of Systemic Risks Stablecoins are also under scrutiny elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee warned that poorly managed reserves could trigger fire sales and destabilize broader markets. The committee also flagged the risk of currency substitution, where foreign-denominated stablecoins weaken the use of domestic money. On October 1, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said systemic stablecoins may gain access to central bank accounts but warned that such tokens could reshape Britain’s financial system by separating money-holding from credit provision. Bank of England Governor says stablecoins could reduce UK reliance on commercial banks while proposing controversial ownership caps. #UK #Stablecoin https://t.co/TW5EGT8a6O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 In the United States, regulators have moved in a different direction. In July, Congress passed the GENIUS Act , the first federal law covering stablecoins, which sets capital and reserve requirements for issuers. Analysts at Morningstar DBRS project the market could exceed $1 trillion in annual payments by 2030. The firm described stablecoins as programmable money, combining fiat stability with blockchain efficiency to deliver faster, cheaper payments compared to systems such as SWIFT or wire transfers. Still, the rapid expansion of stablecoins has unsettled parts of the U.S. banking sector. Trade associations warn that adoption could drain deposits and disrupt lending. Coinbase has countered this view by releasing research in August , arguing that fears of deposit flight are overstated and that stablecoins reinforce the global role of the dollar. Coinbase published a defense against banking claims that stablecoins threaten financial stability, calling the ""deposit erosion"" narrative a ""myth"" protecting banks' $187 billion monopoly. #Coinbase #Stablecoin https://t.co/Kpshr7e1K2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 The exchange noted that banks already hold trillions in reserves at the Federal Reserve, offering little benefit to depositors, while stablecoins provide higher yields and near-instant settlement. For European regulators, the debate extends beyond banking competition. Officials warn that reliance on dollar-based tokens undermines financial sovereignty and weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy. ECB adviser Jürgen Schaaf has cautioned that the dominance of U.S. issuers such as Tether and Circle leaves Europe dependent on offshore structures. Circle and Paxos are among the issuers most affected by the EU’s proposed restrictions. Both manage reserves primarily in U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, while their EU operations are overseen by regulators in France and Finland. Authorities in both countries have so far declined to comment. The ESRB said it will publish a detailed report on stablecoins, crypto-investment products, and multi-function financial groups in the coming weeks. Its latest risk dashboard shows systemic risks in the EU remain “elevated,” reinforcing why stablecoins are now viewed as a pressing concern.

AI agents will route liquidity to the best-priced, most reliable stablecoins. Regulatory clarity and growing market depth have pushed stablecoins past $300 billion in market cap. Autonomous agents could compress fees, boost transaction volume and reshape payments infrastructure. AI agents stablecoins — Learn how AI routing can turn fragmentation into a competitive advantage; read expert insights and next steps. AI agents stablecoins are autonomous programs that can detect pricing and liquidity across issuers and instantly move funds to the most efficient stablecoin, potentially making fragmentation a market-level optimizer rather than a barrier to adoption. What is the role of AI agents in stablecoin adoption? AI agents stablecoins means autonomous software will analyze rates, liquidity and counterparty risk, then execute transfers to the optimal issuer. This capability can reduce user friction and ensure liquidity concentrates where execution and economics are best, speeding stablecoin adoption for payments and commerce. How could fragmentation become an advantage? Fragmentation historically creates liquidity silos and user confusion. But AI agents can treat fragmentation as a selection mechanism. By continuously comparing issuer economics, agents can route transactions to the lowest-cost provider. That competitive pressure may compress spreads, raise service quality and force issuers to improve fundamentals. Why has stablecoin market cap reached $300 billion and what does that mean? The stablecoin market exceeded $300 billion due to clearer regulation in major jurisdictions, institutional demand and increased retail use. Higher market cap increases depth and reduces slippage, making automated routing by AI agents more effective and reliable. Who are the key market participants and emerging models? Major dollar-backed issuers, algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins, and corporate-backed tokens like PayPal’s PYUSD now coexist. Each model offers different tradeoffs in liquidity, redemption mechanics and settlement speed. Market participants include industry leaders and new entrants building on unique business integrations. The rise of AI agents in crypto: what industry leaders say Paxos Labs co-founder Bhau Kotecha warns fragmentation can create confusion but adds AI agents will “switch instantly” to the best economics, turning fragmentation into a market optimizer. Similar views were expressed by other industry figures who expect agents to become core stablecoin users. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz highlighted that AI agents can drive transaction volumes for stablecoins by handling routine purchases on behalf of users, replacing slower settlement rails. Which companies are building relevant infrastructure? Cloudflare announced a project called NET dollar to enable instant AI-driven transactions. Other industry teams are experimenting with payment standards—examples include discussions around HTTP 402 as a payments primitive for agent-driven commerce. These initiatives point to an emerging stack combining fast rails, stablecoins and intelligent routing. NET Dollar stablecoin characteristics. Source: Cloudflare (mentioned as plain text) How will AI agents change fees, liquidity and user experience? AI agents can compress fees by constantly selecting lower-cost execution venues and aggregating liquidity. That reduces friction for end users and can enable micro-payments that were uneconomical with higher fees. Improved UX arises from agents handling complexity—users delegate choices and see fewer failed transactions or confusing options. Stablecoin ecosystem participants. Source: Ethereum Foundation (mentioned as plain text) What are the risks and required infrastructure changes? Risks include concentration of systemic liquidity, oracle and routing manipulation, and interoperability gaps across chains and custodians. Addressing these requires intent-based blockchain primitives, robust auditability and user data controls. Experts like Adrian Brink emphasize the need for intent-based infrastructure so users retain control over data and assets while agents act on their behalf. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can AI agents reduce stablecoin fragmentation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

AI agents evaluate economics, liquidity, settlement speed and counterparty risk, then route transactions to the issuer that optimizes those factors for the user’s intent. Are AI agents already using stablecoins today? Companies and research teams are building prototypes and standards; early production use is limited but accelerating as rails and regulation mature. Key Takeaways AI agents can optimize liquidity : Autonomous routing concentrates flows to efficient issuers, improving execution. Fragmentation may become competitive : Multiple issuer models can coexist if agents handle selection efficiently. Infrastructure matters : Intent-based primitives, fast rails and transparent pricing are prerequisites for safe adoption. Conclusion AI agents stablecoins are poised to change how stablecoins are used by routing liquidity, lowering costs and enabling new commerce models. As market cap grows past $300 billion, the focus shifts to building secure rails and standards so agents can safely act on users’ behalf.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion cornerstone of the digital asset market, is currently trading about 4% shy of its record high of $124,128. It advanced 2% overnight, mirroring the 2% increase in overall crypto market capitalization, which has now reached $4.19 trillion. Historically, October, (nicknamed “Uptober”), has been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, adding weight to expectations that new peaks for leading cryptocurrencies may be just around the corner. Meanwhile, U.S. policy shifts are providing additional tailwinds. In July, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first federal law requiring stablecoins to maintain full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, a sweeping modernization effort to align securities regulations with the digital asset space. With clearer rules emerging, some analysts believe the upcoming altcoin run could even surpass the heights of 2021. If DeepSeek’s predictions play out, XRP, Solana, and Pepe could be at the forefront of this move. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Sees Path Toward $10 According to DeepSeek, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could rally to $10 by the end of 2025, more than triple its current $3.04 price point. Source: DeepSeek AI The token has already shown resilience this year, briefly touching $3.65 on July 18, its highest since 2018’s $3.40 peak, before sliding back 16.5% due to various macro-economic and political pressures. Ripple continues to strengthen its payments infrastructure, securing institutional adoption worldwide. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as a cost-effective remittance tool for developing nations. A major turning point came in early 2025, when the SEC officially dropped its long-running lawsuit after a 2023 court decision ruled that retail XRP sales did not constitute securities. DeepSeek believes that a decisive breakout above the July high could set XRP on course for $5 to $10 before year-end. ChatGPT and other AI models even suggest a more aggressive scenario, projecting potential runs toward $20. Over the past year, XRP has gained 492%, dramatically quintupling Bitcoin’s 99% and Ethereum’s 90% gains over the same period. Technicals are favorable as well, with three bullish flag formations developing in 2023, hinting at high upside potential into Q4. Although Fed rate cuts and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t trigger an immediate breakout. However, Uptober hype, new ETF approvals in mid-October, and fresh U.S. crypto legislation by Christmas could be powerful catalysts. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek AI Predicts a Surge Toward $1,200 Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself as a leading smart contract blockchain, boasting a market cap above $124.8 billion and over $12.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem. Developer activity and institutional adoption remain strong and expanding. Speculation is building that a spot Solana ETF in the U.S. could soon emerge, potentially sparking inflows similar to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Trump has floated the possibility of incorporating Solana into a proposed U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Under his concept, however, the government would only acquire SOL through asset seizures, not direct buying. In terms of price action, Solana peaked at $250 in January, slipped to $100 in April, and rebounded to $247 on September 19, nearly retesting this year’s highs. At it’s current price of $230, it’s once more eying a new high watermark. Now breaking out of a bullish flag, DeepSeek projects that Solana could reach $1,200 by year-end, more than quadruple its all-time high of $293.31. Still, this target hinges on ETF approval and ongoing regulatory clarity. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin With 10× Upside Potential Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, has quickly cemented itself as a top-three meme coin with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, the most valuable meme coin not tied to a dog theme. Its appeal lies in cultural relevance, drawing from Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series. Despite fierce competition, Pepe’s strong liquidity and community backing have helped it stay relevant. Elon Musk has even joked about holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin on X, further boosting its visibility. Currently priced at $0.00001003, Pepe has pulled back but continues to hold firm at key support levels. A decisive breakout above $0.000018–$0.000022 could open the path to $0.00003 by mid-autumn. DeepSeek envisions a bull market scenario where Pepe could climb as high as $0.0001, a staggering 10× jump. While such gains may be constrained by its already substantial market cap, the token could still deliver outsized performance compared to other meme plays. Technical charts show a descending wedge between November and March, a typically bullish pattern that could help drive Pepe to $0.00005 by winter, effectively quintupling its value. With U.S. regulatory clarity improving, Pepe could be positioned for far larger moves. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Side Play While DeepSeek sees propitious things for the above coins, one project that is flying under its radar is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme coin marketing itself as Dogecoin’s long-lost degen gym bro cousin. It caters to traders drawn to high-volatility, small-cap bets backed by community hype. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap asset, Maxi Doge embraces its high-risk, meme-driven identity. Since its launch, it has already raised $2.7 million in just a few weeks. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI focuses on community-led growth via Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading competitions, and upcoming partnerships. Out of its 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing and collaborations. Staking is live, offering rewards up to 125% APY, though yields will decline as participation increases. At present, presale tokens are available at $0.0002605, with higher pricing scheduled in future rounds. Investors can buy through the Maxi Doge website using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Bitcoin is holding strong near $120,400, just 3% away from its record-breaking ATH in August. But while BTC holds the spotlight, smart money is flowing rapidly into altcoins and top-performing meme coins , many of which have already hit new highs this year. What’s behind this surge? Two historic policy shifts from Washington are rewriting the rules of the game. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act , the first-ever U.S. law built to legitimize and regulate stablecoins. Then came the SEC’s Project Crypto , a sweeping initiative to modernize securities laws for the digital asset era—a clear green light for broader institutional involvement. With bullish momentum accelerating, tokens like XRP, Zcash, and Aster are quickly emerging as top picks for traders hunting the next breakout opportunity. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Pioneer and Best Large Cap Crypto Altcoin of 2025 XRP ($XRP) reached a fresh peak of $3.65 on July 18 following the passage of the GENIUS Act, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40. Since then, it has cooled to about $3.04, reflecting a 16.5% retracement. The asset’s appeal lies in its efficiency as a low-cost, fast settlement network for international transactions, positioning it as a viable challenger to traditional payment rails like SWIFT. Partnerships with organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and rising adoption among U.S. financial firms have only strengthened its credibility. Ripple’s growing influence was highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House crypto policy roundtable earlier this year. Its launch of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, shows its ambition to carve out a slice of the potentially trillion-dollar stablecoin sector. A decisive 2023 court ruling confirmed retail XRP sales are not securities, removing a long-standing regulatory overhang and allowing the token to rally to multi-year highs. Over the past year, XRP has gained 492%, far outperforming Bitcoin’s 98% rise. After a summer breakout, the coin consolidated near $3 before its typical September correction. Currently, its RSI has risen from 45 mid-week to around 57 today, indicating that a fairly broad and quick buy-in has been happening this week. While recent rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t spark an immediate breakout, likely due to markets pricing in the news, technical patterns show multiple bullish flags forming. With additional ETF decisions expected in mid-October, analysts suggest XRP could climb anywhere between $5 and $10, or higher. Zcash ($ZEC): Privacy-First Crypto Rallies an Astonishing 172% in 7 Days Zcash ($ZEC) is a developing privacy-focused cryptocurrency that emerged in 2016 from a fork of the Bitcoin codebase. While Bitcoin’s transactions are public and pseudonymous, Zcash was engineered to offer a solution for those who seek genuine financial privacy. The core of its technology is a cryptographic breakthrough known as zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). This innovation allows for transaction validation on a public blockchain without revealing key metadata, such as the sender, recipient, or the amount transacted. The Zcash protocol provides a unique dual-address system, giving users the choice between transparent, Bitcoin-like addresses and completely shielded addresses, allowing for selective disclosure and enabling users to share transaction details for auditing or compliance purposes while maintaining confidentiality for other transactions. In the last seven days, Zcash rallied a phenomenal 172% and now trades around $147, as demand for privacy coins surges with a broader “Uptober” rally. Zcash may have gained the most, but other projects like Dash ($DASH) and Verge ($XVG) rallied close to 100% over the last seven days. That said, Zcash’s high RSI of 92 indicates it is due a correction, which could take it back to the sub-$100 level in the short-term. However, as we move towards the New Year, bulls will likely be eying $300 as the next leg up. Aster (ASTER) Aster ($ASTER) represents a new generation of decentralized perpetual exchanges, a project born from the strategic merger of two successful DeFi protocols, Astherus and APX Finance. The platform’s objective is to bridge the gap between the user experience of centralized exchanges and the security of on-chain trading. By offering both perpetual contracts and spot trading on a single interface, Aster aims to simplify and enhance the DeFi trading experience for a broad spectrum of users, from novices to seasoned professionals. In the last fortnight, Aster rose 206% and now trades at around $194. In the last 24 hours, the price rose 6%, making it one of the most profitable cryptos all around. With Binance’s CZ continuing to promote the project, ASTER has a real chance of reaching $5 and beyond soon. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales For those looking outside the listed tokens, over in the presales market, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is gaining momentum as one of 2025’s standout ICOs. It blends Bitcoin’s proven security with Layer-2 scalability while tapping into the viral energy of meme culture and community-led governance. The project’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster payments, smart contract support, and decentralized governance. So far, the presale has raised more than $21 million, with some analysts projecting 10× returns or more once it launches. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers ultra-low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, meme tokens, and seamless payment rails. A recent Coinsult security audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, increasing confidence among early investors. The HYPER token underpins the ecosystem by powering staking, governance rights, and transaction fees. Early backers can currently earn up to 56% APY through staking while also securing voting privileges once the DAO activates.

XRP trading range compressed in a descending triangle with $2.70–$2.80 support and $3.60 as the immediate breakout target. Fibonacci resistances at $3.12 (0.5), $3.25 (0.382) and $3.40 (0.236) align with recent rejection zones. Long-term inverse head-and-shoulders structure sets a $4.80 potential if neckline support holds and volume confirms the breakout. Meta description: XRP breakout setup front-loaded with primary keyword. XRP breakout nears $3.60; monitor Fibonacci resistances and volume — read technical outlook and next steps. XRP trades at $3.03 with analysts eyeing $3.60 breakout as Fibonacci levels and long-term patterns point toward $4.80 potential. XRP consolidates in a descending triangle, with analysts targeting a potential $3.60 breakout. Fibonacci levels show key resistance at $3.12, $3.25, and $3.40 before a move higher. Long-term structure signals a possible path toward $4.80 if neckline support holds firm. XRP is showing technical signs of strength as it trades near a critical breakout point. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $3.03 after rebounding from September’s low of $2.71. Chart structures and Fibonacci levels are pointing toward a possible upward move toward the $3.60 mark. What are the key technical breakout levels for XRP? XRP breakout technicals center on the descending triangle that has contained price action since August. The immediate support range sits at $2.70–$2.80 while near-term resistance clusters at $3.12, $3.25 and $3.40. Clearing these zones increases the odds of a move to $3.60 within the triangle projection. How do Fibonacci retracements shape short-term targets? Fibonacci retracement plotted from $2.67 to $3.66 places the 0.618 at $2.93, a level buyers have defended. The 0.5 and 0.382 levels at $3.12 and $3.25 respectively map to recent rejection areas. The 0.236 near $3.40 is the final resistance band before the projected $3.60 breakout target. $XRP looks set to break out of a triangle, with $3.60 as the target. pic.twitter.com/ldP7rMCCn4 — Ali (@ali_charts) October 2, 2025 Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the triangle’s projection to $3.60, matching the July swing high. The pattern shows compressed volatility typical before decisive moves, meaning volume confirmation and a clean weekly close above the descending trendline would be meaningful confirmations. What does long-term structure indicate for XRP? Higher-timeframe structure suggests a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a neckline near current resistance bands. If support above the neckline holds and buyers sustain momentum, the measured target from that structure sits around $4.80. Source: JavonMarks (X) Market participation supports the technical case: spot and futures activity show elevated open interest and near $7 billion in trading volume across major venues. Rising volume during a breakout would add conviction to extension targets in the $3.85–$4.00 area and the longer-term $4.80 projection. How should traders monitor the breakout and manage risk? Traders should watch for a weekly close above the descending trendline and $3.12–$3.25 resistance band, confirmed by rising volume and open interest. Risk management should prioritize keeping stops below the $2.70–$2.80 support zone and scaling position size ahead of major resistance tests. Frequently Asked Questions Will XRP reach $3.60 soon? Short-term price action favors a move to $3.60 if XRP breaks above the descending trendline and clears resistance at $3.12–$3.40 with volume confirmation. The probability increases with a weekly close above the triangle’s upper boundary. Is $4.80 a realistic long-term target for XRP? Yes. A confirmed inverse head-and-shoulders on higher timeframes points to a measured target near $4.80, provided the neckline holds and macro liquidity conditions remain supportive. Key Takeaways Triangle consolidation: Price compressed between $2.70–$2.80 support and a descending trendline, signaling a potential breakout. Fibonacci alignment: Resistance at $3.12, $3.25 and $3.40 are key levels to clear for a move to $3.60. Volume & structure confirm: Rising volume and a weekly close above the trendline would support extensions toward $3.85–$4.00 and $4.80. Conclusion Front-loaded technical signals for the XRP breakout show a clear short-term path to $3.60 if resistance zones and the descending trendline are overcome. Long-term structure offers a $4.80 upside scenario contingent on neckline support and volume confirmation. Monitor Fibonacci levels, volume, and weekly closes for actionable signals. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-technical-outlook-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""XRP Nears $3.60 Breakout; Fibonacci Levels and Long-Term Structure Point to $4.80"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-33.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""XRP trades at $3.03 with analysts eyeing a $3.60 breakout; Fibonacci resistance and long-term patterns point toward $4.80 potential if neckline support holds."" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will XRP reach $3.60 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""If XRP breaks above the descending trendline and clears resistance between $3.12 and $3.40 with confirming volume, the projected triangle target of $3.60 is likely."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is $4.80 a realistic long-term target for XRP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A higher-timeframe inverse head-and-shoulders pattern targets approximately $4.80, conditional on sustained neckline support and continued market participation."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor an XRP breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks to validate an XRP breakout using price, Fibonacci levels, and volume."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-33.png"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-technical-outlook-2025#step1"", ""name"": ""Identify pattern and key levels"", ""text"": ""Locate the descending trendline and support at $2.70–$2.80.

Liquidations And Short Squeeze The heavy liquidation figure points to a sharp and fast move that forced leveraged traders out of the market. Short sellers bore the brunt, which helps explain the sudden surge. Rapid liquidations can push a price higher quickly, and that kind of move often brings extra volatility right after the spike.

An unexpected ADP payroll print showed a decline of 32,000 jobs in September versus forecasts calling for a 50,000 gain. Official US employment data took a timeout amid stoppage of government functions, leaving traders to weigh partial signals. The CME FedWatch tool put the odds at about 97% for a 25 bps rate cut at the October 29 Fed meeting, and it flagged another potential cut at the December 10 meeting. Those shifting rate expectations appear to have pushed some investors toward assets like gold and cryptocurrencies. Network Changes And Fee Cuts BNB Chain’s own moves helped the rally. Validators cut the minimum gas fee from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei earlier this week, following prior reductions that moved fees from 3 Gwei to 1 Gwei in April 2024 and then to 0.1 Gwei in May 2025. Block intervals were tightened from 750 milliseconds to 450 milliseconds, and proposals now aim for per-transaction fees near $0.005 with a longer-term target of $0.001. Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto.

Analysts point to the similarities with a 37,800% explosion rally in 2017, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a climb following a trend breakout. Similarly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making altcoin headlines with high presale demand and DeFi integrations. XRP Price Could Hit $5 This Altseason XRP price ended Q3 2025 at around $2.90, equivalent to a 28% quarterly gain which is the highest price recorded by the crypto. Analysts such as Milkybull Crypto believe the trend is reflecting 2017, when a comparable breakout was followed by an eventual rally to $3.31. The decisive move of the Ripple token over the $2.20-$2.30 resistance band is an indication of further strength. Moreover, there is on-chain data that confirms this bullish rally. The MVRV Z-Score is in the middle range, meaning that it can gain between $3 to $5. Mid-sized holders, with 10,000 to 100,000 XRP, are not selling, hence adding to the market confidence. Additionally, further buying pressure may be ignited by pending October ETF decision deadlines, such as Grayscale and 21Shares filings. Regardless of the above positives there is technical caution. XRP is currently 470% above the low it had in November 2024 and the weekly RSI shows divergence, indicating that it is losing momentum. XRP Price $15 Long-term Target Meanwhile, several analysts see Ripple’s current formation as the beginning of a multi-year rally toward $15 . Top analysts compared today’s quarterly breakout to 2017, when XRP quickly surpassed multi-year resistance. Technical indicators such as a symmetrical triangle and bull flag indicate eventual price increase within the range of $5-$15. Source: TradingView Following this perspective, the long-term projection of XRP gives an average price of $3.40 by December 2025 and a possible increase to $4.48 in 2026. By 2030, certain models project a peak of up to $9.86 and with the long term market momentum, there is a possibility of reaching as high as $15 with the right macroeconomic factors. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently broke above a descending trendline on the 2-hour chart, sparking predictions of a 25% short-term rally. Market analyst Satososhi1242 predicted a move toward $0.00001460 after SHIB rebounded from a retest at $0.00001158. Source: TradingView Community optimism is reinforced by larger patterns, including a potential falling wedge breakout on the weekly chart. Analyst expects a climb toward $0.00004567, while MMBTrader predicts a long-term rally as high as $0.00007730. Key SHIB price support remains near $0.00001230, a crucial level that must be maintained to sustain bullish momentum. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is Leading the Altcoin Buzz As XRP and SHIB dominate price discussions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the crypto presale market. The Ethereum-based DeFi project has gathered over $14 million with over 13,500 holders. Alternatively, the capital efficiency and security of the project are also attractive to retail and institutional investors. Anti-rug systems and transparent vesting plans, as well as Hashex and CertiK audits all create trust in the coin. Analysts estimate returns of up to 400x , making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best-performing altcoins to watch in the next crypto bull cycle . Conclusion XRP price records an all-time high quarterly close, supporting the argument of a rally to $5 in 2025 as well as $15 in the long term, with short-term corrections. In the meantime, a breakout in Shiba Inu price trend supports a short-term upswing, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is a powerful presale, having DeFi utility and 400x ROI. These strong points are influencing investor sentiment as the market enters the next altcoin season.

52632078,597013,1759532423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52632078.jpeg,What Does Ripple CTO’s Resignation Mean For The XRP Price? Community Speculates,https://bitcoinist.com/what-ripple-cto-resignation-mean/,"With Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz announcing plans to resign, community members have begun to speculate what this could mean for the XRP price . This comes as XRP reclaims the psychological $3 level, providing a bullish outlook for the altcoin. What Ripple CTO’s Resignation Means For The XRP Price In an X post , community member unknowDLT said that it is no coincidence that the Ripple CTO is stepping down right before XRP ETFs and global ISO 20022 adoption . He added that Schwartz knows the liquidity flood will trigger a supply shock and push XRP’s price up as it becomes the backbone for settlements. However, it is worth noting that the Ripple CTO stated that he will not be stepping down until the end of the year. As such, he is expected to still be in his role when this projected XRP price surge occurs. The XRP ETFs are expected to launch as early as this month, while the adoption of ISO 20022 could occur in November. While unknowDLT believes that the XRP price is set to rally amid Ripple’s CTO departure, crypto pundit Bitlord has suggested that this is bearish for the altcoin. He stated that it was time to sell XRP, highlighting why the resignation was suspicious. The pundit further remarked that the market is at the stage where Ripple will begin to openly admit failure. Resignation Comes Amid Increased Competition Bitlord also noted that Schwartz’s announcement came at a critical time, when SWIFT announced plans to launch its blockchain ledger. The crypto pundit had declared that it was ironic that XRP was replaced overnight by the very thing it sought to replace. With SWIFT building its ledger, there is a belief that XRP may not be the foremost crypto for payment settlement, which is bearish for the XRP price. He further explained that there is increased competition to look forward to and no clear answers from Ripple. In line with this, he remarked that the Ripple CTO stepping down to enjoy life and hobbies isn’t exactly bullish for the XRP price. The pundit also speculated that XRP can no longer dump successfully on retail, which is why Schwartz was joining Ripple’s board. He believes that this move is in preparation for an IPO . Bitlor questioned what this would mean for XRP holders , adding that they would find out in the coming months. The XRP price has climbed above $3 amid the speculations about what the Ripple CTO’s resignation could mean for the altcoin. It is also worth noting that the altcoin showed little reaction on the day Schwartz announced plans to resign. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $3.02, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|Altcoin|Bitlord|Coinmarketcap|David Schwartz|ISO 20022|ripple|SWIFT|UnknowDLT|XRP|XRP holders|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|WALLET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 23:00:23

PolyMarket Split 50/50 as $500M Meme Coin Factory Faces Crash Fears,https://cryptonews.com/news/pump-fun-ath-this-year-polymarket-split-50-50-as-500m-meme-coin-factory-faces-crash-fears/,"Polymarket has opened a new prediction market centered on Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin launchpad that has rapidly become one of the most active platforms in the crypto ecosystem. The market lets users wager on whether Pump.fun’s token, PUMP, will reach a new all-time high by December 31, 2025. NEW POLYMARKET: Pump​.fun ATH this year? https://t.co/JqBmmJqSZn — Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 3, 2025 At present, the betting odds are split evenly, with “Yes” and “No” outcomes each priced at 50%. The balance reflects uncertainty among traders, who are weighing Pump.fun’s rapid growth against questions about its long-term sustainability. Pump.fun Drives Nearly 13M Token Launches on Solana, $500M in Fees Collected Since launching in early 2024, Pump.fun has facilitated the creation of more than 7 million tokens, according to Galaxy Research. Nearly 13 million of the 32 million tokens on Solana have been launched through Pump.fun, marking a near 300% increase in under two years. Tokens on the platform represent $4.8 billion in fully diluted market value, while Pump.fun itself has generated close to $500 million in fees. The platform’s expansion has had a direct impact on the wider Solana ecosystem. High trading volumes on Pump.fun have funneled liquidity into Solana, at times supporting gains in SOL’s price. At its peak, Pump.fun revenue reached $13.48 million in a single week between August 11 and August 17, its strongest performance since February. Over the past 30 days, the launchpad has generated around $120 million in fees, according to DefiLlama. Source: DefiLlama Daily activity remains high. In the last 24 hours, Pump.fun recorded $134.3 million in trading volume and 114,457 active addresses. More than 20,000 new tokens were deployed on the platform, while 95 “graduates” advanced beyond the bonding curve stage. Fees collected over the same period totaled $1.29 million. Source: Dune Despite these milestones, concerns linger. Data shows that 98.6% of Pump.fun tokens are classified as scams or pump-and-dump projects, raising questions about sustainability. Median holding times for Solana meme coins have also collapsed to about 100 seconds, down from 300 seconds a year earlier, showing the dominance of bots and scalpers in trading activity. Pump.fun launched its own token, PUMP, in July through an initial coin offering that raised $500 million in under 12 minutes. The token has since seen sharp moves. It reached an all-time high of $0.008819 but now trades at $0.007028, about 20% below that peak but still up 75% in the past 30 days. Its market capitalization stands at $2.48 billion, ranking it 66th on CoinGecko. The introduction of Polymarket’s new betting market adds another dimension to the story, giving investors a structured way to quantify sentiment. With odds currently split, the market highlights both confidence in Pump.fun’s explosive growth and caution over the volatility of meme coin-driven ecosystems. Pump.fun Token Gains Momentum Amid Ecosystem Upgrades and Institutional Interest Pump.fun has continued to draw attention with a mix of ecosystem updates, exchange listings, and corporate adoption, fueling bullish sentiment for its native token, PUMP. The platform’s major upgrade, Project Ascend, announced on September 2, introduced a new creator fee structure aimed at improving token sustainability . The system, called Dynamic Fees V1, lowers fees as market capitalization rises, encouraging long-term projects rather than short-lived speculative launches.

Expansion efforts have followed swiftly. In mid-September, Binance added PUMP to its spot market, offering traders a chance to share in a 350 million token reward pool. On October 1, Pump.fun announced new payment integrations with Apple Pay, Robinhood, Phantom, and others, streamlining onramps for users with low fees and instant trading access Institutional interest has also emerged. On October 2, Australia’s Fitell Corporation disclosed a purchase of 216.8 million PUMP tokens worth $1.5 million , adding them to its treasury as part of a broader Solana-focused investment strategy.

Tron supply squeeze: ~89% staked, tight circulating supply. Strong taker-buy CVD and positive funding rates support continued gains.

Key levels, funding rates and CVD confirm bullish bias with elevated volatility risk.""} What is the Tron supply crunch? Tron supply crunch refers to the steady reduction of liquid TRX available for trading as a large portion of the circulating supply is locked in staking. With nearly 89% of circulating tokens staked, the circulating float is thin, which intensifies price moves on relatively small flows. How does TRX staking affect liquidity? High staking ratios reduce available liquidity and magnify the market impact of inflows and outflows. When 89% of supply is staked, even modest taker-buy volume in futures can push the TRX price sharply higher. Conversely, a wave of unstaking or exchange inflows can produce swift corrections. Can TRX price sustain momentum above its ascending trendline? The daily chart shows TRX holding above a multi-month ascending support trendline, preserving a bullish structure. Key technical levels to watch are support near $0.331 and resistance at $0.355 , where a sustained breakout could open targets toward $0.40 and higher. Failure to maintain the ascending support would increase downside risk and could shift sentiment quickly, given the market’s elevated leverage and concentrated staked supply. Source: TradingView (price chart) What market signals confirm Tron’s next major move? Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) shows persistent taker-buy dominance, indicating futures traders are aggressively leaning long. Positive funding rates and strengthening momentum together validate the bullish thesis while also increasing liquidation risk if momentum reverses. Futures taker buy volume signals: What does CVD reveal? The CVD surge demonstrates that buy-side flow is strong and consistent, reinforcing price resilience. When taker-buy CVD rises alongside price and positive funding, it signals conviction among leveraged participants that the trend will continue. Source: CryptoQuant (on-chain / derivatives flow) TRX positive funding rates: Why they matter? Funding across TRX perpetuals is modestly positive (≈0.009% at time of writing), meaning longs pay shorts. This confirms leverage is skewed to longs and supports higher spot prices, but prolonged positive funding raises liquidation vulnerability.

High staking tightens float, and elevated leverage amplifies both gains and losses; traders should size positions conservatively and use stop management because liquidity shocks can trigger rapid moves. What signals would invalidate the bullish case for TRX? A decisive daily close below the ascending support near $0.331, combined with falling CVD and a shift to negative funding, would weaken the bullish outlook and increase downside probability. Key Takeaways Supply squeeze : Heavy staking (~89%) reduces circulating TRX and magnifies price sensitivity. Derivatives confirmation : Rising taker-buy CVD and modestly positive funding support continuation. Risk management : Monitor $0.355 resistance and $0.331 support; use position sizing and stops to manage volatility. Conclusion Tron’s supply dynamics and derivatives positioning create a bullish setup for TRX price, but the same factors raise volatility risk. Traders should watch the ascending trendline, CVD and funding rates closely. With demand intact, TRX can continue higher — yet disciplined risk controls remain essential.",News|FLOW|TRX,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRX|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 23:14:05

X user Kevin Capital, who is followed by more than 24,000 traders, pointed out that DOGE’s monthly chart has just triggered several buy indicators that have historically marked major breakouts.

The goal is to get the StochRSI to cross the 20 level and show follow through as anything below that level is… pic.twitter.com/FxrohrzlXo — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) August 27, 2025 The combination of these technical indicators favors a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that could see the token rising to $1 first during this cycle and possibly to $10 in the long term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Needs to Break Out of This Pattern to Start Its Next Leg Up The daily chart shows that Dogecoin has been on an uptrend for a while, making a series of higher lows along the way since October 2024. A bullish breakout above the price channel shown in the chart would set off a strong rally for the token that would likely reach those levels first. Meanwhile, if DOGE surpasses that mark, the stage will be set for another move toward $1 , meaning a new all-time high for the token. Although getting to $10 may take a while, DOGE’s long-standing upward trajectory should continue as Wall Street keeps embracing meme coins. The launch of an ETF linked to DOGE is evidence that institutional adoption is on the rise. Similarly, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could outperform well-established tokens during this cycle. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings 1000x Energy to the Trading World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the legendary doge meme and turns it into the face of a trading community built for degens who love going big.

With total market capitalization climbing above $4.24 trillion, investors are preparing for what could be the most explosive phase of this cycle. XRP, ETH, and SOL are all showing signs of major breakouts following weeks of overselling and quiet accumulation. This article breaks down the technical and fundamental signals behind each coin, highlighting the levels to watch as the market gears up for its next leg higher. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Rising Open Interest Signal New ATH Incoming XRP has risen to $3.04 today, equalling a 2% gain in 24 hours and a 10% increase in a week. The major altcoin is also up by 7% in a month, while also boasting an impressive 490% increase in a year, underlying its growth in the wake of Donald Trump’s inauguration and the end of the Ripple-SEC case. There are many reasons to be bullish about XRP, including the fact that a wave of XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the coming weeks , boosting institutional demand for the token. Demand for XRP is also growing as a result of Ripple’s expansion as a firm, with the company signing multiple new partnerships in recent months, as well as expanding into new territories. This means that XRP is in a fantastic position to ride what may be the start of an end-of-year rally, judging by recent moves. Source: TradingView It looks as though XRP is going to break out of the pennant in which it has been trading in recent weeks, while its indicators are both rising strongly from oversold positions. Such changes come as open interest for XRP futures has risen back to $8 billion , having risen from just over $7 billion in August. This points to rising prices, with XRP likely to rise beyond $3.50 by the end of the month, before reaching $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – Institutions and Company Reserves to Push Altcoin Even Higher in Q4 Ethereum has risen by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $4,487 also representing a bullish 15% increase in the last seven days. The coin is also up by 96% in a year, giving it a good platform from which to post more gains, especially when it’s still undersold relative to recent moves. Looking at its chart, we see that it has begun to gain strong momentum, with its relative strength index (yellow) bouncing from 30 in late September to just over 50 today. Likewise, its MACD (orange, blue) is about to turn positive for the first time in a couple of weeks, implying that buying pressure will be ramping in the near term. Source: TradingView And when combined with Ethereum’s almost peerless fundamentals, this makes for a fantastic crypto price prediction for ETH. Ethereum continues to dominate the crypto ecosystem in terms of TVL ( at $93.7 billion ), while a growing number of firms have been establishing ETH reserves in recent weeks. Based on this, and based on the expectation of a bull rally, we could see the ETH price break the $5,000 barrier by the end of this month, before hearing towards $10,000 in the longer term. Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Altcoin Could Break ATH in Matter of Weeks Solana has risen to $230 today, making for an 18% increase in a week and a 10% return in a month. Also of note is the fact that Solana has risen by 67% in the past year, which is arguably not that much in comparison to other major alts (especially XRP). Yet the argument to make from this is that it means that Solana still has big gains left in it this year, with the coin only 21% away from its ATH of $293. Probably the most exciting thing about Solana right now is that, as with XRP, it has several ETFs waiting to launch. We could therefore see an explosion in its price in the next couple of months, also helped by public firms opening SOL reserves and funds . Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that it has begun to break out after the correction it sustained in late September, and its next stop is $250, which if broken could predict a climb towards its ATH. Because of the bullishness surrounding SOL, it has every chance of rising above $300 in the next few weeks, while it could comfortably near $500 in December. PEPENODE Crosses $1.6 Million in Presale: Could Mine-to-Earn Be Next Big Pepe Token? As good as the tokens above look, some traders may want to diversify into newer coins, so as to widen their exposure to potential market-beating gains. One way of doing this is to look at presale coins, which under the right circumstances can rally big once they list for the first time. An interesting example of such a token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 coin that recently opened its ICO. Just as the legends predicted… A Virtual Mine-to-Earn platform in the palm of your hand. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tOsvFJMgo4 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 1, 2025 It has now raised over $1.6 million in this sale, testifying to its potential once it launches. Much of this potential stems from its status as the market’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ crypto, one which gives holders the ability to earn rewards by building their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, users can earn greater rewards, which the project will pay out in established meme coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. This could drive demand for PEPENODE, which will also be open to staking, with its current yield in excess of 800%. All of this makes PEPENODE one of the more exciting presale tokens, with investors able to join its sale by going to the project’s official website . The token is currently available at $0.001083, but newcomers should act quickly since this price will continue to rise regularly until the sale ends. Buy PEPENODE Here.

The release, which took place on Thursday, October 2nd, coincides with the start of a bullish period many in the crypto community have dubbed “Uptober.” According to blockchain monitoring platform Whale Alert , the unlocked XRP was distributed in four separate transactions: two batches of 400 million and two batches of 100 million, totaling 1 billion XRP. Based on XRP’s trading price at the time, these tokens represented approximately $3 billion in market value. While Ripple’s monthly escrow releases are predictable, this month’s release was slightly delayed, occurring a day later than the usual schedule. Ripple’s Escrow System Ripple’s escrow mechanism is designed to regulate the circulation of XRP and prevent excessive supply from destabilizing the token’s value. Each month, the company releases up to 1 billion XRP, often returning unsold portions to escrow after limited market activity. This structured approach aims to balance liquidity and scarcity, ensuring that XRP’s price is not unduly impacted by large, uncontrolled sales. The October release attracted particular attention due to its timing. The market momentum surrounding XRP has been strong, with the token recently breaking above the $3 resistance level. As of press time, data from CoinMarketCap shows XRP trading around $3.02, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours. Investors are closely monitoring the impact of the unlocked tokens, which could influence short-term price movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Market Activity Market analysts suggest that the freshly available XRP could serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, increased supply sometimes pressures prices by reducing scarcity. On the other hand, the additional liquidity may facilitate institutional transactions and broader adoption, particularly as regulatory decisions on XRP ETFs approach . Several major ETF filings are under review, and investor confidence remains elevated with the expectation that these products could bring substantial capital into the XRP ecosystem. The release also underscores Ripple’s commitment to transparency and predictability in its token management. By adhering to a monthly schedule and providing clear data on unlocked amounts, the company aims to minimize market uncertainty and maintain investor trust. As the market enters October, XRP’s recent performance, coupled with the escrow release, has prompted optimism among traders. While supply increases can sometimes trigger short-term corrections, many analysts believe the event strengthens XRP’s infrastructure for institutional use. If combined with potential ETF approvals, these developments could reinforce upward momentum throughout the month.

Be ready. https://t.co/5JtfTm82Wi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Solana Price Predictions: Could TradFi Exposure Push SOL Beyond $1,000 These new touchpoints for TradFi demand come as Solana nears the apex of a 6-month ascending wedge pattern. The Solana price now approaches a retest of its upper support as momentum indicators flip decidedly bullish. SOL / USD 1-day chart, 6-month falling wedge points bullish. Source: TradingView. The RSI has found its footing above the neutral line at 55, a sharp rise from recent oversold conditions as buyers overwhelm sellers. The MACD histogram has also mounted a golden cross above the single line, suggesting the current move represents more than a bounce, but a potential lasting uptrend. However, psychological resistance found at $335 today could threaten the integrity of the push, particularly as technical indicators only just scratch bullish. The key threshold for a breakout sits around $300, Solana’s early-year high. Flipping this level into support would validate a potential 130% move to $500 . But with U.S. interest rate cuts expected to stimulate risk appetite, ETFS could see the s olana price extend 350% to $1,000 before year-end. And with CME Group’s global market tapping in, round-the-clock TradFi exposure could push it further in 2026. Solana Waits For 2026 While These ICO Investors Are Raking In Gains For large-cap coins like Solana, a noteworthy breakout takes months of built-up momentum and catalysts at just the right time to see it surge. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) takes a different approach. PEPENODE is the first mine-to-earn meme coin that lets anyone earn rewards by building virtual mining rigs – no expensive hardware, no tech skills needed. Think of it like a crypto game where you buy digital nodes , upgrade your rigs , and collect rewards in popular meme coins like $PEPE – all before the token even launches. It’s a fun, low-barrier way to tap into passive income during the presale phase, and early players are already stacking up gains while others are still waiting on the sidelines. Deflation is hardwired into the system: 70% of $PEPENODE tokens spent on rigs and nodes are burned, driving scarcity and supporting long-term returns. Momentum is rising fast. The presale has surged past $1.6 million, while early adopters are still earning a massive 800% APY on staking. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining. With the next price increase only hours away, waiting could make entry more expensive. To stay updated, you can also follow PepeNode on X (formerly Twitter) . Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Bitcoin is currently consolidating above $119,000. Traders are looking for an altcoin that will dominate the next two years. Most tokens won’t survive the competition, but those with strong narratives, institutional catalysts, and vibrant ecosystems usually outlive the hype. The three names that are starking the noise for the year 2026 are DeAgentAI (AIA), PancakeSwap (CAKE), Coin98 (C98). Each have varied strengths, with some offering specialised AI-driven products, others crafting DeFi upgrades and some focused on regional adoption roadmaps that differ from US-centric players. At the same time, investors are also watching for new projects with the potential to amplify growth beyond today’s majors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly positioned as one such asset, combining audit-backed credibility with viral momentum. Together, these four names highlight the shifting dynamics of capital rotation heading into the next stage of the bull cycle. DeAgentAI (AIA): AI Agents Meet Multi-Chain Infrastructure Not many projects have come out of the woodwork like DeAgentAI. In the middle of September 2025, it was listed for the first time on Binance Alpha and Binance Futures to facilitate spot trading and perpetual contracts, with a maximum leverage of up to 50×. In just 24 hours, the price skyrocketed by 179.83%, with an increase of 401.68% over the course of the week; market cap nearly $137 million. DeAgentAI is gaining momentum with an airdrop for Binance users that broadened its initial distribution and contributed to its liquidity. What makes it special is its infrastructure that consists of decoupled AI agents running on Sui, BNB Smart Chain and Bitcoin. This ties in nicely with one of the hottest narratives in Web3 – AI meets DeFi. Still, sustainability remains the key challenge. Getting listed on exchanges will get you the publicity you need but the real long-term price growth will depend on actual developer activity, real adoption of its AI tools and continued cross-chain integrations. If DeAgentAI turns hype into real usage, it could be one of the most relevant tokens by 2026 PancakeSwap (CAKE): DeFi’s Veteran Reinvents Itself PancakeSwap has been present in the DeFi space since 2020. However, PancakeSwap Infinity aims to change this trajectory. The launch of this gas-efficient Layer 2 solution at the end of September 2025 sparked unprecedented trading activity, with volumes reaching over $772 billion in Q3. The price of CAKE surged by 27.92% within 24 hours and increased by nearly 29% in the past week as its market capitalization stands at $1.16 billion. The upgrade added custom liquidity pools and accounting following ERC-6909 standards to enhance scaling while reducing costs for liquidity providers. These new ideas help improve capital efficiency, a DeFi pain point. PancakeSwap will certainly be tested on its ability to maintain dominance with Uniswap moving into new territory. In 2026, CAKE’s ability to keep expanding total value locked (TVL) and maintain protocol revenue from swap fees and staking will be the key to its future appeal. As institutions get comfortable with revenue-backed tokens, I believe PancakeSwap’s combination of innovation and track record makes it one of the best possible DeFi plays for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Beyond the Noise While DeAgentAI, PancakeSwap, and Coin98 dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a different kind of narrative. Looking toward 2026, analysts are building lists of the most promising altcoins to hold long-term. Alongside majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is finding its way onto those watchlists as the speculative piece of a multi-year portfolio. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics and cultural branding offer potential for 100x wealth-style outcomes in bullish cycles. What sets it apart is that it isn’t just narrative hype: its contracts are verified through CertiK and HashEx audits , providing reassurance for longer-term holders. For those constructing portfolios aimed at 2026 and beyond, the idea is simple, combine infrastructure leaders like ETH and SOL with small allocations into speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The blend of security and risk could position investors for the generational outcomes crypto is known for. Coin98 (C98): A Regional Powerhouse Finds Momentum Coin98 might have a smaller market cap than other cryptos but has recently made headlines. C98 saw trading volume skyrocketing by nearly 1,930% in early October 2025. This caused the crypto to gain 21.81% in 24 hours and 45.55% weekly. Currently, this crypto has a market cap of $64.8 million. Its momentum stems from both macro and micro catalysts. Bitcoin’s rise to $116,000 this week has caused a chain reaction on the macro front which is uplifting low-cap tokens. In August 2025, Coin98’s integration of Concordium ID will add an important privacy-preserving age verification layer that may prove critical to Southeast Asia’s Web3 development on the micro side. C98 is the right crypto project that can take advantage of the fast-growing crypto adoption of the region. The key watchpoint for Coin98 is token unlocks. In June 2025, more than 5.5 million C98 will unlock, which could pressure the token to sell-off in the short term. If partnerships continue and adoption takes off in Southeast Asia, premier small-cap names to hold into 2026 could include (C98)? Coin98. Investor Psychology Heading Toward 2026 DeAgentAI, PancakeSwap, Coin98 and MAGACOIN FINANCE share a commonality in their ability to tap into investor psychology. Traders don’t just want utility. They want growth. They want the narratives that power the market. They want leverage coins in a bull cycle. DeAgentAI satisfies the hunger for AI-driven DeFi. PancakeSwap delivers proven utility and innovation. Coin98 appeals to regional adoption narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE is appealing because they’re scarce and community-focused. The winning portfolios in 2026 will likely be a balanced mixture of established platforms, emerging leaders and credible growth plays across all the four. Conclusion Which Altcoins can hold the price surge in the long term from now to 2026? DeAgentAI has a daily increase of 179.83%, PancakeSwap achieves record volumes, and Coin98 gains from regional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be a solid growth-oriented complement to the majors, credible and with some upside. Investors looking to position their strategy for the next cycle are not looking for a winner, rather a series of assets that optimally balances scalability, adoption, and growth optionality. Portfolios will be able to handle fluctuations in the crypto space and still benefit from major gains.

The announcement has revived one of the most ambitious XRP price forecasts in the community, a long-term projection of $20,000 per token. The discussion began after RippleX Senior Director of Engineering, J. Ayo Akinyele, shared updates on his team’s work in a recent Ripple Insights article . Akinyele revealed that Ripple is developing tools designed to support private yet regulatory-compliant transactions. Over the next year, the company plans to implement zero-knowledge proofs, which would allow financial institutions to process sensitive data more securely while maintaining performance and scalability. Steingraber’s Bold Valuation Model The renewed focus on privacy has drawn attention back to a valuation model introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP community analyst Chad Steingraber . In his analysis, Steingraber described a framework that could theoretically drive XRP toward a $20,000 price point, relying on three key dynamics: demand, market perception, and scarcity. This is where it gets interesting… XRP https://t.co/2L9UgxJ17j pic.twitter.com/g8Wxz5v6Dx — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 2, 2025 First, he highlighted demand as the central force behind value creation. In his view, assets that lack meaningful demand are undervalued, while surging demand can result in rapid price appreciation. Second, he pointed to how shifts in market perception can elevate valuations without necessarily requiring new inflows of capital, a dynamic he said applies broadly across financial markets. Finally, he emphasized scarcity, noting that XRP has a capped supply of under 100 billion tokens and is subject to gradual deflation, as a small amount is destroyed with every transaction. Steingraber argued that traditional market capitalization figures do not always reflect true investment in an asset. At the time of his model, XRP’s reported market capitalization was around $18 billion, but he maintained that this overstated real exposure due to thin trading volumes and retail-driven activity. He asserted that circulating supply and available liquidity, rather than theoretical market cap numbers, ultimately determine price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Privacy Matters for Institutions Building on this framework, Steingraber predicted that major banks and payment providers would not rely on public exchanges or standard liquidity tools. Instead, he suggested they would adopt private ledgers while holding XRP as a reserve asset. According to his model, banks could issue internal digital instruments backed by XRP reserves, using them for customer balances and interbank transfers. He further projected that liquidity providers would play a key role by accumulating large pools of XRP to facilitate settlement between institutions. In this scenario, competition among major financial players to secure XRP would significantly reduce available supply on public markets. Steingraber also pointed to the permanent loss of some XRP, including tokens locked in inaccessible accounts, as a factor that compounds scarcity. He estimated that only about 20 billion tokens are available on exchanges, meaning institutional accumulation could quickly drain order books and accelerate price increases. Linking Ripple’s Strategy to Price Theories Ripple’s current focus on integrating zero-knowledge proofs aligns with the type of privacy and compliance features that Steingraber’s model assumes institutions will require. For proponents of his $20,000 projection, the company’s technology roadmap offers support for the idea that banks and large-scale payment systems may adopt XRPL for settlement. While most analysts view a $20,000 valuation as highly speculative, the intersection of Ripple’s privacy initiatives with Steingraber’s institutional demand thesis has kept the debate alive within the XRP community. At minimum, the company’s efforts to expand privacy and scalability are seen as essential steps in preparing the ledger for broader enterprise use.

Bitcoin will not realize this massive potential unless mechanisms are created to move and utilize capital directly on its network. Why Bitcoin Can’t Absorb Global Wealth Overnight Analyst BRITISH HODL presents a powerful thesis on BTC’s role, arguing that its impact extends far beyond its own valuation, fundamentally changing how global capital is allocated. In an X post, BRITISH HODL stated that while BTC aims to absorb global capital, this is conditional, and BTC will not capture all of the capital flow on earth unless it is redirected onto the BTC network. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally However, as BTC becomes more widely understood, capital will become extremely sensitive, and only the highest quality equities will attract capital. This is simply an existing, long-term trend, evidenced by the dominance of a select few, such as the Magnificent Seven (Mag7) stocks in traditional markets over the last 30 years. Bitcoin intensifies this trend because it provides a highly accessible and transparent standard for risk-free returns. As the risk hurdle rate increases, investors are no longer satisfied with marginal gains from poor-quality assets. The consequence of this will be a significant market cleaning and a lot of concentrated value-creating innovation as companies are forced to deliver exceptional performance to earn capital. Meanwhile, there will be a very fast turnover of terrible companies as BTC’s value proposition becomes increasingly understood by investors. BRITISH HODL makes it clear that in a BTC-dominant era, you must outperform BTC on a risk-adjusted basis to capture any capital. The Growing View Of Bitcoin As An Alternative Money Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, maintains a balanced yet skeptical view of Bitcoin, acknowledging its growing influence while pointing out fundamental flaws that will prevent its ultimate adoption by nation-states. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Expands As Ohio Approves Vendor For State Cryptocurrency Payments Dalio starts by stating that while he can’t say exactly how effective BTC is as a money, the fact that it’s being perceived by many as an alternative money is worth paying attention to. He frames the utility of any currency as both a medium of exchange and a store of wealth, emphasizing that the latter is more important. Despite its revolutionary technology, Dalio highly doubts that any central bank will take it on as a reserve currency. However, since all of the transactions are public, there is no privacy, which is unacceptable for sovereign entities managing vast financial operations. As a result of the risk in the future, the code could be broken to make it less effective through government controls. The expert confirms that he does have some BTC in his portfolio, though not a significant amount.

An analyst has shared a bold view that the token could one day reach extremely high price levels if banks and financial institutions begin to use it on a large scale. He believes that past patterns in the crypto market show growth, but the next step for XRP could be something new and far bigger. The argument is that actual global adoption would create a situation that has never happened before in crypto history. If that happens, the token’s price could rise far above the levels that many traders currently expect. Analyst BarriC Argues XRP Price’s True Potential Lies In Mass Adoption He said that anyone who claims the XRP price will “never reach $1,000” does not understand what they are talking about. According to him, there is no historical data that shows what happens when a cryptocurrency is adopted and used by banks and large financial institutions. Because of this, it is incorrect to place limits on how far XRP could rise in the future. BarriC explained that analysts cannot only study XRP’s future value from past charts or price action . Instead, they have to view it through the lens of global adoption . If banks and financial systems around the world start using XRP to move money, then the market would be facing something new, something without comparison in past cycles. That is why, he says, XRP should not be thought of as a coin that can only climb to trim levels like $4 or $5. Why The XRP Price Could Go Beyond $20 And Toward $1,000 BarriC also pointed to XRP’s past growth as an example of what could be possible. He reminded his followers that the token once skyrocketed from $0.006 to $3. This rise occurred within the limits of a typical four-year cycle, which follows the Bitcoin halving event, bull runs, altcoin season, and then the bear market. Even without large-scale adoption, XRP still managed to make that giant leap. The analyst said the real question is what will happen when banks and institutions adopt XRP on a mass level. If banks and institutions begin to move millions, billions, and even trillions of dollars through XRP, then the demand and usage will be unprecedented in the crypto world. In his view, when money of that scale flows into XRP, the price cannot stop at $20. Instead, such adoption could create the conditions for the XRP price to reach $100, $1,000, or even higher. BarriC said this is why he believes people should look at the token’s future differently from most altcoins. For him, the combination of market cycles and real-world adoption could set XRP apart and make it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the market.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 00:00:54

Ayo Akinyele says he’s pushing to make the XRP Ledger (XRPL) the “first choice for institutions seeking innovation and trust” — and to do it with privacy-first tooling. Akinyele, a senior director of engineering at Ripple, lays out the case in a blog post published Thursday, arguing that finance can’t function without confidentiality while public blockchains are built for transparency. The way through, he says, is programmable privacy that lets “honest participants control what is revealed, to whom, and under what circumstances,” while still giving regulators the disclosures they need. Privacy as infrastructure, not secrecy Akinyele contends privacy on-chain should be a baseline protection, analogous to the encryption that secures online banking. He points to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — cryptography that proves a statement is true without exposing the underlying data — as a mechanism for private but compliant transactions (for example, proving KYC completion without broadcasting identities to the entire network). In his view, without built-in confidentiality, institutions won’t move core workflows to public ledgers; without accountability, regulators won’t sign off. ZKPs, selective disclosure and hardened wallet infrastructure are meant to square that circle. Scaling without sacrificing trust Beyond privacy, Akinyele argues scalability must not come at the expense of security or decentralization. He highlights trusted execution environments (TEEs) for fair transaction ordering to curb frontrunning and confidential computation for running sensitive logic off-chain while emitting verifiable outputs — both intended to reduce market-structure risks without reverting to intermediaries. Looking ahead, he sketches two milestones. First, over the “next 12 months,” he says he’s focused on making XRPL the institutional default by applying ZKPs to enable private, compliant transactions that also improve throughput. Second, in 2026 he expects confidential multi-purpose tokens (MPTs) — a forthcoming XRPL standard — to bring privacy-preserving tokenized collateral to market. That, he says, is an essential step for institutional adoption of real-world assets (RWAs) and DeFi (decentralized finance). Akinyele also positions XRPL as “uniquely positioned to bridge” what he describes as “many trillions of dollars in assets set to move on-chain over the coming decade,” citing the ledger’s decade-long operating history, built-in decentralized exchange, escrow and payment channels as finance-oriented primitives already at the protocol layer. “The future of blockchains belongs to builders who remove unnecessary trust,” he concludes — arguing that if systems can prove correctness, prevent misuse and protect data, public ledgers can deliver the privacy, compliance and efficiency institutions require.",Tech|Ripple|XRP Ledger|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|WALLET|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 00:10:12

MoonBull’s 11,800% ROI Packs a Punch as Hedera and Aster Rally",https://timestabloid.com/chasing-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2025-moonbulls-11800/,"The best crypto to invest in is the question every trader and student of blockchain keeps asking in 2025. The market is buzzing again, with meme coins stealing the show and established networks holding their ground. Three names stand out for different reasons this October: MoonBull, Hedera, and Aster. Each project carries its own flair, yet one of them is pulling all the eyeballs with a presale that feels like catching lightning in a bottle. Meme coins have dominated crypto headlines for years, from Dogecoin’s internet-fueled rise to Shiba Inu’s viral run. They’ve taught the market that humor and culture can be just as valuable as tech-heavy whitepapers. Now in 2025, the trend is shifting toward meme coins that pair laughs with real tokenomics. This is where MoonBull enters, a meme-fueled rocket propelled by a solid economic engine. MoonBull Presale is live now, and it is shaping up as a second shot for traders who missed early giants like Dogecoin or Solana. Hedera and Aster may have strong market caps and proven adoption, but MoonBull’s first-come, first-served model with 23 scarcity-driven stages is where fortunes might be made. Let’s break it down coin by coin. MoonBull Presale: The Best Crypto to Invest in 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just another meme coin floating in space. It’s an Ethereum-based project combining hype with long-term sustainability. The presale is already in Stage 4, with more than $200K raised and over 700 holders on board. At $0.00005168, early buyers are staring at an ROI north of 11,800% by the time it hits the projected listing price of $0.00616. That’s not peanuts – that’s life-changing money if timed right. Picture this: putting down $20,000 at the current stage translates into nearly 387 million MOBU tokens. By the time the presale reaches its final stage, the value of that bag could soar past $2.3 million. This kind of upside doesn’t come every season, which is why many see MoonBull as the trending best crypto to invest now. What sets MoonBull apart is its ecosystem. It’s not only about flipping tokens. Holders can stake for a 95% APY starting at Stage 10, letting them double up passively. A massive staking pool of 14.6 billion tokens ensures payouts stay smooth. Add the referral program – with 15% bonuses for both referrers and referees plus leaderboard rewards in USDC – and you have a snowball effect designed to grow the community fast. Mobunomics: The Bull’s Engine of Scarcity and Rewards Mobunomics is where MoonBull’s design flexes its muscles. Every trade splits value across three tracks: 2% goes into liquidity for price stability, 2% heads to holders as reflections, and 1% is burned to make supply scarcer. Selling doesn’t weaken the system; it strengthens it. The total supply of 73.2 billion tokens has been carved up to balance presale, staking, referrals, and community rewards. Half the supply is allocated to presale alone, making early stages like today’s a rare golden gate. With its deflationary mechanics, staking pools, referral boosters, and Ethereum-powered backbone, MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just a joke coin. It’s shaping up as the best crypto to invest with ROI, and it’s pulling retail and whale investors into one herd. The bull is charging – and the question is whether you’ll be on its back or in its dust. Hedera (HBAR): Solid Tech, Market Struggles Hedera, priced today at $0.2239, is ranked #25 on CoinGecko with a market cap near $9.5 billion. It has seen a 8.3% gain this week, but that’s still a hair below the global crypto market’s 9.1% rise. With a fully diluted valuation of $11.2 billion, Hedera shows the weight of its token supply, which stretches to 50 billion HBAR in circulation potential. The project remains a favorite among developers for its Hashgraph tech, a faster and more scalable alternative to traditional blockchain. Yet, the coin’s price action often feels like a hippo stuck in mud compared to nimble meme plays. Even though it once soared to an all-time high of $0.569, it’s still trading over 60% below that level today. For long-term holders, Hedera might be seen as the best crypto to invest long term, given its enterprise partnerships and ecosystem stability. However, in short-term cycles, it doesn’t pack the same excitement as a hot presale. It’s steady, but steady doesn’t always get headlines. Aster (ASTER): A Rising Star with Heavy Volume Aster trades at $1.89 with a market cap of around $3.18 billion, ranked #52 on CoinGecko. It’s riding a 4.1% weekly gain but trails behind the broader crypto market. With 1.7 billion tokens circulating and a fully diluted valuation over $15 billion, Aster is playing in the big leagues, even if the scoreboard shows mixed signals. Its all-time high of $2.41 is still within reach, though it sits 20% below that mark right now. On the flip side, Aster has climbed an eye-popping 1,824% since its all-time low. That kind of rebound reminds traders that Aster can run when the bulls wake up. Its trading volume of $1.07 billion in 24 hours shows liquidity isn’t a problem, though it did slip slightly compared to the day before.

Attention is quickly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At $0.035 and 55% sold in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has twin lending infrastructure, real-utility, and non-custodial smart contracts offering investors a utility-driven option in a growing DeFi market. With over 16,710 holders and $16.7 million raised, Mutuum Finance is attracting the attention of retail and whale investors as well and is a high-upside altcoin that can leverage rising institutional and regulatory adoption patterns. Visa Stablecoin Initiative Represents Growing Institutional Onboarding and Regulatory Clarity Visa’s intention to test a platform allowing businesses to make cross-border business-to-business payments using stablecoins is a strong step toward crypto mainstream onboarding. By eliminating the need for local account pre-funding, the initiative can bring faster cross-border payments and reduced capital inefficiency to banks, remittance companies, and other financial institutions. The program has backing from the U.S. Genius Act, which gave stablecoin issuers clear regulatory guidance and enabled companies to have confidence experimenting with digital currencies without a cloud of legal uncertainty. As Visa collaborates with unidentified firms and is planning to roll out the scheme next year, stablecoins shift from a niche cryptocurrency fad to core financial infrastructure, with some potential to disintermediate traditional payment rails while supporting existing networks. This institutional adoption trend of rising institutional adoption mirrors investors’ appetite for new, utility-driven digital assets, opening room for early-stage projects with credible DeFi applications to draw capital. Mutuum Finance Presale Figures Show Lively Investor Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees its Stage 6 presale figures skyrocket with tokens sold at $0.035, a 16.17% boost over the previous round. The demand remains high, and over 16,710 individuals have engaged with over $16.7 million committed to date, indicating increased faith within the longer-term future of the project and vision. Mutuum Finance will award $100,000 giveaway to early adopters. It will have ten winners and award each winner with $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The project’s vision is thus to bring long-term value and enable growth in the space of community-building. Enhanced Security and Risk Management Security is the top priority for Mutuum Finance. To this effect, the platform introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to invite security researchers and developers to stress test and report bugs. Bugs are rated on a four-level severity level as critical, major, minor, and low for ultimate assurance against any threat. Mutuum Finance is risk-weighted Loan-to-Value (LTV) protocol that holds adequate collateral for every asset based on its risk factor, thereby a more stable and well-balanced lending process. For containing market volatility, the protocol also maintains a buffer reserve, with excess reserves on higher-risk assets as extra collateral. Dynamic liquidation ratios and live LTV are dynamically set to respond to prevailing market conditions at the moment to enable the protocol to actively offset volatility. Reserve multipliers are set from 10% on less risky assets to 35% on more risk assets to add a layer of systemic insurance. Efficiency is Mutuum Finance’s top priority as well. Collateral is maximized to create maximum borrowing capacity and correlated assets are employed to create lending and borrowing efficiency as flawless as possible. These structures result in low insolvency risk with a stable, sustainable DeFi protocol. MUTM Ready for the Next Adoption Wave Visa’s foray into stablecoins and the Genius Act bring a sea change in adoption of mainstream crypto, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to gain big time. Having already raised more than $16.7 million from 16,710+ investors and with Phase 6 already being 55% sold, tokens won’t budge from $0.035 for the time being. Its twin borrowing system, security knowledge, and $100,000 giveaway establish it as one DeFi project that shines. Act now to be in on the presale before the next price spike and be part of this rapidly-growing ecosystem.

The analyst begins with a quick framing of Bitcoin, noting that the market sits at a psychologically charged inflection just below all-time highs. He characterizes this zone as the “best risk-reward area to take a short,” not as a trend call but as a hedge for portfolios given proximity to prior peaks and well-defined invalidation. “I’m bullish, but I am cautious at $106,000,” he reiterated, referring to a visible liquidity pocket that he continues to flag as a magnet for price probes. He emphasizes his stance has been consistent: fully exposed on spot, cautious on leverage near resistance, and mindful of how quickly sentiment can flip when price revisits extremes. XRP Price Could Rip 400% XRP is the focus. On lower time frames, he sees open interest rebuilding and liquidity clustering overhead—most notably around the $3.40–$3.45 region—with thinner, newer pools below near $2.66 and $2.55. In his read, this is typical when an upside move begins to organize: resting liquidity accumulates above recent highs while late shorts leave footprints below. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash To $2.33 Is Still Possible In This Scenario, Here’s Why On the daily, he identifies additional liquidity density around $2.11–$2.40, but stresses that the stack above is far larger, with a notable band between roughly $4.02 and $4.25 and intermediate reference points near $4.10. “The times when we’ve had big dense areas of liquidity like this… we run into that area, we struggled in it, and then boom—when we do break out higher, we’ve ripped,” he said. He points back to the earlier breakout from the $0.50s, where a similar pattern of layered overhead liquidity resolved into a multi-week melt-up. The near-term momentum tell, in his view, is the three-day RSI crossing up from below 50—something he says closes today and has historically mattered for XRP. He logged three recent instances. The first preceded the move from roughly $0.50 to $2.70, a run he pegs at approximately 400% from mid-range to peak. The second produced a smaller, but still notable, ~27% advance. The third, in late June, was followed by a ~68% climb. “The minimum push… was 27%,” he said, arguing that even a conservative replay would take XRP “just above this high that we’ve recently set,” while the upper bound of historical outcomes opens the door to far higher prints. “If we do madness… 470% would take us to $17 right now. Bring your emotions back in check,” he cautioned, underscoring that these are scenario brackets, not guarantees. Different Price Scenarios From there, he moves into structure. On the daily chart he sketches a still-valid five-wave advance, with the present upswing acting as wave three of a larger third. Using Fibonacci extensions anchored to the last impulsive leg, his 4.236 projection lands around the $6.50–$6.80 zone, with one read producing ~$6.79 and another shorter-range draw yielding about $4.78. Related Reading: Ex-Ripple Dev Explains Why XRP Is 10x The Value Of LINK He notes that prior extensions overshot by roughly 20%, which—if repeated—would imply a spike toward the “$8.20 region” before a sharper corrective reset and a subsequent fifth-wave push. To unlock those paths, he wants to see a series of higher-time-frame closes reclaiming major retracement thresholds: “A daily close above $3.20 would be great. If we start closing above $3.36–$3.43, we’re on for that $6.80 price target, especially if we can get the close above $3.65.” Market-wide context could help. XRP dominance has broken its range and is building what he calls a bull-flag pattern on the three-day. The last confirmed three-day RSI bullish cross in XRP dominance marked the start of major upside phases; another cross now would, in his words, be “the time. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is flirting with a bearish rollover on the daily, complete with divergences near resistance. A renewed bleed in BTC dominance would mechanically free up relative performance for large-cap alts; in his ideal scenario, Bitcoin grinds higher toward or through the highs while XRP “just runs faster.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.0246.

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Shows Whales Are Still Selling In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score for the various investor cohorts on the network. The “ Accumulation Trend Score ” refers to an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC holders are participating in accumulation or distribution. The metric calculates its value by not only considering the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also by accounting for the size of the wallets themselves. This means that larger entities have a higher influence on the score. When the value of the indicator is greater than 0.5, it indicates that large investors (or alternatively, a large number of small investors) are leaning toward a trend of accumulation. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger this behavior is. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold implies that distribution is the dominant behavior on the BTC blockchain. The zero level acts as the extreme point on this side of the scale. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score turned neutral-red across the investor cohorts last month, suggesting the network was facing distribution. Recently, however, the metric has recorded a shift. The mid-sized BTC investors, those holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC, have started participating in some aggressive buying, with the indicator sitting close to the 1 level. The 10 to 100 BTC cohort has also seen the indicator rise into the accumulation zone. On the smaller end of the scale (below 1 BTC and 1 to 10 BTC groups), a neutral behavior is still the dominant one, indicating that retail hands are still unsure about the asset’s direction. The whales , holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, have seen their selloff calm down a bit in recent days, but these humongous entities nonetheless remain in a phase of distribution. Finally, the 10,000+ BTC investors, popularly known as the “ mega whales ,” have only stepped deeper into distribution, with the Accumulation Trend Score near zero. Considering this trend, it would appear that the latest bullish push in Bitcoin could be fueled by the fresh demand that’s coming from the mid-sized entities. It now remains to be seen how the Accumulation Trend Score will develop for the groups in the coming days, and whether this structural shift will only advance further. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a sharp rally of more than 10% in the last week, which has taken its price beyond the $120,000 level.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score|Bitcoin Mid-Sized Holders|Bitcoin Selling|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 01:00:55

BNB confirmed a bullish flag breakout, targeting $1,236 with potential extension toward $1,500. Institutional adoption and treasury strategies boosted BNB demand, strengthening its long-term growth outlook. BNB Chain activity surged with $8.23B locked value and 73.24M active addresses supporting momentum. BNB is continuing its strong rally after breaking out from a bullish flag formation. The breakout confirmed upward continuation, positioning the token toward $1,200 and marking a potential new all‑time high. At the time of writing, BNB was trading at $1,145.99, reflecting steady growth and rising market participation. What price structure and momentum support the breakout? Bullish structure: BNB’s 4‑hour chart showed a clear pennant then flag, with the pole rising from $960 to $1,120. The subsequent breakout with expanding volume projects a target near $1,236 (about 22.46% from the consolidation low). $BNB is doing the same, which i told you earlier. Bullish flag got a break, and the target is $1200 for the new ATH. We are so close to that. Cycle top vibes hitting different. Congrats to the real diamond hands who held through 2022. Finally, @cz_binance words true — Henry (@LordOfAlts) October 3, 2025 According to analysis prepared by Henry, BNB has maintained higher lows within a rising channel since mid‑August. Strong buying pressure supported this structure, keeping momentum intact during recent sessions. Market volume surged after the breakout, signaling continued accumulation. Source: NekoZ(X) Analyst NekoZ described BNB’s chart as a “masterclass in trend continuation,” noting three major breakouts since July. Each breakout led to expansion, and the current cycle targets $1,500 as traders monitor higher resistance levels. Why is institutional demand important for BNB price? Institutional demand increases capital inflows and treasury support for price discovery. Several funds and corporate treasuries have allocated to BNB, raising buy‑side pressure and reducing available supply on exchanges. Examples of institutional activity include Kazakhstan’s Alem Crypto Fund selecting BNB as a reserve asset and Nasdaq‑listed Windtree Therapeutics allocating a majority of a recent raise into BNB. These actions, reported by market observers, contribute to a firmer long‑term outlook. Network growth also supports the rally: on‑chain data shows BNB Chain’s total value locked at $8.23 billion (up 2.5% in 24 hours) and 73.24 million active addresses, with 4.34 million transactions in September—the second‑highest monthly activity on record. These metrics indicate both liquidity and engagement that can sustain higher prices. Frequently Asked Questions What is the nearest resistance and upside target for BNB? Nearest resistance sits around $1,200–$1,236 (measured move); extended targets reach $1,500 and, under strong momentum, higher psychological levels such as $2,000 in longer scenarios. How should traders confirm the breakout? Confirm with increased breakout volume, higher lows on shorter‑timeframe charts, and supportive on‑chain metrics such as rising TVL and active addresses. Risk management is essential—use stop levels below the flag structure. Key Takeaways Technical breakout: Bullish flag projects a $1,236 near‑term target with potential extension to $1,500. Institutional flows: Fund and treasury allocations bolster demand and reduce circulating supply. On‑chain support: $8.23B TVL and 73.24M active addresses provide structural backing for momentum. Conclusion BNB’s bullish flag breakout, reinforced by institutional demand and expanding BNB Chain activity, places the token within reach of $1,236 and tests above $1,200. Traders should watch volume and on‑chain metrics for confirmation while managing downside risk. COINOTAG will continue to monitor developments and provide timely updates.

52636136,597122,1759543225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52636136.jpeg,Analyst Says XRP Price Target Of $27 Still Holds – ‘The Ride Has Just Begun’,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-target-of-27-still-holds/,"A new technical analysis by crypto analyst ChartNerd has predicted the long-term trajectory of the XRP price . According to the expert, the cryptocurrency could be gearing up for a new all-time high, with price targets set at an impressive $27. Already, XRP is showing signs of building momentum after its recent rebound from the $2.8 level , but ChartNerd suggests that “the ride has just begun.” XRP Price Structure Points To $27 ATH ChartNerd’s latest analysis on X social media outlines XRP’s long-term price structure, which has been forming since its 2018 all-time high of $3.84 . After peaking and then spending nearly seven years suppressed and consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, the altcoin has finally broken free of its constraints. This breakout had triggered an explosive rally in the cryptocurrency’s price, carrying it from $0.5 to $3.6 this year in rapid succession. Despite this impressive performance, ChartNerd explains that XRP’s price rally is far from over . The cryptocurrency’s structure suggests a much larger expansion is on the horizon, with Fibonacci Extension levels reinforcing the case for a $27 price target. Specifically, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the chart has been pointing to $27 ever since XRP’s 2018 high. A surge to this level would see the cryptocurrency exploding by an impressive 800% from current levels around $3. With the symmetrical triangle pattern now broken to the upside, the long-term chart suggests the token is finally ready to move toward higher levels. The analysis identifies critical points in the cryptocurrency’s bullish journey: a breakout impulse that shattered descending resistance, a new cycle of ascending support, and the confirmation of the previous Fibonacci targets. ChartNerd concludes his analysis by urging traders to prepare for a ride that has only just begun. Analyst Says XRP To Hit $5 First In addition to his long-term projection, ChartNerd presented a short-term analysis that predicts XRP could skyrocket from its current price of $3 to $5, representing a roughly 66% surge. He shared a price chart that shows the cryptocurrency displaying a classic Bull Flag formation —a pattern that often signals bullish continuation after an upward move. During the time of his analysis, ChartNerd noted that XRP was bouncing off its 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around the $2.77 level, a key area of support to prevent further declines. The Bull Flag structure is clearly visible on the chart, featuring a strong flagpole that moves upward, followed by a period of consolidation within a downward-sloping flag. The breakout target from this Bull Flag formation points directly to the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension at $5.35. ChartNerd emphasized that while the altcoin still has work to do, holding above the 20-week EMA and breaking through flag resistance are critical to fueling this projected rally. More importantly, he says that the current Bull Flag pattern lies inside a larger flag with a bullish target set at $15.",XRP|Bull Flag Structure|ChartNerd|Fibonacci Extension|ripple|Symmetrical Triangle Pattern|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 02:00:25

Analyst Calls To “Stay Alert”,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoins-big-breakout-incoming-analyst-stay-alert/,"An analyst has pointed out how a Dogecoin breakout could be coming, based on this technical pattern that the asset has followed over the years. Dogecoin Is Currently Inside Accumulation Zone Of Long-Term Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is still in the accumulation phase of a technical analysis (TA) channel. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $119,000: Analyst Says $139,000 Could Be Next Parallel Channels form when the price of an asset travels between two parallel trendlines. There are a few different variations of the pattern, depending on how the trendlines are oriented with respect to the chart axes. The Ascending Channel, the type that’s of interest in the context of the current discussion, involves trendlines that are sloped upward. That is, these channels correspond to a phase of upward consolidation in an asset’s price. The upper line of the pattern tends to be a source of resistance, while the lower one is a source of support. Either of these levels not holding up can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel could signal a bullish breakout, while a fall below it may lead to bearish action. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Ascending Channel that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has followed over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin slipped below the support line of the Ascending Channel earlier in the year. This fall, however, didn’t immediately confirm a bearish breakdown, as the memecoin has seen a few instances over its history where temporary declines below the line have taken place. During each of them, the coin ended up finding support in a zone bounded by the channel’s lower level and another parallel support line just some distance below. From the chart, it’s visible that this same pattern could be playing out once more, as the asset has stabilized since entering this historical “accumulation” phase. For now, the coin is still trading inside this zone, but a surge back into the Ascending Channel could eventually arrive, if the past pattern is anything to go by. Each of the previous returns into the channel led to notable gains for Dogecoin. “The breakout is coming,” says the analyst. “Stay alert!” Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder RVT Nears Cycle Lows: A Healthy Reset? Another altcoin, Chainlink (LINK), has also been following an Ascending Channel recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. As is visible in the chart, Chainlink’s 3-day price is currently trading near the mid-line of its multi-year long Ascending Channel. The analyst believes a surge to $47 could be next for the coin, corresponding to the upper line of the pattern. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.255, up more than 13% over the last week.

XLM at critical $0.38 resistance and 0.786 Fibonacci level Rising TVL and improved long-to-short ratios signal growing on-chain activity and bullish sentiment Technical indicators (RSI ~45, MACD nearing crossover) show fading bearish pressure and potential momentum shift Stellar (XLM) price nears $0.38 resistance — watch breakout volume and daily close confirmations for a rally to $0.50. Read our technical summary and trade checklist. Stellar (XLM) is heating up near the $0.38 mark. Charts and on-chain data hint at a breakout. XLM faces major resistance at $0.38, at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. A breakout above the trendline could trigger upside toward $0.50. Rising TVL and bullish trader sentiment point to a potential breakout. Stellar (XLM) is just below the crucial $0.38 resistance level. As of the writing time the price dipped 1.22% to $0.3656, a 0.72% weekly gain and rising trading volume show growing bullish momentum. What is driving Stellar (XLM) toward the $0.38 level? Stellar (XLM) is approaching a confluence of technical resistance: the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement near $0.3725 and a descending trendline around $0.38. Rising on-chain metrics and improving trader sentiment are increasing the probability of an upside breakout if volume confirms a close above the trendline. How does the chart structure influence short-term XLM price action? The 4-hour chart shows a descending triangle pattern that typically signals bearish risk, but current price action has compressed toward the triangle apex. XLM trades around $0.36897, just under the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.37254. A decisive close above the descending trendline with increased volume would shift the technical bias to bullish. Source: Ali Charts Via X Why does on-chain data matter for XLM’s breakout chances? On-chain metrics provide real activity context beyond price. Stellar’s Total Value Locked (TVL) rose from $139.1 million on Saturday to $144.4 million by Tuesday, approaching an August peak of $153.6 million. Rising TVL typically reflects increased ecosystem usage and liquidity, supporting bullish price scenarios when paired with technical breakouts. What do trader positioning and indicators show? Market sentiment has tilted cautiously optimistic. CoinGlass reported a long-to-short ratio of 1.07, the highest in over a month, indicating more traders are positioned long. Daily RSI sits at ~45, moving toward neutral 50, while MACD lines are nearing a bullish crossover. These indicators suggest bearish pressure is fading but confirmation requires volume and daily closes. When will a breakout or rejection be confirmed? A breakout is most credible after: 1) a daily candle close above $0.38 and the descending trendline, and 2) a meaningful surge in trading volume. Conversely, a rejection would be signaled by a strong reversal candle at resistance and weakening volume, targeting $0.34 and potentially $0.32 on further downside. Short checklist for traders monitoring XLM Watch for daily close above $0.38 with increased volume. Confirm MACD bullish crossover and RSI moving above 50. Monitor TVL and network activity for sustained on-chain support.

A sustainable rally to $0.50 requires a daily close above $0.38, elevated trading volume, and supportive momentum indicators. Without these confirmations, any spike could be a short-lived pullback. How should traders manage risk around the triangle apex? Use defined stop levels (e.g., below $0.34) and scale position size until a clear daily close confirms direction. Monitor volume and TVL to avoid trading on false breakouts. Key Takeaways Resistance at $0.38 : A decisive daily close above the 0.786 Fibonacci and trendline is needed to validate a bullish breakout. On-chain support : Rising TVL and a higher long-to-short ratio add credibility to an upside scenario. Confirm with volume : Volume surges and momentum crossovers will be the primary confirmation signals for a sustained rally. Conclusion Stellar (XLM) sits at a technical crossroads near $0.38, where a confirmed break with higher volume could open targets at $0.40 and $0.50, while a rejection risks support at $0.34 and $0.32. Monitor daily closes, volume, RSI and TVL for reliable signals.

Stocks are at all-time highs, and the tech sector is driving the surge even without fresh government data. On Friday, each of the major averages were headed for a winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level over its last five sessions. The S&P 500 broke through 6,700 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed again as semiconductors rallied hard. On Tuesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market value. Other assets joined the climb, with gold and Bitcoin moving sharply higher as retail traders piled in. Emerging market stocks are beating U.S. equities this year, and China’s large-cap names are up more than 40% in 2025. For now, the accepted view is that stocks, which historically ignored shutdowns, will keep rising if the suspension of federal operations doesn’t drag on longer than usual. But there are warnings that this shutdown may be different. The blackout of government data could mean the Federal Reserve heads into its October 28–29 meeting without crucial numbers, just as risks grow around both the labor market and inflation. “This time, a shutdown is going to matter,” said Hardika Singh, economic strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “When the Fed meets at the end of October, without this data from the nonfarm payrolls report, it’s going to be very, very difficult for them to make a decision.” Singh added that: “The president is giving them so much flack for being slow with cutting interest rates. And I think that with the Fed independence already under fire, it makes it all the more important for us to see rate cuts come at the right time for the right reasons.” Singh, who remains bullish despite concerns, said the lack of clarity heading into the decision could dent a rally that’s already distrusted by many. “The market is in mostly a really good spot, but people are looking for reasons to not believe this rally,” she said. “I think the shutdown here just gives them all the more ammunition to not buy the argument that we’re in a bull market.” Investors weigh rate cuts as shutdown clouds Fed decisions Signs of nervousness are visible across Wall Street. Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman said this week that he thinks the market is in the “late innings” of a bull run and could be vulnerable to losses, though he added it’s still less risky than bonds given higher inflation. Some investors are saying the Fed doesn’t need to cut rates right now, citing elevated inflation, record stocks and a still-growing economy. Markets are pricing in two quarter-point cuts by year’s end, with the next expected later this month according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said the Fed need not cut given the outlook for stronger inflation. On Friday, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said he is leery of cutting rates too quickly. Even so, bullish momentum is hard to fight. High valuations worry some investors, but David Miller, investment chief at Catalyst Funds, said the market’s heavy tilt toward tech makes it more able to handle premium valuations than in the past. Today alone, the Dow jumped 500 points. Fundstrat’s Lee told clients this week he expects the S&P 500 could reach 7,000 by December. “We would not lean bearish because of shutdowns,” he said . “If stocks are down, we would be dip buyers.” Bitcoin gains as traders hedge against shutdown risks Bitcoin rallied Friday to within striking distance of its record high as the U.S. shutdown entered its third day. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency traded up roughly 2% on the day at $123,874, about 1% below the mid-August all-time high of just over $124,000. Investors are moving into the decentralized asset after lawmakers failed to agree on federal funding, forcing the shutdown on Wednesday. Bitcoin is up 12% this week alone. “The shutdown matters this time around,” wrote Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered. “During the previous Trump shutdown (22 Dec 2018 to 25 Jan 2019) Bitcoin was in a different place than now, so it did little.” Kendrick added, “However, this year bitcoin has traded with ‘US government risks’ as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium.” Standard Chartered expects a new high soon and ultimately the crypto reaching $135,000. Traders are also using crypto and other assets to hedge against rising political and economic tensions. Spot gold rose 0.5% to $3,876.55 per ounce early Friday, with prices up more than 2% for the week. Traders also poured money into stocks Friday despite growing geopolitical uncertainties, with the S&P 500 rising 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.27%.

Per a report from Bloomberg, the plan is to create a digital-asset treasury company that will stockpile XAUt, the gold-backed token issued by Tether, while Bitmain supplies about 82% of the planet’s crypto mining machines, according to an April study by the University of Cambridge Judge Business School. Sources also said that Cohen & Co. is the lead advisor on this deal. They declined to be named because the talks are private. This effort adds another layer to the long-running collaboration between Tether and Antalpha. The two companies already work together on Tether Gold, which according to Tether’s site has a market capitalization of $1.5 billion. That token launched in 2020 through a Tether subsidiary and is fully backed by physical gold bars stored in vaults. Tether and Antalpha expand gold token plans On September 29, Antalpha announced that it was expanding its partnership with Tether to make XAUt easier to access. It said it will offer collateralized lending against the token and set up physical vaults in major financial centers so holders can swap their digital tokens for real gold bars. Antalpha confirmed that Tether purchased an 8.1% stake in its company back in June, cementing their financial link. Meanwhile, demand for gold has spiked 46% this year amid fears over inflation and global political tensions. CoinGecko data shows that the market capitalization of Tether’s gold token doubled during the same period. While working on this $200 million fundraise, Tether is also trying to raise as much as $20 billion for its main stablecoin business. If that succeeds, the company would be valued at about $500 billion, which would make it one of the biggest privately held firms in the world, as Cryptopolitan reported . Data from PitchBook shows that more than 80 companies have set up digital-asset treasury companies this year. Many are following a model inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which bought large amounts of Bitcoin. These companies often use reverse takeovers or special purpose acquisition vehicles to build listed proxies for assets like Bitcoin or Ether. Back in April, Tether shared that it had teamed up with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald LP and SoftBank Group to create a Bitcoin treasury company called Twenty One Capital. But even as these crypto treasuries multiply, a growing number of them have seen their stock prices drop recently as interest from institutional investors cools off.

Chinese EV manufacturers are already facing regulatory pressure in Europe, including a countervailing duty and the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR), which has negatively impacted over 70% of them. Ursula von der Leyen wants the EU to become AI-first Ursula von der Leyen believes artificial intelligence could help revive the region’s struggling automotive sector and also improve road safety. During her speech, she urged the European Union to adopt an “AI first” strategy across strategic industries, with a focus on mobility. She cited how self-driving cars have become a reality on the streets of America and China and does not see why Europe is being left behind. To her, “AI first” also means “safety first”. Her remarks come amid Brussels’ attempt to promote industrial competitiveness, even as local automakers struggle to keep up with foreign technology development, particularly from China and the United States. Von der Leyen suggested banding together to form a network of European cities to pilot autonomous vehicles, and claimed up to 60 Italian mayors had already expressed interest. The EU chief has also vowed the bloc will support developing vehicles “made in Europe, and made for European streets”. Europe’s automotive industry is currently undergoing rapid transformation amid pressure to decarbonize and digitize, and von der Leyen thinks AI could play a significant role in reducing congestion, linking remote areas to public transport, and preserving jobs. “The future of cars – and the cars of the future – must be made in Europe,” she said . China EV brands set sights on Europe Chinese EV manufacturers face significant regulatory risks in Europe, including a 17.4% EU countervailing duty and the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR), which has negatively impacted over 70% of these firms. However, they have refused to be daunted by the hostile tariffs and have been leveraging strategies like plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and localized production. It has been effective because, as of June 2025, Chinese EV brands had captured 10% of the European EV market with BYD’s sales tripling to 13,503 units by July 2025, surpassing Tesla for the first time and highlighting the rapid growth and competitive edge of Chinese EV brands. The shift towards PHEVs has worked so well for them because it aligns with the European consumer’s preferences for flexible charging options and long-distance travel, maintaining a stable market share amid tariff challenges. There is also the issue of geopolitical tensions, which have resulted in fragmented EU member states’ policies. As things stand, the future of Chinese investments in Europe is uncertain, and this has affected the EV sector. In 2024, Greenfield projects accounted for £4.9 billion. However, the value of newly announced EV projects has declined significantly, with three major battery projects getting shelved. Analysts have warned that further tariffs — potentially exceeding 20% — could also affect export volumes. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Coinbase applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the OCC to bridge crypto and TradFi. Approval would let Coinbase offer custody plus payments and integrated on‑ramps/off‑ramps under clearer regulation. Several US crypto firms, including Circle and Ripple Labs, have also sought the trust charter this year. Coinbase National Trust Charter: Coinbase seeks OCC approval to expand services under clearer oversight — read the implications and timeline. What is Coinbase’s National Trust Company Charter application? Coinbase’s National Trust Company Charter application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a regulatory step to operate as a federally chartered trust entity, allowing the exchange to broaden services beyond custody while asserting it does not intend to become a bank. The filing targets clearer oversight for payments and integrated on‑/off‑ramp capabilities. How would the charter change Coinbase’s services? Approval would permit Coinbase to expand from pure custody into payments and related financial services under federal supervision. This can reduce reliance on third‑party partner banks for on‑ramps and off‑ramps, streamline customer flows, and create new product paths such as native fiat rails and payment settlements. Coinbase said seeking the license is part of its broader effort to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. Coinbase has formally applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the OCC, joining other US crypto firms pursuing similar federal trust charters this year. “Coinbase is taking a significant step in expanding our business capabilities and regulatory oversight beyond the existing framework, paving the way for innovation and growth in building a modern financial system powered by digital assets,” Coinbase said in a statement on Friday. Why does Coinbase say the charter will “bridge the gap” with TradFi? Coinbase frames the charter as part of a strategy to link the crypto economy with the traditional financial system. The firm emphasizes that clearer rules and federal oversight will support innovation while preserving customer trust and security. Coinbase clarified: “ Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security.” What do industry insiders say about operational impact? Luke Youngblood, who previously led Coinbase staking rewards, said the charter would enable Coinbase to “offer basically built‑in on‑ramp, off‑ramp, and no longer have to use partner banks on‑ramps, off‑ramps.” Political commentator Brendan Pedersen noted that trusts can carry business limitations versus commercial banks, though that distinction has narrowed over time. Source: Coinbase When did other companies file similar charter applications? Several crypto firms have filed trust charter applications in the same period. Stablecoin issuer Circle submitted an application on July 1, and Ripple Labs filed shortly after. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse described approval as a potential benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Frequently Asked Questions Will Coinbase become a bank if the trust charter is approved? No. Coinbase has explicitly stated it does not intend to become a bank. A National Trust Company Charter would provide federal oversight and enable broader services while remaining focused on crypto-native products. How will customers benefit from the charter? Customers could see faster, more integrated fiat on‑ramps and off‑ramps, potential new payment products, and clearer regulatory protections for custody and transactional services. Does the charter change regulatory obligations? Yes. A federal trust charter subjects the firm to OCC supervision, compliance requirements, and reporting structures different from non‑chartered crypto businesses. This can increase transparency and regulatory alignment. Key Takeaways Regulatory move : Coinbase applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the OCC to operate under federal trust oversight. Service expansion : Approval could allow payments, integrated on‑ramps/off‑ramps, and expanded custody offerings. Industry context : Circle and Ripple Labs have pursued similar charters, signaling a broader industry push toward federally chartered trust structures.

Exchanges recorded a net outflow of $2.37M, indicating accumulation and lower short-term selling pressure. Cardano price near $0.87, futures OI $1.5B, exchange outflows show accumulation — read analysis and key levels for traders. (Cardano price update) What is the current Cardano price outlook? Cardano price is trading near $0.87 after a rebound from $0.80 support, showing renewed buyer interest and a short-term resistance zone at $0.88–$0.90. A decisive break above $0.90 could accelerate momentum toward $0.95 and higher, while failure to hold $0.80 would increase downside risk. How did recent price action and technical indicators behave? Price closed near the session high after a range between $0.851 and $0.883, reflecting buying pressure throughout the day. Reported data shows ADA at $0.8855 with a 24-hour gain of about 3 percent. The RSI recovered above 50, and price has formed higher lows since September, suggesting steady accumulation. Cardano trades near $0.87 after rebounding from $0.80 support, with futures open interest at $1.5B and resistance at $0.88–$0.90. Cardano rebounds from $0.80 support, with buyers now targeting resistance at $0.88–$0.90. ADA futures open interest jumps to $1.5B, showing stronger trader participation and inflows. Net outflow of $2.37M from exchanges signals accumulation and reduced short-term selling pressure. Cardano is trading near $0.87 after rebounding strongly from the $0.80 support zone earlier this month. The price action shows consistent buying pressure, with traders closely monitoring the $0.88 resistance area. If this resistance breaks, ADA could see accelerated upward momentum supported by stronger trading activity and higher market participation. How has trading volume and momentum changed? Trading volume rose as ADA advanced from the $0.80 level, with multiple green daily candles confirming renewed upward momentum. Observations indicate buyers aim to overcome $0.88, the next immediate hurdle before $0.91 and $0.95. Volume increases alongside rising price support higher conviction for sustained moves. What do futures activity and exchange flows indicate? Cardano futures open interest increased to roughly $1.5 billion—up from under $300 million earlier this year—pointing to higher derivatives participation. Exchange flow metrics show a net outflow of $2.37 million on October 3, which typically reduces immediate selling pressure and signals accumulation by holders or cold-storage transfers. Price Action and Technical Structure Cardano (ADA) recently traded at $0.8855, recording a 24-hour increase of 3 percent. Market data from Coingecko showed a trading range between $0.851 and $0.883.

Green candles on the daily chart confirmed renewed upward momentum after a series of red sessions. Buyers are now focused on overcoming resistance near $0.88, which serves as the next immediate hurdle before $0.91 and $0.95. Futures Activity and Exchange Flows Cardano’s futures market shows growing interest from traders. Open interest surged above $1.5 billion by early October, compared with under $300 million earlier this year. This expansion reflects stronger speculative inflows and greater engagement in derivatives markets. Source: Popeye(X) Exchange flows further suggest accumulation. On October 3, ADA recorded a net outflow of $2.37 million, indicating coins are moving off exchanges. Such movements often reduce near-term selling pressure while pointing toward longer-term holding behavior. According to an observation by Popeye, ADA’s 4-hour chart displayed strong volatility near $0.8692, with resistance between $0.88 and $0.90. A breakout above this zone could open the way to $0.91, $0.95, and possibly $1.02 if momentum continues. Frequently Asked Questions Is Cardano showing signs of accumulation? Yes. Net exchange outflows of $2.37M and higher lows on price charts indicate accumulation. Increased futures open interest to about $1.5B complements on-chain signs, suggesting traders and holders are building positions. How likely is a breakout above $0.90? Momentum indicators and rising volume improve the probability of a breakout, but traders should watch resistance at $0.88–$0.90 and confirm a daily close above $0.90 before assuming sustained upside toward $0.95. Key Takeaways Short-term support : $0.80 — confirmed rebound and buyer interest. Immediate resistance : $0.88–$0.90 — a decisive break could trigger accelerated gains. Market signals : Futures OI at $1.5B and $2.37M exchange outflows point to higher participation and accumulation; monitor volume and RSI. Conclusion Cardano price has rebounded from $0.80 and trades near $0.87, with futures open interest and exchange flows pointing to increased participation and accumulation. Traders should watch $0.88–$0.90 for a breakout confirmation; a sustained move above this zone may target $0.95 and beyond.

Analyst Sees $800 Trillion Liquidity Boom,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-at-10k-analyst-sees-800-trillion-liquidity-boom/,"A sharp debate has opened inside the XRP community over whether the token could ever reach the kind of eye-popping prices some enthusiasts imagine. Numbers and theory are being thrown around. Practical limits are being argued right back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Market Cap Math And Limits According to reports, the numbers make a simple point: with a circulating supply of close to 60 billion XRP, a price of $1,000 would value the token at about $59.91 trillion. That total would more than double the market cap of gold and top many of the biggest assets on earth. Some analysts use that math to say such prices are not realistic any time soon. Their argument rests on a basic idea — money supply and valuation interact, and extreme price targets imply extreme market value. Garlinghouse Predicts 14% Of SWIFT Volume At the XRPL Apex event in Singapore in 2025, US-based Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse drew a line between messaging systems and actual liquidity. Based on reports from that stage, he told a journalist that XRPL’s future depends more on liquidity than on messaging alone. He estimated the ledger could handle about 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume within five years. That figure is large, but it is an adoption target that sits far below the trillion-dollar claims floated elsewhere. I keep telling everyone, the problem crypto solves is liquidity. You can’t print more money to create liquidity, that will just collapse fiat. But you can have limitless (almost unlimited) liquidity simply by having say a token like XRP reaches $10k, that will create over $800T… https://t.co/YpLUe6Sgal — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 2, 2025 A Different Way To See Liquidity Software engineer Vincent Van Code pushed a contrasting view. According to Van Code, XRP should be judged as a tool that can move liquidity around, not as an asset that must be fully cashed out into fiat to matter. Related Reading: Fast And Furious: XRP’s Next Rally Predicted To Shock Markets He proposed that, at a $10,000 price, XRP could unlock more than $800 trillion in liquidity. Van Code used an analogy likened to a logarithmic decay to explain why converting that liquidity to cash would not simply crash markets. His point: market mechanics and swap processes could expand usable liquidity without requiring a one-to-one conversion into existing money supplies. Easily, because it is just a “swap” or bridge token. Liquidity in FX is more about available trading pairs than simply loads of currency. Further, where that liquidity is sitting in crucial. Your point is more related to economic and monetary policy, which is vastly different… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 3, 2025 Critics Point To Central Banks And Money Supply Other market participants have pushed back. They note that central banks control liquidity through tools like QE and QT, and that broader money measures such as M2 keep changing. Reports show M2 has continued to grow over time in many countries. Those critics ask why governments would hand over control of liquidity to a neutral digital token. They also warn that the math Van Code uses assumes wide adoption, large trading pairs, and guaranteed counterparty trust — all hard to achieve.

52640080,597546,1759546843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52640080.jpeg,Crypto Oversight Concerns: State Regulators Warn Market Structure Bill May Hinder Anti-Fraud Protections,https://bitcoinist.com/state-regulators-crypto-bill-fraud-protections/,"Multiple state authorities shared concerns about the upcoming crypto market structure legislation and its impact on their ability to prosecute fraudsters in crimes related to digital assets. State Regulators Sound The Alarm Over Crypto Bill Regulators from Alabama to Montana sounded the alarms over the highly anticipated crypto market structure bill, warning that it may “diminish their ability to pursue wrongdoers,” Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Amanda Senn, director of the Alabama Securities Commission, told the news media outlet that the Senate’s draft of the legislation, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, does not give state-level regulatory agencies implicit authority to supervise digital asset companies. This oversight could mean that these authorities may not be able to prosecute offenders for fraud. Meanwhile, Federal enforcement against crypto companies has significantly decreased since the Trump administration took office in January. Multiple federal regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have shut down or reduced their digital asset-related enforcement units, dismissing most cases and investigations against crypto firms. According to Cornerstone Research data cited by Bloomberg, the SEC had initiated nine crypto-related enforcement actions by the end of August, a significant drop from the 47and 33 actions taken in 2023 and 2024, respectively. At this pace, 2025 could see the lowest crypto-related enforcement actions since 2017. “The dam is going to break,” Senn argued. “If you don’t have the states paying attention and prosecuting fraud, nobody is looking out.” Montana State Auditor James Brown warned that the bill’s changes to the definition of an investment contract could “let criminals wiggle out of being prosecuted.” “What we are hearing from people, with all the national talk about the benefits of digital currencies and the theory that you are going to get rich quick, you’ve got two factors that lead to easy fraud,” Brown added. State Anti-Fraud Protections In Danger? State regulators have proposed changes to the market structure bill, which is expected to go into markup after late October. Some state officials explained that the Senate’s current draft language would not require crypto businesses to register with states or respond to their inquiries. Additionally, the legislation would change the federal definition of an investment contract, adding new conditions and elements. In September, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) sent a letter to multiple Senators, warning them that Congress must preserve state anti-fraud enforcement authorities in the upcoming crypto bill. The association argued that “it is critical that the resulting framework preserve state anti-fraud protections,” as they protect investors and are “essential in the ongoing fight against online scams.” To achieve this, NASAA offered two recommendations to the lawmakers. First, they suggested that lawmakers reject provisions that redefine the investment contract test, explaining that “upending decades of securities law as contemplated in Section 105 will have devastating effects on anti-fraud efforts by adding so many elements and conditions to the investment contract analysis that form, not substance, will determine whether regulators can take action.” Second, they recommended that Congress enact the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act to ensure states have the anti-fraud authority necessary to respond to residents’ complaints involving digital assets. Despite the concerns, some industry players disagree that the market structure bill will hinder state authorities’ ability to prosecute bad actors. Some suggest that regulators will be able to pursue criminals “in the name of consumer protection.” “I do understand why a state would be worried about it, in particular if the federal system doesn’t engage in any enforcement,” Mauro Wolfe, leading partner of Duane Morris’s Digital Assets and Blockchain Group, told Bloomberg. “I do think this will be an area where defense lawyers will say the states can’t do it, and it will be litigated,” he concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|CLARITY Act|crypto market structure bill|crypto regulation|DOJ|NASAA|Responsible Financial Innovation Act|State regulators|US Congress|US SEC|US Senate,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 03:00:43

Now this doesn’t mean the company is trying to become a bank. Greg made that very clear: “Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank.” What it wants is a green light to go deeper into crypto payments and build more services around them, now that stablecoins are finally being taken seriously in Washington. Payments have become a major focus for Coinbase over the last year. The rise of stablecoins, especially USDC, has made that obvious. In July, President Donald Trump signed new legislation to regulate stablecoins, and since then, things have picked up fast. Coinbase has teamed up with Shopify to promote USDC, which it supports and earns revenue from alongside the issuer Circle. Greg said a national trust charter would give Coinbase one single overseer instead of a patchwork of state regulators, helping it launch new crypto features faster while keeping regulators involved. The charter would also strengthen Coinbase’s ability to weave crypto into everyday payments; on websites, in wallets, and even in big retail checkouts. The exchange wants to simplify how crypto connects with the traditional finance system, but without turning into a bank. Greg called the charter a way to “enable continued innovation” while giving the company room to grow with fewer regulatory blockades. Other crypto firms chase charters while Congress stalls Coinbase isn’t the only one eyeing a national-level license. Circle filed for the same kind of charter in June. Ripple followed in July. Paxos threw in its application by August. One firm, Anchorage Digital Bank NA, already holds a trust charter. All of them want faster access to building crypto tools in a messy U.S. regulatory landscape that still can’t decide who oversees what. Meanwhile, Congress is dragging its feet on another much-awaited crypto market structure bill. Lawmakers are trying to sort out who should regulate what and how to define digital assets under U.S. law. The bill is supposed to go through markup in the Senate by late October, but nobody expects it to actually pass this year, what with all that Trump has dumped on the Congress. Coinbase’s charter application is sort of a workaround this. They go federal, skip the state delays, and push ahead while Capitol Hill sits figuring out how to write rules. And so far, the market seems to approve, because since January, Coinbase stock has surged by 53%, sitting at $380.02 at press time. Coinbase shuts down GiveCrypto and experiments with crypto-based welfare Coinbase has also been experimenting with what to do with its philanthropy programs… or at least, what’s left of them. In 2023, the company shut down GiveCrypto, its own donation effort. It admitted the project failed. “Unable to create lasting change,” the company said at the time. Instead, Coinbase sent $2.6 million in leftover funds to GiveDirectly, a group better equipped to run welfare programs with crypto. As Cryptopolitan reported , that money is now funding a new New York City program called “Future First”, run by GiveDirectly. The goal is to figure out if giving people crypto directly, with no strings, can help them make real decisions around housing, education, and stability. Emma Kelsey, who oversees U.S. programs at GiveDirectly, said the project’s structure is different from traditional basic income tests. Rather than drip-feeding monthly amounts, recipients in NYC are getting one $8,000 lump sum, followed by five smaller deposits of $800 each.

The AVAX four‑hour chart shows price trading near $29.92 with clear support at $27–$25 and a deeper base near $23–$22. Resistance zones sit at $35 and the $40–$42 range. Support levels around $25–$27 have repeatedly acted as rebound points, while intraday swings reflect profit‑taking and short‑term accumulation in the $12.2–12.9 billion market‑cap band. Source: CW Via X Market capitalization movements: why they matter Avalanche market cap swung between approximately $12.1 billion and $12.9 billion in intraday trading, showing both profit‑taking and renewed buying. Holding above $12.5 billion supports short‑term upside, while failing $12.2 billion would increase downside risk. Source: CoinGecko Frequently Asked Questions What caused September 2025 DEX volume to spike for Avalanche? Higher on‑chain activity, increased swap pairs and a cluster of large transactions drove September’s DEX volumes. Market commentary and on‑chain metrics point to renewed trader participation and elevated liquidity demand across AVAX pairs. How should traders interpret the current AVAX support and resistance? Traders should view $27–$25 as immediate support for short‑term longs and $35 as the first clear resistance for breakouts. A sustained move above $40 would indicate broader market confidence; conversely, losing $23–$22 increases downside risk. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What caused September 2025 DEX volume to spike for Avalanche?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Higher on‑chain activity, increased swap pairs and several large transactions drove September’s DEX volumes, indicating renewed trader participation and elevated liquidity on Avalanche."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How should traders interpret AVAX support and resistance now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Treat $27–$25 as immediate support and $35 as first resistance; a break above $40 would signal stronger bullish momentum while losing $23–$22 would increase downside risk."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Avalanche DEX volume surge and AVAX price action"", ""description"": ""Stepwise guide to evaluate the September 2025 Avalanche volume surge and relevant price signals."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm volume data"", ""text"": ""Compare monthly DEX volume series to prior months to verify the $33–34B figure and identify abnormal spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess price support and resistance"", ""text"": ""Locate immediate support at $27–$25 and resistance at $35 and $40–$42 to frame trade bias."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor market cap swings"", ""text"": ""Track intraday market cap between $12.1B–$12.9B for signs of accumulation or profit‑taking."" } ]} Key Takeaways Volume spike : September DEX volume reached about $34B — the largest monthly total in 2025.

The alleged vulnerabilities were reportedly found in Palantir, Anduril Industries and Microsoft’s joint venture called the Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) system, leading to a drop in Palantir’s stock price. Palantir Technologies Inc. rejected claims that its battlefield communications platform suffers from major security flaws after an internal U.S. Army memo warning of “very high risk” vulnerabilities sparked investor concerns and sent its stock tumbling on Friday. Palantir , along with the defense technology firm Anduril Industries Inc. and partners including Microsoft Corp., is building the Army’s Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) system. The platform is designed to connect soldiers, vehicles, commanders, and sensors with real-time data. But a September 5 memo from Army Chief Technology Officer Gabriele Chiulli raised serious red flags, saying the prototype system contained “fundamental security” problems that left it vulnerable to insider threats, external attacks, and data misuse. The document concluded that the platform should be treated as “very high risk” in its current form. Palantir has rejected claims of a security flaw Palantir shares fell more than 8% on Friday, their steepest decline in a day since August, before partially recovering. The company, which has enjoyed a stock rise of over 2,000% in the past three years under President Donald Trump’s administration, was quick to push back on the report. “The concerns raised in the September 5 Army memo were addressed as part of the normal development process. No vulnerabilities were found in the Palantir platform.” A Palantir spokesperson said in a statement . Anduril, which is privately held but eyeing an eventual IPO, also dismissed the report. The company said the memo reflected “an outdated snapshot, not the current state of the program,” stressing that risks are routinely identified early and resolved before systems are deployed in the field. Palantir and Anduril are both riding a wave of lucrative Pentagon contracts under Trump. Palantir recently secured a $480M deal for Maven, an artificial intelligence system designed to analyze battlefield imagery and sensor data, while Anduril signed a $159M contract to develop night vision and mixed reality gear under the Soldier Borne Mission Command program. ‘Very high risk’ concerns Anduril boasts of producing a working NGC2 prototype just eight weeks after winning the Army contract. In September, the company highlighted the system’s success in live-fire exercises at Fort Carson, Colorado. Soldiers using NGC2 reportedly fired artillery missions in seconds compared with minutes for crews relying on legacy communications. Supporters argue that this speed and flexibility are exactly what the U.S. military needs to maintain an edge over adversaries like China and Russia, but the leaked memo, first reported by defense news outlet Breaking Defense, paints a less optimistic picture. The memo stated that the NGC2 prototype’s security posture meant that “any authorized user can potentially access and misuse sensitive classified information,” with no mechanisms in place to log or track their actions. It also noted that third-party applications integrated into the platform had bypassed standard Army security assessments. One app was found to contain 25 high-severity code vulnerabilities, while three others each contained over 200 flaws awaiting review. Perhaps most alarmingly, the memo said the Army could not verify whether the software itself was secure, who was accessing what data, or how user actions could be monitored. “The likelihood of an adversary gaining persistent undetectable access to the platform requires the system be treated as very high risk,” Chiulli wrote. However, Leonel Garciga, the Army’s Chief Information Officer and Chiulli’s supervisor, told Reuters that the findings were part of a structured process to “triage cybersecurity vulnerabilities” and strengthen the system before wider deployment. Lieutenant General Jeth Rey echoed this view, saying, “This is a new capability coming in and we found a risk and we mitigated it right out the gate.” The Army has not said whether the memo will affect the timeline for NGC2’s rollout, but officials insist the development process is designed to treat such problems early, not to reduce confidence in the technology.

The historic plunge comes under President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff policy, which has weighed heavily on India’s trade prospects. Officials in New Delhi are now rolling out long-term plans to cut dependence on the dollar as they try to shore up sentiment for the rupee. The fall of the rupee has made it the worst-performing currency in Asia this year.It has dropped 3.6% against the greenback despite a softer dollar environment. Analysts warn that this slide poses inflation risks for India, which imports a large portion of its fuel, and also makes global investors cautious about deploying funds into Indian markets. Officials are now trying to globalize the rupee in a way similar to China’s strategy with the yuan, but experts say the process is full of obstacles. RBI expands tools to push rupee in cross-border trades The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this week introduced new measures to push global acceptance of the rupee.It announced new reference rates for key partners like the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. By doing so, banks can directly price trades in rupees and partner currencies instead of routing them through the dollar. R. Gurumurthy, a retired regional director at the RBI, said, “Transactions are typically channeled via the dollar, adding a costly layer.” The RBI also broadened the types of assets that holders of some overseas accounts can purchase and allowed banks to lend the local currency in three neighboring countries. Abhishek Upadhyay, an economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd, said the timing of the measures shows the central bank’s effort to strengthen sentiment for the rupee and slow the pace of its depreciation. Experts caution that pushing up the usage of the rupee globally will demand more than publishing a reference rate.Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist at IDFC First Bank, said that “removal of restrictions on the convertibility of the currency” would eventually be required to reach true internationalization. Gurumurthy added that central banks might also need to coordinate interventions to prevent volatility in new currency pairs. “Publishing a reference rate does not by itself create liquidity and banks will only trade actively if there is sufficient demand, hedging tools, and confidence in market stability,” he said. Dollar stays dominant as Indian markets rally under lending reforms Breaking the dollar’s dominance will not be easy. Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed the U.S. currency was on one side of 89% of all foreign-exchange trades in 2025, up from 88% in 2022. While the rupee struggled, India’s stock market index the Nifty 50 rose 0.23% to 24,894.25, and the BSE Sensex added 0.28% to 81,207.17.Both indexes rose about 1% over the week, driven by banks. State-owned lenders surged 4.4%, private banks climbed 2.5%, and high-weight banks increased 2.2% after the RBI eased rules for lending to capital markets and large companies on Wednesday. The RBI kept rates steady as expected but announced plans to raise limits on lending against shares and to cut risk weights for non-bank lenders funding infrastructure projects. “The status quo on rates is a relief for banks as a rate cut would have led to contraction of net interest margins, while the relaxation of restrictions on bank loans will aid credit growth,” said Prakhar Sharma and Vinayak Agrawal, equity analysts at Jefferies. Metals also posted gains. Prices rose 1.8% on the day to a record high, pushing weekly gains to 3.9% on a weaker dollar, supply disruptions, and firmer expectations for an October U.S. rate cut. The broader small-cap and mid-cap indexes gained 1.8% and 2% this week, showing how Indian assets remained strong even as the rupee hit an all-time low. Get seen where it counts.

The recent price surge has fueled optimism that XRP could see further growth in October 2025, with a target price of $4.20 in sight. This potential rally is being driven by upcoming ETF decisions, whale buying activity, and key support levels holding firm. While XRP remains in the spotlight, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as top picks for investors seeking high-upside growth opportunities. With increasing market traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is steadily positioning itself for a major breakout in 2025, joining the ranks of altcoins to watch closely in this shifting market. XRP: Riding on Key Support and ETF Momentum XRP’s price rose 5% in the past 24 hours, up 11% from its local low of $2.69 to trade just below $3 on Thursday. This move positioned XRP for further gains in October, backed by several onchain, technical and fundamental factors. XRP’s record quarterly close on Tuesday came as the price pushed above a key support zone between $2.75-$2.80, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows. The cost basis distribution heatmap shows significant activity in this area, where nearly 4.3 billion XRP were acquired, underscoring the importance of this level. Holding above was critical for a sustained recovery toward $3 and beyond. “$XRP is currently trading within a descending triangle pattern as buyers continue to defend the $2.8 support zone,” said Alpha Crypto Signal analysts, adding: “This compression is setting up for a decisive move.” A breakout above the descending trendline with substantial volume could trigger a bullish leg for XRP toward $3.40–$3.66. As Cointelegraph reported, a decisive breakout from a symmetrical triangle could ignite a rally toward $4.20 in October, fueled by whale buying. October’s ETF spotlight could also add tailwinds to XRP, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deadlines looming mid-month. ETF Momentum Rally Leads Investors to High RIsing Gem While XRP’s growth prospects look strong, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the best altcoins to watch for 2025. The project’s early-stage growth and clear roadmap have sparked interest among both retail and institutional investors. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from other altcoins is its real utility and strong community engagement. As one of the most talked-about projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is poised to deliver substantial returns for those who get in early.

With its steady rise and growing adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a strong contender in the altcoin space, gaining momentum as more investors discover its potential for high returns. Conclusion: From Stability to High-Upside Growth, Diversifying is Key As XRP continues its push toward the $4.20 target, driven by solid support and ETF momentum, it remains one of the top altcoins for stability and growth in the coming months. At the same time, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are offering exciting high-upside growth opportunities for investors looking to diversify and capitalize on future success. With the XRP ETF decision approaching and strong fundamentals driving its momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a key player to watch in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Pedro M., 39, was detained on Thursday, October 3, 2025, following a five-hour manhunt by Thai law enforcement officers. He is wanted across Europe and Asia in connection with schemes allegedly worth more than €500 million ($586 million), involving Bitcoin investment fraud, card skimming, and passport forgery. Fraud suspect arrested after chance encounter Pedro has long been wanted by the Portuguese authorities as well as Thai law enforcement due to various charges. Ironically, an ironic plot twist was about to unfold as the most unlikely person helped nab the two-year fugitive. A Portuguese journalist holidaying in Thailand spotted Pedro in Bangkok and contacted authorities. Facial recognition software and biometric databases helped authorities to confirm the suspect’s identity before plainclothes officers deployed to the scene. After a few hours of surveillance, the suspect was apprehended. Pedro first entered Thailand in 2023 on a tourist visa, but never renewed it or registered an address. Records show his last visa stamp dates back nearly two years. He admitted to overstaying his visa and was formally charged with immigration violations. Authorities said he would face legal proceedings in Thailand before being deported to Portugal, where he is expected to stand trial. He will also be added to Thailand’s immigration blacklist. Pedro ran a wide fraud network According to Interpol records and Portuguese media, Pedro has been on the run for quite a while. He’s the suspect behind a large criminal organization with recorded operations in Europe, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia. Swiss bank accounts linked to hundreds of millions of euros, while victims ranged from retail investors lured into fake crypto platforms to banks and payment processors targeted through credit card fraud. Thai officials said that shortly after his arrival in Bangkok, Pedro was involved in small local Bitcoin scams, defrauding victims of more than 1 million baht, which is about $30,800. According to reports, an arrest warrant was initially issued. However, it was later withdrawn, allowing him to evade capture and resettle in southern Thailand, where he went off radar and dropped off immigration records. By the time of his arrest, European investigators had attributed to him losses exceeding €500 million, placing the case among the largest fraud operations tied to digital assets in recent history. Global stakes in crypto enforcement The arrest throws fresh light on some of the challenges regulators and law enforcement face as crypto-related scams continue to increase. Pedro’s ability to remain in Thailand for nearly two years without valid documentation has raised questions about monitoring processes in the country, even as authorities pointed to the eventual success of biometric tools and international intelligence sharing. While Thai investigators were swift with acting on the tip provided by the journalist, chances are high that Pedro would still have been moving without the chance encounter in Thailand. Pedro is expected to be deported to Lisbon once Thai courts conclude proceedings, where prosecutors are preparing multiple charges, including fraud, money laundering and forgery. Interpol is also expected to assist in attempts to trace and recover assets moved through Swiss accounts. For Portugal, the case will likely mark one of the largest financial crime trials tied to cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Price Poised For October Rally Such projections may seem ambitious, but historical data supports the notion that October has consistently been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months. Over the past 12 years, BTC has closed in the green during October in 10 of those years, and the correlation between strong performances in September and October is noteworthy. Following a positive September—where the Bitcoin price recently posted a gain of 3.91%—the stage appears set for another fruitful October. Bitcoin has an impressive October win rate of 83%, having only recorded losses in the month twice since 2011. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 In 2014, the cryptocurrency fell by 12.95%, and in 2018, it dropped by 3.83%. This remarkable track record highlights October as one of the most profitable months for Bitcoin holders, with an average return of 20.62%. The pattern remains consistent: every time September has closed positively, October has followed suit. Historical data from previous years shows that a green September often leads to substantial gains in October. For instance, in 2015, the Bitcoin price rose by 33.49% after a September increase of 2.35%. Similarly, in 2023, a 3.91% gain in September translated to a substantial 28.52% increase in October. Could BTC Reach $150,000? The bullish sentiment doesn’t end there. In four out of four instances where both September and October closed positively, November also maintained the upward trend. The data showcases consistent gains: in 2015, November saw a 19.27% increase following a strong October. If Bitcoin were to replicate its historical average return of 20.62% this October, a price point around $143,539 could be on the horizon. Even if it aligns with the median return of 14.71%, investors could see new records reaching just above $136,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Levels, Predictions Point To $140,000 By Early 2026 Market expert Michael van de Poppe has also chimed in on the bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. He noted several strong technical indicators, including BTC’s ability to hold the 20-week moving average as support, breaking through a downtrend at $112,000, and positioning for the highest weekly close in its history. Recent performance has seen a robust 11% weekly candle, further fueling optimism. Additionally, with gold experiencing a significant run, the expert suggests that the Bitcoin price appears poised to catch up. Van de Poppe has expressed confidence that, if current trends continue, the market’s leading cryptocurrency could not only hit $150,000 this quarter but also achieve a new all-time high within the month. When writing, BTC trades at approximately $121,669, only 2% below all-time high levels above $124,000.

Following today’s update, MARA remains the second-largest public company with BTC reserves, trailing Michael Saylor’s Strategy. MARA Holdings Increases Bitcoin Reserves According to an official announcement earlier today, MARA Holdings’ BTC reserves rose by 373 coins in September. The firm’s total BTC holdings are valued at approximately $6.4 billion, according to prevailing market prices. Notably, MARA Holdings mined a total of 736 BTC in September, valued at approximately $88.6 million. In comparison, the company had mined 704 BTC in August 2025, representing a 4.4% increase over the previous month. MARA Holdings’ amount of BTC mined in September represents roughly 5.2% of all miner rewards. This includes the transaction fees generated during the month. Unsurprisingly, MARA Holdings continues to be the largest public BTC miner in terms of BTC held. That said, it is worth highlighting that MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin stack consists of BTC that is loaned, actively managed, or used as collateral. Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO, MARA Holdings, noted: In September, we produced 218 blocks, a 5% increase over August, demonstrating the continued strength and resilience of our operations even as global hashrate grew 9% month-over-month to an average of 1,031 EH/s. This growth in production underscores our ability to execute consistently, even as mining becomes more difficult. As mentioned earlier, MARA Holdings follows Strategy, the leading public company with the largest stack of BTC on its balance sheet. Strategy continued to increase its BTC stack, purchasing another $22 million worth of BTC earlier this week, propelling its total holdings to a mammoth 640,031 BTC, worth around $77 billion. Other public firms that feature among the top BTC holders include the likes of Twenty One (43,514 BTC), Japan-based Metaplanet (30,823 BTC), and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (30,021 BTC). In addition, well-known firms like Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., Galaxy Digital Holdings, Coinbase Global, Tesla, and Jack Dorsey-backed Block rank among the top 15 public companies with the largest BTC reserves. Companies Preferring Altcoins For Corporate Treasury While Bitcoin still reigns supreme in terms of being the most influential cryptocurrency with the highest adoption, altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) are emerging as viable competition to BTC. For instance, NASDAQ-listed VisionSys AI recently announced that it plans to launch a Solana-based treasury program, valued at up to $2 billion.

The company contends that such a move would be too risky, technically complex, and could destabilize the market. Over five days of testimony, witnesses backing the tech firm warned that a divestiture could jeopardize operations expected to generate $15.9 billion in revenue by 2025, based on projections from research firm eMarketer. They further argued that dismantling the company’s ad exchange would sow uncertainty across the digital advertising industry, diminish service quality for smaller publishers, and deter potential investors. Google finds itself in a problem with illegal monopoly allegations Google’s trial process focuses on suitable methods to foster competition in the technology that supports the display advertising industry, which the tech giant controls. The trial came after Leonie Brinkema, an American lawyer and jurist serving as a United States district judge of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, ruled that the tech company held an illegal monopoly in two areas, that is, the advertising exchange and ad server, a publisher-side technology, in April. The tech firm currently sells ads for website publishers, provides tools for advertisers to buy placements, and runs an exchange where transactions are completed through real-time auctions. In response to the ruling, the Justice Department has proposed that the tech firm be forced to divest its AdX exchange and disclose how its ad server determines which ads are displayed. Notably, if these changes fail to fix competition issues encountered in the market, the department has requested that the company gradually sell its ad server. In response to these proposals, Google has suggested integrating its technology with a popular alternative, Prebid, and competing ad servers. It has also pledged not to reinstate certain auction methods that the court found gave them unfair benefits, known as “first look” and “last look.” However, it is worth noting that the company’s efforts mainly focused on fighting against the Justice Department’s proposal to make it sell AdX. On the other hand, the agency argued that they found this proposal appealing because it will control approximately 56% of the display ads market, supporting a significant portion of the open web. Google fights against the Justice Department’s proposal to make it sell AdX Concerning the sales of its ad exchange, Google outlined several arguments to convince the court that the Justice Department’s proposal was not a suitable solution. According to the tech company, selling AdX is technically tricky. This is because many of its engineers and outside experts agree that the ad exchange, unlike the rest of Google’s technology, would be complex. AdX and the publisher ad server are now integrated into a single product under Google Ad Manager. Glenn Berntson, engineering director for Google Ad Manager, stated that this allows them to share processing power and reduces the time it takes to decide which ad to load on a webpage. Heather Adkins, Google’s vice president of security engineering, commented on the situation. Adkins likened the relationship between AdX and Google’s core infrastructure to knitting, explaining that it is very intertwined. Still, the Justice Department argues that the connection of Google’s AdX product to its underlying infrastructure could be replaced with tools from cloud providers, including the tech firm’s own offering, Google Cloud Platform. Although Adkins acknowledged that some of Google’s core services have similar versions, they may not operate in exactly the same way.

Dogecoin price rose 16% after a late-September support bounce, signaling renewed buying interest. SEC action on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETF filings is the near-term event traders expect to move DOGE. Dogecoin sits below major resistance: a move to $1 requires 250%+ upside; technical patterns warn of mixed risk. Dogecoin price surged 16% after a support bounce; monitor the SEC DOGE ETF decision for potential upside — read our analysis and trading checklist. What is driving the recent Dogecoin price surge? Dogecoin price climbed roughly 16% after bouncing off a key support level in late September, moving to $0.2630 as buyers entered the dip. Market participants cite improving technicals and the anticipated SEC decision on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs as the primary near-term drivers. How could an SEC DOGE ETF approval affect Dogecoin? Approval of spot DOGE ETFs could increase institutional accessibility and liquidity, lifting Dogecoin’s visibility in portfolios. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has said regulators are likely to approve many ETF filings; market history shows ETF approvals tend to coincide with increased inflows and heightened volatility. Expect short-term volatility around the announcement. Why is technical analysis mixed despite the rally? Dogecoin cleared its 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages, a bullish short-term sign. However, the chart is forming a rising wedge pattern, which can precede corrections as trendlines converge. Reaching $1 requires more than 250% upside from current levels, making that target unlikely without sustained institutional demand. Dogecoin price has surged by 16% after hitting a key support level. Investors are optimistic ahead of the SEC’s ETF decision. Dogecoin price has surged 16% after bouncing off a crucial support level in September, signaling renewed investor confidence. The SEC’s expected approval of Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs could further boost Dogecoin’s momentum in the coming weeks. While DOGE’s price has rebounded, analysts suggest it will take significant time before it reaches the $1 resistance level. Dogecoin has recently experienced a significant bounce after hitting a crucial support level in late September. Investors bought the dip, lifting the token to approximately $0.2630, a 16% uptick from the local low. The move coincides with growing market optimism as traders anticipate regulatory clarity on spot DOGE ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is widely expected to rule on multiple DOGE ETF applications, including filings from Grayscale and Bitwise. Market commentators such as Eric Balchunas (Bloomberg) have noted a favorable probability for ETF approvals given the current regulatory context and the existence of regulated derivatives tied to Dogecoin. Such approvals typically increase asset visibility to institutional managers. When is the SEC decision likely, and what should traders watch? SEC deadlines vary by filing but are concentrated in the coming weeks. Traders should watch official SEC announcements and major ETF filing timelines. Key on-chain and market signals to monitor include volume spikes, inflows into DOGE-denominated ETFs (when available), and price behavior around the $0.3088 year-to-date high. Source: TradingView Despite the rally, the path to $1 remains long. A move that large needs sustained capital inflows and structural adoption. Analysts caution that a rising wedge increases the probability of a short-term correction even while moving averages point higher. Traders should size positions with risk controls in place. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Dogecoin Price Surges 16% as Investors Eye SEC DOGE ETF Decision"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-32-1024x515.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Dogecoin price rose 16% after a support bounce; the SEC’s decision on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs is the key near-term catalyst for further momentum."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/dogecoin-price-surges-oct-2025"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Dogecoin reach $1 if the SEC approves DOGE ETFs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""An ETF approval would likely boost Dogecoin's visibility and liquidity, but reaching $1 requires sustained institutional inflows and broader adoption; a one-time approval is unlikely to deliver that full move immediately."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When is the SEC expected to decide on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETF filings?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Decision timelines vary by filing, but market participants expect key rulings within the coming weeks; traders should monitor official SEC notices and ETF filing updates for exact dates."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor Dogecoin price ahead of the SEC ETF decision"", ""description"": ""Steps to follow price action, technical signals, and regulatory updates to make informed decisions."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track key technical levels"", ""text"": ""Monitor 50-day and 100-day EMAs, recent support at $0.225–$0.24, and the year-to-date high at $0.3088 for breakout or rejection signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch regulatory timelines"", ""text"": ""Review SEC filing deadlines and public notices for Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETF applications and set alerts for announcements."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Manage risk"", ""text"": ""Use position sizing and stop-loss levels; expect elevated volatility around ETF decision dates and prepare for rapid price swings."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How high could Dogecoin realistically climb after ETF approval? Short term, DOGE could see strong gains due to increased demand, but $1 remains unlikely without sustained institutional adoption. Market experts place higher probability on sizable but incremental moves rather than immediate triple-digit percentage gains. How should retail traders respond to ETF news? Retail traders should avoid emotional leverage. Use alerts, define stop-losses, and consider incremental entries. Keep positions size-limited and prioritize capital preservation during event-driven volatility. Key Takeaways Immediate catalyst : SEC decisions on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs are the key near-term drivers. Technical outlook : 50/100-day EMA cross provides short-term support, but a rising wedge warns of possible correction. Risk management : Expect volatility around announcements—use stops and prudent position sizing. Conclusion Dogecoin price has shown renewed momentum after a 16% bounce off key support, with the SEC’s handling of DOGE ETF filings the primary event to watch. Investors should balance bullish catalysts with technical caution and maintain disciplined risk management as regulatory clarity unfolds.

With optimism building across the market, targets as high as $10,000 for ETH have surfaced for 2025. Yet while Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto world, some traders argue the most dramatic multiples may come from smaller projects. One name that continues to generate buzz is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , a presale altcoin priced at just $0.0058 that is already being tipped to surpass $2 in the next cycle. Ethereum price prediction points higher Ethereum has shown resilience in 2025, with ETH recovering strongly after periods of volatility. Analysts now suggest the network’s continued dominance in DeFi and NFTs, along with upcoming scalability improvements could drive ETH toward $8,000–$10,000. While that kind of run would deliver strong returns, critics argue that such gains are modest compared to what smaller tokens could achieve. Institutional inflows remain a critical factor. With spot ETH ETFs gaining traction, liquidity has surged, further solidifying Ethereum’s role as the backbone of Web3. For most investors, ETH remains a safe choice. However, the question many are asking is not whether Ethereum will rise but which new tokens could outperform it. Why smaller caps can deliver bigger multiples Large-cap coins like Ethereum, while safer, are unlikely to deliver the explosive 50x or 100x multiples that draw speculative capital. That is why presale tokens are attracting attention. With low entry prices and rapid growth narratives, they offer a level of upside that even the most bullish Ethereum price prediction cannot match. This is where Layer Brett enters the conversation. By combining meme appeal with Ethereum Layer 2 technology, it represents a unique mix of hype and utility. Traders looking for the next breakout are starting to view LBRETT as a way to complement ETH holdings with higher-risk, higher-reward exposure. Layer Brett’s rapid rise Layer Brett’s presale has already raised over $4.2 million, showing strong demand from early backers. The token’s staking rewards sit at 616% APY at the time of writing, although these yields will decrease as more wallets join. This mechanism creates urgency for investors who want to maximise rewards before dilution. Beyond staking, the roadmap includes NFT launches, gamified staking mechanics and cross-chain bridging, which elevate Layer Brett above the average meme project. Accessibility is also a major selling point: Buying requires only a wallet connection and ETH or USDT, making entry simple for newcomers and veterans alike. The project has also teased a $1 million giveaway, designed to boost engagement and reward early adopters. Combined with its utility features, this has helped Layer Brett capture a wave of attention across crypto communities. Social traction fuels momentum Strong communities often drive meme coin success and Layer Brett is no exception. Telegram and X groups have around 10,000 members, TikTok has over 25,000 followers and YouTube reviews rack up thousands of views. This online presence signals a project already breaking into mainstream conversation — something essential for viral growth. Final thoughts The most bullish Ethereum price prediction sees ETH climbing toward $10,000, cementing its status as a safe long-term bet. But for those chasing exponential returns, Layer Brett offers a far sharper upside. At $0.0058 in presale, with over $4.2 million already raised, staking yields above 600% APY, plus a roadmap including NFTs, gamified staking, cross-chain functionality and a $1 million giveaway, it has all the ingredients for viral success. Ethereum may remain the backbone of Web3 but in terms of multiples, analysts are increasingly pointing to LBRETT as the token most likely to deliver 50x or even 100x gains.

AI Reveals Shocking Answer,https://cryptopotato.com/will-bnb-overtake-xrp-and-when-ai-reveals-shocking-answer/,"The cryptocurrency tied to the world’s largest digital asset exchange has been on a roll lately, smashing new all-time highs on a regular basis, with the latest being above $1,190. This has propelled its market capitalization to a peak of its own at roughly $160 billion as of the time of this writing. This puts BNB in a relatively close proximity to the likes of USDT and XRP. The question that we asked ChatGPT was: Will (or when) BNB can surpass both? Can BNB Overtake XRP? Although the current difference of $30 billion between the duo’s market caps is still quite significant, what’s more worrying to the XRP Army is the lack of actual momentum behind their favorite asset. Ripple’s cross-border token peaked in mid-July at $3.65, but it has failed to resume its run ever since and currently struggles at $3.00 even as the entire market is pumping. In contrast, BNB, perhaps led by the hype around ASTER, has rocketed in the past month, gaining 30% compared to XRP’s more modest 8.5%. Its new all-time high came on Friday evening at just over $1,190. ChatGPT outlined several other bullish factors behind BNB, including the global market dominance of the exchange behind it, the growing activity of the BNB Chain, and the burning mechanism, which reduces the amount of tokens until the total supply is down to 100 million. At the same time, OpenAI’s chatbot acknowledged that XRP has been trading mainly sideways lately, and the momentum surrounding it appears to be lacking. It noted that the adoption progress of the XRP Ledger and RLUSD is relatively slow compared to speculation-driven hype cycles, such as BNB and ASTER. “My take: Based on momentum + fundamentals, BNB has a strong chance of overtaking XRP by end of this year,” commented the AI solution. In a more ‘bullish’ scenario for BNB, ChatGPT said the flippening can happen somewhere in October or November if the asset’s momentum continues and adds another 20-25%, while XRP stalls. Not So Fast ChatGPT also outlined a different scenario in which XRP breaks out of consolidation and reaches new highs, thus maintaining or extending the gap with BNB. In it, the token and the company behind it would require a significant catalyst. The most probable appears to be the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission has over a dozen filings on its desk waiting for a decisive decision after multiple delays . Many of those have a deadline set for October, and a green light could send the underlying asset flying, the AI chatbot said. According to current odds on Polymarket, the chances for such financial products to hit the US markets by the end of the year are almost 100%.

And the buzz? Some are calling for gains of 4,000%. Here’s how these three stack up, and which one might just blow up next bull run. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Power Meets Layer 2 Innovation Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a Layer 2 blockchain purpose-built for meme culture, speed, and ultra-low fees. At the core of its ecosystem lies the $LILPEPE token, which powers every transaction and utility across the network. With meme culture thriving in the crypto space, LILPEPE aims to be the first chain fully dedicated to launching and supporting meme projects. Right now, the presale is in Stage 13, with tokens priced at $0.0022. Out of the 17.25 billion tokens allocated for presale, over 93.45% have already been sold, raising more than $26.29 million. The next stage price is set at $0.0023, showing steady demand from early buyers eager to secure their spot before exchange listings. Security is also a major selling point. LILPEPE has been successfully audited by CertiK, receiving a 95.49% security score, which ranks it among the most secure meme tokens in the DeFi space. The audit covered smart contract logic, admin privileges, vulnerabilities, and compliance with ERC-20 standards, giving investors peace of mind. The Tokenomics Are Designed For Sustainability: 26.5% Presale – Rewarding Early Believers. 30% Chain Reserves – ensuring long-term ecosystem support. 10% Liquidity – deep trading pools for smoother transactions. 10% DEX Allocation – for decentralized exchange listings. 13.5% Staking & Rewards – Incentivizing Long-Term Holders. 10% Marketing – pushing meme dominance through viral campaigns. 0% Tax – no buy or sell fees, keeping it DeFi-friendly. Additionally, the team has launched a Mega Giveaway, rewarding large presale buyers with ETH prizes. Combine this with meme culture, community-driven growth, and a unique Layer 2 chain, and it’s easy to see why analysts are calling LILPEPE one of the few tokens with true 4000% upside potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Veteran Fighting Back Shiba Inu defends $0.0000115 support as whales scoop up 62B SHIB. Falling exchange balances hint at rising self-custody, signaling bullish sentiment and expectations of higher prices ahead. The Shiba Inu burn rate has also surged more than 100%, helping reduce supply pressure. Meanwhile, ecosystem growth continues with the rollout of Shibarium, its own Layer 2 solution designed to boost utility. Some analysts even speculate on the long-term potential of a Shiba Inu ETF, which could bring institutional demand. However, while SHIB has plenty of community support and upside, reaching a true 4000% return from its current levels is less likely compared to newer, smaller-cap projects like LILPEPE. Cardano (ADA): The Smart Contract Powerhouse Unlike SHIB and LILPEPE, Cardano isn’t a meme coin—it’s a smart contract blockchain going up against the likes of Ethereum and Solana. Right now, ADA is hanging around the $0.80 support zone, with bulls eyeing a move back toward $1.50–$2.00, and maybe even $3.00 if momentum really kicks in. One big plus for Cardano is its institutional backing. Cardano’s ETF inclusion highlights its strength, while rising exchange outflows suggest investors are holding rather than selling. As long as ADA holds that $0.80 base, analysts think it could grind higher. The catch? Its growth probably won’t be as wild as meme coins—more slow and steady than a moonshot. Which Coin Holds the 4000% Potential? Cardano (ADA) is a blue-chip project with steady upside, strong fundamentals, and institutional backing. It’s more about slow and sustainable growth than explosive gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains strong in terms of community momentum and technical patterns, indicating a potential breakout. While it could deliver solid returns, its large market cap makes a 4000% rally less realistic. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the wild card with the highest upside. Its combination of meme power, Layer 2 technology, zero-tax structure, and viral marketing strategy gives it a unique edge. Backed by a strong audit score and presale momentum, LILPEPE is positioned to become the next big meme coin explosion. Author’s Note For investors chasing life-changing gains, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most compelling play of the three. With a presale nearly sold out, a launchpad for meme projects, and a Layer 2 chain designed to outpace competitors, it has the ingredients to replicate or even surpass the success of early SHIB and DOGE investors. SHIB and ADA remain solid bets for more conservative traders, but for those seeking the next 4000% crypto rocket, Little Pepe could be the frog that jumps the highest.

ETH current price: $4,463 with $4,505 as immediate resistance. Upside targets: $6,035 (1.618 Fibonacci) and $6,900 (measured move). Market drivers: Spot ETH ETF buys (~$80M), whale accumulation, and steady weekly volumes. Ethereum bull flag gains momentum; ETH price target $6,900 if $4,505 breaks — read analysis and trade implications from COINOTAG. What is the Ethereum bull flag and why does it matter? The Ethereum bull flag is a weekly continuation pattern formed after a strong rally, signaling consolidation before a potential breakout. It matters because a confirmed breakout above $4,505 could accelerate returns toward key targets like $6,035 and $6,900, particularly with ETF inflows and on-chain accumulation supporting demand. How do spot ETH ETFs and $80M inflows affect the ETH price? Spot ETH ETFs increase institutional demand and liquidity, which can tighten available supply and lift price action. Reported single-day ETF purchases of about $80 million coincide with whale accumulation and steady weekly trading volumes, reinforcing the bullish structure and improving probability of a breakout. Market-cap snapshot: ETH market capitalization near $538 billion with 24h volume around $47 billion (CoinMarketCap, plain text). Bull Flag Structure Strengthens The weekly chart shows a classic bull flag: a sharp prior rally followed by a tight, downward-sloping consolidation channel. Ethereum moved from under $2,500 in June to above $4,000 in August, then formed higher lows inside the flag. A breakout above the upper trendline and $4,505 resistance is the technical trigger for measured-move targets. #Ethereum Bull Flag Weekly bull flag pattern forming on $ETH.

The dotted projection on the chart indicates potential continuation once a confirmed weekly breakout occurs. Market Data and Technical Signals Key market data points front-loaded: Price range (24h): $4,396 – $4,550; closing near $4,463. Market capitalization: ~$538 billion (CoinMarketCap, plain text). 24h volume: ~$47 billion (CoinMarketCap, plain text). Analyst notes: Ali Martinez flags resistance at $4,505 as the immediate hurdle. Kamran Asghar notes a confirmed breakout above $4,282 with a 1.618 Fibonacci extension target at $6,035. Institutional flow data reported by SoSoValue shows spot ETF purchases around $80M in a single day, a notable demand signal when combined with on-chain whale accumulation. Source: AliMartinez (X) How should traders interpret the technical setup? Use clear triggers and risk management: a weekly close above $4,505 confirms continuation; a failure below the lower flag trendline invalidates the pattern. Volume confirmation—higher volumes on breakout—strengthens the signal. Apply stop-losses below recent swing lows and scale position sizes to volatility.

A weekly close above $4,505 that breaks the flag’s upper trendline with elevated volume generally confirms the breakout and opens targets like $6,035 and $6,900. How much did spot ETH ETFs buy and why does it matter? Spot ETH ETFs reportedly purchased around $80 million in one day. That volume matters because it signals institutional demand, which can support higher price targets if accumulation continues. Key Takeaways Pattern: Weekly bull flag indicates consolidation with a bullish tilt. Trigger: Weekly close above $4,505 on strong volume confirms continuation. Drivers: Spot ETH ETF inflows (~$80M), whale accumulation, and steady on-chain metrics support upside. Conclusion Ethereum’s weekly bull flag and institutional flows create a high-probability bullish scenario if price clears $4,505. Traders should watch volume and on-chain metrics closely, use disciplined risk management, and monitor targets at $6,035 and $6,900.

The post suggests that SWIFT has incorporated Ripple’s technology into its operations, with XRP positioned to provide liquidity for the evolving financial system. The information was presented alongside a video explaining PaymentSafe’s framework and its role in enhancing payment efficiency through universal connectivity. Breaking: SWIFT has quietly woven Ripple’s tech into its network. #XRP is set to fuel liquidity for the next-generation financial system pic.twitter.com/ayyNGVKn6h — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) October 1, 2025 PaymentSafe and its Functionality The video explains that PaymentSafe is a centralized platform for processing payments across multiple networks, including domestic systems, international corridors, and SWIFT . The design is built around enabling straight-through processing by removing fragmentation in formats and message flows. One of its highlighted features is the “universal translator,” a component that converts between legacy SWIFT MT messages and ISO 20022 standards, including CBPR+. This translation capability allows banks and financial institutions to streamline operations without being constrained by legacy infrastructures. PaymentSafe also includes back-office integration with functions such as core banking, treasury, trade finance, reconciliation, and internet channels. The platform embeds compliance tools like sanction screening and anti-fraud workflows. Additional modules cover reporting, message workflow, and centralized monitoring, making it a broad system designed to meet regulatory and operational requirements while unifying payment activity. Network Connectivity and Ripple’s Presence The screenshot shared alongside the video shows PaymentSafe’s interoperability with multiple networks. These include SWIFT , real-time gross settlement systems, ACH, instant payments, and central bank clearing systems. Notably, Ripple and distributed ledger technology appear as network endpoints within this diagram. The implication presented in the post is that PaymentSafe facilitates connectivity between traditional financial networks and emerging technologies, creating a bridge for new forms of liquidity management. The claim emphasized by CryptoSensei is that SWIFT has “woven” Ripple’s technology into its ecosystem, making XRP a potential liquidity solution within this integrated framework. While the materials presented highlight Ripple’s placement in the PaymentSafe architecture, they do not provide evidence of XRP being directly operational within SWIFT flows . Rather, the diagram and explanation indicate PaymentSafe’s ability to unify multiple networks, with Ripple shown as one of the available endpoints. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Suggested Role of XRP According to the interpretation given in the post, XRP’s role would be to provide liquidity across payment corridors that traditionally rely on pre-funded accounts or correspondent banking. By positioning XRP within a hub that can translate and process multiple formats under a single interface, the argument is made that financial institutions could reduce friction and costs when accessing liquidity. PaymentSafe’s compliance and fraud-prevention features are also cited as crucial for making such an approach viable in regulated financial environments. CryptoSensei’s post connects PaymentSafe, SWIFT, and Ripple into a narrative suggesting a deeper level of integration between legacy networks and emerging technologies.

Shibarium Team Implements New Security Measures According to a post-mortem report , the malicious attack involved a perpetrator submitting three fraudulent checkpoints to Shibarium’s Ethereum mainnet contracts, disrupting the continuity between Heimdall’s local state and the on-chain state. After the attack was detected, Shibarium’s Kaal Dhairya announced on social media platform X (previously twitter) that authorities had been alerted, while also expressing a willingness to negotiate with the attacker in exchange for the return of the stolen funds. However, no agreement was reached, and the attacker has since moved the stolen assets, leaving the Shibarium team to focus on recovery and security enhancements for the platform. In light of this, Heimdall intentionally halted operations, pausing legitimate checkpoint submissions to prevent further damage. They also described the attacker’s method, which included a short-lived stake amplification strategy through a 4.6 million BONE delegation. This tactic allowed the attacker to cross operational thresholds and attempt to gain unauthorized control over the system. To address these issues, the Shibarium team organized their response into multiple overlapping workstreams, functioning around the clock in collaboration with Hexens.io, an independent reviewer. Their approach included daily stand-ups, continuous monitoring of changes, and strict separation of duties among team members responsible for infrastructure, contracts, validator operations, and testnets . This aimed to eliminate any single points of failure, employing hardware custody for keys and ensuring every critical change was rehearsed off-chain or on testnets prior to implementation. Shiba Inu Dev’s Strategy To Compensate Affected Users As part of their actions, Shiba Inu devs introduced a rescue method in the StakeManager to recover at-risk BONE tokens. They executed the AdminConsumeLegacyBound function to clean up legacy unbond states associated with the attacker’s contract. This response verified that the staking ledger updates were successful, ultimately rescuing the 4.6 million BONE and removing the malicious delegation. Looking ahead, Shiba Inu developers detailed their plans for the near future, which include implementing blacklisting measures in the Plasma Bridge. These controls aim to prevent malicious actors from initiating or completing bridge transactions. Once these measures are in place and thoroughly verified, the team intends to restore full bridge functionality. In addition to these technical updates, Shiba Inu developers are designing a comprehensive plan to ensure that affected users are made whole. This plan will incorporate gating, phased limits, and coordination with partners to facilitate safe bridging and withdrawals. Specific details will be communicated only when it is deemed secure to do so.

SOPR Trend Hints At $5,000 Upside",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-breakout-sopr-trend-5000-upside/,"Ethereum (ETH) has been on an uptrend since September 28, surging from around $3,800 to the mid $4,000 range at the time of writing. According to recent data from Binance, ETH went through a “reset” during the second half of September and early October, and may now be eyeing the $5,000 price level. Ethereum Reset Over, New Highs Soon? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, ETH underwent a healthy reset over the past few weeks. While the digital asset initially dropped to $3,800 – $3,900 range, it is now trading in the mid $4,000 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Close To Local Bottom? Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest At the same time, ETH’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remained volatile around 1.0, with multiple spikes above one and a singular outlier, shown in the chart below. It suggests that short-term inflows are generating enough demand to meet the supply. In simple words, any price decline is quickly reversed as long as the ETH SOPR remains above 1.0. The chart shows a local bottom created in late September near $3,800 – $3,900. This local bottom was soon followed by a gradual rebound to $4,500. However, the reversal did not occur at once. Instead, it occurred in multiple stages, with short price corrections that did not go below previous lows. For most of this period, the SOPR hovered between 0.98 and 1.03, a neutral range that suggests a rotation in position instead of a broad market sell-off. Although some flash highs surged above 1.0, these profit-taking bursts were quickly absorbed by the strong demand for ETH. Currently, Ethereum is showing signs of reaccumulation. As long as any pullback keeps the SOPR at or above 1.0 and the support level at $4,000 is not breached, ETH could benefit from a continued upside scenario. Arab Chain added: A sustained break above 4.5K would consolidate demand momentum and open the way for gradually higher targets, while a break below 4.0K with SOPR <1 would be the first clear sign that sellers have taken control. ETH Reserves On Exchange Continue To Dwindle Besides ETH’s bullish momentum that may propel it to $5,000, the digital asset’s reserves on crypto exchanges continue to decline. Recent analysis found that an increasing number of new ETH investors are withdrawing ETH for self-custody or staking. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Sharpest Reset Since 2024 As Price Drops Below $4,000 ETH whale behavior also points toward a potential upcoming price rally for the cryptocurrency. Recently, ETH whales scooped as much as $1.73 billion worth of ETH, sending exchange balances to a nine-year low. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently gave a rare bullish signal, suggesting a potential price appreciation to $8,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,471, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

That kind of start is statistically close to flawless. Now Bank of America says that every time in history the S&P 500 surged at least 10% by September’s end, it kept rising for the rest of the year. Well except in 2012 when the U.S. got slammed by a fiscal cliff and global growth slowed. That year, the index gave back 1% in Q4 after gaining 15% in the first nine months. So far, 2025 doesn’t look anything like 2012. There’s no fiscal cliff, and overseas markets are not in freefall. What there is, however, is momentum. The S&P 500 is actually coming off back-to-back 20%+ gains in both 2023 and 2024. And as of Friday, the benchmark index closed at 6,715.79, barely higher on the day but enough to etch another record into its YTD climb. Analysts project 7,000 by December, ignore shutdown Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, doesn’t see the rally stalling out anytime soon. He told clients this week he expects the S&P 500 to reach 7,000 by December, which would be at least 4% higher than Thursday’s closing level. Tom said the U.S. government shutdown, which stretched into its third day on Friday, wasn’t a concern for markets: “It’s had little impact on stocks in the past,” he wrote. Tom called the postponed release of the September nonfarm payrolls report a “sidebar issue.” That report was scheduled for Friday but got delayed because of the funding lapse. Investors instead focused on other signals, including a report from the Institute for Supply Management, which showed the services employment index shrank for the fourth straight month. That slowdown gave traders more confidence that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are still on the table. Even though the shutdown didn’t move the S&P 500 much this week, Tom did caution that a longer lapse in federal funding could eventually weigh on stocks. He also warned that a spike in investor excitement might become a problem. If too many people pile into stocks at once, he said, there could be no one left to buy and push prices higher later. That could freeze the rally right when people think it’s unstoppable. Dow and S&P 500 close at record highs, Nasdaq slips While the S&P 500 barely moved Friday, it still finished with a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 238.56 points, or 0.51%, to end at 46,758.28, also hitting a new closing high. The Nasdaq Composite wasn’t as lucky. It dropped 63.54 points, or 0.28%, closing at 22,780.51. Beneath the surface, there were some sharp moves. Applied Materials slumped by 2.7% after the chip-equipment maker said Thursday night that it expects a $600 million hit to its 2026 revenue. The tech sector took a hit overall, dragging on the Nasdaq’s performance. Tesla stock fell by 1.4%, showing weakness in big-name growth stocks. But utilities stocks ran in the opposite direction, up by 1.2% on the day, leading the sector gains inside the S&P 500. Despite the noise, the full week looked strong across the board. The Dow added 1.1%, matching the S&P 500’s 1.1% gain, while the Nasdaq closed out the week with a 1.3% rise. That capped off a bullish start to Q4, with the S&P 500 still grinding higher and holding its most perfect track record.

Liquidity inflows surged: $1.1B added in September, $5.9B since March Stablecoin supply rose by $4.42B since June, topping $14.8B 30-day trading volume reached $125.62B; perpetuals contributed $43.61B Meta description: Solana market outlook: liquidity inflows, TVL and stablecoin supply surge—key signals for SOL traders. Read the concise market summary and takeaways. What is Solana’s current market outlook? Solana market outlook is currently positive, driven by rising TVL, strong stablecoin supply inflows and elevated trading volumes. These on-chain signals point to increased network usage and investor accumulation, suggesting a higher probability of near-term upside for SOL without implying guaranteed price direction. Why are liquidity inflows rising on Solana? Liquidity inflows have accelerated as users deposit capital into Solana-based protocols, lifting Total Value Locked (TVL). In September alone, on-chain inflows added roughly $1.1 billion , and cumulative additions since March total about $5.9 billion (DeFiLlama data). Higher TVL typically indicates stronger protocol engagement and capital commitment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana market outlook: Liquidity inflows, TVL and stablecoin supply surge"", ""description"": ""Solana market outlook is positive as liquidity inflows, stablecoin supply and trading volumes increase, signaling stronger investor confidence in SOL."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://COINOTAG.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.17.42.png"" } }, ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.17.42.png"" ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana seeing real inflows or just transient volume?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Data shows sustained deposits: $1.1B added in September and $5.9B since March, plus growing stablecoin supply and rising TVL, indicating more persistent capital commitment rather than only transient volume spikes."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain metrics confirm investor interest in Solana?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key metrics include Total Value Locked growth, a $4.42B rise in stablecoin supply since June, $125.62B 30-day trading volume, and bridge netflows climbing from $23.29B in March to $44.03B at press time."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Solana inflows and volume"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess whether Solana's inflows and volume signal durable network growth."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check TVL trends"", ""text"": ""Compare month-over-month TVL to confirm sustained deposit growth rather than short-term spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Review stablecoin supply"", ""text"": ""Evaluate stablecoin inflows as a proxy for available trading liquidity and capital on the network."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Analyze trading volumes and derivatives"", ""text"": ""Confirm whether DEX and perpetual volumes are increasing in line with on-chain activity to validate broader market engagement."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How much liquidity was added to Solana in September? September saw approximately $1.1 billion of inflows on Solana, reflecting increased deposits into protocols and stronger on-chain capital allocation according to available on-chain analytics data. How large is Solana’s current stablecoin supply increase? Stablecoin supply on Solana rose by about $4.42 billion from a June low of $10.47 billion, pushing total supply above $14.8 billion . In the last seven days, roughly $1.445 billion in stablecoins were added. Liquidity inflow spikes across the market Month-over-month liquidity inflows into Solana have accelerated, driven by higher deposits into DeFi protocols and increased stablecoin balances. Growing TVL indicates capital is being committed to the network’s ecosystem. Since March, roughly $5.9 billion has been added to Solana’s ecosystem (DeFiLlama data). These figures support the view that network usage is expanding and investor interest is rising. Source: DeFiLlama Volume surge on exchanges Exchange volume on Solana has climbed markedly. Over the last 30 days, Solana recorded approximately $125.62 billion in trading volume, led by decentralized exchanges and derivatives trading. Perpetual exchanges accounted for about $43.61 billion of that volume, highlighting rapid growth in Solana-based derivative markets and deeper liquidity pools on DEXs. Source: DeFiLlama Investors shifting to Solana Investor flows also point to accumulation. Bridge netflow data shows a recovery from a March low of $23.29 billion to roughly $44.03 billion at press time, suggesting assets are being bridged into Solana at a faster pace. Source: DeFiLlama These inflows and on-chain engagement metrics suggest investors are increasingly viewing Solana as a platform for capital deployment and trading activity rather than a transient speculative destination. Comparative summary Metric Recent Level Significance Total Value Locked (TVL) + $5.9B since March Shows capital commitment to protocols Stablecoin supply > $14.8B (up $4.42B since June) Indicates available liquidity for trading 30-day trading volume $125.62B Reflects active market participation Bridge netflows $44.03B Signals cross-chain asset migration into Solana Key Takeaways On-chain inflows are strong : TVL and stablecoin supply increases point to sustained capital deployment. Trading activity is elevated : High 30-day volumes and significant perpetual trading highlight robust market depth. Investor behavior favors accumulation : Bridge netflows and deposit trends imply confidence in Solana’s ecosystem. Conclusion Solana’s current market outlook is constructive: rising TVL, a surge in stablecoin supply and record trading volumes together indicate stronger network usage and investor accumulation. Market participants should monitor on-chain metrics and derivative flows for confirmation, while staying mindful of overall market risk.

New Era Is Upon Us,https://timestabloid.com/biggest-xrp-news-in-last-few-years-new-era-is-upon-us/,"The XRP community is reacting to a major announcement that signals a significant change in leadership at Ripple. David Schwartz, the company’s long-serving Chief Technology Officer, has confirmed that he will step down from his role at the end of the year . After more than a decade of shaping the technical foundation of the XRP Ledger , Schwartz will no longer be responsible for the day-to-day tasks of the position. Mason Versluis Highlights the Shift Crypto enthusiast Mason Versluis addressed the development in a post accompanied by a video, presenting it as one of the most important updates surrounding XRP in recent years. In his remarks, Versluis underscored Schwartz’s influence as the creator and primary architect of the XRP Ledger. Biggest $XRP news in the last few years?! New era is upon us! pic.twitter.com/IxxNe4bwWl — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) October 1, 2025 He explained that the decision marks the end of a 13-year tenure but stressed that Schwartz made it clear he is not leaving the XRP community altogether. Instead, he indicated that he is exploring different ways to remain engaged, suggesting an ongoing relationship with the ecosystem. Versluis described the transition as evidence that XRP is entering a new era. He argued that the departure does not necessarily represent a setback for holders, unless Schwartz were to take his expertise to competing blockchain networks such as Algorand or Hedera. In that scenario, Versluis noted, XRP would face more direct competition from projects benefiting from Schwartz’s technical contributions. Nonetheless, his overall stance emphasized continuity and long-term commitment, reaffirming his personal decision to remain invested after holding XRP for seven years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses to the Announcement The news prompted commentary from within the XRP community, including users who noted that Schwartz will still hold a position on Ripple’s board. One observer pointed out that this typically involves a non-disclosure agreement, ensuring that sensitive information remains within the company. This detail added another dimension to the announcement, suggesting that Schwartz’s influence and oversight will not disappear even as he steps back from daily operations. The combination of a formal departure from the CTO role with the retention of a board position highlights a balance between transition and continuity. While some may interpret the move as a signal of change, others view it as a natural progression for someone who has been in a key leadership position for decades. Schwartz’s long history in cryptography, including consulting for government agencies and observing the early stages of Bitcoin, reinforces the perception that his expertise will remain valuable in whatever capacity he chooses to engage. For many, this represents a chance for new leadership to emerge while maintaining a degree of stability through Schwartz’s continued involvement.

ETF inflows: $58B total, $23B this year, $20B expected before year-end Standard Chartered cites institutional demand, adoption pace, and market sentiment as primary catalysts. Bitcoin recently cleared $120,000 and historical Q4 performance supports upside seasonality. Bitcoin price prediction: Standard Chartered sees a new all-time high soon—learn why institutional ETF flows and adoption may push BTC higher. Read the latest outlook. What is Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin price prediction? Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin price prediction is that Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the near term and close 2025 around $200,000. The bank’s outlook is based on institutional spot ETF inflows, adoption trends, and persistent bullish sentiment despite macro uncertainty. How does institutional ETF money support the Bitcoin rally? Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted roughly $58 billion in total inflows, with $23 billion arriving this year alone. Standard Chartered expects an additional $20 billion before year-end, which would increase demand and reduce available supply, providing upward pressure on price. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Set to Break Records Next Week, Predicts Standard Chartered"", ""description"": ""Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin could hit $135,000 soon and potentially $200,000 by year-end, citing strong spot ETF inflows and adoption."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-set-to-break-records-next-week"" }} Why does Standard Chartered expect a new all-time high? Standard Chartered points to three primary drivers: sustained institutional demand via spot ETFs, accelerating adoption, and favorable seasonality for Q4. Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research, notes the market is “primed for another surge” as ETFs funnel capital into Bitcoin. When have ETF inflows historically impacted price? Historically, major inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs correlate with periods of price strength because ETFs provide an on-ramp for institutional capital. With $58 billion in cumulative ETF inflows to date, the scale of demand is materially larger than several prior cycles. Frequently Asked Questions How likely is Bitcoin to reach $135,000 next week? Standard Chartered models suggest a near-term push toward $135,000 driven by fresh ETF allocations and sentiment. While probability cannot be guaranteed, the bank cites measurable ETF inflows and market structure as the basis for the projection. Will Bitcoin reach $200,000 by the end of 2025? Standard Chartered maintains a $200,000 year-end scenario based on continued institutional adoption and additional ETF inflows. This is a forecast, not a certainty, and depends on sustained demand and macro conditions. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is Standard Chartered's Bitcoin price prediction?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the near term and has reiterated a $200,000 year-end target, citing strong spot ETF inflows and adoption as key drivers."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much have spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in so far?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $58 billion in cumulative inflows, with approximately $23 billion arriving this year and an additional $20 billion expected before year-end."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin price predictions from institutional reports"", ""description"": ""A short guide to reading institutional Bitcoin forecasts and the key signals to watch."", ""totalTime"": ""PT5M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check the institutional thesis"", ""text"": ""Identify whether the forecast is driven by demand-side factors such as ETF inflows, adoption, or supply dynamics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify cited data"", ""text"": ""Confirm figures like ETF inflows, custody flows, or on-chain metrics when available as quantitative support for forecasts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess market context"", ""text"": ""Consider macro risk, liquidity conditions, and seasonality which can amplify or mute forecast outcomes."" } ]} Key Takeaways Institutional flows matter : Spot ETFs have driven $58B in cumulative inflows, underpinning price support.

Seasonality and sentiment : Historical Q4 performance and renewed bullish sentiment are supportive but not guarantees. Conclusion Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin price prediction frames a constructive outlook built on substantial spot ETF inflows and adoption momentum. While forecasts of $135,000 and $200,000 by year-end reflect a bullish scenario, investors should weigh model assumptions and market risks.

BlackRock’s interest in the company grew after a report from reliable sources revealed that Aligned Data Centres successfully raised $12 billion. Notably, this is more than what several leading AI startups have gathered in a single funding round. This fundraising aimed to significantly expand the company’s footprint amid growing demand for facilities that support AI systems. This deal could become one of the largest transactions of the year and possibly the largest ever for any data centre firm. The The BlackRock-owned company is also in advanced-stage talks to buy utility firm AES in a deal that could be valued at over $40 billion. BlackRock to strike a deal with Aligned Data Centres in the AI boom era Sources familiar with the situation have noted that BlackRock’s acquisition plans highlight the eagerness of investors to make substantial investments in firms considered crucial for the AI surge. To support this claim, AI-related businesses have already generated $141 billion in corporate credit this year, exceeding a total debt of $127 billion encountered last year, according to Goldman Sachs’s report dated Thursday, October 2. Meanwhile, as tech companies uphold their commitment to invest hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in physical infrastructure for AI, there is an escalating need for firms like Aligned that can fulfil these demands. This remains a fact even though Aligned is still planning for most of its data centre capacity and setting targets for the income it will generate. Ari Klein, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, weighed in on the matter, noting that Aligned has “several activities planned.” He added that companies are prepared to invest further in these initiatives and the opportunities they may create. Founded in 2013, roughly ten years before the era of generative AI, Aligned has always prioritised the establishment of custom data centres for businesses, focusing on efficiency and sustainability. The company’s website revealed that it receives a strong support system from Macquarie Asset Management and manages or is creating 78 data centres across the Americas. Aligned intends to build bigger and more numerous data centres Like other data centre providers, Aligned has encountered new pressure to build numerous data centres over the past years as AI becomes increasingly adopted. In January, Aligned said it had raised $12 billion in equity and debt financing to expedite its efforts to construct 5 gigawatts of data centre capacity — enough power to run half New York City on a hot day. In a social media post at the time, Andrew Schaap, CEO of Aligned Data Centres, mentioned that this investment aimed to help the company capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-ready infrastructure. “Aligned is ready to seize this opportunity,” he said. However, the main challenge is that building data centres of the required infrastructure takes time, including power supplies. Today, Aligned has more than 600 megawatts of operational data centre capacity, and another 700 megawatts under construction, according to the firm DC Byte, which tracks the market. Despite this, DC Byte founder Edward Galvin noted that Aligned still operates on a decent-sized scale.

52642713,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827096,1759554900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52642713.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: Why Analysts Believe BNB And LBRETT Are Set To Outshine SOL,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-analysts-believe-bnb-and-lbrett-are-set-to-outshine-sol/,"The crypto market is buzzing again and a fresh Solana price prediction has traders debating whether SOL can hold its ground or if other projects will surge past it. While Solana’s speed and developer activity remain impressive, analysts argue its dominance may be challenged by both BNB and Layer Brett (LBRETT) — a meme-fuelled Ethereum Layer 2 that has already raised over $4.2 million at just $0.0058 per token . For many retail investors, LBRETT represents the type of low-entry, high-reward play that once made early SOL backers millions. Solana price prediction split At the time of writing, SOL trades around $180 after a period of volatility. Some bullish projections suggest the token could test the $220 mark in Q4, driven by strong NFT volumes and institutional adoption. Still, every Solana price prediction comes with caveats — network congestion, outages and stiff competition could keep SOL capped, with some traders even suggesting a retrace toward $150 if momentum fades. Others remain convinced that the network’s transaction speed and developer base could push it toward new highs in 2025. SOL has always attracted speculative capital but the market is no longer just about speed. Investors want scalability, real-world use cases and liquidity. If Solana can’t address its historic downtime issues, its rivals could draw away significant portions of retail and institutional flows. Why BNB remains relevant Despite regulatory hurdles, Binance Coin (BNB) has been notably resilient. BNB has held above the $500 zone in recent weeks, and multiple BNB price trackers now point to the $600 level as a key resistance. Binance’s global exchange presence, ecosystem expansion and token burns continue to support demand. For some holders, the combination of utility and scarcity means BNB still has a strong case as one of the leading altcoins for the next rally. The fact that it’s the backbone of the Binance Smart Chain also ensures constant demand for BNB, keeping it relevant no matter how the broader market shifts. The rise of Layer Brett (LBRETT) While SOL and BNB are household names, newer entrants like Layer Brett are stealing attention. The project has raised more than $4.2 million in presale funding and offers staking rewards of around 616% APY at the time of writing — though these will decline as more wallets join. Its roadmap includes gamified staking, NFT rollouts, cross-chain bridging and a $1 million giveaway, setting it apart from many meme-driven tokens that lack utility. Accessibility has also helped LBRETT gain traction. Investors can connect a wallet and buy using ETH or USDT in minutes, making it easy for first-timers to get involved. Social media traction is another driver: Telegram communities are buzzing, X threads about Layer Brett are going viral and TikTok mentions are climbing fast. Some traders have even described it as the “escape from Base,” referencing how it upgrades the Brett meme into a full-featured Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. For many, this mix of meme energy and tangible utility is why analysts now believe LBRETT could deliver outsized returns compared to both SOL and BNB. The takeaway A bullish Solana price prediction sees SOL retesting its highs, while BNB remains a steady blue-chip pick. But for those chasing true multiples, Layer Brett may offer the most exciting path forward. With its presale still live at $0.0058, millions raised already and staking above 600% APY, it’s positioned as one of the most compelling altcoin opportunities heading into 2025. Don’t miss out — bag your LBRETT tokens today before the presale ends.

XRP holds $1.93 support while consolidating near the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $3.25. Oscillators reading 70–75 show sustained momentum but allow short-term pullbacks. Recurring accumulation–consolidation–breakout cycles place $6.26 and $21.71 as sequential technical targets. XRP price prediction: consolidation at 1.272 Fibonacci $3.25 with $6.26 next — read key levels and action items now. XRP consolidates above key Fibonacci support as analysts note recurring cycle patterns targeting $6 to $21. XRP holds $1.93 support while consolidating near the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $3.25 ahead of major resistance. Oscillator readings near 70–75 indicate strong momentum, resembling levels seen before previous cycle peaks. XRP’s recurring accumulation, consolidation, breakout pattern suggests $6.26 as the next technical checkpoint. XRP is trading in a decisive consolidation range following a breakout above long-term resistance, with analyst MikyBull Crypto outlining targets between $6 and $21. That view is derived from a Fibonacci expansion setup plus a recurring multi-cycle structure that historically precedes large uptrends. What is the current XRP consolidation above Fibonacci telling traders? The XRP consolidation above the 1.272 Fibonacci extension near $3.25 signals that prior resistance around $1.93 has flipped to support, providing a base for the next technical move. This setup often precedes measured extensions to the 1.618 ($6.26) and 2.272 ($21.71) levels. How reliable are the Fibonacci extensions for XRP targets? Fibonacci extensions are a common technical tool used to estimate target zones after a breakout. For XRP, the 1.0 level acted as resistance near $1.938 and has become support. The 1.272 extension around $3.25 is the current consolidation plane; 1.618 and 2.272 provide sequential targets. Why does momentum matter for XRP’s next leg up? Momentum gauges whether the market has the strength to reach those Fibonacci targets. Oscillator readings between 70–75 imply sustained buying pressure similar to pre-peak conditions in prior cycles, though values above 80 historically accompanied cycle tops in 2017 and 2024. How should traders interpret oscillator readings now? Readings near 70–75 typically indicate active momentum with room to run. Traders should expect periodic cooling—short pullbacks inside an uptrend—while monitoring support at $1.93 and the 50-day SMA for structural health. Source: Steph is Crypto on X The multi-cycle pattern that appeared in 2014, 2020 and 2024 — accumulation, consolidation, breakout — is visible again. Price is stabilizing above the 50-day simple moving average in the $2.60–$3.20 band, a common pivot used historically to time expansions. When could XRP reach the 1.618 extension near $6.26? Timing depends on momentum persistence and macro catalysts. If current momentum continues into late 2025 or early 2026, the 1.618 extension at $6.26 is a plausible near-term checkpoint before any larger Fibonacci expansions play out. What risk management should traders use around these levels? Use defined stop levels under $1.93 support and consider scaled position sizing ahead of the 1.618 resistance. Monitor oscillators for extreme readings and watch the 50-SMA for structural confirmation to avoid being caught by short-term pullbacks. Frequently Asked Questions What is the short-term XRP price target based on this setup? The short-term technical target is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension near $6.26, assuming momentum holds and support at $1.93 remains intact. How do cycle patterns influence XRP forecasts? Recurring accumulation–consolidation–breakout cycles historically led to large moves. With XRP following the same sequence, analysts view current consolidation as a preparatory phase for further expansion. Key Takeaways Support and structure : $1.93 acts as key support after reclaiming the 1.0 Fibonacci extension. Momentum : Oscillators around 70–75 show strength but allow short pullbacks inside the uptrend. Targets : 1.618 at $6.26 is the next technical checkpoint; longer-term Fibonacci points toward $21.71. Conclusion Overall, the XRP price prediction based on Fibonacci alignment and recurring cycle structure points to $6.26 as the immediate technical checkpoint, with longer-term expansions toward $21.71 possible if momentum persists. Traders should monitor $1.93 support, the 50-SMA and oscillator readings for confirmation and manage risk accordingly.

This happened as the SEC announced that:- “Effective October 1 and until further notice, the agency will have a very limited number of staff members available. The SEC has staff available to respond to emergency situations with a focus on the market integrity and investor protection components of our mission.” That notice meant that ETF filings would move forward or stall depending on the law, not on active review. Crypto strategist Chad Steingraber captured the point clearly when he posted :- “The Teucrium XRP ETF was not approved by the SEC directly. They reached the deadline and the SEC didn’t ‘approve or deny’ the listing. So it was automatically allowed. ‘Silence is compliance.’” SEC leaves futures-style ETFs running while shutdown freezes spot crypto funds Financial journalist Eleanor Terrett explained why this happened. Teucrium’s product holds Treasuries, cash, and swap receivables and was filed under the 40 Act, which means the SEC didn’t need to approve it actively. Eleanor added that the Commission typically lets futures-style ETFs go effective after the statutory waiting period passes. By contrast, spot crypto ETFs are filed under the 33 Act as commodity trusts and need explicit approval before trading, which will not happen until the shutdown ends and the agency returns to full capacity. That breakdown shows the dividing line. Futures-style ETFs can run on autopilot after the statutory time limit, but spot products like XRP under the 33 Act can’t trade until SEC staff review and declare the registration effective. Because the agency is on limited operations, those S‑1s are not being processed. Meanwhile, the SEC’s own notice said all non-excepted employees are subject to furlough, official travel is canceled or postponed, training during the appropriations lapse must be canceled or postponed, and paid leave is voided. Any employee excepted must report for duty, but if they are sick their status would be furloughed. The agency emphasized that employees who have not been designated as excepted may not volunteer to work without pay, saying that such voluntary services “are a violation of the Antideficiency Act and will not be permitted under any circumstances.” Crypto issuers file dozens of ETFs while SEC stays frozen Despite the freeze, filings keep piling up. More than 30 crypto ETF applications hit the SEC this week. REX-Osprey filed prospectuses for 21 crypto funds on October 3, and Defiance lodged six more the same day. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart posted about the filings on X, saying that REX-Osprey’s lineup covers single-asset strategies tied to AAVE, ADA, ATOM, and ENA, some with staking features. Defiance’s submissions included six leveraged funds. Three were long on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and three offered short exposure. All six aim for 3x leverage. Seyffart commented that “3x isn’t really allowed by the new leveraged ETP rules,” saying the issuer appears to be “targeting” 3x through options to get around the standard 2x cap. This is all coming after the SEC approved generic listing standards for crypto-related exchange-traded products on September 17 across Cboe, Nasdaq, and NYSE Arca, as Cryptopolitan reported . Those rules were meant to speed up spot crypto listings by removing 19b‑4 approvals and moving the bottleneck to the S‑1 filings. Fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on September 29 that altcoin ETF approvals are “really 100% now,” because the old 19b‑4 “clock” is moot and S‑1s just need Corp Fin’s green light. But now, as Eric put it, “everything is on ice… it’s like a rain delay,” and issuers must wait until the agency reopens.

Many analysts believe LILPEPE could deliver up to 8000% gains for early buyers if all goes well after its exchange launch. Solana (SOL) Shows Steady Strength Solana has become one of the top networks for building decentralised apps. As of writing, SOL trades at $195. The price has pulled back slightly in recent weeks, but analysts say that has helped reset momentum indicators like the RSI, leaving room for a fresh rally. Developers continue to launch new DeFi and gaming projects on Solana. The announcement that CME Group plans to offer Solana futures in 2025 has also excited traders, as it could bring more institutional money into SOL. Analysts believe SOL could move into the $300 to $350 range next year if market conditions improve and demand for Solana’s network keeps growing. Dogecoin (DOGE) Holds Its Meme Crown As of writing, Dogecoin is priced at $0.22. After months of consolidation, its technical charts show that momentum could return. Large holders have been steadily adding DOGE to their wallets, a pattern that often comes before upward moves. Speculation about a potential Dogecoin ETF and its inclusion in some institutional products has given DOGE a more serious investment angle than in previous years. If buying pressure increases and market sentiment improves, analysts see room for DOGE to reach between $0.35 and $0.40, with some more bullish forecasts pushing closer to $0.50. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Leads with Fresh Momentum The most talked-about newcomer is Little Pepe, a project that mixes meme culture with real blockchain infrastructure. Instead of launching as just another meme token, LILPEPE is building a Layer 2 network that enables faster and cheaper trading of meme tokens. It is also sniper-bot-resistant, which means early investors are protected from whales grabbing the supply at launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is in stage 13 of its presale, priced at $0.0022. The presale has raised over $26 million and is already 93% sold out. Early investors from stage 1 have seen about 120% gains before the token has even launched. The presale price will rise again in the next stage as demand keeps growing. Community incentives have been a major driver of growth. The project is running a 777k giveaway with more than 406,000 entries. Additionally, the Mega Giveaway, which runs through stages 12 to 17, has attracted over 72,000 participants. These campaigns have created buzz and strengthened the community ahead of its upcoming CEX listings. Because LILPEPE will launch with a near-zero market cap, every dollar of new buying pressure could outsize its price. That is a big advantage over older coins like SOL and DOGE, which already have large market caps. Bullish Projection for 2025 If the presale momentum continues at its current listings and the community continues to expand, analysts believe LILPEPE could rise as high as 8,000% from its current presale price. An 8000% increase would increase the price to $0.18 from $0.0022. At the current price, roughly 45,454 tokens would be purchased with a $100 investment. That $100 would be worth $8,100 if the token hit $0.18. Conclusion: How to Buy LILPEPE Among the three cryptos, Solana and Dogecoin remain strong, established names, but Little Pepe offers the kind of high-upside story that appeals to early adopters. With the presale price already up 120% and analysts eyeing an 8000% gain potential, it is capturing attention as the one to watch in 2025. To Buy LILPEPE Before The Presale Ends: Visit the Little Pepe website . Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask. Ensure you have ETH or USDT available in the wallet. Choose how many LILPEPE tokens you want to buy. Confirm the transaction on the presale page. After the presale concludes and the token lists on exchanges are complete, claim your tokens through the website. With a starting price of $0.0022 and a potential move to $0.18 if it reaches the 8000% target, early buyers have a clear opportunity to position themselves before the presale concludes.

Cycle defined by emotion and halving events Institutional flows may reduce—but not eliminate—cyclical swings Analysts cite October as a possible 2025 peak if historical patterns repeat Bitcoin four-year cycle: understand halving-driven patterns and what institutional adoption means for price action — read expert takeaways and timing insights. Gemini APAC head Saad Ahmed says Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is rooted in human emotion and may persist, even as institutions reshape volatility and peak dynamics. What is the Bitcoin four-year cycle? Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to recurrent market phases linked to the halving schedule and investor sentiment, producing bull and bear periods roughly every four years. The pattern mixes supply-side shocks from halvings with waves of retail optimism and correction, creating observable peaks and troughs. A senior crypto executive argued the cycle is driven less by deterministic timing and more by recurring human behavior. Saad Ahmed, Gemini’s head of APAC, told Cointelegraph at Token2049 that excitement, overextension and subsequent corrections form the core mechanism behind the pattern. Saad Ahmed spoke to Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Singapore. Source: Cointelegraph How could institutional involvement change the Bitcoin cycle? Institutional participation tends to add liquidity and longer-term capital, which can reduce short-term volatility. Ahmed said growing institutional involvement can “help the market absorb some of the volatility,” meaning cycles may become smoother though cycles themselves may persist. Data points referenced by market analysts support this: crypto analytics firm Glassnode noted recent price action may still track the historical halving cycle, while other observers argue institutional flows are changing amplitude rather than eliminating cyclical structure. When might the next Bitcoin cycle peak occur? Some analysts point to October as a probable peak month if 2024–2025 price action mirrors past cycles. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital estimated a potential October peak approximately 550 days after the April 2024 halving. Short-term performance supports momentum: BTC rose significantly over recent weeks, with market trackers reporting gains near all-time highs. Historical seasonality also matters: Q4 has been Bitcoin’s strongest quarter since 2013 on average, which can amplify late-year rallies. Frequently Asked Questions Does the four-year cycle always repeat? No. The four-year cycle is a recurring historical pattern influenced by halving events and investor psychology, but timing and magnitude can vary due to macro, regulatory, and institutional factors. What drives the largest swings in the cycle? Major drivers include the halving-induced reduction in miner-issued supply, waves of retail sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and the pace of institutional adoption—each affecting liquidity and price discovery. How should investors interpret cycle signals? Use a mix of on-chain metrics, macro context, and risk management. Look for divergences in supply metrics and broker-inflow trends, and avoid assuming exact repeat timing of past cycles. Key Takeaways Cycle persistence : Patterns likely continue in some form, driven by emotion and halving mechanics. Institutional impact : Greater institutional involvement can dampen volatility but not fully erase cycles. Timing signals : Analysts cite October as a potential peak window; historical seasonality favors Q4 strength. Conclusion Bitcoin’s four-year cycle remains a useful framework for understanding broad market rhythm. While institutional flows and evolving market structure may smooth extremes, experts including Saad Ahmed believe the human-driven dynamics that create cycles will persist. Monitor on-chain data and institutional activity to gauge how the cycle may unfold in the coming months. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-four-year-cycle-expert-opinion"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-four-year-cycle-expert-opinion"" }, ""headline"": ""Crypto Executive: Bitcoin Four-Year Cycle Likely to Persist as Institutions Reduce Volatility"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199adab-46aa-7aaa-bee6-e86910f4f4b0.jpeg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Gemini APAC head Saad Ahmed says Bitcoin's four-year cycle is rooted in human emotion and may persist, even as institutions reshape volatility and peak dynamics."" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does the four-year cycle always repeat?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The four-year cycle is a recurring pattern influenced by halvings and investor emotion, but timing and magnitude vary with macro and institutional factors."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How could institutional involvement change the Bitcoin cycle?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutional flows add liquidity and longer-term capital, which can reduce short-term volatility and alter cycle amplitude while leaving cyclical mechanics intact."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When might the next cycle peak occur?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Some analysts estimate an October peak if historical patterns repeat; market seasonality and on-chain metrics should be monitored for confirmation."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin cycle signals"", ""description"": ""A brief guide to reading cycle indicators using on-chain data, market sentiment, and institutional flows."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check halving schedule"", ""text"": ""Note the most recent halving date and expected supply impact, since halvings historically precede bull phases."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Observe supply held by long-term holders, exchange balances, and realized price metrics for divergence signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess institutional activity"", ""text"": ""Track inflows to institutional products and custody adoption as indicators of reduced short-term volatility."" } ] } ]}",Bitcoin|Guides|News|BTC|Core,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-04 05:35:54

Based on Ethereum’s current prices, the sale comes to roughly $4.51 million. The EF added that the 1,000 ETH sale will occur via CoWSwap, utilizing a TWAP strategy to minimise market disturbance and support its DeFi-centric mission. The platform announced on X, “The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via CoWSwap’s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi.” The Ethereum Foundation had planned a sale of 10000 ETH in September The EF’s announcement did not specify which stablecoins it would receive in the swap. The move also appears separate from the foundation’s earlier plan to convert 10,000 ETH into stablecoins, since Friday’s $4.5M sale was smaller and will be carried out via CoW Swap rather than a centralized exchange. The foundation has maintained that its treasury policy seeks a middle ground between earning yields above standard benchmarks and serving as a responsible steward of Ethereum, with an emphasis on DeFi. With the new planned sale, the foundation aims to establish consistent funding for research, grants, and contributions. It also seeks to protect its budget against the instability of crypto by converting ETH into assets based on fiat. The stablecoin move comes at a time when the EF redirected attention to internal changes—pausing grant submissions to the Ecosystem Support Program to handle demand, appointing two co-executive directors, Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak, in April, and restructuring staff and dev teams in June. Currently, EF’s operating costs are set at 15% of its treasury each year, with a runway of two and a half years. EF intends to gradually scale down its expenses to about 5% of the treasury According to industry figures, Ethereum currently holds 68% of DeFi’s locked-up value and remains the top player, although it faces challenges from its rivals. Ethereum DeFi’s total value locked had also surpassed $100 billion by the end of September, delivering its highest daily measurement since early 2022. Now, building on that dominance, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has emphasized the importance of DeFi as a focus for Ethereum, stating that “low-risk” applications could generate predictable income in much the same way Google Search generates revenue for Google. “Low-risk DeFi can and should play a similar role for Ethereum,” he said, noting that in the future, this could help to mitigate arguments within Ethereum over whether or not revenue-generating apps can be true to the project’s vision. Over the next five years, EF also plans to gradually reduce spending before stabilising it at around 5% of the treasury, in line with endowment-style models, which will provide stability and independence. The transition is meant to provide greater financial predictability while preserving Ethereum’s independence. Some observers view EF’s recent ETH sales as further evidence of the ecosystem’s increasing fiscal prudence. Buterin still believes that Ethereum could surpass Google by combining decentralization with ethical finance, allowing DeFi to balance profit and principles. He commented, “The revenue generator does not have to be the most revolutionary or exciting application of Ethereum. But it does need to be something that is at least not actively unethical or not embarrassing.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Prices decline, sentiment hits bottom, and opportunities seem to disappear. But the history of highs and lows shows that the best crypto gains aren’t during the euphoric giddy-ups, but during the silent times when most have given up. The trick is learning to adjust strategies, preserve capital, and still identify growing opportunities when the market sentiment is down. Even though the recent months have been challenging for traders, there is still hope that one can accumulate wealth in the meantime, with upcoming projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE perhaps being an example of this. While there are no guarantees in the crypto market, here are three well-proven strategies to make investors profitable even during red markets. 1. Diversify Smartly Without Overstretching Diversification is a common investing strategy, but it must be approached carefully in the context of crypto. Too many investors spread their portfolios across dozens of tokens, then find themselves with exposure to coins that lose liquidity in bear markets and disappear altogether. Instead, one should be looking for a few good projects with sound fundamentals. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to act as stable anchors due to their long-term compounding and deep liquidity. Initially, it might be advisable to have a few altcoins with established ecosystems, like Cardano or Solana, for a balanced portfolio without excessive risk. The idea isn’t to chase every pump, but to ride assets that won’t die and will do well at the start of any new cycle. At the same time, leaving space for carefully selected new ventures is where some of the life-altering returns are found. This is where presales and early-stage tokens can create asymmetric opportunities when big players just can’t. 2. Focus on Fundamentals, Not Noise In a bear market, substance outweighs speculation. Tokens that spiked on hype always seem to pop, while technologies that have real utility continue to grow in the background. For investors, this is the time to sort long-term winners from short-term distractions. Look for tokens that provide solutions (scalability, DeFi, interoperability, new models of adoption). By studying developer activity, community development, and partnerships, one can often determine which projects are on the brink of the next expansion. In crypto, the riches go to those who learn when everyone is gripped by fear. A good illustration of this strategy paying off is Ethereum. Some investors bought Ethereum secretly in 2019 when it was trading at less than $200, well before the DeFi craze brought it to new highs. Those opportunities exist today if one can dig some depth beneath the surface. 3. Allocate to Early-Stage Winners Like MAGACOIN FINANCE While major cryptocurrency coins offer stability, presale opportunities offer the upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has smashed all early-stage fundraising records by raising $15.5 million-which has raised eyebrows amongst retail investors and analysts alike. This accounts for it selling out so fast, as well as the hype surrounding being only available in small quantities pre-sale. Considered by many to be one of the most promising new altcoins on the market, some analysts are predicting anywhere from 55x returns once the token starts trading on major exchanges. As opposed to existing coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, that are already at multi-billion-dollar market caps, MAGACOIN FINANCE has significantly more potential it has to grow from its starting point. This isn’t to say investors should go all in on a speculative token. But even a tiny percentage of a portfolio invested in ambitious ventures similar to MAGACOIN FINANCE can help get insight into lower returns and minimum exposure, especially in a bear market, when the prices of conventional assets are low. It’s all about dividing riskier, longer-term retirement and financial holdings with the riskier but more rewarding types of investments. Learning to Thrive in Bear Markets There is no doubt that bear markets are where the disciplined investor is rewarded. They weaken the mainstream, fail to spin off their own sustainable projects, opening the door for the next wave of adoption. For those who haven’t given up, they also present some of the best entry points in crypto. By balancing exposure to established assets with a carefully selected mix of early-stage gold, focusing on fundamentals rather than hype, and understanding the unique power behind presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can not only weather a downturn but prosper in it. Conclusion Bear markets challenge investors, but they’ll also pay off patient investors who have a clear strategy. At the core are the well-established coins Bitcoin and Ethereum, while emerging technologies such as Cardano and Solana provide growth opportunities in the ever-evolving space of blockchain solutions. Beyond that, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has so far raised a staggering $15.5 million from investors, have demonstrated that there is still potential for massive upside in even comparably adverse environments. Surviving a bear market while being profitable doesn’t come with luck-it necessitates smart positioning, patience, and an ability to navigate to where the real opportunities are found.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Exchange Inflows Have Shot Up In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the deposits being made by Bitcoin short-term holders to centralized exchanges. The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The STHs make up for one of the two main divisions of the network done on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the “long-term holders” (LTHs). Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Big Breakout Incoming? Analyst Calls To “Stay Alert” Historically, the former cohort has proven to include the weak hands of the market who panic sell whenever volatility emerges in the asset, while the latter is made up of the blockchain’s diamond hands. Bitcoin has witnessed a sharp rally over the past week that has taken it past the $122,000 level. Considering the nature of the STHs, it would be expected that they would be looking to take some profits. For LTHs, tracking selling can be simple because as soon as a member of the cohort breaks their dormancy, their coins exit the cohort and enter the STHs, as their age counter resets back to zero. It’s not quite as easy in the case of the STHs, however, as the group’s coins are constantly in motion within its members. One way to gauge STH selling is through their transactions to exchanges. Generally, one of the main reasons why investors use these centralized platforms is for trading-related purposes, so deposits to them can be an indication that there is demand for selling the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the exchange inflows coming from the Bitcoin STHs. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin STH deposits to exchanges have shot up alongside the latest price rally. The inflows that have spiked have specifically been the profit ones, with there being no loss deposits at all. Thus, it seems the buyers who got in during the price all-time high (ATH) are choosing to hold through this run. In total, the STHs have transferred 46,276 BTC over a 24-hour span during the latest run. At the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to a whopping $5.7 billion. The analyst notes that this is one of the largest spikes that the indicator has seen recently.

52643960,597403,1759557645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52643960.jpeg,SEC Silence Stalls Litecoin ETF Decision as LTC Price Holds Near Monthly Highs,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-silence-litecoin-etf-decision-ltc-price-holds/,"Litecoin (LTC) remains steady near its monthly highs despite new regulatory setbacks, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to act on Canary Capital’s proposed spot Litecoin STF. The deadline passed on Thursday without any update, leaving the much-anticipated product in limbo. The delay occurs at a crucial time for crypto ETFs, coinciding with a U.S. government shutdown that has hampered financial oversight and added to the complexity of the approval process. SEC Misses Deadline as Litecoin ETF Rules Shift The SEC was expected to decide on Canary’s application by Thursday, but no update was issued. Analysts observe that the delay may be due not only to the shutdown but also to a broader shift in how crypto ETFs are managed. Earlier this year, the SEC began phasing out the traditional 19b-4 filing process, which has been historically associated with strict deadlines, in favour of S-1 registration statements. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas argue this transition means old deadlines “no longer matter” under the regulator’s evolving framework. Instead, approval timelines may now depend on the SEC’s broader review of new listing standards, making the process less predictable. Shutdown Complicates ETF Reviews The U.S. government shutdown is intensifying the delays. Although the SEC continues with limited operations, its contingency plan, published in August, confirmed that reviewing new financial products, including ETF filings, would be paused during a shutdown. This has left Canary’s Litecoin ETF, along with several other altcoin-based products, in a holding pattern. Pending applications for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, and Dogecoin ETFs are among those affected. These would build on the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have already attracted more than $74 billion in inflows. However, Litecoin faces additional scrutiny, as its regulatory classification remains less clear than Bitcoin’s status as a commodity. Litecoin Price Remains Resilient Despite the regulatory uncertainty, Litecoin’s price has stayed resilient. At the time of writing, LTC was trading around $118, approaching a two-month high of $122. Analysts suggest that if the token can surpass resistance near $121, a new rally might be triggered. The consistent upward trend indicates investor confidence that approval is more a matter of timing rather than rejection. Market observers describe the SEC’s silence as more of a “rain delay” than a denial. Once the shutdown concludes and new listing standards are fully implemented, analysts expect the ETF decision process to speed up.

According to the chart, XRP is now in the “take-profit zone,” a range where previous cycles delivered significant returns for investors. Steph’s observation reflects how the asset has reached a historically significant stage within the cycle. XRP has shown strength against Bitcoin this year, and the current shift from Bitcoin season to Altcoin season on the chart positions XRP firmly within another bullish phase. The Take-Profit Zone The marked “take-profit zone” on the chart suggests an environment where XRP holders may consider securing gains after extended accumulations. Historically, these points often represented the culmination of upward momentum within the altcoin season before corrections followed.

The combination of current favorable market conditions , XRP’s positioning, and the repeating cycle of altcoin seasons establishes a moment of heightened interest. In July, XRP experienced a notable rally, rising to an all-time high of $3.65 in the middle of Bitcoin season. While XRP struggled to move in the past, the chart suggests that the current phase could align with outcomes seen during previous altcoin peaks, and a new surge in this season could send it to unprecedented heights.

Trading volumes for both tokens have surged as exchanges report heightened activity, and price swings on major platforms have pulled the broader market into sharper focus. XRP, backed by years of partnerships with payment networks, is pressing its case for streamlined cross-border transfers, while Zexpire promotes a model that removes intermediaries altogether. Analysts point to contrasting legal strategies, governance structures, and target user groups as catalysts for the unfolding rivalry, framing the contest as a decisive moment for how future money might move across borders. XRP’s Second Wind: Will the Speedy Digital Coin Race Past $3 Again Ripple’s native coin, XRP, powers a worldwide payment network that clears about 1,500 transfers every second and settles them in moments for only a fraction of a cent. Banks and remittance firms have embraced the system, attracted by its knack for shuttling both traditional money and other digital coins—such as Bitcoin—across borders in the blink of an eye. This swiftness stems from a streamlined approval process handled by chosen computers rather than energy-hungry mining, keeping the network both nimble and decentralized. Price action has been a roller-coaster: from fractions of a cent in 2013 to a record $3.84 in early 2018, down to below a dollar during regulatory turmoil, and back to $2.42 at the start of 2025. The recent courtroom win over the U.S. securities watchdog, capped by a $125 million fine instead of a multibillion-dollar hit, sparked a 26 percent rally and lifted spirits in the wider market. Compared with the slower yet more famous Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP trades at a discount to its own history while offering faster settlement times that appeal to banks searching for efficiency. First-Mover in Gamified Options Trading: Could ZX Be the Next HYPE? In crypto, the biggest gains often go to first movers in new categories. This cycle has already provided a valid example: HYPE, the token of Hyperliquid, rode the surge in derivatives trading and put on outsized returns for early holders. Zexpire is aiming to do the same — but in an even fresher niche. It’s the first 0DTE DeFi protocol that turns options trading into a simple, one-click daily play. One-Click Options, Fixed Risk Crypto options already see around $3 billion in daily volume, and prediction markets like Polymarket have pushed past $10 billion in cumulative bets. Zexpire combines the two, wrapping volatility trading into a format anyone can play. Zexpire removes the complexity of options trading: no more intimidating charts and Greeks. Just one question: Will BTC stay in range today, or break out? Click your choice and let the market play out. The risk is capped — you’ll never lose more than your stake. Be Among the First to Buy ZX Like HYPE for Hyperliquid, ZX is the Fuel of Zexpire Every play on Zexpire runs on its native token ZX, which is currently in seed access at just $0.003, stepping up stage by stage until it reaches $0.025 at listing. That structure means the earliest participants lock in the lowest entry point, while later buyers pay more. Beyond price, early buyers also get extras like staking yield before TGE, cashback perks, and beta access — benefits designed to reward the first wave of holders. First-Mover Advantage: Getting ZX Before It Explodes Every cycle has tokens that capture a new wave before the market catches on. HYPE did it with derivatives on Hyperliquid, turning early adoption into one of the cycle’s strongest narratives. Now $ZX is positioned to do the same for gamified options trading — a brand-new category that combines the growth of prediction markets with the simplicity of one-click plays. Early buyers secure the lowest entry point, while long-term holders stand to benefit from fee burns, buybacks, staking rewards, and platform perks that tighten supply and reward participation. Buy $ZX, the Next Breakout Token Conclusion Market watchers point to XRP as a proven tool for fast, low-cost transfers. Its long track record gives it weight in talks about the next phase of global payments. Yet attention is now shifting to Zexpire, billed as the first DeFi venue that flips volatility into gain. The contrast has set off lively debate about which model will guide the coming wave of digital finance. Zexpire lets users make a single click guess on whether Bitcoin will stay in range or break out each day. Losses are capped, with no liquidations or margin calls, turning sharp price moves into a clear earning path. Every play uses $ZX, whose fee cuts, buybacks, and fixed demand create early-buyer appeal. XRP represents a promising opportunity too, but the spotlight now rests on Zexpire’s push to turn the market’s biggest headache into its main reward.

XRP price rose 7% after large whale cohorts (100M–1B holders) added roughly 300 million XRP inside the $2.80–$2.82 band, creating a dense supply cluster. On-chain accumulation at that band triggered a short-lived supply squeeze that pushed price toward near-term resistance at $3.50–$3.60. How strong is the $2.80 support band? On-chain heatmaps show nearly 2 billion XRP concentrated in the $2.80–$2.82 range, making this the densest cost-basis zone. That concentration acts as a structural support level and a logical dip-buy region for institutional and retail HODLers. Data source mentions: Santiment (on-chain heatmaps), TradingView (price levels). Table: Q3 ROI comparison (top altcoins) Asset Q3 ROI XRP 27% DOGE 41% ETH Data shows larger swings; key support tested Why are whales stacking XRP now? Whales appear to be positioning ahead of potential Q4 momentum. Strategic accumulation at $2.80 reduces average cost and increases the probability of a supply-controlled breakout. On-chain signals show the biggest cohort’s holdings rose to ~9.48 billion XRP after the October buys, indicating conviction among smart-money participants. What resistance levels matter next? Key resistance sits at $3.50–$3.60. A clean break above that band, confirmed on higher timeframes, would validate the bullish setup and likely attract momentum traders. If price fails there, consolidation between $2.80 and $3.50 is the most probable near-term outcome. Source: Santiment Meanwhile, XRP’s price action on daily charts demonstrates repeated validation of $2.80 as support, which historically preceded breakout runs in risk-on markets. September’s volatility left XRP with the lowest Q3 ROI among top altcoins (27%), but large-cohort accumulation suggests participants are positioning for a potential comeback. Source: TradingView (XRP/USDT) Frequently Asked Questions Is the XRP rally driven by retail or whales? On-chain cohort data points to whale-led accumulation in the 100M–1B cohort, which added ~300M XRP at $2.80–$2.82. This smart-money move created a dense support band that likely amplified the 7% rally. When will XRP retest resistance at $3.50? Short-term price action suggests the $3.50–$3.60 band is the next major test. If buying volume sustains above $3.50 on daily closes, the market is more likely to pursue higher targets in Q4. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why is XRP up today?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""XRP rose after whale cohorts added ~300 million XRP at $2.80–$2.82, creating dense support and triggering a short-term supply squeeze that produced a 7% move toward $3.50 resistance."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the key support level for XRP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""$2.80–$2.82 is the densest cost-basis band on-chain and currently serves as the primary support and dip-buy zone for XRP."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to read XRP whale accumulation"", ""description"": ""Three-step process to interpret on-chain whale stacking and potential price implications for XRP."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Identify cohort buys"", ""text"": ""Check on-chain cohort data to see which whale classes increased holdings and the buy price bands."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Map supply clusters"", ""text"": ""Use cost-basis heatmaps to find dense supply bands that act as support or resistance."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Monitor breakouts"", ""text"": ""Watch for daily-close confirmation above resistance with volume to validate rally continuation."" } ]} Key Takeaways Whale accumulation : ~300M added at $2.80–$2.82, strengthening support.

Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to recurring market behavior tied to halving events that historically reduce miner issuance and often precede multi-year expansions. The pattern typically includes an accumulation phase, a sharp expansion toward a peak, and a correction — though recent cycles show greater variability. How does institutional involvement affect Bitcoin cycles? Increased institutional participation can moderate extreme swings by providing sustained demand through custody and long-term funds. Industry leaders note that while volatility will persist, institutional flows may reduce peak-to-trough amplitudes and extend the expansion phase. Saad Ahmed, head of APAC at Gemini, said cycles stem from human emotion: excitement leads to extensions and corrections. Analysts at analytics firms such as Glassnode have published data suggesting recent price action still aligns with long-term patterns. When might the current cycle peak? Some market commentators, including crypto analyst Rekt Capital, indicated a possible peak in October if the market follows a similar timeline to the 2020–2021 expansion. Historical seasonality shows Q4 has been strong for Bitcoin, with past data pointing to outsized returns in that quarter. Frequently Asked Questions Will the Bitcoin four-year cycle always predict price tops? The cycle is a heuristic, not a guaranteed predictor. It highlights recurring phases but cannot account for new macro shocks or structural market shifts; use it with on-chain and macro indicators for better context. How should investors factor cycles into strategy? Use the cycle framework for timing and risk management: scale positions during accumulation, reassess on sharp rallies, and employ stop-losses or hedges near historically late-stage expansion signs. What role do halving events play? Halving events reduce new Bitcoin supply and often precede extended bull phases by shifting supply dynamics. Historical patterns show halving-to-peak timelines can span several hundred days, but past performance is not a guarantee. Key Takeaways Cycle relevance : The Bitcoin four-year cycle remains a valuable framework for market phases. Institutional impact : Growing institutional flows may temper volatility and shift cycle timing. Watch October : Analysts cite October as a plausible peak if historical timelines repeat; monitor breadth and macro data. Conclusion The Bitcoin four-year cycle continues to offer a useful lens for market behavior, though its predictiveness can be altered by institutional participation and macro forces. Investors should combine cycle analysis with on-chain metrics, macro assessment, and risk controls — and track developments through Q4 as markets evolve.

Analysts Back This New ETH L2 Token For 160x Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-ada-in-2021-analysts-back-this-new-eth-l2-token-for-160x-gains/,"The last bull cycle minted fortunes for early ADA holders but a fresh Cardano price prediction suggests the next wave of big returns may not come from ADA itself. Instead, analysts are pointing toward a new Ethereum Layer 2 project, Layer Brett (LBRETT) , as the meme-fuelled contender with serious upside potential. With ADA trading under pressure, many investors are asking whether rotating into LBRETT could be the smarter play. ADA struggles to reclaim old highs The latest Cardano price prediction has split opinion. ADA is trading close to $0.60, a level many view as critical. Some bulls argue that strong development activity and ecosystem upgrades could lift ADA back above $0.70 in the coming months. However, bearish analysts warn that if the $0.55 support zone fails, ADA might drift into the low 40-cent range. For long-term holders, Cardano’s methodical, research-driven approach remains appealing but critics highlight its slower pace compared to rivals. In 2021, ADA surged from under $0.20 to over $3 — an incredible run. Yet repeating that feat may be harder this time around, with ADA now competing against faster, cheaper and more flexible blockchains. That’s why many Cardano price prediction reports now suggest muted returns compared to more speculative newcomers. Why ADA investors are looking elsewhere Despite ADA’s loyal community, capital tends to chase projects with momentum. Ethereum Layer 2s, Solana-based dApps and new meme coins have been grabbing headlines. ADA’s measured progress means it can sometimes look stale next to the breakneck pace of rivals. With ADA still struggling to break higher, some traders are choosing to rotate into emerging tokens where the potential upside looks far greater. Layer Brett (LBRETT) gaining traction This is where Layer Brett enters the conversation. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, LBRETT blends the viral appeal of memes with tangible utility. Its presale, priced at just $0.0058 , has already raised over $4.2 million. At the time of writing, staking rewards stand at around 616% APY — though they decline quickly as more buyers join, making early entry especially attractive. The roadmap goes far beyond memes. Planned features include NFT integrations, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging, all supported by a growing community. A teased $1 million giveaway has also added to the buzz, drawing thousands into its Telegram, TikTok and X groups. Unlike many meme tokens that lack substance, Layer Brett positions itself as a hybrid: Meme energy on the surface, but with Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure beneath it. Accessibility is another strength. Buying LBRETT only requires connecting a wallet and paying with ETH or USDT, a process designed to appeal to both first-time investors and seasoned traders. Analysts argue that this combination of low entry cost, utility and community hype is why LBRETT could be the token that rivals ADA’s early days in terms of life-changing returns. The takeaway Every Cardano price prediction highlights ADA’s resilience and long-term potential but also its slower growth profile. In contrast, Layer Brett is being pitched as the fast-moving alternative, with some analysts projecting a run from under one cent to over $1 within two years — equivalent to more than 160x gains. For investors who regret missing ADA’s run in 2021, LBRETT could be the second chance they’ve been waiting for. With staking yields still in the hundreds of percent, millions already raised and community momentum accelerating, it may be the project that defines the next wave of meme coin mania. Secure your Layer Brett allocation today — the presale won’t stay at $0.0058 for long.

Primary driver: regulatory clarity (CLARITY Act) Institutional adoption via digital asset treasuries (DATs) could materially increase demand for BTC. Market conditions: liquidity, corporate balance‑sheet allocation, and macro stability support higher targets. Charles Hoskinson predicts $250K Bitcoin by 2026 — analysis of regulatory catalysts, institutional demand, and market mechanics. Read the full breakdown and implications for investors. What does Charles Hoskinson predict about Bitcoin’s price? Charles Hoskinson predicts $250K Bitcoin by mid‑2026 , arguing that passage of the CLARITY Act will remove regulatory uncertainty and unlock institutional and corporate demand. He expects clearer rules to trigger corporate digital asset treasuries and broader liquidity, potentially more than doubling current price levels within a year. How could the CLARITY Act drive Bitcoin toward $250,000? Regulatory ambiguity has been a primary restraint on large institutional allocations. The proposed CLARITY Act aims to define agency roles across crypto markets. If it passes, corporations and financial institutions could confidently add Bitcoin to balance sheets. Clear rules reduce compliance costs and legal risk. That encourages: More corporate digital asset treasuries (DATs). Increased institutional custody and ETF-like vehicles. Higher market liquidity and tighter bid-ask spreads. Historic analogues show that institutional entry points can drive prolonged price appreciation. Hoskinson points to these mechanisms as the likely path to a $250K level by mid‑2026. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Charles Hoskinson Predicts $250K Bitcoin by 2026 – Here’s Why"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/charles-hoskinson-predicts-250k-bitcoin-2026"" }, ""description"": ""Charles Hoskinson predicts $250K Bitcoin by mid-2026, citing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key drivers for higher demand and liquidity."", ""keywords"": ""Charles Hoskinson, Bitcoin $250K, CLARITY Act, digital asset treasuries, institutional adoption""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How regulatory clarity could lead Bitcoin to $250K"", ""description"": ""Stepwise explanation of how the CLARITY Act and institutional adoption could push BTC toward a $250,000 valuation."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Passage of the CLARITY Act"", ""text"": ""Legislation defines agency jurisdiction and reduces legal ambiguity for market participants."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Institutional onboarding"", ""text"": ""Banks, asset managers, and corporations create custody, ETF-like offerings, and digital asset treasuries."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Corporate treasury allocation"", ""text"": ""Firms allocate a portion of cash reserves to BTC as a store of value, increasing sustained demand."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Liquidity expansion"", ""text"": ""Higher market participation tightens spreads and supports larger price moves with less slippage."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Price appreciation"", ""text"": ""Sustained demand and improved liquidity drive medium-term price discovery toward elevated targets."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why does Charles Hoskinson believe Bitcoin can reach $250K?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""He believes regulatory clarity from the CLARITY Act will unlock institutional and corporate demand, leading to digital asset treasuries and increased liquidity that could push Bitcoin toward $250,000 by mid‑2026."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the CLARITY Act and why does it matter?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The CLARITY Act is proposed legislation to define which agencies regulate different crypto market segments.

Hoskinson sets a timeline of June–July 2026 for his $250K target. This assumes passage or clear momentum behind regulatory measures and a steady ramp in institutional balance‑sheet allocations. The timeline ties directly to expected legislative and institutional adoption windows. Frequently Asked Questions Will institutional adoption alone push Bitcoin to $250K? Institutional adoption is necessary but not always sufficient. It must combine with regulatory clarity, sufficient liquidity, and macro stability. When these factors align, institutional flows can have outsized price impact over 12–24 months. How realistic is a mid‑2026 target given current market structure? Realism depends on legislative outcomes and corporate behavior. If the CLARITY Act or similar measures pass and corporations move toward DATs, the scenario is plausible. Absent that, incremental institutional adoption could still lift prices but likely on a longer timeframe. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity matters : The CLARITY Act is central to Hoskinson’s thesis and to easing institutional risk. Institutional and corporate demand : Digital asset treasuries and custody solutions amplify sustained buying pressure. Timing and catalysts : Legislative progress and improved market infrastructure are the primary catalysts for a mid‑2026 move. Conclusion Charles Hoskinson’s $250K Bitcoin forecast centers on regulatory clarity unlocking institutional and corporate demand. While the prediction hinges on legislative outcomes such as the CLARITY Act, the mechanisms — DATs, custody expansion, and increased liquidity — are well understood and could plausibly drive large upside if realized. Monitor regulatory developments and institutional balance‑sheet activity as the key indicators.

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Risen Alongside Price Rally As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Open Interest has seen a sharp surge recently. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of BTC-related positions that are currently on all derivatives exchanges. When the value of the metric rises, it means the investors are opening fresh positions related to the asset. Generally, more positions come up with more leverage for the sector, so the cryptocurrency’s price can become more volatile following an Open Interest jump. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies traders are either closing positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. This kind of trend can clear out leverage, which can naturally make the asset more stable. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a strong increase alongside the asset’s run toward the all-time high (ATH) during the last few days. This suggests speculative interest in the coin has gone up. The trend isn’t anything unusual, as rallies tend to attract a lot of attention, and with attention naturally comes repositioning on the derivatives market. The scale of the rise this time, however, is definitely something worth taking note of. Rapid increases in the indicator alongside a rally can sometimes destabilize it. Following the latest jump, the Bitcoin Open Interest has touched $45.3 billion, which is a new ATH. “That’s the highest level of leverage the market has EVER seen,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether the bullish momentum will continue regardless of the intense speculation, or if it will prove to be a warning sign. In some other news, the BTC rally has also been accompanied by growth in the Coinbase Premium Gap , an indicator that measures the difference between the BTC prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). As the below chart shared by Maartunn in another X post shows, the metric’s value is floating around a positive value of $108 right now. This notable positive value implies Coinbase traders are currently participating in a higher amount of buying than Binance users, which is why Bitcoin is going for a higher rate there. BTC Price Bitcoin has pushed back toward its ATH as the latest continuation to its recovery run has taken its price to $122,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin open interest|Bitcoin Speculation|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 07:00:31

This performance positions XRP just 15% shy of its all-time high, making it one of the standout performers in the crypto space, trailing only Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), which saw price increases of 16%, 23%, and 21%, respectively over the same time frame. XRP Price Analysis Back in July of this year, the XRP price reached its peak of $3.66, but subsequent market corrections saw the token drop to as low as $2.70. Since then, attempts to recover have faced challenges, particularly with a key resistance level at $3.10 that has thwarted upward movements since August. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 This struggle has led to the formation of a falling wedge pattern on XRP’s daily chart, signaling a potential shift as selling pressure wanes and buying interest rises. Market expert Lark Davis recently shared his insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that if the XRP price can maintain momentum, it could target around $4, indicating a potential rally of approximately 33%. However, this bullish outlook hinges on XRP’s ability to consolidate above the $3 threshold, which would serve as confirmation of a breakout from the bullish pattern and pave the way for further price recoveries. Will ETF Approvals Propel Prices Higher? Contrasting Davis’ optimistic view, market analyst Ali Martinez expressed skepticism, arguing that while a breakout may occur, it might only lead to a price target of $3.60, essentially retesting previous highs rather than achieving new records. Despite differing opinions, the general sentiment leans towards potential upside, bolstered by the anticipation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that may soon gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for investing in XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Levels, Predictions Point To $140,000 By Early 2026 Leading analyst Crypto King highlighted the involvement of prominent names in the industry, with fund sizes ranging from $200 million to $1.5 trillion. He posited that the approval of even a single ETF could usher in a wave of institutional investment into XRP, significantly affecting its price trajectory. While the prospect of institutional money entering the XRP market is enticing, it remains to be seen whether these funds will have a substantial impact on the XRP price, particularly given the precedent set by similar investments in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum in 2024 following their own regulatory approvals.

The digital asset crossed $3 for the first time since 2018, and hit a new all-time high of $3.65 in July. Despite this remarkable performance, many XRP investors are convinced that the asset has not fulfilled its true potential and have even higher expectations. In a recent post, PharaohX33, an experienced market participant, stated that buying XRP below $3 “may likely be gone forever.” He added that prices under $2.00 and $1.00 are already “GONE.” He anticipates XRP to start rising within the next few weeks. Buying $XRP below $3.00 may likely be gone forever. We'll know within the next couple of weeks for sure. Below $2.00 – GONE Below $1.00 – GONE Prepare for higher prices. I wish you all the best of luck. — 𓂀 (@PharaohX33) October 2, 2025 Reasons for Confidence in XRP The timing of these comments coincides with recent actions by the Federal Reserve. The Fed recently cut interest rates , and expectations remain that more cuts could follow before the end of 2025. Lower borrowing costs tend to increase market liquidity and risk appetite, providing favorable conditions for assets like XRP. Market participants see this monetary environment as a potential catalyst that could drive stronger flows into digital assets. XRP, already recognized for its speed and efficiency in settlement, may attract renewed attention in such an environment. As institutions seek digital assets capable of serving large-scale financial functions, the combination of easier monetary policy and structural strengths could significantly lift demand . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation of Institutional Entry A key point of focus for investors is the potential approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , as the SEC has multiple decision deadlines this month. Approval of such products would represent a milestone for institutional adoption, as it would provide large investors with regulated access to XRP. This possibility has strengthened expectations of fresh capital inflows, with market observers noting that ETFs often mark turning points in liquidity and price dynamics for digital assets. PharaohX33 emphasized the urgency of positioning before such developments happen. He concluded his remarks with a simple message, writing, “Prepare for higher prices. I wish you all the best of luck.” For many retail and institutional investors, the prospect of missing an entry below $3 is becoming an important consideration. In early January, a prominent community member predicted that XRP would cross the $2 mark and not return , and the asset has spent much of 2025 well above this level. XRP is trading at $3.02, and if PharaohX33 is right, the next breakout in a few weeks might be the last time XRP trades around $3.

After breaking decisively above $3, XRP has reignited enthusiasm among traders who had grown weary of its long consolidation. For some, this is proof that the project still has life beyond the courtroom drama and years of stagnation. For others, it raises the question of whether this rally is sustainable, or if smarter money should be chasing newer tokens like Layer Brett with far higher potential multiples. XRP bulls in control Momentum has shifted firmly in favour of the bulls. The most recent rally saw XRP surge past $3 with strong volume, leading analysts to speculate about a move toward $4–$5 if current sentiment holds. Some more ambitious forecasts even point to $6 in early 2026, provided the regulatory picture continues to improve and Ripple’s cross-border settlement technology gains wider adoption. That said, XRP’s past cycles serve as a warning. Each rally has often been followed by sharp corrections, particularly once hype begins to fade. While a move toward $5 looks possible in the near term, traders remain divided on whether XRP can deliver the kind of outsized returns it once promised. Ripple’s long-term outlook Ripple still maintains an edge in payments technology, with partnerships across multiple financial institutions. This underpins the more optimistic XRP price prediction cases. Yet the token’s supply dynamics and regulatory baggage remain hurdles. Even if utility adoption accelerates, the pace of XRP’s price growth may not match faster-moving rivals. For holders who endured years of stagnation, the current breakout is welcome but it’s also prompting comparisons to new projects that appear to offer greater multiples. That’s where alternative tokens — particularly in the Ethereum Layer 2 space — are stealing attention. Where Layer Brett fits in One standout is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , an ETH L2 token that has combined meme culture with real technical underpinnings. Still priced at $0.0058 in presale, it has already raised over $4.2 million. At the time of writing, staking yields sit above 600% APY , though they drop quickly as more wallets join, giving early adopters a strong incentive to move fast. The project isn’t just about hype. Its roadmap includes NFTs, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging, all layered on Ethereum’s infrastructure. A $1 million giveaway is also in the cards, helping to fuel surging community growth across Telegram, TikTok and X. Many traders argue that this mix of meme-driven branding and genuine Layer 2 utility is exactly what makes LBRETT more dynamic than slower-moving tokens like XRP. Accessibility is another selling point: Buying LBRETT only requires connecting a wallet and paying with ETH or USDT. This simplicity has made it attractive to both newcomers and experienced investors and analysts now suggest it could climb from under one cent to over $1 in the next two years — a potential 160x move. The bottom line Every fresh XRP price prediction highlights the token’s resilience and renewed strength above $3. But when it comes to raw upside, XRP is unlikely to deliver the exponential multiples that newcomers like Layer Brett are targeting. For many traders, the choice is between stability and outsized opportunity. XRP may march toward $5 or even $6 if momentum continues but the bigger excitement seems to be shifting toward projects like LBRETT — where staking, community hype and Layer 2 technology intersect. Analysts note that the presale’s rapid fundraising and high APY structure put it in a different league compared to traditional meme tokens. With excitement mounting, LBRETT could end up defining the next wave of gains while XRP works to defend its hard-won territory above $3. Secure your share of Layer Brett today before the presale price moves higher.

Traders should use clear stops and consider percentage-based dip buys or weekly-close confirmations. Weekly close above $260 could target $520. Mechanical 25% dip buys with 50–60% profit exits showed three recent winning cycles. Support levels: $160 (near-term), $120 (deep buffer), $40 (long-term accumulation zone). Solana resistance analysis: SOL near $240–$260; learn breakout and dip strategies to trade responsibly — read actionable levels and next steps. Analysts outline Solana’s path as it nears key resistance, with breakout and dip based strategies guiding traders. Ali projects a weekly close above $260 could send Solana toward a $520 cycle peak. ZYN notes three straight gains using a 25% dip buy and 50%-60% rally exit method. Support sits at $160, with deeper buffers near $120 and $40 if rejection occurs. What is Solana’s current resistance outlook? Solana resistance sits in a cluster from $240 to $260, acting as the primary decision zone for the next directional move. A confirmed weekly close above $260 would signal stronger conviction and could open targets up to $520, while failed tests increase the probability of retests down to $160 or lower. How could a weekly close above $260 affect SOL? A weekly close above $260 would validate bullish order flow and technical structure, making subsequent targets at $280, $320, $360, $400, $440 and $520 plausible. These levels align with historical congestion and measured-extension methods; traders should expect phased advances with intermittent redistribution rather than uninterrupted rallies. Source: Ali on X Analyst Ali maps a stepwise progression through targeted checkpoints that reflect prior congestion. Each checkpoint—$280, $320, $360, $400, $440—serves as both profit-taking and re-accumulation zones ahead of a potential $520 cycle peak. This measured path suggests an orderly structure rather than erratic parabolic moves. How should traders approach SOL at current resistance? Traders can adopt one of two discipline-focused frameworks: confirmation-based entries or mechanical percentage entries. Each preserves capital while aligning risk to defined support and resistance. Weekly-close confirmation : Wait for a weekly close above $260 before scaling long; place stops below the breakout candle low. Mechanical dip strategy : Buy increments on 25% pullbacks from local highs and take partial profits at 50–60% rallies, as noted by analyst ZYN. Risk management : Use predefined stop zones at $160, $120, and $40 depending on time horizon and position size. Both approaches emphasize discipline: confirmation reduces false-break risk; mechanical entries capitalize on recurring range behavior. Position size and stop placement should reflect individual risk tolerance and time frame.

Yes. ZYN’s observation of three straight favorable cycles using a 25% dip buy and 50–60% exit suggests recurring range dynamics. That said, traders must pair mechanical rules with stop discipline to mitigate regime changes or unexpected market shocks. Key Takeaways Decision zone : $240–$260 is the critical resistance range determining next phase. Two valid approaches : Weekly confirmation vs. mechanical dip buys — both require clear stops. Defined supports : $160, $120, and $40 offer staged defensive levels for different time horizons. Conclusion Solana faces a pivotal moment as price tests the $240–$260 resistance cluster. Traders can prioritize a weekly close above $260 for breakout conviction or use disciplined percentage pullback buys with set exits. Monitor support zones and use strict risk management; this structured approach preserves capital while capturing potential upside. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana Resistance: Weekly Close Could Signal Move Toward $520"", ""description"": ""Solana resistance sits near $240–$260; analysts outline breakout and dip strategies with key supports at $160, $120 and $40."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2QO7I4WIAAsXt0-1-1024x716.jpg""], ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T12:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/solana-resistance-analysis"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to trade Solana at the $240–$260 resistance"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step disciplined approaches for trading SOL at critical resistance using confirmation and mechanical dip buys."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2QO7I4WIAAsXt0-1-1024x716.jpg"", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Set your framework"", ""text"": ""Choose either weekly-close confirmation or mechanical dip-buy rules before entering any trade."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Define entry and exit rules"", ""text"": ""For confirmation, enter after a weekly close above $260.

This step is part of the foundation's public treasury policy, which mandates regular Ethereum sales when there are deviations from its fiat-based operating expense reserve target. The Ethereum Foundation shared the following statement: “Today, we are converting 1,000 ETH into a stablecoin. This transaction is important not only to fund our work, but also to demonstrate the power of DeFi.” Related News: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Releases Update Regarding Recent Hack Attack Meanwhile, the Fusaka upgrade, a crucial step for the Ethereum network, has also been added to the calendar. Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, is preparing for two separate testnet phases this month. The mainnet upgrade is expected to be live by the end of November. Dankrad Feist, co-leader of the Ethereum Foundation's protocol architecture team, said that blockchain technology will become increasingly integrated into everyday financial services in the coming years. “In the next 10 years,” Feist said, “the majority of blockchain users will be ordinary people. They will look for easy solutions like a fintech app, rather than dealing with crypto wallets or complex blockchain interfaces.” *This is not investment advice.

52647112,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827169,1759563000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52647112.jpeg,Top 3 Cryptos That Could Mirror Ethereum’s (ETH) Success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-3-cryptos-that-could-mirror-ethereums-eth-success/,"When Ethereum (ETH) launched in 2015 at under $1, few could have imagined that it would later blow up over $4,000, with early adopters getting life-changing returns. Investors are now searching for the next gems with the same volatile upside, and Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and newcomer Mutuum Finance are at the forefront. Cardano (ADA) continues to develop with updates targeting scalability and interoperability, setting itself up for strong long-term growth. Solana (SOL), despite being volatile in recent times, remains a workhorse for high-speed blockchain applications and institutional adoption. Yet the project that is making all the buzz is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-driven DeFi platform currently priced at just $0.035. Its presale is currently in Phase 6, now over 55% sold out, reflecting robust demand and growing investor confidence. With over 16,750 holders, over $16.8 million raised, and a design aimed at dual lending infrastructure, Mutuum Finance has the best chance to offer ETH-like returns, and perhaps be the next sub-$1 altcoin to explode by 2026. Cardano (ADA) Builds Momentum With Key Targets Ahead Cardano (ADA) is rebuilding momentum as it restarts the upward trend in parallel with bullish predictions, now nearing $0.85 after registering more than 11% gains in the recent sessions. Traders are eyeing short-term targets of $0.95 and $1.00, while mid-term targets stretch as far as $1.05, $1.17, and even $1.33 as network upgrades and ecosystem development spark optimism. This sustained upward push solidifies ADA’s position as one of the most promising sub-$1 cryptos that has the potential to replicate Ethereum’s early growth trajectory. That being said, while ADA’s price outlook remains strong, many investors are also keeping a close eye on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is rapidly building momentum. Solana’s Momentum Gains Strength as $2B Treasury Strategy Induces Rally Solana (SOL) surged 5% to $220 this week after Nasdaq-listed VisionSys revealed a staggering $2 billion treasury plan with Marinade Finance, in a big leap forward for institutional participation in the Solana ecosystem. The first $500 million phase of the project will involve staking SOL for the next six months, a move that is widely seen as a milestone in onboarding AI infrastructure on blockchain technology and accelerating enterprise-level adoption. This shot in the arm of institutional confidence not only confirms Solana’s position as a high-performance Layer-1 network but also foretells potential large-scale price appreciation as demand for its ecosystem scales. Yet, as Solana’s growth narrative gathers momentum, the majority of investors who seek early-stage, high-upside potential are looking beyond blue-chip names, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now entering the picture. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is leading the decentralized finance charge with its presale, securing over 16,750 investors and raising a total of over $16.8 million to date. Already 55% filled in Phase 6, MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.035 per token. Committed to expanding the frontiers of DeFi, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles for enabling secure settlement, exchange, and lending of USD-backed tokens against popular assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The company makes use of robust and dependable price information with fallback oracle protections, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages for ensuring accuracy under all circumstances even in the event of severe market volatility. Mutuum Finance Announces Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has officially made public the development of its innovative lending and borrowing protocol , a massive achievement toward its vision to bring decentralized finance solutions to the next level. The V1 version will be live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, with the core features being a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. The launch will initially feature ETH and USDT as lendable, borrowable, and collateralizable assets, setting the foundation for a scalable and heterogeneous DeFi ecosystem. What to Choose Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are hopeful, but the clear winner is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Valued at just $0.035 currently and already over 55% sold out, MUTM’s strong dual lending ecosystem, high demand, and early-stage position give it the most potential to deliver Ethereum-like returns. For those investors searching for the next breakthrough under $1, MUTM is the top option.

Zhimin Qian, 47, a Chinese national, was convicted at Southwark Crown Court on Monday, 29th September, after pleading guilty to acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of cryptocurrency under the Proceeds of Crime Act (2002). Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a large-scale fraud in China between 2014 and 2017. During this period, the Metropolitan Police said that Qian defrauded over 128,000 victims before converting the proceeds into Bitcoin. Multi-Year Fraud Operation The investigation was first launched in 2018 following intelligence on the transfer of criminal assets, and led to the seizure of 61,000 Bitcoin from Qian. After fleeing China using false documents, she entered the UK and attempted to launder the illicit funds by purchasing property, allegedly with the assistance of an accomplice, Jian Wen. Following the conviction, Will Lyne, The Met’s Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command, said , “Today’s guilty plea marks the culmination of years of dedicated investigation by the Met’s Economic Crime teams and our partners. This is one of the largest money laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally. I am extremely proud of the team. Through a meticulous investigation and unprecedented cooperation with Chinese law enforcement, we were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK.” Qian has been taken into custody and will be sentenced at a later date. Accomplice Jailed Too As part of the broader investigation into international crypto-related fraud, Wen received a jail sentence last year for her participation in the scheme. Evidence presented by the Met’s economic crime team revealed that she assisted in moving a cryptocurrency wallet holding 150 Bitcoin, worth £1.7 million at the time, about $2.3 million. Southwark Crown Court sentenced her on 22 May 2024 to six years and eight months in prison.

Funding for crypto startups declined sharply in Q2 2025 as investors demand proven adoption and clear monetization paths. VCs favor projects with real adoption and predictable revenue. Q2 2025 saw a 59% decline in crypto startup funding and a 15% drop in deal count. 18 projects raised $312 million in a single week; valuations often rely on future cash flows. Crypto venture capital: VCs are more selective in 2025—learn why funding fell in Q2 and how projects must prove adoption to attract capital. Read actionable guidance now. Crypto venture capitalists are a “lot more careful” and not just jumping on every hot narrative, says Bullish Capital Management director Sylvia To as investors shift toward projects with real adoption and predictable revenue in 2025. Crypto venture capitalists are dialing back their risk appetite, avoiding the hot flavor of the month and applying a more critical lens to investments, according to Bullish Capital Management director Sylvia To. Investors are increasingly requiring evidence of usage and revenue before committing capital. “VCs are a lot more careful now. It’s not just a narrative play,” To said during a sit-down interview at Token2049 in Singapore. She noted that prior cycles allowed quick checks for new layer 1 projects without proven demand. That approach has changed as market fragmentation exposed weak adoption across many chains. What is driving the shift in crypto venture capital behavior? The shift is driven by weak user adoption, inflated valuations and a demand for predictable revenue models. Funds now question whether infrastructure has real traction—transaction volume and developer activity are the most scrutinized metrics. Who has been using the new infrastructure? “You really have to start thinking: there’s all this infrastructure being built, but who has been using it?” To said. VCs are looking for active wallets, transaction volume and third-party integrations as proof points before investing. 18 crypto projects collectively raised $312 million during the week ending Sept. 29. Source: Messari (plain text) To observed that many projects raised funds at inflated valuations in 2025, often relying on projected future cash flows rather than demonstrated pipelines. As a result, fundraising has slowed and investor scrutiny has increased. How much did crypto startup funding change in Q2 2025? Crypto startup funding declined significantly in Q2 2025, with a 59% drop in funding compared to the prior quarter , alongside a 15% decline in deal count, according to Galaxy Research (plain text). Galaxy Research’s VC report showed that crypto and blockchain startups raised $1.97 billion across 378 deals in Q2 2025. Overall venture investment into crypto amounted to $10.03 billion over the three months ending June, but the quarter-on-quarter drop signals heightened selectivity among investors. Which trends stand out in recent VC activity? Notable developments include large institutional allocations to Bitcoin-related strategies—Strive Funds secured $750 million in May to pursue such strategies—and concentrated raises by early-stage teams focused on monetizable infra and revenue models. How can crypto startups attract VC in 2025? Startups must prove adoption, demonstrate predictable revenue, and show institutional interest. Clear unit economics, strong on-chain metrics and partnerships that lead to measurable transactions are essential. Demonstrate active users : show daily active wallets, transaction volume and retention metrics. Show revenue pathways : detail current or near-term revenue streams with conservative forecasts. Prove product-market fit : list integrations, pilot customers or institutional commitments. Maintain transparent governance : clear token economics and on-chain controls reduce perceived risk. Frequently Asked Questions Why are VCs avoiding narrative-driven crypto projects? VCs avoid narrative-driven projects because past cycles produced many layer 1s and infra plays without user adoption. Investors now require on-chain evidence and predictable revenue to justify valuations. How steep was the funding decline in Q2 2025? Funding declined by 59% to $1.97 billion across 378 deals in Q2 2025, with an overall $10.03 billion invested over the three months ending June, indicating a pullback from earlier, more aggressive deployment. What metrics do investors prioritize today? Investors prioritize transaction volume, active users, revenue run rate, institutional partnerships and sustainable token economics when evaluating opportunities. Key Takeaways Selective capital: VCs now prioritize adoption and revenue over narratives. Funding down: Q2 2025 saw a 59% decline in funding and fewer deals. Action for founders: Focus on measurable usage, conservative financials and institutional traction to attract VC interest. Conclusion Crypto venture capital in 2025 has moved from narrative-driven bets to disciplined underwriting centered on adoption and revenue. Projects that can demonstrate clear user activity and monetization are best positioned to secure funding. For startups, the imperative is simple: prove your metrics and tighten your revenue model to align with investor expectations. Author: COINOTAG — Published 2025-10-04.

BNB's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview BNB Breaks $1,100 as Uptober Momentum Builds BNB’s latest rally saw prices climb to $1,111 before consolidating near $1,096, posting a 6% gain in 24 hours and more than 17% in the last week. Analysts note that the breakout above $1,050 resistance unlocked renewed momentum, with traders now targeting $1,200 as the next psychological barrier. Market data from CoinGlass shows that nearly $400 million in leveraged positions were liquidated during the move, including $268 million in short positions. This suggests that institutional buyers and momentum traders seized the opportunity to accumulate BNB as retail traders were forced out of the market. Network Growth and Lower Gas Fees Drive Demand Beyond price action, fundamentals on the BNB Chain continue to strengthen. Recent upgrades reduced gas fees from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, positioning BNB Chain as one of the cheapest and most efficient blockchains for decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading applications. On-chain activity supports the bullish case. Active addresses spiked to over 73 million in September, while transaction volumes climbed to 4.34 million monthly, the second-highest on record. The chain’s total value locked (TVL) has also risen to $8.23 billion, showing steady adoption across DeFi protocols. Institutional participation is increasing too. Kazakhstan’s state-backed Alem Crypto Fund recently designated BNB as its first official investment, indicating that sovereign entities are starting to diversify into exchange-linked tokens. Can BNB Sustain Its Push Toward $1,200? With BNB’s market cap now surpassing $160 billion, experts believe the token is strengthening its position as a key asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Technical signals indicate potential further gains: the token remains strong above all major moving averages, and RSI is near but not yet in overbought levels. Nevertheless, volatility remains a significant risk. A decline towards the $1,000–$1,030 support zone could occur if profit-taking speeds up. However, as long as BNB stays above $1,050, analysts consider $1,150–$1,200 as achievable short-term targets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-xrp-is-gearing-up-for-parabolic-advance-heres-why/,"XRP has held a firm position within its current trading range, showing a consolidation that many traders monitor. The recent price action highlights a period of compression just above a significant support level. Crypto trader and analyst Scient (@Crypto_Scient) recently revealed that XRP is preparing for a “parabolic advance.” This technical behavior often precedes larger moves, and analysts are evaluating whether the asset could soon establish a major shift in market direction. The analyst added that he does not see “any other major printing a cleaner or more bullish structure right now.” This assessment aligns with what can be seen on the chart, where the asset has formed a descending triangle , a recognizable bullish continuation pattern. $XRP , gearing up for parabolic advance. Honestly, I don’t see any other major printing a cleaner or more bullish structure right now. #XRP #XRPUSDT pic.twitter.com/AKyh0G6RP8 — Scient (@Crypto_Scient) October 1, 2025 The Bullish Formation The chart provided by Scient shows XRP trading at $2.9471, sitting above the $2.8 zone, which has acted as a strong area of support following the large breakout earlier in 2025. Since reaching a new all-time high in July , the price has entered into a descending triangle consolidation. While descending structures sometimes carry bearish risk, in this case, it appears to be forming as a bullish continuation setup due to its positioning above the breakout level. The highlighted support zone reinforces this view. XRP has continued to maintain that level despite repeated declines and support tests, showing buyers remain in control. The compression within the pattern suggests a potential expansion in volatility, with the bias tilted upward given the preceding trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Levels to Monitor A crucial point in the analysis is that XRP remains firmly above the multi-month accumulation range it broke out from earlier in the year. By holding above $2.8, which previously acted as a resistance zone, the market has effectively confirmed it as new support. The significance of this setup lies in the clean market structure that has developed over time. XRP’s consolidation phase is occurring in alignment with bullish continuation principles. Scient’s assessment that the structure is among the strongest in the market highlights the potential for significant price expansion once the consolidation resolves . If buyers continue to defend the resistance level, XRP could build the necessary momentum for another surge. A breakout above the descending resistance trendline would provide technical confirmation of renewed strength. Market watchers would then look for a push toward the higher levels established during the previous rally. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Altcoin Season Index at 65 Bitcoin dominance holds at 58.21% while selective altcoins outperform, indicating measured repositioning. Ethereum +12.46% and BNB +21.21% weekly gains; meme coins show high volatility (up to +136.81% and down -40.97%). Altcoin dominance nears breakout as Layer 1s lead rotation; track Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin dominance for timing. What is altcoin dominance and why does it matter now? Altcoin dominance measures the share of total crypto market cap held by altcoins versus Bitcoin. It now trades near a long-term support channel (~0.13) and, combined with an Altcoin Season Index reading of 65, suggests growing rotation into altcoins while Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at 58.21%. How is the current capital rotation into Layer 1 networks unfolding? Layer 1s are leading this rotation: Ethereum gained 12.46% and BNB 21.21% in seven days. Infrastructure upgrades and integrations are cited as drivers. Institutional flows into Bitcoin ETFs ($627 million in 24 hours reported) are supporting Bitcoin’s stability, so capital appears to favor structured ecosystems before moving into smaller caps. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/altcoin-dominance-breakout-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Altcoin dominance nears breakout zone as Layer 1s lead capital rotation"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2VXgF1WUAApa-W-1-1024x664.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Altcoin dominance nears a breakout as Layer 1 networks lead rotation and Altcoin Season Index hits 65; measured repositioning noted while Bitcoin dominance holds.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor an altcoin dominance breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks to confirm a genuine altcoin breakout and manage risk."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch Bitcoin dominance"", ""text"": ""Monitor Bitcoin dominance for a decisive break below 57% which historically signals broader altcoin expansion."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track Altcoin Season Index"", ""text"": ""Use the Altcoin Season Index; a sustained move above 66 often confirms rotation pressure into altcoins."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Follow Layer 1 performance and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Prioritize Layer 1 network strength (ETH, BNB) and institutional flows before allocating to high-volatility meme or micro-cap tokens."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What level of Bitcoin dominance signals altcoin expansion?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Historically, a sustained Bitcoin dominance below ~57% has often coincided with broader altcoin cycles and increased altcoin market share."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does an Altcoin Season Index of 65 mean?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""An Altcoin Season Index reading of 65 signals rising rotation pressure but is just below the common 66 threshold used to denote an official altcoin season."" } } ]} Altcoin dominance nears key breakout zone as Bitcoin strength persists and Layer 1s lead capital rotation. Altcoin Season Index hit 65, signaling rising rotation pressure despite Bitcoin’s 58.21% dominance hold. Ethereum and BNB led gains with 12% and 21% weekly advances, driven by infrastructure upgrades. Meme coins like FLOKI and JELLYJELLY surged, but Plasma’s 40% drop shows ongoing liquidity risk. Altcoin dominance is approaching a possible inflection zone as market structure data and sentiment indicators align for what analyst Merlijn The Trader describes as “Strike 3.” His observation points to an emerging shift in capital rotation, with altcoins slowly reclaiming ground against Bitcoin. Historical trendlines support that pattern. Previous dominance peaks in 2018 and 2021 both coincided with sharp altcoin rallies before deep corrections. The current ratio trades near 0.13 , sitting on long-term channel support that has defined every recovery phase across the past two cycles. What do long-term structure signals indicate about rebound potential? According to Merlijn The Trader, the dominance chart shows three projected cycle tops: 2018, 2021, and a projected top in 2025. Each touched an upper resistance band. Price action continues to respect that formation, suggesting upside room remains while the lower boundary holds. Source: Merlijn The Trader (social commentary) Near-term positioning shows caution. Bitcoin dominance increased to 58.21% , gaining 0.25 points in 24 hours. The Altcoin Season Index climbed to 65 out of 100, nearing the commonly referenced 66 threshold used to denote official rotation. That divergence points to selective repositioning rather than indiscriminate risk-taking. How are Layer 1 networks shaping the current rotation? Ethereum gained 12.46% in seven days, with BNB advancing 21.21% over the same stretch. Upgrades and integrations on these networks have driven institutional and retail interest, while broader market indices show flows into regulated products that support Bitcoin’s case as a core allocation. The Binance market index rose 11.09% across the week. XRP tracked an 8.53% rise amid compliance developments. These moves suggest capital preferentially rotates into robust, liquid ecosystems before pursuing high-risk micro-cap opportunities. Why are meme coins and micro-caps still risky? Speculative appetite is evident: FLOKI rallied 36.83% after a European ETP listing (reported in market notices). Micro-cap JELLYJELLY surged 136.81% on listing momentum. Conversely, Plasma (XPL) plunged 40.97% , highlighting thin liquidity and rapid drawdowns in smaller markets. That contrast underscores a layered advance: stable gains in Layer 1s, selective retail speculation in meme assets, and heightened liquidity risk for micro-caps. Further confirmation of broad altcoin expansion would likely arrive if Bitcoin dominance breaks below 57% . Comparison table: key metrics this week Metric Value Implication Bitcoin dominance 58.21% Maintains BTC stability; limits immediate altcoin breadth Altcoin Season Index 65/100 Rising rotation pressure; just below official threshold Ethereum (7d) +12.46% Layer 1 strength BNB (7d) +21.21% Strong exchange-led ecosystem gains Frequently Asked Questions What BTC dominance level historically triggers altcoin season? Historically, a sustained Bitcoin dominance drop below ~57% has often signaled that capital is rotating into altcoins more broadly, enabling wider altcoin advances. How should traders manage risk during early rotation? Prioritize liquid Layer 1 tokens, use position sizing, set stop-losses, and monitor institutional flows and the Altcoin Season Index for confirmation before increasing exposure to high-volatility micro-caps. Key Takeaways Measured rotation: Altcoin dominance nears a key zone but Bitcoin dominance remains a constraining factor. Layer 1 leadership: Ethereum and BNB gains indicate infrastructure-driven capital flows. High-risk micro-caps: Meme token rallies coexist with sharp liquidity-driven drawdowns; manage risk accordingly. Conclusion Altcoin dominance is approaching a pivotal area as Layer 1 networks lead capital rotation while Bitcoin retains significant market share. Short-term gains in Ethereum and BNB point to structured strength, but liquidity risks in smaller tokens remain.

Aggressive taker buy volume pushed BTC above $120K. Active receiving addresses jumped to ~548K, indicating renewed demand. Derivatives flows show larger average order sizes and stronger institutional participation. Bitcoin price surges above $120K; aggressive buying and rising on‑chain demand signal short‑term bullish momentum — read analysis and key takeaways. What is driving Bitcoin’s recent surge above $120K? Bitcoin price moved above $120,000 primarily because aggressive taker buy volume outpaced sell pressure, and on‑chain metrics show a rapid rise in active receiving addresses. Strong derivatives order flow and coordinated retail-institutional accumulation front‑load bullish momentum for BTC in the near term. How does aggressive long positioning affect BTC momentum? Market order‑flow data indicates that taker buy volume — traders paying the offer to open or add longs — has meaningfully risen. When taker buys exceed taker sells, price discovery tends upward because buyers accept higher prices immediately. This behavior suggests traders expect continuation rather than short‑term mean reversion. Source: X Why does rising on‑chain activity support a bullish outlook? The Number of Active Receiving Addresses climbed sharply, indicating larger participation in incoming transfers. Higher receiving addresses typically reflect either accumulation or increased transactional use. The recent jump from approximately 400K to 548K addresses in three days signals heightened demand and network engagement. CryptoQuant and other on‑chain analytics providers reported the spike in receiving addresses and a concurrent rise in futures average order size, reinforcing the link between on‑chain demand and derivatives positioning. Source: CryptoQuant How are retail and institutional flows aligning? Derivatives metrics show larger average futures order sizes, consistent with institutional participation. At the same time, on‑chain indicators point to rising retail accumulation at current prices. This alignment — institutions providing directional pressure via futures and retail adding spot demand — amplifies momentum when both cohorts accumulate simultaneously. Source: CryptoQuant What is ahead for BTC? Near term, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on whether buyers can sustain a close above $120K. A confirmed daily close above that level increases the probability of an extension to the next resistance near $125K. Conversely, failure to hold $120K could trigger profit‑taking and a pullback to recent support bands. Source: TradingView Frequently Asked Questions How quickly did active receiving addresses rise? Active receiving addresses rose from ~400K to ~548K in roughly three days, a ~37% increase that signals a rapid uptick in network inflows and participation. Does higher taker buy volume guarantee a sustained rally? No. While higher taker buy volume indicates buying conviction, sustained rallies require continued demand, healthy liquidity, and confirmation on daily closes above key levels like $120K. Key Takeaways Aggressive buying : Taker buy volume drove the initial push above $120K, showing traders are paying higher prices to enter longs. On‑chain demand : Active receiving addresses jumped to ~548K, reflecting stronger network participation and accumulation. Watch $120K : A decisive close above $120K favors a run to $125K; failure to hold could prompt short‑term retracement. Conclusion The current Bitcoin surge is backed by measurable market action: aggressive taker buy orders in derivatives and a clear rise in on‑chain receiving addresses. These signals improve BTC’s short‑term probability of continuation, but traders should monitor $120K as the decisive pivot.

Despite whale accumulation driving PEPE futures open interest beyond $600 million, the reality for traders is declining network activity. Could Layer Brett ’s jump from Base limitations to dedicated Ethereum Layer 2 architecture represent a possible infrastructure breakthrough? Read on. Why PEPE ‘s Whale Momentum Hits Network Activity Decline Walls Whale accumulation patterns around PEPE reveal sophisticated positioning, with futures open interest climbing to unprecedented levels between $560-600 million while trading volumes surge past $1.2 billion daily. It’s a display of confidence, particularly as PEPE shows 10% weekly gains that outpace Bitcoin’s modest 1.4% movement. However, beneath this momentum lies a troubling disconnect that technical analysts cannot ignore. On-chain metrics expose the critical weakness undermining ambitious Pepe Coin price prediction models calling for massive multipliers. Daily active addresses have plummeted below 3,000 users, representing a sharp decline in network engagement that typically precedes major corrections in memecoin markets. This pattern repeats across previous cycles where whale accumulation creates temporary price support while fundamental user adoption erodes and with the current support level around $0.00000900, there’s mounting pressure as resistance at $0.000009681 becomes increasingly difficult to break through declining volumes. The Derivatives Success Trap That Memecoin Infrastructure Cannot Handle PEPE’s derivatives market success masks a dangerous infrastructure trap threatening its sustainability. The fundamental problem lies in PEPE’s inability to scale beyond speculative trading patterns. Unlike traditional financial instruments that derive value from underlying assets, memecoin derivatives depend entirely on sustained community engagement and network activity. As daily active addresses continue declining, derivatives positions face increasing pressure from traders who recognize that engagement metrics predict price sustainability better than whale accumulation patterns. This creates what institutional analysts call the “derivatives success trap” – where impressive trading volumes and open interest numbers mask deteriorating fundamentals. Projects caught in this trap face rapid deleveraging events when market sentiment shifts. Brett’s Layer 2 Evolution From Viral Potential to Sustainable Utility Layer Brett’s strategic transformation addresses these core infrastructure limitations that trap projects like PEPE in unsustainable speculative cycles. By evolving to a dedicated Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett combines memecoin viral energy with genuine blockchain utility that survives beyond derivatives trading patterns. The project’s presale has already raised over $4.2 million, showing solid recognition of its potential. The key difference lies in Layer Brett’s approach to solving Ethereum’s fundamental scalability problems through high-speed transactions and low gas fees. While PEPE struggles with declining network activity despite whale accumulation, LBRETT offers staking rewards exceeding 610% APY that create genuine utility for token holders. As such, Layer Brett’s ecosystem development extends beyond simple token trading to include NFT integrations, gamified staking and cross-chain interoperability features. These utilities create multiple engagement touchpoints that sustain network activity even during market downturns, preventing the derivatives trap that catches projects relying solely on whale momentum. From Speculative Price Cycles to Infrastructure That Outlasts Hype The contrast between PEPE’s current trajectory and Layer Brett’s infrastructure-first approach illustrates why traditional memecoins face sustainability challenges that dedicated Layer 2 solutions avoid. PEPE’s reliance on derivatives momentum and whale accumulation creates temporary price support without addressing fundamental scalability limitations that cause network activity to decline. While Pepe Coin price prediction models chase ambitious multipliers based on historical patterns, market reality shows that infrastructure limitations ultimately determine which projects survive long-term. Layer Brett’s presale represents meme culture appeal and serious blockchain utility and the project looks well positioned to capture massive sustainable growth this year.

According to authorities, its promoters are based in Russia, while technical support is based in Georgia. Meanwhile, its Indian operations are handled from Dubai, with the servers located in Barcelona. The illegal online trading platform, OctaFX, is being investigated by Indian authorities for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens over the past few years. According to the Enforcement Directorate ( ED ), the platform has become a part of a study into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into digital assets and use the services of international payment gateways. Indian authorities allege OctaFX made $96 million from crime proceeds Indian authorities claimed that a multi-agency investigation has revealed that OctaFX made more than $96 million of alleged crime proceeds in nine months. According to authorities, some of the funds were layered, with the platform allegedly using fake import services from Singapore to launder criminal proceeds from India. In a particular case, the ED was able to connect Rs. 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa located in Spain, Rs. 36 crore in banks, 39,000 USDT, land, and Demat holdings of about Rs. 80 crore. Meanwhile, authorities have claimed that OctaFX is not the only platform being investigated by the ED office in the Mumbai zonal unit. Other alleged illegal online platforms carrying out investment frauds include Power Bank, which is under investigation at the Bengaluru zonal unit. Angel One, TM Traders, and Vivan Li are also being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit, while Zara FX is being investigated by the ED office at the Kochi unit. The ED’s cases across its offices are based on the FIRs registered by the police in different cities. “Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,” the ED revealed in its study. Indian authorities also discovered that in the Birfa IT case, the scammers were able to send more than Rs. 4818 crore to Hong Kong and Canadian entities under their control. Authorities say operators are usually foreigners Authorities claimed that most of the payments sent abroad are done under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, while others are escrow services on fake invoices. The ED document revealed that Indians have lost more than Rs. 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024, a jump of about 206% in estimated losses from Rs. 7,465 crore recorded in 2023. Notably, the ED recorded a 50% rise in the number of cases from 2023 to 2024. Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud also discovered that the masterminds were operating the operation from Laos, Hong Kong, and Thailand. They created and maintained shell entities using forged documents. The operations were maintained by Indians hired to carry out other types of alleged crimes, including issuing fake IPO allotments, stock market investments, and fake digital arrests. Proceeds of crimes are collected from several shell companies and converted into digital assets before they are remitted overseas as payments for fake import services. While international payment gateways act as intermediaries for many of these illicit transactions, a part of the funds is laundered using hwala channels, the ED notes. In its reports, the Enforcement Directorate claimed that it discovered that some illegal funds were returned into the country under the premise of legitimate investments into stock markets.

Key Takeaways: Tether and Antalpha are raising $200 million to build a tokenized gold treasury centered on XAUt. The initiative deepens their partnership as gold demand climbs and tokenized commodities gain traction. Tether continues expanding beyond stablecoins with strategic bets in mining, AI, and tokenized assets. The effort aims to stockpile XAUt, Tether’s blockchain-based gold token, backed by physical bars stored in a Swiss vault. If successful, the capital raise would strengthen ties between two of the digital asset industry’s most prominent players. Tether, Antalpha Join Forces Amid Crypto-Mining and Stablecoin Dominance Tether is the issuer of USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap, while Antalpha is closely tied to Chinese mining giant Bitmain, which produces over 80% of global Bitcoin mining hardware. XAUt, launched by a Tether subsidiary in 2020, has grown to a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion. The planned vehicle would act as a publicly visible treasury focused solely on accumulating this asset. It follows an expanded partnership between Tether and Antalpha announced last week, which introduced new services such as XAUt-backed lending, custody, and token redemption. Antalpha said it plans to open vaults in global financial hubs, allowing token holders to redeem their digital assets for physical gold. We are proud to announce the expansion of our collaboration with @Tether_to , further integrating Tether Gold ($XAU₮) @tethergold into our RWA Hub. Through this partnership, we will now offer $XAU₮-backed lending and full-stack infrastructure solutions, making digital gold more… pic.twitter.com/eXaGQpoY0N — Antalpha Global (@AntalphaGlobal) September 29, 2025 Tether has been pushing far beyond stablecoins in recent years, with investments in Bitcoin mining, AI, payments infrastructure, and tokenized assets. Its CEO, Paolo Ardoino, is a strong advocate of gold as a store of value, and the company held $8.7 billion worth of gold on its balance sheet as of June. At the same time, Tether is reportedly seeking to raise $20 billion in a separate effort to scale its core USDT operations, a deal that would value the company near $500 billion. The gold-backed initiative arrives as demand for gold surges. Global gold investment is up 46% this year amid geopolitical tension and inflation fears, according to Bloomberg. XAUt’s market cap has doubled in that time, per CoinGecko data. More than 80 digital asset treasury firms have been formed in 2025, many using reverse mergers or SPAC structures to mimic Strategy Inc.’s public Bitcoin bet. Tether Rejects IPO Route Even as Circle’s Stock Soars Tether’s focus on gold comes as competition heats up. Circle, which went public in June , has seen its stock surge over 500% since its debut. Tether, however, has no plans to follow suit. “In general we are not interested in becoming a public company,” Ardoino said in July . The new legislation appears to be opening doors that were previously shut. Ardoino, along with other crypto executives, attended the White House bill signing. The law could, for the first time, help normalize stablecoin usage, both in crypto trading and across mainstream financial infrastructure. Tether has long been under fire for a lack of transparency, particularly regarding its reserves. Audits, promised for years, have yet to materialize. However, Ardoino said the company has been in contact with auditing firms in recent weeks.

Short-term volatility and CME session gaps suggest consolidation is likely before any sustained breakout. BTC near record highs with resistance at $124,200 — watch consolidation. Volume spiked on retracement; sellers capped gains leading to a pullback below $121,630. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades warns of October strength but advises avoiding heavy leverage; CME Open/Close gaps are key markers. Bitcoin near all-time highs: watch $124,200 resistance and consolidation. Read key signals and trade guidance — COINOTAG. What is driving Bitcoin close to its all-time highs? Bitcoin near all-time highs is being driven by renewed Q4 optimism, short-term buying pressure and visible CME Open/Close gaps that attract follow-through flows. These catalysts pushed BTC toward $124,200 but immediate resistance and heavier volume on retracements suggest consolidation rather than a clean breakout. How did price action unfold during the latest session? Bitcoin opened near $121,360 and rallied toward $124,200 before encountering significant seller interest. The move produced a retracement back below $121,630, demonstrating how momentum can reverse quickly at major resistance zones. Traders noted a horizontal guide near $122,448 that framed the session’s range. As of the latest read, BTC traded at $122,676.01, a minor decline of $11.12 (0.01%). Bitcoin edges close to all-time highs with volatile moves, showing resistance near $124,200 as traders balance Q4 optimism and caution. Bitcoin nears record highs with sharp swings as traders prepare for Q4 momentum while remaining cautious of sudden pullbacks. BTC price action highlights strong resistance near $124,200 as sellers push retracements, keeping consolidation in focus for traders. Daan Crypto Trades notes October strength yet warns traders to avoid heavy leverage during potential flushes and sharp corrections. Bitcoin showed sharp volatility heading into the weekend, sparking both excitement and prudence among market participants. The cryptocurrency nearly touched its all-time highs late Friday before closing slightly lower. Why are CME Open/Close levels important now? CME Close and CME Open levels act as institutional reference points that can concentrate liquidity and attract price fills. The chart shared by analyst Daan Crypto Trades highlighted these levels and a shaded red zone that visualized the recent correction. Traders often monitor these gaps because later sessions can gravitate toward them, producing measurable short-term moves. Source: Daan Crypto Trades How should traders manage risk during a near-record rally? Short-term traders should prioritize position sizing and avoid heavy leverage, as recommended by Daan Crypto Trades. Use stop placement below recent structure (e.g., below $121,360 session lows) and watch for volume divergences on attempts to retake $124,200. Maintain discipline: a failed breakout often leads to quick flushes that penalize overleveraged positions. Comparison: Key session levels and market readings Metric Level / Reading Implication Immediate resistance $124,200 Requires conviction to clear; sellers active Intraday guide $122,448 Defines current trading range Recent trade $122,676.01 Small decline; consolidation bias Frequently Asked Questions Is Bitcoin breaking its all-time high now? Not yet. Bitcoin approached the record but met resistance near $124,200 and pulled back, indicating that a sustained breakout requires stronger follow-through volume and conviction from institutional flows. How can traders spot a real breakout versus a false breakout? Look for rising volume on the breakout, confirmed closes above resistance on multiple timeframes, and alignment with institutional markers such as CME gap fills. Avoid entering solely on price spikes without confirmation. Key Takeaways Resistance matters : $124,200 is the primary level to watch for a breakout or rejection. Volume confirms : Higher volume on a breakout is necessary to validate a sustained move. Risk management : Avoid heavy leverage; use stops and monitor CME Open/Close gaps.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a new price discovery rally, which could start sooner than expected. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Uptober’ Begins With $220 Retest – Is It Ready For Second ‘Expansion Wave’? Bitcoin Eyes Third Price Discovery Uptrend On Friday, Bitcoin jumped nearly 3% to hit a two-month high of $123,894. The flagship crypto has seen a massive recovery from last week’s correction, surging 14% from the local lows. Earlier this week, BTC reclaimed the $115,000-$117,000 area, which served as a key support zone during the early Q3 rally, before surging to the crucial $120,000 barrier on Thursday. Amid its bullish performance, analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that Bitcoin was able to secure a daily close above this level, skipping a retest of the recently reclaimed $117,000 mark. He explained that a daily close above $120,000, followed by a successful post-breakout retest, has historically preceded a move to the $123,00 resistance, with a nearly identical daily performance leading to the mid-August all-time high (ATH) of $124,474. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows noted that if BTC successfully holds the $120,000-$121,000 zone, it will reach highs soon. On the contrary, he warned that losing this area could lead to a retest of the $117,000 as support. Nonetheless, he considers that Bitcoin’s price might not see another massive correction in the short term, as history suggests the cryptocurrency might have bottomed during the late-September pullback. “BTC historically bottoms in September. Since 2016, Bitcoin has bottomed 7 times in September. (…) Historically, this means BTC bottom is most likely in and it won’t go lower than $107K,” he asserted. Analyst Crypto Jelle forecasted that price discovery could resume as early as next week, pointing out that holding the $120,000 level as support over the weekend and closing above it in the weekly timeframe would set a strong base for the long-awaited Q4 rally. Is BTC’s Top A Few Weeks Away? As the flagship cryptocurrency is on the “cusp of entering Price Discovery Uptrend 3,” Rekt Capital also shared a potential timeline for Bitcoin’s cycle top based on its previous post-halving performances. The analyst previously shared his 2025 roadmap for BTC’s rally, suggesting that it could see an extended cycle or potentially enjoy a third Price Discovery Uptrend before the bear market, which would push the cycle peak into deeper stages of 2025. In a video analysis, he suggested that BTC’s top could arrive in the next two weeks to two months. As he explained, Bitcoin peaked around 520 days after the 2016 Halving event, while it topped nearly 550 days after the 2020 event. If it had repeated its 2017 timeline, BTC would have had to peak around September, meaning that the August ATH was the cycle top. The analyst dismissed this possibility, suggesting that a repeat of its 2021 price action was more likely. In this case, BTC would need to peak in the next two weeks. Related Reading: Analyst Forecast Ethereum (ETH) Breakout To $6,900 As Price Retests Crucial Resistance However, Rekt Capital laid a third scenario in which Bitcoin tops around mid-November. This timeline would follow the theory that the cycle peak timeline is increasing by 30 days at a time, signaling that this cycle’s peak would happen around the 580-day mark post-halving. “If we are looking at the four-year cycle, the most important thing is to just wrap everything up in candle one. That’s historically what’s been the case,” he explained. “So, at least two weeks and maybe still a month and a half to a maximum of two months. But beyond that, I don’t think we’ll be lengthening.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|btc|BTC ATH|BTC breakout|BTC price discovery|BTCUSDT|crypto analyst|Crypto Bull Run 2025|crypto market correction|Crypto Market Recovery|Crypto trader,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-10-04 09:00:59

Ayo Akinyele is spearheading efforts to position the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as the top choice for institutions by prioritizing privacy-first innovations. In a recent blog post published on October 2, Akinyele emphasized that the key to meeting institutional demands lies in combining the transparency of public blockchains with confidentiality. Akinyele pointed out that privacy on-chain should be a baseline protection for the encryption that secures online banking. He cited zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a type of cryptography that establishes the veracity of a statement without disclosing the underlying information, as a means of facilitating private but law-abiding transactions. Akinyele suggested Know Your Customer (KYC) as an example of completing the process without disclosing identities to the entire network. According to Akinyele, organizations will not transfer essential processes to public ledgers unless confidentiality is built into them. He added that regulators will not approve public ledgers if accountability is not present. Akinyele emphasized that wallet infrastructure, selective disclosure, and ZKPs are designed to close that gap. Akinyele drives XRPL’s privacy-first push for institutional DeFi “Without privacy, financial institutions cannot safely use public ledgers. Without accountability, regulators cannot sign off. With programmable privacy, we can have both.” https://t.co/fo83mCmhCW Meet J. Ayo Akinyele @ja_akinyele , cryptographer and RippleX Senior Director of… — RippleX (@RippleXDev) October 2, 2025 Akinyele stated that he is committed to making XRPL the go-to option for organizations seeking trust and innovation throughout the upcoming year 2026. According to Akinyele, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will be essential for enhancing scalability and facilitating private, legal transactions. He stated that the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, activated on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) mainnet on October 1, 2025, will represent a significant advancement in the on-chain representation of complex financial products. The Ripple Engineer confirmed that Confidential MPTs will introduce privacy-preserving tokenized collateral to the market in 2026. Akinyele confirmed that confidential MPTs will be a necessary step for institutional adoption of DeFi and tokenized RWAs. “The future of blockchains belongs to builders who remove unnecessary trust. If we can prove correctness, prevent misuse, and give users confidence that their assets and data are safe, then blockchain tech won’t just scale, it will transform finance.” ~ Ayo Akinyele, Senior Director of Engineering at Ripple Institutional DeFi has reached a transaction volume of $1 billion, marking a significant milestone in its transition from pilot initiatives, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), stablecoin transactions, and lending protocols. In the past year, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has established itself as a settlement layer that both regulated financial institutions and crypto-native businesses trust, and broken into the Top 10 chains for real-world assets (RWAs). According to Akinyele, the introduction of XRPL Version 3.0, a protocol-level lending system that permits pooled lending and underwritten credit, is a key component of this approach. Ripple’s team claimed that XRPL version 3.0 aims to establish its position in the upcoming stage of institutional finance by utilizing XRP as a utility token for collateral management and settlement. The Ripple engineer confirmed that the capacity of XRPL to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) and expedite cross-border payments is driving its institutional adoption. Akinyele champions XRPL’s bridge for institutional assets Akinyele thinks that scalability must not come at the expense of security or decentralization. To mitigate market-structure risks without reverting to intermediaries, Akinyele emphasized the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs). The (TEEs) will help in equitable transaction sequencing to prevent front-running and confidential computing for executing sensitive functionality off-chain, while producing verifiable outputs. The Ripple engineer also positioned XRPL as “uniquely positioned to bridge” what he described as “many trillions of dollars in assets set to move on-chain over the coming decade,” citing the ledger’s decade-long operating history, built-in decentralized exchange, escrow, and payment channels as finance-oriented primitives already at the protocol layer.

The XRP community is now in that stage. Ripple’s longtime Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has announced his decision to step back from his daily role , marking a significant milestone for both Ripple and XRP. Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle), a prominent crypto expert and researcher on X, released a video offering his perspective on the news. He remarked that “every revolution has a moment when the builder steps aside,” comparing Schwartz’s decision with Satoshi leaving Bitcoin and leadership transitions in Ethereum. He framed Schwartz’s move as XRP reaching that same stage, where its growth no longer depends on one figure but on the strength of the network and adoption surrounding it. The JOB COMPLETE Signal Is Here #XRP ’s Endgame Next!!! pic.twitter.com/icfKsr8WQv — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 2, 2025 The Next Phase for XRP Schwartz has not departed from Ripple entirely; he will transition into an emeritus role and maintain involvement on the company’s board. This adjustment means Ripple retains Schwartz’s expertise while allowing new leadership to guide the next phase of growth. Bull Winkle framed Schwartz’s decision as a signal of strength rather than weakness, remarking that “he didn’t leave here because of weakness. He left because XRP is strong enough to run without him.” The timing of his step back is central to the narrative. Ripple has built relationships with over 300 banking and financial institutions worldwide, a foundation that continues to support the case for XRP’s long-term utility in cross-border payments and settlement. As partnerships expand, the role of an individual executive becomes less central to XRP’s path forward, reinforcing the argument that the digital asset is now positioned for institutional-scale growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation for ETFs and Institutional Demand A key factor shaping the current anticipation is the prospect of U.S.-based spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Several pending applications have October deadlines , creating heightened expectations. This window could mark a turning point for XRP and bring a new wave of institutional investment into the ecosystem. Ripple Bull Winkle linked Schwartz’s step back to this development, saying it comes “right when ETFs, banks, and institutional adoption are all lined up for XRP.” He sees the transition as timely and aligned with broader momentum. Schwartz will remain involved as a strategic voice in the community. Ripple’s partnerships worldwide and upcoming ETF decisions position XRP for one of its most significant periods yet.

Expert Comments,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-rally-continue-after-bitcoins-recent-surge-expert-comments/,"Bitcoin has been showing a strong rise since the beginning of October, confirming the phrase “Uptober” frequently used by cryptocurrency investors. As of today, the Bitcoin price has climbed above $123,000, just a few hundred dollars shy of its all-time high recorded in mid-August. BTC has been trending upwards for the past five days. Bitcoin's steady appreciation despite market volatility caused by the US government shutdown was driven by a report published by JPMorgan analysts. The report predicted that Bitcoin could reach $165,000 by the end of the year. Analysts argued that Bitcoin stands out as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Related News: Two Top Officials at the Federal Reserve, Jefferson and Logan, Discussed Interest Rate Cuts and the U.S. Economy Crypto advocates have long argued that Bitcoin's decentralized nature can provide a safe haven during times of government-driven uncertainty. Investors' recent interest in Bitcoin, particularly in the face of threats of new tariffs, supports this argument. JPMorgan has stated that Bitcoin is still “undervalued” compared to traditional hedges like gold. Bitcoin's rally is being accompanied by other cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum rising nearly 9% in the past week, reaching $4,500. However, not everyone is as optimistic as JPMorgan. Alex Blume, CEO of investment advisory firm Two Prime, described this rise as a “fragile rally.” Blume said the rise could be due to expected market movements in the final quarter of the year, adding that the increased money supply coupled with the Fed's interest rate cuts provides a clear advantage for Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

BTC near $124k with strong institutional spot demand Open Interest hit a fresh $90B ATH and short-term holders moved significant supply to exchanges. Bitcoin Dominance holds ~59% and long-term holding rates have increased, limiting alt rotation. Bitcoin retest $124k: BTC nears ATH on heavy spot inflows and rising LTH conviction — read analysis and next steps. What is driving Bitcoin’s retest of $124k? Bitcoin retest $124k is being driven by large institutional spot inflows, rising long-term holder accumulation, and elevated derivatives open interest. These dynamics have boosted bid-side liquidity and reduced the altcoin rotation that previously amplified leverage flushes. How significant are derivatives and open interest for BTC price action? Open Interest (OI) recently set a new $90 billion all-time high, a 7% rise from the prior peak. High OI increases liquidation risk but paired with strong spot flows, it signals greater participation rather than purely speculative excess. Source: CryptoQuant (data reported as on-chain and derivatives metrics). BTC is trading roughly 1.3% below the prior $124k ATH as the market evaluates whether available bids can absorb potential long liquidation events. Historically, similar OI peaks preceded short-term volatility when leveraged positions were overexposed. Why are short-term holder flows important for the current setup? Short-term holder (STH) activity is a key liquidity signal. In the current window, 46k BTC flowed from STHs to exchanges, representing the largest 24-hour STH-to-exchange spike on record. That movement shows weak hands are being shaken out as prices approach resistance, reducing the pool of immediately liquid supply. At the same time, STH on-chain cost bases flipped above $111k and realized profit rates rose, indicating many recent participants are now in profit and may be less motivated to sell on minor pullbacks. Image of STH dynamics: Source: CryptoQuant How do ETF flows and Bitcoin Dominance affect breakout odds? ETF spot inflows continue to underpin BTC bids. On October 3rd, ETFs recorded an inflow of $985 million, reinforcing a structural bid beneath price. Simultaneously, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is holding near 59%, which limits capital rotation into altcoins and concentrates demand back into BTC. When BTC.D remains elevated, altcoin performance underperforms and speculative rotation is restricted, lowering the probability of a broad market derisking that previously triggered deeper corrections. When could a leverage flush still occur? A leverage flush becomes more likely if open interest collapses rapidly while spot flows dry up and BTC.D falls sharply as capital rotates into alts. Monitoring OI trends, ETF net flows, and exchange inflows from STHs provides the earliest warning signs of renewed downside pressure.

The lawsuit, filed in 2022, alleged that Yuga Labs misled buyers into expecting profits from their NFT purchases. In his decision, Olguin said the NFTs were marketed as digital collectibles offering exclusive membership benefits, not as profit-seeking investments. “The fact that defendants promised that NFTs would confer future, as opposed to immediate, consumptive benefits does not alone transmute those benefits from consumptive to investment-like in nature,” he wrote. The court found that there was no “common enterprise” between buyers and Yuga Labs—an essential component under the Howey Test. The NFTs were tradable on public blockchains and lacked any ongoing financial arrangement between purchasers and the company. NEWS: A California judge ruled Bored Ape NFTs are not securities, tossing the class-action suit against Yuga Labs Unlike Top Shot & DraftKings, BAYC was sold on 3rd-party marketplaces, and royalties weakened the “common enterprise” link Major precedent for NFT securities law pic.twitter.com/yBhyZjw08L — Now Media (@nowmedia) October 3, 2025 Legal experts noted the significance of the ruling. “Statements about NFT prices and trade volumes are a somewhat closer call, but even then, these statements by themselves fail to establish an expectation of profit,” Olguin added. Consensys attorney Bill Hughes pointed out that fees collected by Yuga were independent of NFT pricing, further weakening the plaintiffs’ case. The court also said that general statements about value or future plans did not equate to promises of profit. The ruling strengthens the argument that most NFTs, particularly those designed as digital collectibles with access features, do not fall under existing US securities regulations, setting precedent for other ongoing cases in the space. Nike and StockX Settle NFT Trademark Dispute Ahead of Trial As reported, Nike and StockX have settled their nearly three-year legal battle over sneaker-linked NFTs, bringing an abrupt end to a closely watched case that could have set new precedent for digital asset and intellectual property law. The agreement, filed last Friday in New York federal court, cancels a jury trial scheduled for October and dismisses all claims with prejudice. The lawsuit began in 2022 when Nike accused StockX of trademark infringement over its “Vault” NFTs, which used Nike-branded sneakers. The conflict intensified when Nike alleged that StockX had sold counterfeit shoes, claims partially upheld in March, when a judge ruled StockX had sold fake Nikes to both investigators and a customer. The settlement spares both parties from further reputational and legal risk. This development follows Nike’s broader retreat from digital collectibles. The company’s web3 arm, RTFKT, announced it would shut down operations by early 2025, citing a shift to legacy preservation. The closure has drawn investor backlash, with some alleging they were left holding worthless digital assets after the sudden pivot.

Dogecoin price prediction models are celebrating technical patterns, and Shiba Inu builds ambitious Layer 2 infrastructure, but both legacy tokens struggle against utility limitations. Layer Brett ‘s over $4.2 million presale momentum and 610% staking rewards represent a key shift from traditional memecoin limitations toward dedicated Layer 2 infrastructure that moves beyond these barriers constraining DOGE and SHIB. What is behind this driving force? Why DOGE Golden Cross Patterns Hit Utility Walls at Key Resistance DOGE’s recent golden cross formation has generated significant bullish sentiment, yet price action remains trapped in the $0.21-$0.22 range with stubborn resistance at $0.225. This technical pattern historically signals momentum shifts, but Dogecoin’s fundamental architecture limits its ability to capitalize on institutional interest flowing into the space. Institutional ETF speculation has driven DOGE trading volumes to approximately 808.9 million, yet this increased activity has exposed the network’s scalability constraints. When institutional money seeks efficient execution and retail traders pile in simultaneously, Dogecoin’s infrastructure becomes a limiting factor. The gap between technical optimism and fundamental capacity creates sideways trading patterns despite bullish chart formations. Newer architecture is needed to address these limitations while maintaining memecoin appeal. DOGE’s reliance on outdated blockchain technology isn’t going to cut it much longer. SHIB Bridge Hacks Expose Infrastructure Limits Legacy Memecoins Face Shiba Inu’s massive Shibarium bridge hack involving BONE tokens highlights security vulnerabilities that emerge when legacy memecoins attempt ecosystem expansion through retrofitted solutions. While SHIB developers work on LEASH v2 migration to rebuild confidence, these incidents reveal how adding utility layers to existing memecoin frameworks creates new attack vectors rather than solving fundamental limitations. The SHIB-DOGE trading pair hitting record lows since November 2021 demonstrates how ecosystem complications can harm relative performance. Despite trading volumes exceeding 1 trillion tokens, Shiba Inu struggles to break above its 200-day moving average while dealing with security concerns that undermine investor confidence. These challenges illustrate why building utility on top of memecoin foundations creates more problems than solutions. Brett’s Layer 2 Evolution Transcends Traditional Memecoin Ceilings Layer Brett represents a fundamental evolution beyond the limitations constraining both DOGE and SHIB by combining meme energy with purpose-built Layer 2 technology. While traditional memecoins hit utility ceilings due to foundational blockchain constraints, $LBRETT operates on infrastructure designed for scalability, security, and genuine utility from inception. The project’s rapid progression to $4.2 million in presale funding shows off the recognition that next-generation memecoins require next-generation blockchain architecture. The 610% staking rewards offered by Layer Brett aren’t promotional gimmicks but sustainable features enabled by efficient Layer 2 economics that legacy memecoins cannot match. Unlike DOGE’s limited utility or SHIB’s bridge-dependent ecosystem additions, Layer Brett’s staking operates natively within its blockchain environment, eliminating security risks and efficiency bottlenecks that constrain traditional memecoin growth. From Technical Patterns to Dedicated Blockchain Infrastructure Revolution The transition from analyzing technical patterns on constrained networks to evaluating purpose-built blockchain infrastructure represents a maturation in memecoin investment strategy that traditional Dogecoin price prediction models cannot adequately capture. While DOGE golden crosses and SHIB ecosystem developments generate headlines, Layer Brett’s infrastructure-first approach addresses the fundamental scalability and utility challenges that create resistance levels and security vulnerabilities in legacy memecoins. Layer Brett’s presale success and sustainable staking rewards prove that investors increasingly recognize the limitations of retrofitting utility onto outdated blockchain foundations.

Filings are marked “subject to completion” after the SEC updated streamlined spot-ETF rules. Proposals include ADA + Staking, AVAX + Staking, DOT + Staking and dedicated funds for LINK, LTC, XLM. crypto ETFs: REXShares & Osprey filed 21 altcoin ETF proposals including staking-enabled funds — read concise coverage and key takeaways. What did REXShares and Osprey file on October 4, 2025? REXShares and Osprey Funds jointly submitted applications for 21 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , covering established altcoins and newer tokens. The filings, labeled “subject to completion,” list assets from Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) to Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Sei (SEI). Which assets and structures are included in the filings? The proposals include staking-capable products such as ADA + Staking , AVAX + Staking and DOT + Staking , plus dedicated funds for Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and emerging projects TAO, HYPE and SUI. Filings explicitly note that some funds are structured to incorporate on-chain staking rewards into fund returns. Asset Proposed Fund Staking Included Cardano (ADA) ADA + Staking ETF Yes Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX + Staking ETF Yes Polkadot (DOT) DOT + Staking ETF Yes How do staking-enabled ETFs differ from standard crypto ETFs? Staking-enabled ETFs are designed to capture on-chain staking rewards and reflect them in NAV calculations. That structure requires custodial and operational arrangements to stake holdings securely while maintaining liquidity for fund redemptions. Regulators will evaluate how staking yields are earned, reported and distributed within a regulated ETF wrapper. Why does SEC rule change matter for these filings? The Securities and Exchange Commission’s finalized general rules for cryptocurrency spot ETFs simplified listing procedures, reducing the need for bespoke reviews. This procedural change enabled REXShares and Osprey to submit a broad slate of proposals simultaneously, increasing the likelihood of faster processing compared with prior case-by-case approaches. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot — and 18 More ETFs Just Filed"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""REXShares and Osprey filed 21 crypto ETF applications on Oct 4, 2025, spanning major altcoins and staking-enabled funds; filings are 'subject to completion.'"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/2025/10/04/21-altcoin-etfs-filed"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor the progress of these ETF filings"", ""description"": ""Steps to track regulatory progress and fund launch indicators for the 21 ETF proposals."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review official filing notices"", ""text"": ""Read the filings listed as 'subject to completion' to confirm fund scope and staking mechanics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track SEC calendar and statements"", ""text"": ""Watch for SEC orders, comment periods and approval notices related to spot and staking ETF rules."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor custody and staking disclosures"", ""text"": ""Assess custodian arrangements and how staking rewards are collected, allocated and reported."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which assets are included in the 21 ETF filings?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The filings cover Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and newer projects such as Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Sei (SEI)."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are the filings final?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The proposals are listed as 'subject to completion' and will proceed through SEC review under new generalized spot-ETF rules."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will staking ETFs pay out rewards to investors?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Proposals indicate staking rewards are incorporated into fund returns, but distribution mechanics depend on fund documents and custodian arrangements."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Which tokens are in the filings beyond ADA, AVAX and DOT?

The company’s monthly production rose 27% from September 2024, mining 629 BTC and selling 445 BTC for approximately $48.7 million at an average price of $109,568. In its Friday update, CleanSpark reported that its fleet efficiency improved 26% year over year, while its average operating hashrate for the month reached 45.6 EH/s. Push for Financial Independence CleanSpark has been selling a portion of its monthly Bitcoin production since April as part of its strategy to become financially self-sufficient. It also opened an institutional Bitcoin trading desk to facilitate these sales. In August, the company generated $60.7 million from the sale of 533.5 BTC, demonstrating the scale of its operations. The miner’s shares on Nasdaq rose 5.28% following the report and gained more than 23% over the week, according to Yahoo Finance. The broader market has also been buoyant. The market capitalization of 15 major publicly traded Bitcoin miners reached a record $58.1 billion in September, up from $41.6 billion in August and more than double the $19.9 billion recorded in March, according to The Miner Mag. Challenges Ahead for Bitcoin Miners Despite investor enthusiasm for mining stocks, the industry faces increasing headwinds. Higher energy costs and the risk of tariffs on imported mining equipment could weigh on profitability. In August, The Miner Mag reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection alleged some of CleanSpark’s 2024 mining rigs were manufactured in China. This could leave the company with potential tariff liabilities of up to $185 million. Iris Energy (IREN), the largest Bitcoin miner by market capitalization, is also contesting a separate $100 million tariff dispute with the agency. According to Cointelegraph, the effective duty on China-made mining rigs stands at 57.6%, while machines imported from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand face tariffs of 21.6%. Rising Mining Difficulty Bitcoin mining difficulty reached record highs in September and October. This means miners now expend more computing power and energy to produce the same amount of Bitcoin, putting further pressure on operational costs. CleanSpark’s push for efficiency and its growing BTC reserves highlight its determination to navigate these challenges while maintaining financial independence.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-04 09:15:33

He remarked, “Instead of hiring one more person on your team, you could just use Comet to supplement all the work that you’re doing,” noting that the AI browser lets people handle more tasks faster, the time saved could translate into $10,000 in value per year per individual. He added that human digital knowledge work represents about $25 trillion of GDP, so raising efficiency by 20% could inject about $5 trillion. Austan Goolsbee, President of the Chicago Fed, also noted that AI has the potential to drive GDP growth by increasing productivity and enhancing service quality. However, he stressed the significant costs associated with AI infrastructure. Goolsbee cautioned that AI growth could fall short According to Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, businesses are increasingly using AI to reduce hiring and streamline operations, but the overall labour impact remains small for now. Goolsbee, however, cautioned that firms should also consider the chance that AI may not scale as much as expected. He stated, “Might we get over our skis a bit with over-investment and have to clean up if there were a bubble? I think we do want to think about that topic.” Barbara Corcoran, a longtime investor, also said in an interview with CNBC Make It that AI isn’t an “act now or lose out” opportunity. She noted that many entrepreneurs are diving in without a clear sense of its benefits. She also warned that when business owners lack a clear strategy for utilizing AI, they risk wasting both time and money. Nonetheless, corporations like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are planning to pour up to $320 billion into AI and data centers in 2025. Perplexity’s Comet browser is now available free globally Perplexity made its Comet browser available to users globally at no charge on Thursday. The startup has also introduced a new “background assistant” in Comet, available to select paying subscribers, to manage multiple tasks. Comet debuted three months ago for Perplexity’s $200-per-month Max plan members, sparking millions to join its waitlist. The browser centers around a sidecar assistant that helps answer questions, summarize information, manage content, and guide your browsing. The decision to offer Comet at no cost comes as Perplexity takes on big names like Chrome and fresh entrants like Dia. For instance, OpenAI rolled out its web agent, Operator, in January, while Google added Gemini AI to Chrome in September. Anthropic also announced a browser-based AI agent in August. At its core, Perplexity is recognized for its AI search engine that delivers clear responses and directs users to original sources. Last year, after plagiarism claims, the startup established a revenue-sharing program with media outlets. In August, the company launched Comet Plus, a paid subscription offering content from “trusted publishers and journalists.” Perplexity recently announced its first partners: CNN, Condé Nast, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Fortune, Le Monde, and Le Figaro. Perplexity also teased upcoming additions, like a mobile version of Comet and a Background Assistant designed to work on multiple tasks asynchronously.

The delay stems from a combination of procedural changes at the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. In the days leading up to the shutdown, the SEC approved generic listing standards that eliminate the need for case-by-case 19b-4 filings. In this case, exchanges were instructed to withdraw their pending applications under the old system, paving the way for a more streamlined framework that would speed up approvals once operations resumed. Stalled ETF momentum For now, however, cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that the shutdown has stalled that momentum. With large portions of the SEC’s workforce furloughed, the agency is limited to handling fraud cases and emergencies, leaving routine but essential processes, such as sign-offs from the Division of Corporation Finance, on hold. Without that clearance, trading for proposed spot ETFs tied to XRP, Solana , and Litecoin cannot begin, regardless of the new rules. The delay is excruciating for investors who saw October as a breakthrough month, with altcoin ETFs expected to fuel demand and legitimize digital assets. Crypto ETF approval season has officially arrived! https://t.co/85h74ZZ7LS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 30, 2025 Notably, U.S. investors already have access to an XRP ETF through REX-Osprey, which received expedited approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940, cutting its review period to about 75 days compared to the 240-day process under the Securities Act of 1933. Overall, this setback comes as the broader cryptocurrency market regains bullish momentum led by Bitcoin, with many investors shrugging off the effects of the Washington shutdown.

This $0.035 Altcoin Will Leave Them Behind,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-vs-cardano-ada-which-crypto-will-hit-a-new-ath-first-this-0-035-altcoin-will-leave-them-behind/,"While the next bull cycle for crypto is in the cards, investors are keeping a watchful eye on Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), to see which will break its previous all-time high first. But despite their strengths, both may be outdone by a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s receiving much more attention. Now worth just $0.035, MUTM’s presale is already over 55% sold out in Stage 6, drawing in 16,750+ holders and over $16.8 million in capital. Its lending dual infrastructure, real-utility tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contracts have made it a utility-first DeFi project with blowout upside potential. While SOL and ADA may continue to offer steady growth, the early momentum of Mutuum Finance could propel it past the two and offer much larger gains by the time the next top in the market is attained. Cardano (ADA) Breaks Out of Correction Channel With Bullish Momentum Building Cardano (ADA) is flashing fresh strength after months of consolidation, having respected its long-term support line and broken out of multiple triangle and downward channel charts. The breakout shifted overall sentiment to bullish, and price action is currently consolidating at the $0.80 level, which makes a good base for the next possible leg higher. Experts note that the buying momentum can continue to sustain itself and make ADA test the $0.90 level of resistance, which is a high-recovery point, and even set the stage for a fresh bullish trend in 2025. However, while investors follow ADA’s movement, others are in the meantime studying newer projects with greater upside potential and that is where focus is increasingly gravitating towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Solana Bulls Extend Rally After $190 Demand Bounce Solana made a strong bounce from the $190 demand level and has risen to around $220, confirming that the buyers are still in the driving seat. The bull case is valid as long as SOL is maintaining the $173–$186 demand region; keeping that base strong leaves a clear way to the next higher targets at $230, $242, $254 and $262. Price action is trending in a narrow, step-by-step progression, and every retest is converting old resistance into support, so watch the $220 region for momentum to continue or a broken breakout that would induce a re-test of the demand zone. For investors who are interested in looking further than Layer-1 exposure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surfaced on multiple watchlists unheralded as an alternative. Investor Confidence Surges in Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set another presale record by collecting more than $16.8 million in current phase 6. Tokens are at $0.035, higher from a 16.17% uptick from Phase 5. Investor enthusiasm remains high, with more than 16,750 backers having faith in the long-term vision of the project. Mutuum Finance is accompanied by adaptive LTV and liquidation rates that adjust automatically relative to real-time market conditions in such a manner that the protocol becomes very highly sensitive to volatility. Reserve multipliers would range from 10% for risky assets to 35% for risk-averse assets to ensure a second layer of systemic security. Lending & Borrowing Protocol Development Mutuum Finance recently announced the development of its novel lending and borrowing protocol , with V1 going live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will feature liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateral support Security comes first for Mutuum Finance. It has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, inviting security researchers and developers to hunt bugs and report them and be rewarded for doing so. The bugs are ranked on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low, providing end-to-end security and giving a boost to the security roadmap of the platform. Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are both well-positioned for the next bull run, but both of them don’t carry the same kind of early-stage upside as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With tokens currently $0.035 and over 55% sold out, MUTM’s adaptive risk management, lending platform, and true DeFi utility make it stand out as the undisputed winner. Backed by $16.8 million raised and 16,750+ backers, it’s quickly becoming the project most poised to overtake both SOL and ADA, and potentially even offer exponential returns before they even reach new all-time highs.

According to reports, the country’s central bank foresees a credit growth of about 20% before the end of 2025. Pham Thanh Ha, deputy governor of the central bank, mentioned on Friday that there needs to be more interest rate cuts to encourage economic growth and steer the country out of the uncertainty from the US-imposed tariffs, according to a report by Reuters. United States President Donald Trump introduced an array of tariffs on April 2, which affected the markets and divided observers. While the effect on the market has been limited, Vietnam wants to limit the effect of the uncertainty on its economy. Vietnam makes shift towards digital assets In June, the Vietnamese government announced the legalization of digital assets as part of a broader technology regulation. The National Assembly announced the legalization of the assets, approving it under the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14. The law, which is expected to take effect on January 1, 2026, will see Vietnam categorize digital assets as either virtual assets representing real-world tokenized products or crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The law also mandates cybersecurity and anti-money laundering regulations aligned with international standards, an effort likely aimed at addressing concerns brought up by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on the FATF gray list since 2023, and under the new regulation, the country will be tasked with outlining specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for the different classes of assets. In addition, the country launched a 5-year crypto market pilot that would bring stricter controls to the crypto industry. Under the pilot program, the government has also announced a prohibition on issuing on-chain fiat-backed assets, including stablecoins and securities. The program, which has been effected after the announcement, will require crypto transactions, including issuance, trading, and payments, to be carried out in its native currency, the dong. APAC region sees big jump in crypto transaction volumes Vietnam has been predicted to become a regional hub for crypto in Southeast Asia due to the focus of its government on emerging technology. Other factors that have helped the country include its youthful population, robust crypto adoption, pushing it into the fourth position on the Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region remains the fastest-growing in terms of crypto adoption. According to Chainalysis, nine out of the top 20 countries on its Global Crypto Adoption Index are located in the region. The APAC region experienced 69% year-over-year growth in crypto value received as transaction volumes rose from $1.4 trillion to over $2.3 trillion in 2025. The adoption was led by India, Vietnam, and Pakistan, according to data from Chainalysis. Pakistan has been doubling its efforts in the crypto industry at the beginning of the year. Some weeks ago, the country called for exchanges to pick up licenses and begin operations locally. Meanwhile, Vietnam also deployed a national blockchain database for identification and public records in July. The blockchain was designed to serve as the regulated foundation for interacting with the digital economy, on-chain platforms, and internet applications. The blockchain, NDAChain , is a layer 1 network with 49 nodes governed by private-public partnerships. NDAChain is expected to make private data stored on centralized servers secure against cyberattacks by distributing data across a partially decentralized system. Get seen where it counts.

BTC Pushes Higher October (often referred to as “Uptober” within the crypto community) has so far proven its legacy as a highly successful period for the primary digital asset. The price has been gradually increasing since the first day of the month, and it reached $123,850 several hours ago. This means that BTC was just inches away from reaching its all-time high of $124,130, which was witnessed in mid-August. In the following hours, the asset lost some steam, and as of this writing, it trades at roughly $122,400.

52651784,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85271,1759572025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"MUTM’s Path From $0.035 to $2 Looks More Likely Than SHIB Ever Reaching $1, Say Experts",https://timestabloid.com/mutms-path-from-0-035-to-2-looks-more-likely-than-shib/,"This year, the cryptocurrency market has gone through big changes, which has made many buyers look for safe ways to add to their holdings. Meme coins like SHIB get a lot of attention, but their volatility has made more traders and institutional investors look for structured decentralized finance options that offer real returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the best options for investors looking for steady growth, real use, and good long-term prospects. Analysts say that MUTM is much better than hype-driven tokens because of its strong foundations, long-term plan, and strong pre-sale demand. SHIB Ever Reaching $1 The idea of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching $1 has long fascinated its community, but in realistic terms, it faces enormous hurdles. SHIB currently trades in the fractions of a cent, with a circulating supply of around 589 trillion tokens. For SHIB to hit $1, its market capitalization would need to surpass $589 trillion — a figure that is more than five times the total global GDP and nearly 600x larger than Bitcoin’s current market cap. This makes a $1 price target virtually impossible under existing supply conditions. However, SHIB does have mechanisms like token burns aimed at reducing supply, alongside growing utility through the Shibarium Layer-2 network and its ecosystem of decentralized apps. These factors could help SHIB climb in value over time, but even aggressive burns and adoption would likely only push SHIB toward modest fractions of a cent rather than the mythical $1 milestone. Dual Lending, Collateral Protection, and Treasury Mechanics At the moment, Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale costs $0.035, and about $16.8 million has been raised so far. Of the 170 million tokens that were available, 55 million have been sold. With over 16,750 users and a total supply of 4 billion MUTM, investors are keeping a close eye on the next Phase 7 price rise to $0.040, which will be a 15% rise. Now is a very important time for buyers to buy MUTM tokens at a lower price before the price goes up. The successful presale shows that more and more people want a token that can be used for more than just trading in a decentralized lending and borrowing environment. With Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending choices, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its dual lending models. In P2C, users can earn mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio with competitive APYs when they invest well-known tokens like ETH. For example, a $18,000 ETH deposit that earns 15% APY would bring in $2,700 a year in idle income. Overcollateralized lending is good for borrowers; for example, a $1,500 ADA at 70% LTV frees up $1,050 in cash. The P2P function separates more volatile tokens like SHIB and FLOKI, so lending can happen without putting the main liquidity pool at risk. This design makes it easy for a lot of people to participate while keeping the system stable. The security of the whole platform is improved by collateral and liquidation methods. All loans need to be backed up by more collateral than the loan itself. The protocol’s Stability Factor actively watches positions and initiates liquidations when collateral falls below safe levels. Liquidators buy discounted collateral to restore protocol health, creating a fair incentive structure. With an 80% liquidation threshold, assets with lower volatility can keep their higher LTVs, while tokens with higher volatility can keep their 35–55% LTVs with a ~65% barrier. This well-balanced approach lowers the risk and builds investor trust, especially during market changes that make people wonder why crypto is down today. Dynamic liquidity tactics are another way that market volatility is controlled. When there is enough on-chain liquidity, liquidations can happen quickly and with little slippage. Reserve factors take a small amount of borrower interest to build an on-chain safety buffer. All of these steps protect the protocol and make MUTM more valuable as a utility token, which opens up long-term investment possibilities for people interested in cryptocurrencies. Giveaways and Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also offers a robust user interface with a comprehensive dashboard and a Top 50 leaderboard. Investors can track their holdings, calculate projected ROI, and earn bonus MUTM tokens based on their ranking. Security has been validated with a CertiK audit scoring 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, supplemented by a $50,000 bug bounty with tiered rewards and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway for ten winners. The project’s strong social footprint includes 12K+ Twitter followers, demonstrating an active and engaged community. Early buyers show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a lot of value potential. A Phase 2 buyer who bought 150,000 MUTM for $0.015 now has assets worth $0.035, which is a return of 2.3X. With the planned beta launch, the integration of Layer-2, which will lower transaction costs and speed up the process, and the expected listings on top exchanges like Kraken and MEXC, these investors are set to make even more money. These changes let users try out the lending and borrowing process for themselves. This will likely lead to more adoption and higher demand, which could support the $2 goal that was set for the next 12 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has real use, predictable mechanisms, and structured returns, unlike meme coins like SHIB that depend on market opinion and hype. Institutional investors are turning their attention to crypto ETF trends that show projects with measurable yield possibilities. Individual investors are doing the same. Cryptocurrency prices change all the time right now, but MUTM’s presale structure, functional community, and roadmap milestones make it a better choice for long-term crypto investing. The limited supply in Phase 6 is making people move quickly, and investors will be rewarded for doing so when the next price in Phase 7 is set at $0.040. In the DeFi space, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a unique situation to gain both attention and value. It provides structured, clear, and profitable investment opportunities for people who want to move beyond speculative meme tokens.

XRP has often been positioned as a candidate for this role, given its focus on speed and efficiency in value transfer. Adding to this conversation, Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and recognized voice in the XRP community, recently shared his views on how liquidity defines XRP’s future. His perspective came in response to a video where Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within the next five years. I keep telling everyone, the problem crypto solves is liquidity. You can't print more money to create liquidity, that will just collapse fiat. But you can have limitless (almost unlimited) liquidity simply by having say a token like XRP reaches $10k, that will create over $800T… https://t.co/YpLUe6Sgal — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 2, 2025 Liquidity as a Core Function Van Code argued that the central issue digital assets solve is liquidity itself. According to him, increasing fiat supply cannot create sustainable liquidity because it risks weakening traditional currencies. In contrast, he suggested that digital assets such as XRP offer a different dynamic, pointing to the possibility of “limitless” liquidity. He explained that if XRP were to reach a valuation of $10,000 per token , it would generate over $800 trillion in liquidity. He clarified that this would not function in the same way as fiat markets, because an attempt to withdraw the full amount into fiat would immediately affect price levels in a manner resembling a logarithmic decline. By this reasoning, liquidity in digital assets is not limited to fiat comparisons but instead operates through depth of markets and valuation scaling. His statement, “limitless liquidity is what you will be hearing over the next few years,” reflects his view that digital tokens provide a framework for scaling transactions without the constraints that limit traditional currencies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Relevance to the XRP Ledger Van Code’s view on liquidity is based on the XRP Ledger, built to handle high transaction volumes with speed, low costs, and finality. If liquidity scales as he suggests, the XRPL could serve as the foundation for global settlement . His remarks complement Ripple’s vision for XRP in financial infrastructure. While Garlinghouse pointed to XRP capturing 14% of SWIFT’s traffic, Van Code emphasized liquidity mechanics, framing XRP as more than just a bridge asset. Outlook for Growth If adoption and valuation increase, the XRPL could emerge as a leading network for liquidity across markets. This also positions XRP as a potential solution to institutional demand for scalable financial settlement. Though Van Code’s projection depends on a sharp rise in XRP’s price , his point remains that the ledger’s architecture supports sustainable liquidity.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase has applied for a National Trust Charter to expand financial services under clearer regulation. The move would reduce reliance on third-party banks for fiat transactions while avoiding traditional banking status. Circle and Ripple have filed similar applications. The filing positions Coinbase among a growing list of digital asset companies pursuing the same license, including Circle and Ripple. Coinbase Says Trust Charter Will Bridge Crypto and Traditional Finance In a statement on Friday , Coinbase said the charter would support its long-term objective of aligning more closely with traditional finance while continuing to build on its digital asset foundation. “We’re expanding our business capabilities and regulatory oversight beyond the existing framework, paving the way for innovation and growth in building a modern financial system powered by digital assets,” the company said. Despite the move, Coinbase was clear that it has no plans to become a traditional bank. “Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security,” the statement read. The license, if granted, would allow Coinbase to offer payments and other financial services without depending on third-party banks for on- and off-ramps. The crypto market is global, and we need uniform national rules to protect every consumer as the market continues to evolve. That’s why we’ve applied for a @USOCC national trust charter and the federal regulatory oversight and clarity that it provides. — Coinbase (@coinbase) October 3, 2025 Luke Youngblood, a former Coinbase engineer behind the exchange’s staking program, explained on a recent podcast that a trust charter would give Coinbase the flexibility to directly manage fiat inflows and outflows. “No more relying on partner banks,” he said. Youngblood also noted how much Coinbase’s retail platform has improved since he left in 2022. “When I worked there, the debit card didn’t work very well and the app was clunky. Now, you can really tell they’ve hired some top engineering talent.” The filing comes at a time when other major crypto players are also seeking trust licenses. Stablecoin issuer Circle submitted its application on July 1, followed closely by Ripple Labs. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse described the license as a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.” TIME Names Coinbase a 2025 ‘Disruptor’ Among Most Influential Companies As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator. Notably, Coinbase also continued its corporate Bitcoin accumulation. In Q2, the company purchased 2,509 BTC for approximately $222 million, lifting its total holdings to 11,776 BTC and placing it back among the top 10 public holders of the asset, just ahead of Tesla by coin count.

Shiba Inu’s Chart Shows The Spark, PayDax (PDP) Carries The Fire Recently, Shiba Inu traders circulated a chart (see below) showing a breakout from a long downtrend, marked with rocket icons signaling a potential parabolic rally. It’s the classic setup: prices coil, sentiment shifts, and then volume explodes upward. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) gaining over 6% in the past week, traders expect that this move could snowball into a parabolic rally. But Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) problem has always been volatility. The chart above shows just how volatile meme-driven assets like Shiba Inu can be. However, PDP, priced at $0.015 in presale, flips that script. Its structured approach builds steady momentum while still targeting explosive potential upside, positioning it as a stronger contender for the next parabolic rally. With bonuses, referrals, and utilities layered in, PayDax (PDP) sets investors up for a parabolic rally designed for lasting potential gains. The Shiba Inu Trap Or The PayDax (PDP) Advantage? Imagine two investors: Investor A (Shiba Inu) Investor B (PayDax) Buys into SHIB after seeing the breakout chart. The token pumps fast, but within days, it faces sharp corrections. Portfolio swings between +200% and -60% in weeks. Buys into PDP presale at $0.015 with an 80% bonus. As presale demand grows, price appreciation is steady, and bonuses lock in larger allocations before exchange listing. Relies heavily on hype cycles, community sentiment, and viral tweets. Relies on structured tokenomics, adoption-fueling use-cases, Assure DeFi audit , and growing presale momentum. Markets move fast, and while experts agree that both Shiba Inu and PayDax (PDP) are positioned for a potential parabolic rally, the paths look very different. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A chart breakout signals a short-term parabolic rally setup, but extreme volatility makes it hard to sustain gains. Paydax (PDP): As a presale project , much of the upside is already built in. With bonuses and referral incentives layered on, PayDax reduces downside risk while still positioning investors for a powerful parabolic rally once it launches. Shared Momentum: Shiba Inu’s meme-driven surge attracts retail attention, and PayDax is primed to capture that capital rotation as traders search for the next exponential play. In simple terms: if Shiba Inu sparks the flame, PayDax (PDP) is ready to carry it forward into the next parabolic rally. Parabolic Rally In 2 Weeks? The Window For PayDax (PDP) Is Now The next two weeks could define portfolios. Experts are united in predicting a parabolic rally to $1, but while Shiba Inu sparks interest on charts, PayDax (PDP) offers a realistic pathway to sustained profits. A $500 allocation into PayDax (PDP) at the presale price of $0.015, if the projected $1 target is achieved, grows to $33,333 — a +6,566% return. With the presale’s 80% bonus code PD80BONUS, that outcome pushes to $60,000 from the same $500. Referral rewards add another layer of upside. An investor introducing a participant who commits $1,000 secures over 3,300 PDP tokens. Alongside this, PayDax enables yield farming, where staked tokens earn passive returns that accumulate over time. Even modest yields of 20% annually could add thousands of tokens, further amplifying portfolio value. Beyond farming, the PayDax ecosystem includes a lending platform that allows tokens to generate interest while appreciating. This mix of presale bonuses, referral programs, farming, and lending creates a layered profit model with greater upside potential than traditional single-revenue cryptocurrencies. Knowing this, the question remains: will you chase Shiba Inu’s $1 hype and risk another volatile ride, or will you secure PayDax now and stand at the front of a more stable potential parabolic rally to $1?

Market experts, analyzing various indicators and momentum, anticipate a substantial price surge that could potentially reach the $1 mark soon. Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu's recent market behavior is illustrated vividly with the chart below, displaying a breakout from a prolonged downward trend, hinting at an upcoming substantial price increase. Here's a glimpse of the chart that has many traders talking: Linking to the chart's details, traders highlighted this development on social platforms here . Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen over 6% growth in the past week, and given its track record, this uptick could potentially evolve into a much larger gain. However, it's worth noting the inherent volatility in meme-driven assets like SHIB, as shown in the following volatility chart: On the other hand, PayDax takes a more structured approach, beginning its financial journey at $0.015 during its presale phase, and aiming for a robust rally backed by well-thought-out strategies and mechanisms like bonuses and referrals. Investment Strategies and Potential Returns The contrasting investment outcomes between Shiba Inu and PayDax can be best understood by comparing two hypothetical investors: Investor A (Shiba Inu) Investor B (PayDax) Invests based on the breakout chart, experiences significant portfolio fluctuations due to SHIB's high volatility. Enters the market buying PDP at a low $0.015 presale price, enjoying more stability and potential upside from structured growth. Depends on market hype and viral social media activity. Leverages a strategy that includes a sound audit and methodical tokenomics. Conclusion: A New Era in Crypto Investments? Both cryptocurrencies, driven by distinct strategies and market perceptions, are poised for a potential significant rally. Shiba Inu offers the allure of quick gains due to its popularity and media presence. Conversely, PayDax positions itself as a sustainable investment with a solid foundation and lower volatility, illustrated by its strategic pre-sale offerings and bonus structures. The critical question for investors remains: will the allure of rapid gains with high risk in Shiba Inu appeal more, or will the structured and potentially steady growth of PayDax present a more attractive investment?

DGXX's growth relies on capital-intensive projects and frequent share issuance, creating significant dilution risk for shareholders despite being debt-free. The company shows early progress with initiatives like Nvidia Blackwell orders for its NeoCloud AI platform, but scale and competition remain major hurdles. Given high dilution risk, volatile crypto exposure, and unproven financials, I rate DGXX as a hold until tangible results materialize. Digi Power X ( DGXX ) is positioning itself as hybrid company, working in energy, technology and cryptocurrency sector. The company's model is based on three directions: modular Tier III certified ARMS 200 platform development, energy portfolio (~100 MW across three sites, with expansion to >200MW) and crypto mining infrastructure. From first look, this is a good diversification strategy, but then it raises the question if these segments create synergy and aren’t they chosen only as popular topics. Main DGXX narrative is growing AI and Cloud demand, which will need more data centers. They are also talking about potential of their own energy supply to centers, what in theory should lower costs and dependence on others, but these plans require a lot of capital. Their third direction – cryptocurrency mining infrastructure can generate additional revenues in cycle tops, but at the same time it is increasing risk due to crypto volatility. Even though currently DGXX declaring, that they don’t have long-term debt, but they are financing with share issuance, and this is also increasing dilution risk. Currently, they live from “future story” not from stable business, although we see first steps towards stability as in H1 2025 colocation is already generating revenues and AI DC delivery is planned on Q4 2025. AI and Cloud Recently the company has been trying to show that their talks about AI are not just empty promises. One of the moves is an order from Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) for Nvidia Blackwell systems, which will be used on their AI platform NeoCloud. It immediately caught markets attention and shares even though for short time, jumped. This was a good signal that the company is starting to move from theories to real actions. However, we should understand that order of few systems is not the same as becoming AI or Cloud market player. Bigger data centers operators are managing hundreds or thousands of server servers, while DGXX is just starting. Even though the order was a positive step and shows that the company has ambitions, this project does not prove that they are able to compete with bigger market players. Corporate Overview January2025 Tier III One of the main plans – modular Tier III colocation data center development. This decision seems logical, because worldwide AI and Cloud services demand is increasingly growing. And growing demand for calculation power and storage infrastructure, many companies choose to rent a place in certified data centers without needing to build their own. This makes other companies save on costs, and at the same time gives business for players like DGXX. Tier III standard means that data centers will be very reliable, even with technical difficulties they will be able to continue their operations. And this is very important for DGXX clients, because businesses want reliability and stability but are not ready to pay for Tier IV. This position is very attractive, DGXX is aiming for growing mid class segment, and I see a lot of potential there. Currently, the market is very competitive. For example, Equinix or Digital Realty are already in the market, and they have scale advantages. Plus, data center development is a capital heavy venture: infrastructure, licensing, maintenance and so on. And currently, DGXX is financing this through share issuance. Corporate Overview January2025 Energy Integration Narrative The company is not only creating data centers, but they are building their own energy source. From first impression, to me this was a good idea, but then I thought, doesn’t this make them jack of all trades? Yes, having their own energy solution could decrease costs and increase margins, additionally that would cut dependency on external providers and could help with energy spot price volatility, which in recent years became common problem in Europe and US. Again, these types of projects require a lot of investment. Energy projects cost a lot of money, and their ROI is very long, and for micro-caps like DGXX that could become a burden. Again, I believe that this type of project is good but also increases risk of dilution. Corporate Overview January2025 Crypto The fourth DGXX activities direction is crypto mining infrastructure. The management is trying to show that they can make additional revenues from crypto cycles. But this is where I see a lot of issues. It looks good on paper as a diversifying tool – when market experiences a bull run, mining activities could give revenue some boos and increase liquidity. This is an option that gives DGXX additional growth potential if Bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies start to rise. But crypto has negative aspects as well. They are highly volatile, and mining infrastructure is capital heavy, rapidly going out of date technology. Equipment today could be effective, and after few years it could generate losses due to competition or technological advances. Another risky part with crypto currencies is narrative. As I mentioned, the company looks like jack of all trades, and having exposure as investor to crypto, when you wanted AI and data centers is quite dangerous. Seeking Alpha Financial Health DGXX is saying that they do not have a debt (long-term) and it gives them flexibility. But further growth and capital-intensive projects are making them regularly go to investors and do a share issuance. For example, in July 2025. DGXX attracted $15 million through direct offering, selling 4,807, 693 shares for $3.12 each. After this issuance DGXX says they have more than $30 million cash and equivalents and still don’t have debt. In Q2 2025 they additionally attracted $6.6 million through private issuance and $4.5 million through warrants. Even more through ATM program which already has issued 806291 shares with average price of $2.13. We can take a look at smaller example, agreement with NANO Nuclear Energy, they will issue 109677 (subordinated voting shares) as compensation for $250000 debts. Even though this emission is smaller, still it adds up to dilution and shows that they are not afraid to dilute existing shareholders. What does it say about them? The company is announcing debt free, but financing operations through investors, which indeed lowers financial risk due to interest rates for the company, but the risk for investors increases. Seeking Alpha Valuation To evaluate DGXX is very hard task, because they are working in three different segments – data centers, energy projects and crypto infrastructure. Most of the time, companies like these are evaluated by their business stability, cash flow prognosis and peer comparison, but sadly, I can valuate only looking at peer comparison and speculate on potential fair price. If we look at the peer comparison table, we can see that based on multiples the market is fragmented, and investors are mostly investing into “future story” Seeking Alpha DGXX currently is traded at P/S (TTM) 2.51 and EV/Sales 3.33, P/B 3.59, we can compare it to: IDN has P/S ~4.72 and EV/Sales ~4.48 – so DGXX looking cheaper based on these. ZENV with EV/Sales ~2.01 or P/S ~0.34 valued lower, because market has less trust in it’s growth story. NVNI stands near ZENV – EV/Sales ~2.51, P/S ~0.72. We can see that DGXX is somewhere in the middle, it’s more expensive than burnt names (ZENV, NVNI), but cheaper than those that already showed results ((IDN)). This company is in many segments so, as I said, it’s hard to tie it to one sector average. If investors started valuation DGXX as IDN, share price from current $2.62 could go up to around $4.90-5.00 and that would be ~90% upside. And if they could create a stronger data center proof of concept, the market could give it EV/Sales of around 6x, then fair price would be $6.00-6.50 (130-150% upside potential). P/S Implied Price Upside/Downside % Bear (ZENV/NVNI levels) 0.7 0.73 -72.1 Base (Current DGXX) 2.51 2.62 0 Upside (IDN levels) 4.7 4.91 87.3 Bull (Higher premium) 6 6.26 139 Yet, the numbers of upside always look good. Downside is big as well. If we compare it to ZENV or NVNI, which are currently traded at 0.3-0.7 P/S, the fair value could dip to $0.8-1.20, and that would be -55-70% downside. DGXX current valuation is based on trust, not financials. And currently it is expensive, I would be willing to buy when they start showing financial results, not only promises. Summary In short, the risks I see are: Regular share issuance and big dilution risk. Big capital needs (Tier III centers, energy, crypto) Crypto segment is very volatile and could wash the capital away Big competition from other market giants Catalysts: First Tier III colocation center start. New AI/Could orders Energetic integration which would lower costs. Hopefully, crypto rally which would increase revenue in short term. Today DGXX is typical ""future story"" stock, they have three different directions that I feel could stretch their resources. In recent months, they showed us some good moves, like order of Nvidia Blackwell for AI platform ""NeoCloud"", but current scale is not enough. Colocation market is growing, but it is capital heavy and in theory those energy projects we talked could help with the costs. Crypto part of the business is risky and makes me look at the company sceptically, maybe it's my bias against crypto. Financing is mostly done by share issuance, which dilutes shareholders and that is risky too. Due to risk to reward ratio, I am rating this stock as hold.",DGXX|DGX:CA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-04 10:30:08

However, it remains speculative as to whether the premier cryptocurrency will maintain this early October momentum to put in a new all-time-high price, or experience a major correction into deeper liquidity zones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Trap Over? Pundit Reveals Where The Market Is At Right Now Bitcoin Key Levels To Watch: Rally’s Challenge Lies At $125k Resistance In an X post on October 3, key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows shared that Bitcoin is once again approaching critical price levels, backed by data showing trader activity. Pillows based this analysis on the Order Book Heatmap metric, which shows the amount or quantity of pending buy and sell orders at specific price levels on different exchanges. The indicator shows horizontal coloured bands at those price levels, with the colors representing clusters of orders resting around those zones. According to the KOL, Bitcoin has a high amount of sell orders packed around the $125,000 price level. Usually, a zone such as this with clusters of sell orders could act as strong resistance for the price. Interestingly, Ted also cited the presence of a significant amount of buy orders to the downside of the price, specifically around $119,500 and $117,500. As is intuitively obvious, these orders could act as solid support if the flagship cryptocurrency were to experience a correction to this level. Related Reading: BNB Cup-And-Handle Breakout Powers Past $1,050, A Move To $1,100 Next? Cautionary Market Outlook For Bitcoin In a separate X post, Pillows also shares more insights concerning Bitcoin’s price action and what to watch out for in a potential downswing. Notably, the analyst expected Bitcoin to see an accumulation around the $120,000 price level before surging to around $124,000, a prediction that has since played out, leading to a minor retracement. In analyzing the important immediate support levels, the crypto pundit highlighted the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA20), which is currently near $118,447 as a vital threshold. According to Pillows, if Bitcoin holds above this level, the broader trend (which is currently bullish) will most likely be retained. On the other hand, a break below the 30-day Moving Average (MA30), currently around $116,415, may be ominous for the cryptocurrency. The KOL explained that this situation could open the door to “a larger correction toward $112k-$113k,” as more liquidity will be sought after. Therefore, the market remains in a state of anticipation to see if Bitcoin tests its higher resistance at $125,000 or slips back into lower zones to test its support zones. If Bitcoin were to break out of its current resistance zone, the market could see the continuation of its already impressive upward rally into previously uncharted territory. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $122,100, with a fair growth of about 1.6% in the past day.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the parties are in talks to raise at least $200 million. This funding will be used to stock Tether's tokenized gold product, XAUt. Tether issues USDT, the world's largest stablecoin, while Beijing-based Bitmain supplies about 82% of global cryptocurrency mining hardware. Antalpha is a financial services company that works closely with Bitmain. Cohen & Co. is advising on the deal.

Olguin, has reportedly dismissed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs, the blockchain technology company that created the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs collection. The dismissal followed the judge’s ruling that these digital collectibles did not qualify as securities. According to him, the Bored Ape NFTs did not meet several requirements to determine whether financial transactions involving them are considered securities. Judge Olguin was appointed by former US President Barack Obama in 2013. Judge Olguin ruled that Bored Ape NFTs are not securities In his Thursday, October 2 ruling, Olguin pointed out that Bored Ape NFTs differed from other NFT collections previously recognized as securities. Examples of these NFTs include Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot NFTs and DraftKings NFTs. He highlighted this difference mainly because investors prefer to purchase Bored Apes from third-party marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Coinbase, rather than acquiring them directly from the NFT issuer’s marketplace. The federal judge had also discovered that Bored Ape NFTs did not meet the necessary “common enterprise” aspect of the test used to establish an asset as a security. He explained that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate any important relationship between the alleged securities and the proprietary ‘ecosystem’ that supported the case of Dapper Labs and DraftKings. This, therefore, led him to conclude that they had not clearly illustrated a horizontal connection. Another thing that the judge uncovered was that Yuga Labs charges a royalty fee to creators on every sale of Bored Apes. This indicated a difference between the fortunes of the plaintiffs and those of the defendants. This meant that the defendants could still gain profit even if the plaintiffs sold their own NFTs at a loss. These royalties are one of the primary sources of income for NFT creators. To break this down, they earn a built-in fee, mostly over 10%, each time their collectible tokens are sold or traded. Notably, these arguments raised by the judge differ significantly from those employed by the SEC during the Biden administration. Based on those from the SEC, the creator royalties suggested that an asset is a security, as it was designed to be resold by its creators. The SEC ends their lengthy investigation into the NFTs space amid Trump’s pro-crypto stance Yuga Labs has been fighting the federal government for several years about whether NFTs are securities, largely because it is one of the biggest players in this space. While Bored Ape NFTs have cooled off and depreciated in value and cultural significance, they have still racked up a remarkable $7.2 billion in trading volume since their launch in 2021. Concerning the situation, the company mentioned earlier this year that the SEC had concluded its long investigation into its operations as part of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance. The SEC also ended a similar investigation into NFT marketplace OpenSea . It is one thing for the commission to opt not to pursue enforcement against certain NFT projects, but it is a different situation when a federal court issues a clear ruling, as it did in Yuga’s case this week. Despite this significant ruling, Bored Ape NFTs look largely the same.

With Coinbase, Coin Center, and other influential voices providing testimony, the hearing is joining mounting momentum for tax reforms like exemptions for small transactions and fairer treatment of staking rewards. When the game's rules loosen, history shows liquidity finds its way to projects with the most compelling mix of adoption, speculation, and infrastructure. Right now, four tokens stand out as the ones to watch. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Early-Stage Asymmetric Play If XRP, ETH, and SOL are institutional favorites, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is where retail traders rush for life-changing upside. At just $0.0022 in Stage 13 of presale, it sold over 93% of the token allocated for the current stage, leaving only about 1.2 billion tokens. The presale listing price is $0.003, providing early buyers with a guaranteed upside before it even reaches exchanges. Here’s why easing U.S. rules matters: presale tokens like LILPEPE often struggle with exchange access and compliance barriers. If regulators clear the runway, listings on the top U.S. platforms become realistic. Easier listings could spark viral momentum for a meme coin boasting a CertiK audit, 40,000+ investors, and giveaways worth $777K plus 15 ETH . Buying into LILPEPE is straightforward: it’s available directly on the project’s presale portal using ETH or USDT. Once listings hit major CEXs in late 2025, liquidity will broaden, but so will entry prices. Ripple (XRP) Predictions: Analysts Eye $10 by Year-End XRP has always been the bridge between old finance and new rails, and 2025 may be its most pivotal year yet. At its current range of nearly $3.10, a run to $10 by Halloween, as projected by Elon Musk’s Grok AI and shared by Uphold exchange, would mean more than a 3x move. The potential drivers are straightforward but powerful. Rulings on spot XRP ETF applications are expected by October, and Ripple’s pending U.S. banking charter application could legitimize the project in ways few cryptos can match. Grok’s alternate timelines — Christmas or New Year’s Eve for the $10 target- highlight how seriously analysts take this setup. Ethereum (ETH): Solid but Tempered Growth Ethereum (ETH) fluctuates between $4,170 and $4,200, lower by around 7–8% for the week but still firmly entrenched as the foundation of DeFi and smart contracts. The $4,070 level is the one to hold on to; if it breaks, ETH can slide towards $3,800 support. The bullish side expects ETH to regain $5,000 or more if DeFi and scaling demand increase. But here’s the caveat: Ethereum’s size and maturity make 5x or 10x moves far less likely in the short term. For investors, ETH offers stability and institutional confidence — an anchor play rather than a moonshot. Solana Treasury Growth Brings Institutional Spotlight Some heavyweight names have been building their Solana stacks quietly but aggressively in the past few months. Brera Holdings (rebranded as Solmate) kicked things off with a $300 million Solana fund, backed by ARK Invest, Pulsar Group, and the Solana Foundation. Not long after, DeFi Development Corp. disclosed holdings of more than 2 million SOL, worth nearly half a billion dollars, and pledged to keep raising its SOL-per-share ratio. The biggest splash came from Forward Industries, which outlined plans to allocate $4 billion to Solana. Price action is tracking this story: SOL touched $250 recently, with analysts targeting $260–$300 near term and $460 longer term. At a $133B market cap, Solana is no longer a speculative side project; it’s a treasury asset. Final Word The U.S. softening its stance on crypto companies could reshape 2025. Institutional flows will chase stability, but retail money often drives the wildest multipliers. If history repeats, LILPEPE could be the meme engine that turns relaxed regulations into the next 100x story. The presale is still live, but stages are moving fast. This might be the last time to buy under $0.003 for those chasing the next Solana-like breakout.

This session aims to explore adjustments in taxation rules, potentially impacting how cryptocurrencies are treated under U.S. laws. Influential entities like Coinbase and Coin Center will be among those giving testimonies, emphasizing the need for clearer tax guidelines and fairer treatment for various crypto transactions. The prospect of eased regulations is creating a buzz around several cryptocurrencies, suggesting a reevaluation of investment potentials. Here’s an exploration into four crypto tokens that might benefit substantially from these regulatory adjustments. Ripple (XRP): A Bridge to Traditional Finance Ripple’s XRP has long been viewed as a conduit between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology. With a U.S. banking charter potentially on the horizon and the anticipation of favorable rulings on XRP ETFs, the token is expected to see significant movements. If predictions hold, XRP could reach as high as $10 by the end of the year, influenced by its integration into conventional finance and potential new applications. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth Amidst Volatility Though Ethereum has seen a slight dip in its price, it remains a cornerstone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Holding at prices around $4,170 to $4,200, the stability of Ethereum may attract more conservative investors who prefer less volatile assets. The future growth of Ethereum could be stimulated by increased demand for DeFi applications and scaling solutions, maintaining its position as a foundational asset in the crypto space. Solana (SOL): Institutional Interest and Financial Commitments Solana’s recent price movements and the heavy investments into its ecosystem highlight its growing acceptance among institutional investors. With major commitments from entities like Brera Holdings and Forward Industries, Solana is steadily becoming a popular choice for large-scale investment portfolios, further cementing its role as a significant player in the blockchain arena. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Potential for Explosive Growth Among the newer entrants, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as a high-potential token, especially in the presale phase. With a significant portion of its tokens already sold in the ongoing presale, LILPEPE offers an attractive pre-market buy at $0.0022 per token, an appealing prospect for those looking to get in early before it lists on exchanges at a higher price. The anticipated relaxation in U.S. crypto regulations could facilitate easier listings on prominent exchanges, potentially enabling LILPEPE to capture viral growth. For those interested in the dynamics of meme-driven cryptocurrencies, LILPEPE also features promotional giveaways, including a $777K giveaway and 15 ETH giveaway , enhancing its appeal. Final Thoughts and Further Information The potential easing of U.S. crypto regulations could mark a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency sector. While institutional investors may lean towards more stable assets, the retail sector could drive significant growth in newer or less conventional tokens such as LILPEPE. As the scene evolves, these tokens could present unique opportunities for savvy investors.

Gemini AI recently projected that Dogecoin (DOGE) might reach $1 by Christmas 2025. That would be a remarkable climb from where it is now. Yet many early investors are looking elsewhere. A newcomer, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is showing momentum that could deliver gains of 10,372%, potentially taking the token from its current presale price of $0.0022 to $0.22 in the coming cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE) — The Veteran Meme Coin Eyes $1 Dogecoin remains the original meme coin that continues to move the market whenever Elon Musk tweets or the internet buzzes. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.23 according to data on CoinMarketCap . Gemini’s optimistic forecast of $1 by Christmas 2025 implies a more than 400% increase from today’s level. While DOGE has brand recognition and a loyal community, it has been slow to add fresh utility beyond tipping and payments. Analysts note that the push to $1 depends heavily on broader adoption by merchants and favorable market sentiment. The potential is there, but the path is far from certain. DOGE price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — A Newcomer Built for Scale Unlike Dogecoin, Little Pepe has positioned itself as more than just a meme play. The project is creating a Layer 2 network dedicated to meme tokens, featuring ultra-low fees and faster transactions, which appeal to both traders and developers. At the time of writing, the LILPEPE presale is in Stage 13 with tokens selling for $0.0022. The presale has raised $26,348,854 out of a $28,775,000 target and has already sold more than 16.1 billion tokens out of the planned 17.25 billion for this stage, which means it is 93.61% filled. The price recently climbed about 10% from $0.0021 to $0.0022, rewarding early buyers. Those who entered at Stage 1 have already seen gains of roughly 120% while new investors at Stage 13 could still benefit from a projected 36.36% upside by the time the token launches at $0.0030. Little Pepe has also passed a Certik audit and is now listed on CoinMarketCap, key steps that add transparency and trust. The Team is running a $777,000 giveaway and a Mega Giveaway offering more than 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. Comparing the Two Meme Coins Dogecoin’s $1 forecast sounds exciting, but it represents a 4 to 5x increase at best from its current price. In contrast, LILPEPE starts at a much lower base and could see significantly higher percentage gains if it meets its projected goals. A move from $0.0022 to $0.22 would represent an eye-catching 10,372% jump, although it remains speculative and subject to market risks. What sets Little Pepe apart is not just its presale buzz but also its focus on building a utility-driven ecosystem for meme projects, featuring zero transaction tax and anti-bot protections. These structural elements suggest that it is thinking about long-term growth rather than a short-lived meme rally. The Bottom Line Gemini AI’s view that DOGE could reach $1 by the end of 2025 highlights the enduring influence of established meme coins. Still, the higher percentage growth potential seems to lie with Little Pepe , which, at the time of writing, is priced at $0.0022 in its Stage 13 presale. With early buyers already up by 120% and room for another 36.36% rise before launch, the project has drawn significant investor attention. If its Layer 2 network takes off and the community continues to expand, LILPEPE could be the meme coin story to watch, one that has a speculative path to a 10,372% surge from its current level. Investors intrigued by its momentum can learn more or join the presale through the Little Pepe website or its active Telegram group.

Gemini AI's recent forecast that Dogecoin could hit $1 by Christmas 2025 has sparked discussions about its potential and limitations. Dogecoin's Journey Towards $1 Dogecoin remains a flagship meme coin, often influenced by social media and celebrity endorsements. Currently trading at around $0.23, as indicated by CoinMarketCap , it faces a challenging path to reach the $1 mark, needing broader merchant adoption and favorable market conditions to achieve over a 400% increase. Despite its challenges, Dogecoin's strong community and brand recognition make it a significant player in the meme coin market. Rise of Little Pepe: The New Contender Contrasting with Dogecoin's established brand, Little Pepe is a new entrant poised for potential exponential growth. Starting from a presale price of just $0.0022, forecasts suggest a possible surge up to $0.22, marking an impressive 10,372% increase. The coin aims to create a Layer 2 network catering specifically to meme tokens, which could help it achieve rapid growth due to lower transaction fees and faster processing times. Investment Insights: Weighing Potential against Risk When comparing Dogecoin and Little Pepe, investors should consider both the potential returns and the risks. While Dogecoin offers a more stable, albeit slower growth trajectory, Little Pepe could either skyrocket, thanks to its novel infrastructure, or face hurdles typical of new cryptocurrencies. Both coins feature distinct dynamics that can appeal to different types of investors depending on their risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the best choice for traders and early users who want to invest in a DeFi project with structured growth and measurable token demand. MUTM is being built with real-world use cases, clear protocol mechanics, and predictable revenue pathways that make it stand out as a presale chance. Beta launch and Layer-2 scaling to drive adoption Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 presale at $0.035, with over 55% of the 170 million token allocation already claimed. The phase has raised approximately $16.8 million and counts more than 16,750 holders. Phase 7 will step the price up 15% to $0.040, making this one of the last discounted entry points for early participants. The team has announced that the lending and borrowing protocol is under development, with V1 targeting Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and supporting initial assets such as ETH and USDT. This structured rollout ensures investors will have early access to functioning protocol mechanics, not just speculative promise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that is meant to make lending and borrowing easier and more flexible. The project gives users many ways to manage their crypto assets, get liquidity, and make yield by combining Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with a Peer-to-Peer marketplace. Early users will be able to actively test the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending and borrowing model, as well as the mtToken staking and automated liquidation functions, when the beta start comes around. This hands-on proof-of-concept will show that MUTM is a real product that can be used. It will appeal to both individual users and investors looking for a steady return. Unlike many altcoins that come out without working systems, MUTM will have real use from the start, which will increase demand. By making transactions faster and cheaper compared to standard Layer-1 protocols, Layer-2 integration will speed up adoption even more. Because MUTM is cheaper and more efficient, more people will be able to give and borrow money through it, from small investors to treasury-level participants. Protocol income will come from daily activity and loan use. This revenue will then pay for staking rewards and open-market buybacks, creating a demand cycle that feeds on itself. The addition of a native stablecoin will provide an extra source of value by providing a safe way to give and borrow money. MUTM will be linked to active economic flows in the ecosystem. This way, protocol use will determine token demand instead of gambling alone. Exchange listings, community engagement, and ROI potential MUTM’s liquidity and visibility will increase as a result of upcoming Tier-1 exchange listings, which will make it easier for both retail and institutional users to join the market and facilitate smoother price discovery. As more platforms make MUTM available, more trades will happen. This will make it easier for the protocol to make a lot of money and raise demand for the token. Community-focused tools like the dashboard ROI calculator and Top 50 leaderboard will encourage participation by giving extra MUTM tokens to people who use them a lot. These parts make users want to keep interacting with the protocol, which strengthens the feedback loop. More activity leads to more staking benefits and price support based on demand. Early investors are positioned to capture significant upside. For example, purchasing 20,000 MUTM tokens at $0.035 with a $700 investment could reach $20,000 value if the token hits the projected $1 target. With Phase 6 nearly 60% sold and Phase 7 scheduled to step the price 15% higher to $0.040, early participants will secure maximum leverage before wider market entry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few projects that has affordable presale prices, useful DeFi mechanics, Layer-2 efficiency, and a roadmap for real adoption. When traders look at the prices of cryptocurrencies right now, they will see that this is a great time to get into both a new altcoin and a protocol whose use will keep demand high. If investors act now, they will get instant gains from the Phase 7 price change as well as long-term gains from token utility and staking rewards. This makes MUTM the best alt-season opportunity before the price goes up because more people know about it.

People say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best choice because it combines presale momentum, DeFi lending mechanics, and Layer-2 efficiency to provide returns that are measured and go beyond speculative trends. Cardano (ADA) In the past, ADA was thought to be a trustworthy platform for smart contracts, but its roadmap growth has been slower than expected. Many of its more advanced features have delayed release processes, which makes them less useful for lenders and borrowers who want to know what the yields will be. Even though ADA still has network value and market trust, investors who want to see a real return on their investment from active DeFi participation may not be interested in it because it has limited on-chain yield mechanics. Ripple (XRP) XRP is still being looked at closely by regulators, which affects how the market feels and how many people use it. Even though it has a strong cross-border payment infrastructure, XRP isn’t very useful for loans, borrowing, or staking compared to new DeFi platforms. The token’s limits are less appealing to investors who want consistent, protocol-generated income, especially when compared to platforms that offer structured yield, staking, and token buyback loops. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. Approximately $16.8 million has been raised in this phase, with 55% of the 170 million token allocation sold. The project has over 16,750 holders, and the total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040 (+15%), representing the last discounted entry. The team has confirmed development of its lending and borrowing protocol , with Sepolia Testnet V1 scheduled for Q4 2025. Core components include a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. A dual lending approach is used by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Blue-chip coins like ETH and BNB are accepted by Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools. Stablecoins like USDC and DAI are also accepted. People who deposit money get mtTokens that reflect their shares, and the interest rates change based on how much of the pool is being used. In peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, loans for riskier assets can be discussed. This keeps core pools stable by separating volatile assets from them. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a utility-first loan system with many demand drivers. Speculative interest will turn into active platform users when the beta launch happens. This will increase the total value locked and prove that the real yield processes work. Scaling up to Layer-2 will lower friction, letting businesses, funds, and regular users borrow and give money more than once, while also lowering costs compared to Layer-1 protocols. Additionally, issuing stablecoins tied to overcollateralized debt will create a steady demand for borrowing, with fees used to pay for buybacks and staking payouts, creating a demand cycle that feeds on itself. Security and community engagement further bolster confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a CertiK audit (Manual Review + Static Analysis; Token Scan 90.00; Skynet 79.00). A $50,000 USDT bug bounty incentivizes reporting across critical, major, medium, and low severity issues. The project also runs a $100,000 ongoing giveaway and engages holders via a dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard to monitor ROI and leaderboard rewards. Those who bought early already see a big gain. They now have 500,000 MUTM tokens after buying $5,000 worth of MUTM at $0.01. Given the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, that investment is now worth $17,500, a 3.5x increase. The holding would be worth $105,000, which is 21x what it was in Phase 6 and 210x what it was when it was first bought if the goal price is 500%, which is about $0.21. It looks like MUTM is on the right track with beta usage, Layer-2 efficiency, and listing on a Tier-1 exchange. Most of the time, Phase 6 has been sold. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15%, to $0.040. To find out their return on investment (ROI), investors should connect their wallets to the dashboard. This way, they can see where they stand in the rankings and move up before the next price increase. Early users should look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead of ADA, which is stuck, and XRP, which is limited by rules. It’s useful and has a measured chance of making money.

IPOX boss Joseph Schuster said the decision was more of a strategic, company-specific move, adding that it was no surprise after raising $ 1.1 billion. The AI chipmaker respectfully requested to withdraw its Company Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the U.S. SEC in September last year. Cerebras asked the Commission to grant the withdrawal order immediately, pursuant to Rules 418, 457 (p), and 477 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Nvidia competitor raised $1.1 billion on September 30, doubling its valuation to $8.1 billion, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Cerebras Systems CEO Andrew Feldman claimed it was the largest raise in the category and the highest valuation backed by “the best investors.” Feldman insists the company will still go public The Cerebras top executive said the company was still set on going public, rather than continuing with venture capital raises. He added that the IPO withdrawal did not indicate the company’s long-term preference. However, Feldman believes the initial prospectus from last September is outdated, considering the significant advancements the company has made in AI. One of Cerebras’ spokespersons also pointed out that the recent government shutdown did not influence the company’s decision to withdraw its IPO. “I think we have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and I think it’s good practice, when you have enormous opportunities, not to let them fall by the wayside for lack of capital.” ~ Andrew Feldman , CEO at Cerebras The AI chipmaker has reportedly shifted focus from selling systems since its original filing requesting to go public on the Nasdaq. The company leans more toward cloud service provision and accepting incoming queries to models using its chips. Cerebras’ 2025 IPO probability drops by 1% According to Kalshi data, the market for “Who will IPO in 2025” implied a 17% chance of a Cerebras 2025 IPO, a drop from the previous 18% probability. Kalshi reported over 60K in volume over the past 24 hours for this market. The market currently has a volume of over 283,000, with over 77,000 open positions, and overall liquidity stands at over 3.2 million contracts. The company’s IPO prospects began to encounter obstacles shortly after it filed for a Nasdaq listing in the previous year. Cerebras initially faced criticism from the public, who were concerned that it would be overly reliant on a single Middle Eastern firm, G42. The AI chipmaker encountered a setback when it sought clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Department of the Treasury. However, private market investors have continued to hold bullish sentiments about the company despite the prolonged IPO delay. Feldman said the backing from private market investors was strong enough to double the company’s valuation from $4 billion in 2021 to over $8 billion in 2025. The CEO also pointed out the benefits of having investors “who everybody would be proud of” as the cornerstone to any company’s IPO. He asserted that the “new money” will allow for an expansion in U.S. AI chip manufacturing. The company reportedly plans to hire more workers to focus on production as demand increases. Feldman said the company has increased its manufacturing capacity eight times over the past 18 months and is seeking another four times increase in the next six to eight months. According to Cryptopolitan, Cerebras’ recent funding will expand its Inference Service and continue innovation in AI supercomputers and AI chip design. The company has vowed to expand its manufacturing footprint and data center capacity in the U.S. ahead of its IPO. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The reason is easy to understand: Ethereum (ETH) is fully developed, but MUTM is still in pre-sale and has a lot of room to grow. Its model of lending, borrowing, and staking includes features that are meant to appeal to both individual and business users. Lending, borrowing, and real yield mechanics MUTM is in Phase 6 of its presale at the time of writing. Each coin is worth $0.035, and more than 16,750 people have already bought them. The project has already raised $16.8 million. More than half of the 170 million tokens that were set aside for this part have already been bought. Time is running out because the next stage will raise the price by 15% to $0.040. This is your last chance to buy MUTM tokens for less than four cents. The estimated listing price is $0.06. This means that early investors who bought at $0.01 in Phase 1 already have a 3.5x paper gain, which will grow to 6x when the company goes public. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has confirmed that its core lending and borrowing protocol will roll out first on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, with ETH and USDT enabled for lending, borrowing, and collateralization. The platform will operate under two models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) is a system where lenders put assets like stablecoins and well-known tokens like ETH and XRP into smart contracts that have been checked. Interest rates will change based on usage, which will make sure that cash is used efficiently. People who give money will get mtTokens in return. These tokens increase in value over time and can also be used as collateral. For instance, an ETH owner who deposits 10 ETH, which is about $30,000, will make an estimated 14% APY, which is $4,200 a year in passive income. Ethereum (ETH) has a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which means that a person can put up $1,500 worth of ETH as collateral and borrow $1,125 right away. Traders will be able to get liquidity without selling their long-term stocks thanks to this structure. This flexibility has generated a lot of interest during times of market volatility. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans for more volatile tokens like PEPE and DOGE will also be possible through Mutuum Finance (MUTM). In this model, lenders and borrowers discuss terms one-on-one, so there is no shared risk. Lenders take on more risk, but they could make more money, and the way the system is set up keeps instability away from the major liquidity pools. Collateralization is an important part of the platform. Stable assets, such as ETH and the most popular stablecoins, will be able to handle up to 75% LTV and liquidation levels close to 80%. On the other hand, dangerous tokens will only be able to handle 35–55% LTV and liquidation levels closer to 65%. This protects against sudden drops in price and makes sure that the system will still work even if there is a coin crash today. Discounts will be given to liquidators who help settle positions that are in trouble, and reserve factors that range from 10% for safer assets to as high as 55% for volatile tokens will make the pools even healthier. Building trust while presale momentum accelerates The presale momentum is being matched with strong infrastructure planning. Investors are being given the ability to track holdings and calculate ROI through a user dashboard that connects directly to wallets. A Top 50 leaderboard is also being introduced, rewarding the largest investors with bonus MUTM tokens. Security is being prioritized with a CertiK audit already underway, boasting a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. To reinforce community confidence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced a $50,000 bug bounty program with rewards ranging from $200 for low-level discoveries to $2,000 for critical findings. In parallel, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway will reward ten early believers with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Many traders are excited not only about how loans and borrowing work, but also about the way prices are going up, which seems to be similar to how Ethereum (ETH) was growing in its early stages. If a buyer joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 1 at $0.01, they are already up 250% by Phase 6’s $0.035. It goes up in value by 500% when it goes public at $0.06, which is an impressive result that would stand out in any crypto investor’s portfolio. Ethereum (ETH) will almost double in value if it hits $10,000 next year, while analysts have already started to imagine how MUTM could reach $1 with the help of exchange listings and user usage. As work speeds up on it, the beta launch and integrations on big exchanges like Kraken and MEXC will make it available to more people. More liquidity and visibility will bring in more borrowers, lenders, and stakers to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which will increase demand for MUTM coins. Phase 6 is now more than half sold out, so buyers have one last chance to buy MUTM tokens for less than $0.04. The 15% rise into Phase 7 is set in stone, and exchange triggers are still to come. Traders now see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best Ethereum (ETH) option on the market right now because of its strong pre-sale support, well-thought-out protocol design, and clear growth drivers.

Ethereum price near $4,515 with key support at $3,876 and resistance at $4,955 Analyst Donald Dean cites volume shelves and Fibonacci retracements pointing to $5,766 and $6,658 upside targets. Trading volume and a recent double-bottom pattern shape near-term bias; a drop below $3,876 risks bearish continuation. Ethereum price outlook: $4,515 now, watch $4,955 breakout for targets to $5,766 and $6,658 — read the technical roadmap and trading implications. Ethereum trades at $4,515 as analysts highlight $5,766 targets, with support at $3,876 and resistance at $4,955 shaping its next move. Ethereum holds momentum above $4,500 as traders eye $5,766, with strong support near $3,876 and resistance around $4,955. Donald Dean highlights Ethereum’s recovery, pointing to volume shelves and Fibonacci levels that frame its bullish path ahead. Ethereum’s breakout potential rests on $4,955 resistance, with upside targets at $5,766 and $6,658 shaping trader sentiment. Ethereum’s price action has drawn close attention this week as traders watch key technical levels. On October 3, Ethereum traded at $4,515.89 against the US dollar on Coinbase. The token slipped by $32.79, marking a 0.73% decline. However, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s next leg higher. Donald Dean, an analyst on X, stated, “Ethereum has made good upward progress once support was confirmed at the $3800 level. Currently ETH is at the volume shelf launch area near $4500 and ready to move higher. Next target is $5766 for an ETH to BTC 50% retracement.” His outlook highlights a clear technical roadmap that many traders are monitoring. What is the current Ethereum price outlook? Ethereum price is trading around $4,515 with a short-term range defined by support at $3,876 and resistance at $4,955. A confirmed breakout above $4,955 would target the 50% Fibonacci level at $5,766 and the 61.8% level at $6,658, while a drop below $3,876 would signal renewed downside risk. How are price levels and volume shelves shaping ETH’s next moves? Volume shelves at $3,876.53 and the current range indicate concentrated liquidity and institutional interest. The market formed a double-bottom near support, which added buying pressure. Volume-assisted rallies from those shelves historically validate breakouts; traders use these zones to set stop-loss and take-profit orders. Price Action and Key Levels Ethereum has displayed a strong recovery since July, climbing along a teal ascending trendline. Prices rallied sharply and peaked near $4,955.90 in early August. That high remains a critical resistance zone. However, after reaching this peak, Ethereum slipped into a consolidation phase with increased volatility. The chart also shows a descending channel that defined price movements through September and early October. The lower boundary provided support, while the upper boundary capped upward momentum. Recently, Ethereum broke below this channel before rebounding through a double bottom pattern near support. Volume analysis further adds context. Two major volume shelves emerged — one at $3,876.53 and another near the current range. These areas show heavy trading activity and act as liquidity zones. Moreover, Ethereum’s trading range between $3,876.53 support and $4,955.90 resistance will decide near-term market direction. How do Fibonacci levels inform ETH/BTC and USD targets? Fibonacci retracement levels place the 50% retracement at $5,766, the 61.8% at $6,658, and the 100% retracement at $9,547. These levels act as logical targets if momentum resumes. For ETH/BTC, the 50% retracement noted by analysts serves as a cross-pair gauge for relative strength versus Bitcoin. Breaking above $4,955.90 resistance could trigger renewed momentum toward these retracement zones. Conversely, a drop below $3,876.53 would weaken bullish conviction and could open lower support tests. Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for Ethereum? Immediate support is at $3,876.53 and immediate resistance is at $4,955.90. These levels will likely guide short-term trading decisions and determine whether the market resumes an uptrend or returns to consolidation. How likely is an ETH breakout to $5,766? If Ethereum breaks and sustains above $4,955.90 with above-average volume, a run toward the 50% Fib at $5,766 becomes probable. Traders will look for confirmation via volume shelves and follow-through buying to validate the move. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the immediate support and resistance levels for Ethereum?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Immediate support is at $3,876.53 and immediate resistance is at $4,955.90.

While buyers are excited about this prediction, the biggest wallets in the market are quietly changing how they invest in crypto. Instead of putting all of their money into Bitcoin, they are buying tokens that are worth less than four cents. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the top targets. Whales know that assets in the pre-sale stage can bring huge gains, and the growth potential for MUTM is getting their attention. Will BTC go past 120K? Bitcoin (BTC) is now moving toward $125,000, which many traders and experts see as an important next goal. Based on past price cycles and movement, the Bitcoin Cycle Model thinks that BTC could rise to between $125K and $131K later in 2025. A new piece from CoinCentral also says that $125K will be the next big resistance level, especially if BTC keeps getting stronger above $116K. Options traders are betting on a rise toward $125K because of upcoming decisions by the US Federal Reserve. This shows that the market is very optimistic about a rally. Of course, getting to that level will rely on steady flows into ETFs, demand from institutions, and good macroeconomic conditions. The move could be stopped if it fails to break through resistance levels or if sentiment changes. Why big wallets choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At present, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale. Each token is valued at $0.035, with approximately $16.8 million raised and 55% of the 170 million tokens allocated in this stage already claimed. The next phase will lift the price to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. This has created urgency among larger investors, who recognize the difference in entry points today will matter significantly once the token lists at $0.06 and scales toward $1 in the medium term. What attracts whales to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the protocol design that blends yield generation with strong risk management. The team has already announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , which will debut on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. ETH and USDT will be the first assets supported, laying the foundation for the liquidity pools and collateral mechanisms that drive the system. It works like this: lenders put assets like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins into smart contracts that have been checked. In return, they get mtTokens, which are equal to their share of the pool and earn interest over time. As an example, a loan that gives out 0.5 BTC, which is worth about $30,000, will earn about 12% APY, which is $3,600 a year without having to sell their Bitcoin. Borrowers also benefit because they can get cash without having to sell long-term assets. A person might put up $5,000 in Bitcoin as collateral to borrow $3,750 at a 75% Loan-to-Value ratio. Overcollateralization is something that can’t be changed on the platform. Up to 75% LTV is set for stable assets like ETH and BTC, and liquidation limits are close to 80%. Riskier tokens, on the other hand, can only have LTVs between 35% and 55%, and they can only be liquidated at close to 65%. This design makes sure that the system will still work even if there is a crypto crash today. A Stability Factor is used to figure out how healthy the collateral is, and discounts are given to liquidators when stocks drop below certain levels. Because of this, the disposal process is smooth and easy to understand, which is exactly what whales want when they invest money. Another important thing is the liquidity depth. It’s important for big players to be sure that their loans and borrowing won’t be affected by slippage or low liquidity. Reserve factors help Mutuum Finance (MUTM) deal with this problem. For example, assets that are safer are set to 10%, and assets that are riskier can be set to 55%. This careful tuning makes the system more stable during market stress and builds trust among people with bigger wallets. The ROI math that attracts whales The whale plan is easy to understand: buy early, before regular investors do the same. This is already clear from Mutuum Finance (MUTM). In Phase 1, someone bought coins for $0.01. In Phase 6, the entry price went up to $0.035, which is a 250% increase in value. By the time it goes up to $0.06, that buyer will have locked in a 500% cash return. When you look at crypto charts, these numbers really stick out, especially when you compare them to Bitcoin (BTC)’s expected rise to $125K, which is less than a 10% increase from where it is now. The vision is much bigger for whales who join at $0.035. With the token’s goal of $1 by the middle of 2026, this is about a 28x gain. An important step toward that valuation is the beta launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the adoption of its lending system by institutions, and the expected listing on major exchanges like Binance or Kraken. These events will make things easier to get, make the market more open, and raise demand all over. This long-term view is strengthened by trust bonds. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going through a CertiK audit, and their Token Scan and Skynet scores of 90 and 79, respectively, show that they meet security standards. The project has started a $50,000 bug prize program to encourage people to be open about bugs. Important discoveries can earn up to $2,000, and smaller discoveries can still get paid for. Ten people will each get $10,000 in MUTM tokens as part of a $100,000 giveaway at the community level. With more than 12,000 Twitter followers, the group is growing and making progress at the same time.

A recent $2 billion USDT mint has boosted on-chain liquidity. Ethereum now holds $78.5 billion in Tether, surpassing competitors like Tron. This strengthens its role in DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and exchange liquidity. Analysts expect fresh capital inflows may support an “Uptober” rally. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) emerges as a leading PayFi altcoin. With CertiK verification, wallet beta, and crypto-to-bank features, RTX gains traction. Ethereum Price Outlook: USDT Mints Signal Uptober Momentum Ethereum price is currently $4,469. The cryptocurrency is drawing attention from institutional investors as another large USDT mint strengthens its position as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Ethereum now holds $78.5 billion in Tether on-chain, far surpassing competitors like Tron. Analysts say this highlights Ethereum’s key role in DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and exchange liquidity, making it the network of choice despite higher transaction costs. The new USDT mint has sparked hopes for a strong “Uptober” rally, with fresh liquidity possibly flowing into Ethereum and other significant assets. Stablecoin growth often signals upcoming market activity. Historical trends indicate that significant minting events, such as the recent $2 billion USDT creation on Ethereum, usually precede price moves as institutions and traders deploy fresh liquidity. This strengthens confidence in Ethereum’s ability to attract capital and remain central to global crypto operations, including derivative markets and institutional DeFi programs. Remittix: The Trending PayFi Altcoin Investors Are Watching While Ethereum attracts institutional attention, Remittix (RTX) continues to emerge as a top PayFi altcoin for retail and new investors. Remittix has raised over $27 million, sold more than 674 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130. Its growing adoption and utility make it a strong competitor to Ethereum and other primary tokens in Q4 2025. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum #1 on CertiK: The project is fully verified, providing top-tier blockchain security. Wallet beta live: Community testers are actively engaging with the platform. Crypto-to-bank payments: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. Multi-asset support: The wallet supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and more than 30 fiat currencies. 15% USDT referral program: Early users can earn rewards, claimable daily via the dashboard. Conclusion: Why Ethereum And Remittix Could Lead Q4 Growth Ethereum’s large USDT mints and institutional flows signal strong fundamentals and potential price momentum for Uptober. Meanwhile, Remittix offers utility-focused adoption and security that could drive investor interest and real-world use. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in, combining Ethereum’s market dominance with Remittix’s PayFi capabilities offers a balanced approach to growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency space.

While XRP price movements remain steady, much attention has shifted toward Remittix , and the PayFi project is quickly climbing the charts. With close to $27 million raised and more than 674 million tokens sold, this altcoin is positioning itself as the one analysts expect could deliver gains of over 2,000% in October. XRP Price Holds Key Levels Ahead of Breakout Source: AltcoinGordon XRP news today reveals the token is building on stronger fundamentals, even as it consolidates slightly above $3. Ripple has rolled out the RLUSD stablecoin in Africa through partnerships with Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card, greatly expanding its on-demand liquidity services. The XRP Ledger has also activated the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) Standard, simplifying asset issuance and strengthening compliance, a move praised by Uphold’s Head of Research. Technically, XRP price action is nearing a decisive moment. Technical analyst Ali Martinez believes that $3.13 is the critical resistance, and a breakout could move XRP to $3.40 or even $3.60. Wider patterns indicate targets as high as $4.80 if momentum continues. As traders await confirmation of a breakout, failure to hold $2.85 could push XRP back towards $2.70. Remittix Set To Steal The Spotlight As October’s Top Altcoin While XRP price is being closely watched, investors are also eyeing Remittix , which has quickly become one of the most discussed altcoins in the PayFi space. Its growing adoption is not just speculation — it’s backed by real development milestones and a rapidly expanding community. With XRP holders diversifying into this project, experts argue that Remittix could be the altcoin that delivers the 2,000% surge traders are waiting for. Over 40,000 holders have already joined, cementing Remittix as one of the fastest-growing crypto projects live now Development of the Remittix Web App is almost complete, with crypto-to-fiat beta testing scheduled for mid-Q4 Two new CEX listings are on the horizon, adding to confirmed BitMart and LBank partnerships for greater liquidity Designed for global use, Remittix enables instant transfers to bank accounts in 30+ countries with real-time FX conversion The project has a deflationary token model, increasing scarcity and long-term investor value Why XRP and Remittix Could Dominate Q4 XRP news today highlights Ripple’s push into global banking, while Remittix is quickly becoming the PayFi project retail investors are calling the next breakout star. Both assets are shaping Q4 momentum, but for those looking at high-growth potential, Remittix’s mix of utility, exchange expansion, and strong fundraising could set it apart.

Filings indicate that on July 10, 2025, Fields purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 worth of IREN shares. The transaction, disclosed in early August, has coincided with a 196% surge in IREN’s stock over roughly three months. IREN one-week stock price chart.

For instance, among his most recent congress trades, in the days leading up to Oracle’s (NYSE: ORCL ) emergence as a key partner in the U.S. acquisition of TikTok, Fields purchased between $80,000 and $200,000 worth of Oracle stock across three trades on September 17, 18, and 23.

However, Fields has denied any wrongdoing in his stock trades. IREN’s bullish fundamentals Meanwhile, several fundamental factors have contributed to the stocks’ recent rally. Notably, IREN, formerly known as Iris Energy, has rapidly expanded its Bitcoin mining capacity, reaching 50 exahashes per second earlier this year. The company has emphasized efficiency, claiming one of the lowest production costs in the industry by leveraging renewable energy for its data centers. As Bitcoin’s price has strengthened throughout 2025, IREN’s mining margins have widened significantly. What truly ignited investor enthusiasm, however, was IREN’s pivot into artificial intelligence. Building on its data center footprint, the company has begun deploying high-end Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs, including the latest H100 and Blackwell series chips, to power cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. In August, IREN secured “preferred partner” status with the American chipmaker, a designation that provided both credibility and priority access to scarce hardware. This news, combined with strong quarterly earnings showing a 228% jump in revenue and a return to profitability, has made IREN one of the market’s hottest dual plays in crypto and AI.

In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens.

Hyperliquid is powering headlines with billion-dollar unlock debates, while Bitcoin Cash is holding firm above $560 amid a 7% rally. Yet, the true electricity in the market is radiating from BullZilla, the meme coin with a cinematic presale that is moving stages faster than whales can refresh their wallets. BullZilla is not just another meme coin; it’s a living saga among viral cryptos. With over 30 billion tokens already sold, more than $770,000 raised, and 2,500+ holders locked in, the presale is reaching fever pitch. Stages advance every 48 hours or with each $100,000 milestone hit, creating a rapid fire growth engine. Early investors are staring at a listing price of $0.00527, with current buyers in Stage 5 standing before a roaring 4327.15% ROI potential. If there was ever a moment to secure a place in the tribe, it is now. BullZilla’s Mutation Engine Turns Every Dollar Into Firepower for Viral Cryptos What separates BullZilla from every other meme coin graveyard story? The Mutation Engine. Unlike static presales, BullZilla’s progressive pricing system forces urgency: the price climbs either after $100,000 is raised or after 48 hours tick by. There’s no pause, no waiting. It’s motion engineered to punish hesitation. BullZilla Presale Snapshot Stage Price per $BZIL Raised Tokens Sold ROI at Listing $0.00527 5B $0.00011907 $770k+ 30B+ 4327.15% Consider this: at today’s Stage 5B price of $0.00011907, a $6,000 investment bags approximately 50,430,000 $BZIL tokens. By the time BullZilla lists at $0.00527, that same stash turns into $265,768. That’s the kind of portfolio-reshaping return meme coin whales dream of, and it’s happening in real time. The Mutation Engine is already speeding toward Stage 5B, where the price ticks up by another 5.60%. This stage will vanish the moment a few more big buys land. This isn’t just about presale mechanics; it’s a narrative device that makes every participant feel like they’re fueling the viral cryptos, as if they’re part of the beast. It’s why whales are entering fast and why smaller investors are scrambling to secure positions before the window slams shut. How to Buy $BZIL Before the Next Roar Set up your wallet through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with ETH from Coinbase or Binance. Connect directly to the official BullZilla ($BZIL) presale portal and swap ETH for $BZIL. Once confirmed, your allocation is secured and claimable after launch. This highly affordable stage won’t last. Claim your viral crypto tokens today and prepare for the listing roar. Act before the next $100,000 surge pushes the price higher; this is where fortunes are minted. Hyperliquid Consolidates Above $47 While Facing Unlock Tensions Hyperliquid’s October story has been a tale of power and pressure. On the bullish side, the perp DEX is clocking more than $3 million in daily fees, with analysts eyeing a push toward $55–$60 as long as the token holds above $47. At the same time, institutional staking products and treasury strategies are adding legitimacy to its ecosystem. Yet, looming in November is the elephant in the room: a massive $500 million monthly token unlock schedule that threatens to dwarf the project’s buyback absorption capacity. Analysts warn only ~17% may be offset by revenue-driven buybacks, sparking concerns of oversupply. Still, with 62% of perp DEX open interest and a developing HyperEVM ecosystem of 100+ protocols, Hyperliquid remains one of the top viral cryptos trending in 2025. Investors are watching closely, but momentum is still alive. Bitcoin Cash Holds Strong at $560 With Eyes on $650 Bitcoin Cash is proving its resilience this October, jumping 7% to nearly $594 before consolidating above the $560 level. Analysts view this as a key support zone, with upside projections toward $650 if buying pressure persists. BCH’s technicals remain bullish, trading above its MA-20, MA-50, and MA-200. A shadow still lingers over BCH after the October 1 SBI Crypto hack, which saw $21 million stolen across multiple chains, including BCH. Yet, despite this security breach, institutional chatter around potential ETF products and strong community conviction are helping the coin hold momentum. Among upcoming viral cryptos with high ROI potential, BCH continues to show it has staying power while newer players like BullZilla steal the spotlight. Conclusion Every crypto season produces its legends, but October 2025 belongs to viral cryptos . Hyperliquid is balancing billion-dollar unlock concerns with fee momentum. Bitcoin Cash is holding key support and eyeing fresh rallies. And then there’s BullZilla, the only presale roaring with 4327.15% upside baked into its DNA. This presale is not waiting for anyone. With stages flipping every 48 hours or $100,000 raised, the next price surge is only moments away. For those who missed Bitcoin Cash rallies or hesitated on Hyperliquid’s run, BullZilla offers a clear invitation: join the roar now or watch from the sidelines when it lists at $0.00527. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Viral Cryptos What makes BullZilla different from other meme coin presales? BullZilla uses a Mutation Engine where the presale price rises every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours, ensuring rapid progression and rewarding early investors. How much can a $6,000 investment in $BZIL return at listing? At the current Stage 5B price of $0.00011907, $6,000 buys 50.43M tokens, which will be worth about $265,768 at the $0.00527 listing price. Why is Hyperliquid facing concerns despite strong revenues? Starting November, massive monthly unlocks of ~$500 million threaten to dilute supply faster than buybacks can absorb, even though revenues and institutional products remain strong. Is Bitcoin Cash still bullish after the October hack? Yes, BCH is holding $560 as support and could rally to $650 if momentum continues, though security risks remind investors to exercise caution. Should investors prioritize BullZilla over established coins like BCH or HYPE? BCH and HYPE have proven markets, but BullZilla’s presale ROI of 4327.15% and fast-moving stages make it the best new viral cryptos making headlines. Summary BullZilla’s presale is exploding with early-stage frenzy, offering a rare 4327% ROI projection for those joining before the next stage surge. Hyperliquid continues to deliver daily revenue strength while battling unlock fears, and Bitcoin Cash maintains technical support despite recent challenges. Among top viral crypto projects to invest now, BullZilla stands apart with its Mutation Engine, roaring burns, and unmatched presale narrative. Time is running out—the next stage change could be the difference between good gains and life-changing ones.

Investigators opened 17 criminal cases during the same period, the country’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM) announced on Thursday. Most of the illegal Bitcoin farms have been found in and around the capital Astana (5), the city of Shymkent in Southern Kazakhstan and in Kostanay in the North (3 each), the agency detailed. “As part of these cases, $642,000 in digital assets were seized and confiscated,” the AFM pointed out in a press release, also highlighting: “It should be noted that some illegal mining farms operated by stealing electricity, in a volume comparable to the consumption of a large city. There have also been cases of violations of the rights of residents living near noisy farms.” The watchdog emphasized that the illegal electricity usage for coin minting has deprived other businesses and industrial projects, development initiatives and social infrastructure of needed energy resources. The crypto mining boom in Kazakhstan , which followed China’s decision to ban the activity a few years ago, initially resulted in significant power deficits across the Central Asian nation. The government addressed the issue through regulation and pricing, largely solving the problem, at least as far as licensed cryptocurrency miners are concerned. However, unregistered mining operations, often running on illegally sourced electrical energy, have remained a major challenge for the authorities. Kazakhstan collects over $30 million in tax from the mining sector Aside from that, Kazakhstan has largely benefitted from the influx of miners, after adopting rules for the growing industry, including for the sale of the minted digital currency on domestic authorized exchanges and the taxation of its profits by the state. In a post on its Telegram channel, the AFM admitted that crypto mining has generated more than 17 billion tenge (over $31 million) in budget receipts for the country, quoting data from the State Revenue Committee. The agency also reminded that mining enterprises are allowed to operate in Kazakhstan only after obtaining the respective licenses. It further emphasized: “Legal mining activity requires equipment verification, an energy supply contract, and tax compliance.” The AFM also stressed that the opposite “entails criminal liability, harms the country’s economic security, and leads to power outages.” The regulatory body urged entrepreneurs and Kazakhstani citizens to refrain from participating in illegal mining and to support the development of a transparent digital assets market in the country. Kazakhstan aspires to become a regional cryptocurrency hub. The nation was recently visited by crypto exchange Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the owner of the popular Telegram messenger, Pavel Durov. Both met with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and attended a major tech forum. The Financial Monitoring Agency has been active on other fronts as well. Earlier this week, it announced the dismantling of arguably the largest crypto laundering service in the post-Soviet space, a platform known as the RAKS exchange. Last month, Kazakhstan busted a large crypto Ponzi scheme, seizing $10 million in digital assets collected from defrauded investors in Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

Apple and Google both bowed to federal pressures, removing the application and another, Red Dot, from their stores. The applications allow users to crowdsource reports of United States ICE activity, with the platforms citing personnel safety after a deadly sniper attack at a field office in Texas. Google and Apple initially removed the Red Dot app from their store before Apple removed the iOS-based ICEBlock app after demands from the United States Department of Justice under Attorney Pam Bondi. In a statement to Fox News, Bondi claimed that the app was designed to put federal agents at risk for doing their jobs. The DOJ statement also vowed to protect federal law enforcement agents. ICE tracking app developer disappointed with Apple’s decision In a recent statement, the creator, Joshua Aaron, mentioned that Apple’s decision to remove his application from their store blindsided him. “The app was thoroughly vetted for three weeks by Apple’s legal and senior officials before approval,” he said. “It’s been fine all this time. For them to do it now, that’s why I say I’m so disappointed.” Aaron, a software developer who also doubles as a lead singer for the rock band Stealing Heather, released the application back in April. In July, after ICE operations ticked up across the United States, the application went viral after Bondi called out the activities it was being used for. She claimed that they were using it to signal to criminals where federal officers are, a movement that helps illegals evade capture. However, Aaron claimed that Apple has yet to reach out to him or give him a chance to appeal the decision. “Apple has not called me, even though we were number one in the App Store for weeks and had 1.14 million users that counted on this every single minute of their day,” he said. “They just gave me a letter that said we received information from law enforcement that your app is targeting or harming law enforcement officials.” Aaron plans to fight the removal Aaron compared his application to mainstream navigation applications like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze. “To somehow say that ICEBlock is doing anything different than that is ridiculous,” he said. The removal of the application came after Bondi and the DOJ formally asked for the application to be removed, citing officer safety. Meanwhile, Apple has released a statement to Fox News, in which it spoke about the removal. “We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,” Apple told Fox News. Google also echoed the same sentiment with its decision to remove Red Dot, noting to the media that the agents are a “vulnerable group.” “ICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies,” a Google spokesperson said. The spokesperson claimed that the federal government did not reach out in respect to the app, noting that Red Dot was removed due to the high risk of abuse and rules surrounding user-generated content. Meanwhile, Aaron has claimed that the removal is a First Amendment violation, and he prepares to fight it in court and in the media. “This is not some app taken down from the App Store; this is a tech company removing something that is clearly a First Amendment-protected app,” he said. “There’s nothing illegal about developing it. There’s nothing illegal about using it. They are now deciding what you can and cannot use on a device that you own.” Get seen where it counts.

This new excitement has investors searching for the next altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to outperform ETH’s gains in the next few months. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance is one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, with its dual lending protocol bypassing massive inefficiencies in decentralized lending. Its Stage 6 presale is already over 55% sold out. Attracting more than 16,750 owners and raising more than $16.8 million, reflecting growing market sentiment. With its 50x potential for growth, Mutuum Finance is increasingly considered a special early-stage investment opportunity that can do even better than Ethereum’s next bull cycle as the bull market continues to gain traction. Ethereum Breaks Out of 3-Year Range, Analysts Now Eye Five-Digit Targets Ethereum (ETH) has officially shattered three years of horizontal price action, drawing what analysts call the “holy grail” breakout, a technical move that eliminates prolonged consolidation and allows the foundation for a powerful vertical rally. As momentum gains pace and on-chain indicators flash green, it is widely expected ETH’s future destination could be in the five-digit realm, a level previously thought to be years in the making. The breakout is the moment of truth for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, cementing its place as the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts. With institutional funds pouring in and optimism in the air, increasingly large chunks of investors are also exploring emerging altcoins with greater growth prospects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also starting to draw that forward-thinking capital. Mutuum Finance Presale and Big Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its sixth all-time presale round. The project has already broken 16,750 registered members and more than $16.8 million, all-time high milestones, and continues to show growing trust in the market for its long-term project. Investors who are seeking sustainable yield and long-term value will find Mutuum Finance’s growing ecosystem at a quick rate as an investment prospect to consider. The platform also has a very robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation mechanism that adjusts in real-time to shock collateral price. This is supported by another impediment of protection through management of a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier on riskier classes of collateral. Open architecture and security by design enable Mutuum Finance to be a long-term, stable, and secure DeFi platform designed for the long term and to put the times to the test. The project classifies vulnerabilities into four categories, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and provides a rational model for discovery and prevention of such pitfalls before impacting users. Mutuum Finance New Lending & Borrowing Platform Mutuum Finance has announced a new lending and borrowing protocol for its decentralized finance ecosystem. Version 1 (V1) is set to go live on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will include major pieces such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. On the launch day, lending, borrowing, and collateralization support for ETH and USDT is set to go live, ushering in the stage for a simple and open-ended DeFi experience. The Ethereum breakout above $4,400 is a sure sign that the next big bull rally is imminent, but the biggest profits might not come from ETH itself. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at the moment is trading at just $0.035 and significantly more than 55% presale sold out, is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting early-stage DeFi plays of 2025. With more than 16,750 investors, who have raised $16.8 million, a double lending infrastructure, and robust security architecture, MUTM represents a rare chance at 50× potential gain. For investors betting on the next altcoin to surge and drive even Ethereum’s rally, MUTM is the obvious choice.

In a post on X, he noted that “XRP quietly built what others are still pitching,” highlighting its compliance-ready architecture and institutional-grade features already live on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His comments were accompanied by a detailed graphic that outlined how XRP is evolving from a fast payments network into a foundation for institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi) . $XRP quietly built what others are still pitching Read this! KYC at the protocol layer. Tokenized bonds. Compliant stablecoins. Institutional lending standards baked in. This is not a narrative. It's already in motion. Institutions see it. Do you? pic.twitter.com/72brm1pEIy — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 2, 2025 From Payments to Full Institutional Utility For years, XRP has been associated primarily with cross-border payments. That reputation is changing as the XRPL now incorporates compliance features such as KYC and AML directly at the protocol layer. According to the shared graphic, the ledger integrates regulatory tools, including decentralized identity and the clawback mechanism for security assurance. This allows banks and financial institutions to operate with confidence on infrastructure that aligns with regulatory standards. The development of institutional features does not stop at compliance. XRP has native order book decentralized exchanges combined with automated market makers under XLS-30. This provides optimal trade execution by merging liquidity pools with order books. These additions position XRP as more than a retail settlement token, giving institutions a platform capable of handling regulated activity. Tokenization of Real-World Assets The report in the graphic emphasized XRP’s potential role as the backbone for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Tokenized bonds, treasuries, and structured financial products are identified as key use cases. These instruments would be issued using a new multi-purpose token standard while maintaining security and compliance. Built-in pricing oracles and automated swaps provide further support for institutional integration. BlackRock and similar firms are projected to push more than $10 trillion worth of assets into tokenized markets by 2030 . XRP’s positioning as a compliance-ready solution makes it a candidate to host such tokenization efforts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By offering on-chain identity, liquidity management, and lending standards, the XRPL aligns with institutional investors’ demand before committing large-scale capital to blockchain networks. Institutional Lending and Credit Markets Institutional lending is set to expand in 2025 with XLS-65d and XLS-66d, which will bring risk-managed credit issuance, on-chain lending, liquidity vaults, and collateralized real-world assets. AMM-based FX and lending strategies are also planned. These tools target banks, asset managers, and institutions that require more than transaction speed, offering a foundation for regulated credit markets on blockchain. As X Finance Bull noted, “this is not a narrative. It’s already in motion.” With compliant stablecoins, tokenized bonds, and institutional lending, the XRPL is shifting from concept to live infrastructure, positioning XRP as a core liquidity layer for DeFi .

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $1.98. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.22 and an average forecast price of $3.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers a multitude of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, with the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) being its best feat. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.403 (-1.43%) Market Cap $641.2M Trading Volume $965.34K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4228 24-hour Low $0.4016 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.407962 (0.07%) Price Volatility 6.78% 50-Day SMA $0.47332 14-Day RSI 39.98 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.567429 EOS price analysis: Negative market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.403 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward market trend toward $0.403. The altcoin lost 1.43% of its value. The EOS coin looks for support around $0.389. On October 4, the EOS price analysis revealed a bearish daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced significant losses, reaching $0.403 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin lost up to 1.43% of its value today, as sellers continue to rule the market, causing further price depreciation. The altcoin has now been losing value for a second consecutive day, targeting the next support at $0.389. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms a decreasing trend as the price moves downward. The EOS/USD value dipped to $0.403 today. The appearance of red candlesticks on the price chart signifies a bearish trend. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.495. The indicator’s lower limit, which serves as the support, has shifted to $0.369. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 37.38 and is nearing the oversold region. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further instability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows selling pressure building up at the current price level. The altcoin’s value has decreased to $0.403 as bears are trying to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a lesser chance of a reversal in market trends or further price depreciation on the 4-hour chart. The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at a low volatility level. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.425, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.398, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 43.40, the RSI curve is pointing downwards, confirming the selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates significant pressure from the selling side of the market. We can expect further depreciation if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has decreased to $0.403 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further decrease in price levels to retest the support of $0.389. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent resistance around the $0.416 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and took the price to $0.403. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2029 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.22 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition, and it also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.22 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinions on EOS Vaulta (formerly EOS) announced a major milestone as its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to a new all-time high of over $412 million. This figure surpasses its previous high of $397 million, set on September 26, 2025. The network had specifically highlighted that past achievement as significant because it occurred despite a broader market downturn. For the current all-time high, Vaulta attributed the growth primarily to the surge in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. $BTC is surging. Vaulta TVL is surging too — now over $412M.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS fell to $0.47 after a price drop. At the start of October, EOS is trending near $0.41 as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-04 11:45:00

Altcoin ETF filings from REX Shares and Osprey Funds propose 21 spot crypto funds, many structured as staking ETF products that pay validator rewards to holders. These filings expand ETF exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ether, introducing yield mechanics and cross-listed ETP allocation via Cayman subsidiaries. How do staking ETFs work within these filings? Staking ETFs would combine market exposure with validator income by delegating on-chain staking rights to service providers. The filings specify operational mechanics, custody models and anticipated reward distribution, while referencing industry participants such as 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour as benchmark providers in plain text. What assets are targeted in the 21 filings? Reported assets include Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Near (NEAR), Sui (SUI), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), Stellar (XLM) and Hype (HYPE). Many proposals allow portions of portfolios to hold European and Canadian exchange-traded products to satisfy tax and listing considerations via Cayman structures. Why do generic listing standards matter for ETF timelines? The SEC’s new generic listing standards for commodity-linked funds eliminate certain case-by-case waivers, shortening the timeline between approval and listing. Funds that qualify under the new standards can move faster to market once the SEC resumes normal operations. How does the U.S. government shutdown impact approvals? Regulatory pauses tied to the government shutdown have frozen SEC staffing and delayed decisions, including impending October deadlines. The agency missed decisions such as the October 2 Canary Litecoin ETF ruling, creating a backlog that affects the 16 crypto ETF proposals with October 2025 statutory deadlines. What should investors and market participants watch next? SEC resumption date : Approval timelines hinge on government operations restarting. Operational details : Custody, staking custody providers, and reward distribution mechanics will influence product suitability. Benchmark selection : Plain-text references to market providers (21Shares, CoinShares, Valour) indicate potential indexing and pricing sources. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to evaluate staking ETF proposals"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess staking ETF filings for investment suitability and regulatory readiness."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review custody and staking mechanics"", ""text"": ""Confirm who holds private keys, the delegation process, and reward calculation methods."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check allocation and foreign ETP exposure"", ""text"": ""Identify any allocations to European or Canadian ETPs and Cayman subsidiary structures that affect tax and liquidity."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor SEC timelines and regulatory notices"", ""text"": ""Track SEC publications and government operations for changes to listing deadlines and approvals."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are the REX-Osprey filings spot or leveraged ETFs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The filings are spot crypto ETFs, many designed to pass through staking rewards to investors rather than using leverage."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will staking rewards increase ETF yield materially?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Staking rewards can add income, but net yield depends on validator fees, slashing risk and operational costs disclosed in fund prospectuses."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will the SEC decide on these proposals?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Decisions are pending and subject to SEC scheduling; current progress is paused by the U.S. government shutdown and could resume once operations restart."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions What are the tax and custody implications of Cayman subsidiaries in ETF filings? Cayman subsidiaries are commonly used to address U.S. tax constraints and to enable exposure to certain foreign-listed ETPs. Investors should review prospectus disclosures for tax treatment and the fund’s custody arrangements before investing. How should investors interpret references to industry providers like 21Shares or CoinShares? Plain-text references to firms such as 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour indicate potential benchmark or operational partners; these mentions are informational and require verification within each fund’s documentation. Key Takeaways REX-Osprey push : 21 altcoin ETF filings signal a major move to expand product types beyond Bitcoin and Ether. Staking introduces yield : Many filings propose passing validator rewards to ETF holders, changing the risk-return profile. Regulatory timing is critical : Generic listing standards shorten potential timelines, but the U.S. government shutdown has stalled SEC action and tightened October 2025 deadlines. Conclusion The wave of REX and Osprey altcoin ETF filings could reshape crypto ETF offerings by introducing staking ETF mechanics and broader asset coverage. Investors should monitor SEC status, read prospectuses for custody and reward details, and prepare for timelines tied to government operations.

Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee are among the Fed officials who raised concerns about economic and inflation conditions. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also noted that large rate cuts lack support, emphasizing a policy consensus that balances the central bank’s monetary policy approach. He claimed that making significant policy moves at this time is unnecessary. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed doubt about future rate cuts unless inflation drops. Alberto Musalem, President of the Bank of St. Louis, also warned that the Fed is edging closer to its rate cut limits. Miran says policy is out of whack Miran said that the Fed’s monetary policy is out of whack, and reasonable adjustments should be made briskly. However, he remains skeptical about the central bank’s current interest rate policy, pointing out that the Fed might not have reached that point yet. Miran believes that the Fed is at a point where, if it keeps the current interest rate steady for another day, it will be in crisis. However, he foresees a bigger problem in the Fed’s hands if the current rate is held for an extra year. “If you sort of keep it there another day, it’s a crisis, but if you keep it there for an extra year, yeah, I think you have…problems on your hands.” – Stephen Miran , Governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve Miran said on September 22 that leaving the policy restrictive to the current extent risks significantly compromising the Fed’s mandate. He and other FOMC members also believe the neutral rate is not where it ought to be due to President Trump’s policy changes. Miran further explained how deregulation, tax, immigration, and trade policy changes are either increasing nominal savings or boosting productivity in ways that lower the neutral rate. He added that these changes make monetary policy that was not as tight at the beginning of the year, now too restrictive. Bowman predicts three rate cuts in 2025 Michelle Bowman, a member of the Fed board of Governors, predicted on October 3 that the Fed would make three rate cuts before the end of the year. Bowman, who also serves as the current Vice Chair of Supervision, pointed out that these cuts would counter labor market risks and support the economy’s stability as inflation neared the 2% target. However, Miran’s preference for bolder rate cuts places him at odds with most policymakers. Most regional Fed presidents still worry about lowering rates at the current inflation rate, which has remained well above the 2% target. Policymakers also believe that Trump’s tariffs will accelerate inflation as their effects surge through the economy. Miran advocated for a 0.50% rate cut in the next rate-setting meeting, but most officials called for a moderate trim to the 4% to 4.25% range. Fed officials seek to strike a balance between lowering high inflation and supporting the weakening jobs market. The officials further predicted an interest rate target between 3.5% and 3.75% by the end of 2025, with a likelihood of moving to the 3.25% to 3.5% range in 2026. However, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee believes the central bank is now in a sticky spot. He remains a little wary about front-loading too many rates and hoping that inflation will subside. Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Logan remains hawkish and claims that the Fed needs to be cautious about further rate cuts. She previously pointed out that the worrisome environment suggests high inflation is driven by more than just tariff-related issues. Bowman also believes that the Fed policy is at risk of falling behind the curve, especially in offsetting labor market risks. However, Miran stresses that his approach is similar to that of other policymakers, only that he wants to reach the goal faster. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

With that ceiling nearly cleared, a quick move to $135,000 could be in the cards, according to Standard Chartered head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick. In a note published on Friday, Kendrick argued that the U.S. government shutdown is playing a bigger role in markets than in past episodes supporting bitcoin's rally. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, BTC traded in a different context. Now, the largest crypto has been closely correlated with U.S. government risk, measured by the U.S. Treasury term premiums, a relationship that suggests the uncertainty around the shutdown acts as a bullish driver this time. Traders on prediction marketplace Polymarket currently give more than a 60% chance that the shutdown lasts 10–29 days. Kendrick forecasted BTC will continue to rise throughout that period. Kendrick also highlighted a coming shift in ETF investor behavior. While gold ETFs have recently outperformed their BTC counterparts with gold pushing to record prices, spot bitcoin ETF flows are poised to catch up providing tailwind for the asset, the report said. Of the $58 billion in net BTC ETF inflows so far, $23 billion has come in 2025, he said. This week alone, they attracted over $2.25 billion without the Friday session. Kendrick projected that the vehicles could pull in another $20 billion investor capital by year-end – enough to keep his $200,000 year-end BTC price target in play.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Standard Chartered Bank|US Government|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 12:00:00

Solana (SOL) is holding steady near $232, while Chainlink (LINK) recently broke through $22, signaling momentum for the next market rally. In this environment, one emerging altcoin is gaining traction with strong fundamentals: MAGACOIN FINANCE . These three projects are positioned for significant growth, supported by both technical developments and institutional involvement. Solana’s Institutional Push Solana continues to display a strong growth pattern as the digital asset currently trades at a price point close to $232. This price has held despite last week’s $6 million liquidation surge. As their ETFs SOLT and SOLZ continue to experience inflows, institutional interest growing has secured this stability. analysts think solana will reach $300 as the network keeps scaling the rest of the year. The development of Firedancer to be introduced by Solana is expected to facilitate validator throughput. Further, it will upgrade capabilities and remove fixed compute unit limit. Solana is committed to enhancing its transaction throughput and security amid growing competition in the decentralized application and DeFi space. Solana’s ecosystem is growing despite some short-term bearish pressure Recent actions include listings on Nasdaq companies which will accept SOL as payment and alliances that cement Solana’s place in blockchain. As we head into Q4 2025, technical upgrades, institutional demand and ecosystem growth make Solana a strong contender. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Growth Chainlink has also seen significant developments, and is currently trading at $22, overcoming important resistance levels. The recent 2025 Swift Hackathon win of the project highlights its ability to fit into institutional networks as a finance workflow keyblock. Chainlink is gaining reputation by leaps and bounds in the DeFi and regulatory spaces, as seen here. Chainlink has significantly expanded its ecosystem with 12 integrations across 10 blockchains including Solana. The integrations improve the use of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and decentralized price feeds on these chains. More and more institutions, including UBS, have summered Chainlink’s Digital Transfer Agent (DTA) standard for tokenized assets, shaping Chainlink as an important infrastructure provider for the future of digital finance. Chainlink is displaying bullish patterns technically while whales are also accumulating it for the long haul. LINK has crucial resistance at $30. If LINK breaks above $22.50 and continues gaining institutional traction, the price could push higher according to some analysts. Investors Highlight Early Stage Play for Longterm Accumulation While Solana and Chainlink are established leaders in their respective ecosystems, another emerging altcoin is drawing significant attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE runs on a Hashex-audited smart contract, ensuring transparency and security for all investors. It also features a top-tier ecosystem, creating built-in scarcity and positioning it for long-term appreciation. Community engagement continues to grow, with wallet activity signaling early adoption. Investors are increasingly paying attention to the scarcity-driven investment potential of the project, particularly given its transparent foundation and limited supply model. Analysts have highlighted it as one of the best crypto to buy now as capital rotates into promising new opportunities. Conclusion Solana’s strong technical position near $232, Chainlink’s recent breakout above $22, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-driven model make these three altcoins some of the best opportunities heading into the final months of 2025. For investors looking to position ahead of the next rally, these coins offer compelling setups, with Solana and Chainlink leading the way for institutional adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a top contender for future growth.

Analyst Says It Could Be The Next Amazon,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-to-100-analyst-says-it-could-be-the-next-amazon/,"According to new analysis and community discussion, XRP’s recent price action has rekindled a long-running comparison to Amazon’s slow climb before a major breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Some analysts say the pattern looks familiar: a long consolidation, then a steep rally. Amazon’s stock took 3,800 days — more than a decade — to clear its old highs and later rose from about $5 to over $200, a timeline that is being used as a benchmark by bullish XRP voices. Regulatory Battles Do Not End Growth Based on reports, the regulatory history has nuances. Brad Kimes revived the comparison and pointed to regulatory pressure on Amazon as similar to what Ripple faced. Amazon vs XRP. Reminder, Amazon was sued by the SEC, too. 👇 https://t.co/ZXqtWhancp — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) October 3, 2025 That point needed fact-checking. The SEC opened an inquiry into Amazon in 2022 over its testimony on third-party seller data; that probe closed with no fines or charges. The case that led to legal action, however, came from the FTC. The FTC sued Amazon in June 2023 over checkout practices, and the matter was resolved last month with a $2.5 billion settlement — $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds earmarked for roughly 35 million users by December 2025. The broader claim — that major firms can face heavy government scrutiny and still grow — still holds weight in the debate. XRP’s Pattern And Long-Term Claim According to Nick Anderson of Bullrunners, XRP is building a “cup and handle” formation near prior peaks. At the time of his write-up, XRP was changing hands around $2.71. Anderson argued that if XRP follows a similar multi-year path as Amazon, it could eventually trade near $100. He added that someone holding 10,000 XRP would become a millionaire at that level, and that 10,000 holders were among the top 4% on the XRP rich list during his analysis. He warned, however, that such an outcome would likely take years, not months. Technical Signals And Price Targets Meanwhile, based on a technical note from Cryptoinsightuk, XRP has seen a three-day RSI bullish crossover — a signal that has preceded big gains in the past. The analyst pointed out that in each of the three previous times the three-day RSI crossed up, XRP recorded strong rallies. XRP was trading near $3.02 and holding above local support around $2.72. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI.

With recent regulatory hints, institutional flows, and ETF momentum fueling optimism, the stage feels set for a possible run toward $200,000 if three key conditions fall into place. Miss one, and you might miss the move of the decade. At the same time, the stage is set for a new DeFi project to revolutionise payments. It has recently announced CEX listings and its beta wallet is testing live. Bitcoin: The King’s Path to $200,000 Bitcoin already has momentum. It recently broke above $120,000 amid ETF inflows and macro uncertainty. But to vault to $200,000 in 2025, BTC must not only hold gains but soar on fresh catalysts. Analysts are whispering comparisons to past cycles: “if every bank holds BTC,” one strategist suggests, “$200,000 is conservative.” Early buyers who picked up BTC below $100,000 are already showing double-digit gains. But those gains pale if Bitcoin becomes the next multi­-hundred thousand mover. If institutions flood in, they can push demand into scarcity territory. If Washington gives clear rules (Bitcoin seen as digital gold, friendly tax policy), more capital will arrive with confidence. And if the Fed pivots, investors seeking higher yield may flood into risk assets again. Combine those, and $200,000 becomes more than a dream. Remittix: A Next-Gen DeFi Powerhouse Remittix is built as a cross-chain DeFi project focused not on speculation, but real-world payments: crypto to bank, borderless transfers, bank rails in 30+ countries. The architecture is built so regular users benefit. What you need to know: Remittix’s wallet beta is going live soon, with real-time FX conversion baked in. The team is fully CertiK verified and the presale has already raised over $27 million. Over 40,000 holders are reported, and listing plans on BitMart and LBank are in motion. Whales are quietly accumulating: some insiders call RTX “XRP 2.0 in payments gear.” Compared to others, Remittix stands out because it blends utility, community, and momentum. While many tokens promise “metaverse” or “AI,” RTX is pitched as a payments rails solution. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Global Reach: crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Real-World Utility: built for real payments, not hype Security First: fully verified by CertiK, ranked #1 prelaunch Raised Over $27 Million: robust early funding + strong demand Deflationary Tokenomics: designed to reward long-term holders If Remittix nails execution, it could become a foundational layer in cross-border DeFi payments. Many early buyers believe it’s among the fastest growing crypto 2025 stories. $250,000 Giveaway & Referral Blitz: Why Time Matters Remittix is delivering urgency. The team just launched a $250,000 giveaway to its community, amplifying buzz. On top of that, a new referral program pays 15% back in USDT whenever you refer someone — claimable daily from your dashboard. Early testers are already reporting thousands in rewards just by sharing their links. Look: more holders means more liquidity, more listings, more media.

For XRP, traders are closely watching a defining resistance zone that has contained the price in recent sessions. If this barrier gives way, the move to $3.30 may not just be probable — it could unfold with speed. As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.00–$3.05, with strong liquidity across major exchanges. Daily trading volumes remain elevated in the billions, underscoring the intensity of activity at these levels. The token’s price structure has become increasingly compressed, setting the stage for a breakout that could redraw the short-term chart. Xoom’s Key Analysis Crypto analyst Xoom has drawn attention to a clear “point of interest” on XRP’s chart — a descending trendline that has repeatedly rejected bullish advances. XRP’s repeated tests of this line, including a brief breach, underscore its significance as a key technical level. According to Xoom, a decisive break above this barrier could propel XRP to $3.30 without significant resistance. XRP rejected from point of interest twice, once broken… a move to $3.30 zone would likely be a quick one. https://t.co/GRgGQ6QxKZ pic.twitter.com/4D51eeqPhr — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 3, 2025 Why $3.30 is the Target The $3.30 zone represents a visible resistance level where liquidity clusters are concentrated. Beyond this point, stop orders from short positions are likely stacked, creating a cascading effect once triggered. This makes the $3.30 level not only a technical target but also a psychological one , where traders anticipate immediate reactions in volume and order flow. Mid-range chart structures support this projection, marking $3.30 as the next logical destination if the trendline break is confirmed. Market Momentum and Whale Participation Recent activity reinforces the potential for speed once the breakout occurs. Each approach to resistance has been met with surging volume, suggesting large participants are closely engaged. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Whale wallets and on-chain data indicate renewed accumulation, and rising daily active addresses suggest growing market interest. Historically, when accumulation and breakouts align, XRP’s price has surged rapidly. Confirmation and Risk Management Despite the bullish setup, caution remains essential. A genuine breakout requires a firm close above the trendline supported by elevated trading volume. A successful retest of the broken resistance should transform it into a support level. Without these confirmations, traders risk being caught in a false move. Disciplined investors will focus on tight risk management and strategic stop-loss placements to navigate upcoming market fluctuations. In conclusion, Xoom’s analysis underscores the significance of the current technical setup. XRP’s proximity to a critical resistance line, combined with strong market activity and whale participation, suggests that once this barrier is cleared, the sprint to $3.30 could be swift and decisive. Traders who understand both the opportunity and the risks will be best positioned to capture what may be one of XRP’s fastest near-term moves.

Key point 1: SBF attributes the FTX collapse to relinquishing leadership to John J. Ray III on Nov. 11, 2022. Key point 2: FTX’s bankruptcy revealed an $8.9 billion shortfall tied to Alameda Research fund transfers. Key point 3: The FTX estate has repaid $7.8 billion so far and estimates up to $16.5 billion in recoverable assets. Sam Bankman-Fried biggest mistake: SBF says handing FTX to new management cost a rescue chance — read creditor repayment updates and legal aftermath. Sam Bankman‑Fried claimed that handing over FTX to its current CEO was the “single biggest mistake” that prevented him from saving the exchange. What was Sam Bankman‑Fried’s biggest mistake that led to the FTX collapse? Sam Bankman‑Fried’s biggest mistake was signing over control of FTX to new management on Nov. 11, 2022, a decision he says removed his ability to accept a possible external investment minutes later. This transfer preceded the Chapter 11 filing and accelerated the exchange’s bankruptcy process. How did the leadership handover affect the bankruptcy process? The leadership handover on Nov. 11, 2022, allowed John J. Ray III to assume control and quickly pursue Chapter 11 protections. Under new direction, the estate engaged Sullivan & Cromwell for restructuring and legal representation. Plain‑text reporting by Reuters and coverage in Mother Jones document timelines and legal filings surrounding these decisions. Why did FTX collapse and how large was the investor shortfall? FTX collapsed after internal transfers of customer funds to Alameda Research produced trading losses now described as the “Alameda gap.” Criminal convictions established that unauthorized transfers created an estimated $8.9 billion shortfall and triggered mass withdrawals, liquidity failure, and bankruptcy. Who was appointed and what legal actions followed? John J. Ray III was appointed chief executive and filed Chapter 11 the same day. Sullivan & Cromwell subsequently provided legal services and, according to legal filings reviewed by Reuters, earned over $171.8 million in fees by mid‑2024. A creditors’ suit naming the law firm was filed and later voluntarily dismissed in October 2024. Source: Documentcloud.org How much have FTX creditors been repaid and what remains outstanding? The FTX estate began distributions in February and, through September, has returned a cumulative $7.8 billion to creditors. Recovery efforts estimate up to $16.5 billion in assets available, leaving roughly $8.7 billion outstanding. The estate projects repaying most customers at or above 98% of their account values as of November 2022. When were the latest repayments delivered and who reports them? On Sept. 30 the estate executed a $1.6 billion distribution, reported by a creditor committee member known as Sunil via social posts. Official repayment schedules and totals are documented in court filings and estate communications; independent reporting has tracked these milestones since the first $1.2 billion payout in February.

The Alameda gap resulted from unauthorized transfers of customer funds to Alameda Research to cover trading losses, creating a multibillion‑dollar deficit between customer balances and available assets. How can creditors track future FTX repayments? Creditors should monitor official court filings, trustee notices, and estate distributions published by the FTX estate. Independent coverage and creditor committee posts provide supplementary updates. Key Takeaways SBF’s assessment : Handing FTX to new management on Nov. 11, 2022, is described by SBF as his biggest mistake. Scale of loss : The collapse revealed an $8.9 billion shortfall tied to Alameda Research transfers and triggered Chapter 11 proceedings. Repayments ongoing : The estate has returned $7.8 billion so far and estimates up to $16.5 billion in recoverable assets, aiming for near‑full customer recovery. Conclusion Sam Bankman‑Fried’s public statement that relinquishing control of FTX was his “single biggest mistake” frames the legal and financial aftermath of the exchange’s failure. Ongoing estate recoveries and creditor distributions continue to unfold, while regulators, litigants, and industry participants evaluate reforms to prevent similar collapses.

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to nearly $124,000, thanks to surging institutional demand, shifting Federal Reserve policy, and investor optimism about a bullish Q4. BTC faced volatility on Friday as it rose to an intraday high of $123,996 before settling at $122,318. Analysts believe the rally will continue and the price will hit a new all-time high. Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle May Continue In Some Form Gemini’s head of the APAC region, Saad Ahmed, believes Bitcoin’s four-year cycle could continue in some form. Ahmed added that while the cycle may not play out as it has in the past, it doesn’t mean the concept is dead. “I think when it comes to the four-year cycle, the reality is that it’s very likely that we’ll continue to see some form of a cycle. It ultimately stems from people getting really excited and overextending themselves, and then you kind of see a crash, and then it kind of corrects to an equilibrium.” However, Ahmed stated that growing institutional involvement in crypto could help the market absorb some volatility. “You’ll see some of the volatility, kind of a flag off, but you’ll still see some sort of a cycle, because ultimately, it’s driven by human emotion.” However, analyst Rekt Capital believes October marks Bitcoin’s cycle peak if previous patterns hold. Rekt Capital had stated in July that if BTC’s current cycle mirrors 2020, the market will peak in October. “We have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left.” Analyst Predicts Massive Bitcoin Rally Analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic about Bitcoin’s (BTC) prospects in October. According to one team of analysts, Bitcoin could reach $143,000 this month, a 20% rally. While such a prediction may seem almost outlandish, historical data shows that October is one of the most bullish months for the flagship cryptocurrency. Over the past 12 years, BTC has closed in positive territory 10 times. After a positive end to September, Bitcoin is poised for a fruitful October. In four out of four instances when BTC closed September and October positively, the trend continued in November. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is eying the $124,000 level after reaching an intraday high of $123,996 on Friday. Bullish sentiment around the asset has surged thanks to surging institutional interest, shifting Federal Reserve Policy, and rising open interest. Analysts believe BTC could go into price discovery if bullish sentiment persists, potentially rising towards $130,000. One of the most prominent drivers of the latest rally is the US government shutdown and the market’s indifferent reaction. Federal agencies have started to furlough staff, and key economic data and report releases are facing delays. Bitcoin has directly benefited from the shutdown as traders position themselves to deal with the lack of clear policy direction. The shutdown has also complicated matters for the Federal Reserve, as inflation and jobs data could be delayed, leading to speculative inflows into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitfinex analysts stated, “Bitcoin’s movement toward a new all-time high appears genuinely organic. We suspect that Trump’s announcement of potentially considering a stimulus cheque for every citizen, funded by tariffs, could also contribute to a further rise in Bitcoin’s price. This could mirror what we witnessed following the COVID stimulus cheques. Meanwhile, steady ETF inflows provide a clear tailwind.” On-chain data has confirmed the recent surge is driven by demand, with analysts highlighting a taker buy volume spike of over $1.6 billion in one hour across exchanges. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. BTC recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,659. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.65% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,621. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday despite volatility and selling pressure. As a result, BTC reached an intraday high of $123,996 before settling at $122,318. The price is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $122,349.

The partnership will provide easier access to cryptocurrency for 75 million Galaxy users in the US, with a global rollout also in the works. Coinbase Expands Coinbase Integration Electronics giant Samsung has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to allow its Galaxy smartphone users to buy crypto directly from its native Samsung Wallet. The first phase of the partnership will see 75 million Galaxy smartphone users in the US gain access to Coinbase One, a subscription service that offers zero staking fees, high staking rewards, and account protection to secure funds and accounts from unauthorized access. Shan Aggarwal, chief business officer at Coinbase, stated, “Together with Samsung, we’re pairing their global scale with Coinbase’s trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto — starting with more than 75 million Galaxy users across the U.S., and soon around the world.” While the initial rollout is in the US, the partnership will be expanded to Galaxy smartphone users worldwide, potentially bringing a substantial influx of new investors into the cryptocurrency market. There are over one billion Galaxy smartphone users globally. Making Crypto More Accessible The partnership will allow Galaxy smartphone users in the US to buy crypto using Samsung Wallet. Users will also get free access to Coinbase One, which costs $4.99 per month for the basic version and $29.99 for the premium version. Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong believes the partnership will make crypto even more accessible to the general public. “Excited to be partnering with Samsung to make crypto even more accessible. We’re offering 75M+ Samsung Galaxy users in the U.S. free access to Coinbase One to bring them on board. And we’ve fully integrated Samsung Pay, so every Coinbase user in the U.S. can use that to buy crypto.” Samsung And Crypto Samsung Wallet is an evolution of Samsung Pay, which was initially introduced in 2015. The offering integrated several crypto wallet features and rebranded itself as the Samsung Wallet mobile application in June 2022. The application was first rolled out as a payment method and deposit option for cryptocurrency traders at the end of July. The partnership with Coinbase highlights Samsung’s commitment to allowing its users to explore and engage with crypto on a secure, trusted platform from the convenience of their mobiles. Users can use the Samsung Wallet to execute mobile transactions, make payments, complete peer-to-peer transactions, and access digital identity services.

Bitcoin surged from $120,000 to $123,855, but failed to break past its all-time high of $124,128. Bitcoin is trading around $122,604, having retreated somewhat from a brief peak, according to CoinGecko data. It's up 1.3% on the day and over 11% on a weekly basis. Related News: New Development in the US Government Shutdown Crisis - Next Critical Date Set This is the first time Bitcoin has come this close since reaching a record high of $124,128 in mid-August. BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale said in a statement, “Bitcoin briefly tested record highs but retreated due to profit-taking. The overall outlook remains positive; Bitcoin demand is expected to increase as the prolonged government shutdown drives investors into alternative assets.” Strah Savinja, Head of Data and Analytics at FRNT Financial, argued that Bitcoin's safe haven perception is strengthening: “BTC's appeal is not only more visible, but also more deeply ingrained. This is increasingly evident at a time when trust in traditional institutions is eroding.” *This is not investment advice.

For four years, daily transactions on the network held within a span of 900,000 to 1.2 million. However, the range is finally broken as the protocol now records 1.6 million to 1.7 million daily transactions. The steady rise shows that Ethereum’s usage is expanding despite market chaos, with data from Etherscan confirming the same upward flow and showing sustained transaction heights that now surpass previous years. Activity Spikes as Ethereum Leads DeFi Momentum CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost measured the activity using a 14-day simple moving average to account for normal volatility, with the recent jump to 1.6-1.7 million marking a major departure from this long-standing pattern. He related the surge to the pressure of decentralized finance (DeFi) growth , with Ethereum serving as both a liquidity support, a lending platform, and a stablecoin transfer. This rapid expansion in on-chain activity also demonstrates a documented correlation with the price of ETH, providing a fundamental basis for its market performance. The data shows that even during a period of negative sentiment in late March, the network was already processing a higher average of 1.2 million transactions per day, setting the stage for the current breakout. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock previously indicated increasing gas consumption on the main chain as a signal of higher smart contract activity. Meanwhile, other reports also revealed that stablecoin flows on Ethereum have accelerated . This represents a trend that directly supports the rising transaction count. The upswing is not just about token swaps. Data from CryptoSlam show there’s been a surge in ETH-based NFT sales, with minting and rollup settlements contributing to the spike. Accumulation, Reserves, and Long-term Impact Ethereum’s network growth is happening at a time its native ETH token is showing quite strength. The asset surged by double digits since the start of the week to over $4,400 at one point. There is also growing institutional interest, with a separate report indicating that digital asset treasury companies now hold a larger percentage of the total ETH supply (4%) than they do of Bitcoin (3%), suggesting a possible shift in preference among corporate balance sheets. The combination of strong on-chain activity and a successful price breakout above $4,000 has analysts charting ambitious paths forward. One trader, Merlijn, described the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency’s long-term price structure as a “ladder,” with the recent move establishing a new base for future advances. His analysis pointed to an ascending channel that projects potential targets at $6,500, $8,000, and even $10,000. At the same time, other market watchers are keeping a close eye on key resistance levels. They have identified the $4,350 zone as a significant barrier that, if overcome, could open the path toward $4,790.

It has been three years since AI became mainstream through the introduction of ChatGPT, and the report claims that Americans are still showing up to their jobs in droves. According to the report, the researchers looked into federal employment data through July. The researchers also tracked how quickly the mix of occupations changed since November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public. The report also noted that while jobs shifted slightly faster in recent years, about a percentage point higher than the early 2000s internet boom, the changes appear to be normal for technological transitions rather than the economic upheaval that many feared. Yale study finds that AI has yet to take lots of jobs Tech firm executives have predicted that artificial intelligence may soon start to take plenty of jobs, but the report finds that it may not happen soon. “We are not in an economy-wide jobs apocalypse right now; it’s mostly stable,” Molly Kinder, a senior fellow at Brookings and co-author of the paper, told The Financial Times. “That should be a reassuring message to an anxious public.” In addition, the gap between Silicon Valley rhetoric and workplace reality has grown bleak. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei mentioned earlier this year that more than 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear in the next five years. The company also created an initiative, the Economic Futures Program, to track the impact of artificial intelligecnce on the labor market and the global economy earlier this year. Meanwhile, Geoffrey Hinton, known as the Godfather of artificial intelligence, mentioned that the financial gap could be dramatically worsened by AI if things continue to go the way they have been going in the last few years. “What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” he told the Financial Times. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.” Study shows little or no effect across fields Over the last few years, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has singled out customer service jobs as the most vulnerable, with a study arguing that the tech matched skilled human workers in at least 44 business areas. However, data tells a different story. The Yale researchers claimed they examined multiple metrics, including occupational mix changes, industry-specific shifts, and artificial intelligence exposure levels across different job categories. They claimed that workers most exposed to artificial intelligence automation showed no signs of displacement. The information sector, which includes newspapers, movies, and data processing, showed the largest occupational shift. Notably, these changes began before the release of ChatGPT , suggesting that most of the changes are due to industry-specific factors. Finance and professional services also showed the same pattern, showing that movements had happened before the artificial intelligence evolution. Researchers also claimed that young college graduates have struggled in terms of employment, with unemployment among 20-24 year olds with bachelor’s degrees rising to 9.3% in August from 4.4% in April. But the research team noted that the pattern matched that of older degree orders aged between 25 and 29, indicating that there is a labor market slowdown rather than artificial intelligence replacement. The dissimilarity between these age groups has fluctuated between 30% and 33% since 2021, showing no rise after the release of ChatGPT. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This reversal made the market wonder whether the ETH is preparing for another breakout in October. While Ethereum continues to lead the domain of the smart contract platform, new entrants into the DeFi space include the likes of Remittix (RTX) that has blockchain technology with real-world payment solutions.

In cases where a presale is trending, there are usually negative allegations on the internet. Skeptics want to know whether the project is genuine or if it is another scam. In MAGACOIN FINANCE , analysts, auditors, and investors share the same opinion: this presale is a valid opportunity with independent confirmation.. Legitimacy is verified by Security Audits Independent blockchain audits provide the greatest evidence of legitimacy. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already undergone a complete audit by Hashex.org, one of the most reputable companies in the security of smart contracts: See Hashex Audit of MAGACOIN FINANCE The Hashex audit examined the code of the smart contract of the project and established that it is secure, which cancels the usual weaknesses that destroy many new tokens. Moreover, a Certik audit which is a standard in blockchain security, is also underway. When it is ready, it will add a second independent verification layer, which will once again demonstrate that MAGACOIN FINANCE is a 100% legitimate presale. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Legit Beyond audits, analysts highlight several factors that confirm MAGACOIN FINANCE as a trusted project: Verified Official Portal — Tokens are sold only through magacoinfinance.com , ensuring buyer safety. Transparent Structure — A stage-based presale model makes pricing and allocations clear. Analyst Recognition — Multiple crypto experts have listed it as a best crypto presale for 2025 . Community Growth — Investor interest is visible across Telegram and X, building strong grassroots momentum. Audit Verification — Passing the Hashex audit sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from unverified presales. Why Negative Claims Appear Fast-rising projects often attract rumors of scams — especially in competitive presale markets. Analysts stress that this is not unusual. The difference is that MAGACOIN FINANCE has verifiable audits and analyst support , which make it easy for investors to separate fact from rumor. Analyst Perspective on MAGACOIN FINANCE Analysts have always identified MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high conviction presale selection. Transparency, high levels of community adoption, and third party audit make the project one that sparks confidence amongst the retail investors and the whales. To gain trust and legitimacy, unlike presales, which are based entirely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has engaged in quantifiable actions to promote trust and legitimacy. What to Expect of Early Investors To the first and early buyers, MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide a way out: Token Claims — An official site will make Presale allocations claimable at the conclusion of the presale. Exchange Listings — Expected in Q4 2025 , listings will bring broader market access Continued Audits — As Hashex is already finished and Certik is progressing, investors may expect further verification before launch. This roadmap gives confidence to the long-term participants. Final Takeaway So, is MAGACOIN FINANCE a scam? The response of analysts and auditors is obvious, no. The project already successfully passed a Hashex.org audit but is undergoing a Certik audit , so it will be one of the most checked and authentic presales of 2025. As a project that is analyzed and audited as a secure, and trusted entity, MAGACOIN FINANCE fits into the current presale market to the benefit of investors who are looking into the opportunities.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a great option for people who want to buy cheap cryptocurrency with a lot of growth potential. At a price of only $0.035 per token, Phase 6 of the presale has already raised about $16.8 million, with over 16,750 users claiming more than 60% of the offer. The price will go up to $0.040 during the next sales phase. This is the last chance to buy early before prices go up. Stablecoin innovation and liquidity mechanics add depth When it comes to lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) choices. P2C pools let lenders put assets on deposit and make interest while keeping borrowers’ cash on hand. P2P arrangements, on the other hand, let people directly agree to lend more niche or volatile assets. This two-part structure gives crypto coin investors who want to balance risk and yield both stability and freedom. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unique because it has a decentralized stablecoin that is intended to stay fixed at $1. This stablecoin will only be created when people borrow money against assets that are overcollateralized. It will be burned instantly when loans are paid back or assets are sold. To keep the peg steady, governance will actively control interest rates on loans. Rates will go up if the stablecoin falls below $1 and down if it trades above $1. Issuer limits and a controlled mint/burn cycle keep the protocol safe and give investors a way to predict their risk. Borrow interest and liquidity control make the protocol even more appealing. Interest rates change dynamically based on how much of the pool is being used. This makes sure that capital is distributed efficiently. When usage goes up, yields go up, which encourages more deposits. On the other hand, lower usage lowers rates, which makes people more likely to borrow. This system keeps supply and demand in balance while giving crypto investors the best results possible. A strong, multi-layered method is used in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for price discovery. Chainlink oracles give accurate prices for both USD and native assets, and backup feeds and gathered sources make it less important to rely on a single provider. Time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) from decentralized exchanges and other on-chain measures make the data even more accurate. These tools work together to make sure accurate collateral values and safe liquidations, which gives investors faith in the security of the system. Roadmap milestones and security anchors highlight credibility To build, finish, and release a fully functional platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adheres to a four-phase roadmap. The first phase has been completed, which included the presale launch, marketing efforts, giveaways, and audits from outside sources. In Phase 2, the main focus will be on building core smart contracts, the front end of the DApp, the back end infrastructure, and advanced analytics. In Phase 3, the platform will be finished by beta testing, launching the demo, finishing the audit, and getting ready for the exchange offering. In Phase 4, the live platform will go live, MUTM token claims will be possible, the project will grow to include more chains, and major partnerships will be made. This will set the stage for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still puts a lot of importance on security. It got a score of 90 on the CertiK analysis for TokenScan and a score of 79 on Skynet. There is a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program that pays out for weaknesses based on how bad they are: Critical up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium up to $500, and Low up to $200. The current $100,000 giveaway and more than 12,000 Twitter followers show that the community is very active, and the AI-powered helpdesk makes sure that users can get help and support without any problems. The ROI estimates show why MUTM is appealing to crypto investors. People who bought in Phase 1 at $0.01 have already made 250% at $0.035. A listing at $0.06 will mean a 500% return, and long-term goals for analysts range from $0.45 to $1 per token as beta testing, exchange listings, and multi-chain growth take place. In this way, MUTM is a unique example of a cheap cryptocurrency that has a structured growth potential and is backed by strong mechanics and security. With Phase 6 nearly 60% sold, the next presale price at $0.040 will close the window for discounted entry. For investors in crypto coins seeking a low-cost, high-upside option, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an opportunity to participate in a protocol designed for stability, growth, and rewards before broader market catalysts trigger higher prices. Early participation ensures access to this final cheap crypto entry point before Phase 7.

In the past, traders who were able to identify low-cap coins and hold through periods of volatility often came out on top. More than ever, the hunt for the leading altcoins to buy is growing as the most established names reach new highs, making them unlikely to produce outsized gains in the near future. Some traders are now shifting attention to altcoins in crypto presales , as these open the door to purchasing tokens at rock-bottom prices before they are listed on exchanges. Some of the most notable crypto presales worth watching include $LIVE with its 30x launch price increase, BlockchainFX, and Bitcoin Hyper. How to Find the Best Altcoin to Buy Now The best altcoins to buy can be hard to spot in such a crowded market. Unfortunately, even the crypto presale market has become very busy, making it a big task to identify the future winners and ignore the potential losers. One key thing to look for is a clear roadmap and real utility. Projects that are planning ahead are far more likely to launch successfully and generate strong returns for early buyers. Another factor to consider is a solid social media presence. This applies to both utility tokens and memecoins, as presales thrive when communities rally around them and amplify their reach. Some of the projects that regularly come up in discussions as meeting these criteria include $LIVE, BlockDAG, and BlockchainFX. The $LIVE Crypto Presale: 30x Returns on Launch Precedence Research produced a report that claimed the augmented reality (AR) market could grow to $2 trillion by 2035. This is a huge potential opportunity, and the $LIVE presale is tapping directly into this trend. The LivLive AR world is designed to turn everyday actions into interactive quests where players can earn crypto rewards and brands can launch marketing campaigns that are personalized and verifiable. The LivLive technology aims to merge AR with gamification, creating an ecosystem where users can move seamlessly between the physical and digital worlds. Players benefit through rewards for completing real-world challenges, while businesses gain access to a next-generation marketing platform that leverages AI, data insights, and blockchain verification. The pricing structure of the $LIVE presale makes it especially appealing. Entry is set at just $0.0083 per token, while the launch price has already been fixed at $0.25, meaning early buyers are guaranteed a 30x increase on launch. In its private presale, LivLive raised $2 million from whale investors. This strong early support highlights the belief that AR could be the next major sector in crypto, and many traders now view $LIVE as one of the best chances to gain early exposure before the project goes live. LivLIve crypto AR rewards. BlockDAG BlockDAG has become synonymous with the crypto presale space. In many ways, this project kick-started the current presale boom and has, in the process, raised over $400 million according to the official website. The project is built as a Layer-1 network with a focus on scalability and mining efficiency, aiming to rival existing blockchain ecosystems. At the heart of the project is the BDAG token, which is being sold through a tiered system. Each time a tier is completed, the token price increases, rewarding the earliest participants with the largest potential returns. BlockchainFX The BlockchainFX presale is an interesting mix between traditional finance and DeFi. The BFX token is the native currency of the exchange the team is building, where users can trade both traditional assets and crypto. For example, a user could manage their NVIDIA stock position while simultaneously trading Ethereum, all without switching platforms or accounts. The project’s narrative has captured strong market attention, with over 10,000 participants already buying into the BFX presale. Many have also taken advantage of the presale staking option, which allows them to begin earning additional tokens even before the platform officially launches. Final Thoughts on the Top Crypto Presales To Buy The top altcoins to buy now are generally those with lower market caps and strong communities. Crypto presales are leading the charge in this area, especially as established altcoins have grown their market capitalizations significantly. The $LIVE presale offers an AR-focused project where early buyers can expect 30x returns on launch and access to a $2.5 million crypto giveaway.

Among these opportunities, altcoin presales stand out as a potential goldmine for those looking to get in on the ground floor. With established cryptocurrencies reaching peak valuations, the focus is shifting towards newer, less-known coins. Why Crypto Presales? The allure of crypto presales lies in their offer of tokens at minimal prices before they hit the major exchanges. Notable presales, such as $LIVE, BlockchainFX, and Bitcoin Hyper have already demonstrated their potential with impressive price surges from their initial offerings. Spotting Potential in Altcoins Identifying promising altcoins involves scrutinizing their roadmaps and utility. Projects that have clear, actionable plans and genuine applications stand a better chance of thriving. Moreover, a robust social media presence can signal strong community support, which is crucial for the success of any crypto token. Highlight: $LIVE's Augmented Reality Integration The $LIVE token presale is particularly captivating due to its connection with the burgeoning augmented reality (AR) market. According to Precedence Research , AR could grow to a $2 trillion industry by 2035. The LivLive project is poised to capitalize on this by incorporating AR into daily activities, making them part of an interactive crypto-earning experience. The innovative approach of merging AR with gamification sets LivLive apart, encouraging both users and businesses to engage deeply with the digital environment. Its presale price of $0.0083 per token against a launch price of $0.25 shows the immense upscaling potential, guaranteeing early investors a 30x return upon launch. LivLive crypto AR rewards. Other Notable Presales BlockDAG and BlockchainFX are also making waves within the crypto community. BlockDAG, known for its scalability and mining efficiency, is a Layer-1 network that challenges existing blockchain paradigms. BlockchainFX merges DeFi with traditional financial assets, providing a versatile trading platform for diverse asset management. Conclusion As we look towards the future, it's clear that altcoins with lower initial valuations and strong community engagement, such as those offered through presales, represent a remarkable opportunity. With projects like $LIVE leading the way, early participants are set to experience substantial financial growth.

According to the agency, the searches were carried out as part of its ongoing Operation Chakra-V against cybercrime. According to the CBI, the searches bore fruit, revealing that they exposed a sophisticated and large-scale transnational cyber fraud running into hundreds of crores of rupees. The agency conducted several raids in a coordinated operation in seven locations across several cities, including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Delhi NCR. The CBI claimed that it recovered several pieces of evidence from the locations, noting that the evidence was mostly incriminating digital and financial records. CBI blows open large-scale fraud linked to HPZ scam The CBI mentioned that the case, which has been registered under criminal conspiracy and fraud offenses under the Information Technology Act, points to an elaborate criminal conspiracy carried out in the country by Indian nationals, who were acting in collusion and under orders from their foreign-based masterminds. Between 2021 and 2023, the group carried out organized crime under the guise of loans, job investment, and crypto schemes. These criminal activities were carried out through the creation of several shell companies, which were used to open mule bank accounts . Mule bank accounts, in this case, are accounts that just exist for the sole purpose of moving illegal funds. The criminals usually operate many mule accounts, using unsuspecting victims in some cases, which makes it easy for them to layer their transactions, burying investigators willing to trace their transaction footprints in digital paperwork. According to the CBI, most of the criminal proceeds from victims were routed through these accounts before they were converted into different digital assets and moved out of the country. Criminals prefer to use this route to move illegal funds because it is easier and largely untraceable. In some other cases, when these kinds of funds are sent overseas, authorities in India no longer have jurisdiction over them. Thus, the police will need to liaise with law enforcement in the countries where the criminals are located. Further investigations ongoing to find perpetrators The CBI claimed that in their investigations, they discovered that most of the shell companies were set up at the behest of foreign masterminds. The entities were also incorporated in India, with most of them onboarded on several fintech and payment aggregator platforms to collect and channel public funds. The funds were consolidated, converted to digital assets, and then moved into different wallets before being moved abroad. The CBI claimed that it was able to apprehend five accused for their active roles in executing the fraud. They are being presented before the competent court as per the due process of law. Further investigations are also still ongoing to trace the cross-border financial footprints, identify other individuals and entities involved in the crime, and unravel the full extent of the conspiracy. CBI claims it remains committed to combating cyber-related financial crimes through intelligence-led operations, inter-agency coordination, and the use of advanced digital forensics to counter complex transnational fraud networks. This is one of the many crypto-related criminal activities that were unraveled by authorities this week. According to a previous Cryptopolitan report , Indian authorities claimed they discovered an illegal platform that has processed about $96 million in illegal funds.

However, neither has long-term value, so traders are vulnerable to volatile changes in crypto prices and don’t have many ways to make steady returns. The alternative to DeFi that combines real-world usefulness with high short-term ROI potential is now being hailed by analysts and experienced investors. In contrast to meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a lending environment, stablecoin innovation, and predictable interest mechanics that make it a useful way to invest in crypto. Utility-driven lending and stable interest At the moment, Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale costs $0.035, and about 55% of the 170 million tokens have already been claimed, earning $16.8 million. The number of holders has grown to over 16,750, which shows that retailers are confident and that interest in the program is rising. In Phase 7, the price of a token will go up by 15%, to $0.040. This means that new buyers will have a smaller window of time to get in at a lower price and make money during the early presale. The idea behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual lending system that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for assets with high liquidity with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for tokens that aren’t as common. The Stable Interest Rate Model is one of the main advances. It lets borrowers lock in predictable costs for paying back their loans. This system protects people from sudden increases in interest rates on loans while encouraging steady lending and cash flow. The protocol also includes rates for Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE), which allows for higher borrowing limits for closely linked stable assets without sacrificing safety. Restricted Collateralization Mode adds an extra layer of security for dangerous or meme-like tokens by only letting the same asset be borrowed in small amounts. On the other hand, holders of DOGE and PEPE, which are very volatile, have no such protections and are fully subject to market swings. Clear reward structures, overcollateralization, and liquidation triggers keep liquidity high even during sudden downturns, which protects lenders and the protocol. A reserve factor takes a small amount of borrower interest as a safety net in case of defaults or extreme market events. Traders who want a structured way to invest in crypto are looking to MUTM because of these functional mechanics. Instead of depending on viral hype or speculative sentiment, the architecture of the protocol is made to deliver steady returns and growth. Roadmap, security, and ROI potential A carefully planned roadmap is helping Mutuum Finance (MUTM) move forward. In Phase 2, the main focus is on building the core smart contracts, the front-end and back-end systems, and adding more advanced features. In Phase 3, the beta testnet will be launched, working demos will be finished, and audits will be finalized in order to get ready for exchange listings. In Phase 4, the live platform will go live, multi-chain support will be added, and mtToken users will be able to stake rewards, and buyback methods will be turned on. Security credibility is reinforced by a CertiK audit, with Token and Skynet Scores of 90 and 79, respectively, alongside a $50,000 bug bounty program offering tiered rewards from $200 to $2,000. A $100,000 giveaway further enhances community participation and retail engagement, giving investors confidence in both the platform and its growth trajectory. Early investment case People who bought in during Phase 1 at $0.01 are already seeing a 3.5× paper gain at $0.035, and as the presale moves toward Phase 7 and the test launch that follows, it’s expected that there will be a 500% ROI in the short term. In contrast to DOGE and PEPE, where prices tend to stay the same, MUTM’s value goes up because the protocol is used, interest rates stay fixed, and demand is driven by liquidity. Pre-sale momentum, structured lending mechanisms, and the widespread use of stablecoins all work together to create a controlled growth environment that meets investors’ standards for safety and returns. Phase 6 is almost sold out, so getting in early is still very important. The upcoming price jump to $0.040 will make the chance for small buyers smaller, which makes it even more important to act now.

Notably, Bitcoin’s momentum is positive after breaking $120,000, showing a bullish short-term trend despite the U.S. government shutdown. At present, Bitcoin and the broader market outlook are likely to see further momentum, as the macroeconomic environment supports risk assets. For instance, a Federal Reserve rate cut expected later this month could boost investor appetite for cryptocurrencies . Institutional interest continues to grow, with ETFs and crypto funds adding upward pressure on the market. Bitcoin price prediction ​Based on these factors, ChatGPT projects that by October 31, Bitcoin could trade in a range of $128,000 to $136,000, with a base-case price of $132,000. A bullish scenario could push Bitcoin above $140,000 if momentum and ETF inflows accelerate, whereas a sharp correction or regulatory concerns could see it drop toward $120,000. The AI model also noted that key technical levels show support at $118,000 and $115,000, while resistance sits at $125,000 and $130,000, with the psychological barrier of $140,000 also in focus.

According to Martinez’s analysis on X on October 4, as long as Bitcoin maintains support above $117,650, the model points to a target near $139,800, a new record high. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1974406639357935849 Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $122,146, having gained 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Complementing this, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 67.57 remains in bullish territory, nearing but not yet overbought, suggesting room for continued upside before potential consolidation.

In the following lines, we will examine what happened and what every member of the community needs to know. Hack or Not? Earlier this week, one of Pi Network’s co-founders, Dr. Chengdiao Fan, announced that the project has deployed new decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pool features to its blockchains. The tools (initially available only on Testnet) allow Pioneers to experiment directly with token swaps and provide education about DeFi before participating on Mainnet and interacting with real PI tokens. The update stirred huge enthusiasm across the community, with many members flooding X to celebrate the news. One dubious account, which is not the official one behind the crypto project, also highlighted the key benefits of the development. Interestingly, Pi Network co-founder Nicolas Kokkalis forwarded the post, sparking speculation that hackers may have breached his X account. PI users are strongly advised to stay cautious and avoid falling for misleading updates or unverified announcements. To stay safe, they should rely exclusively on trusted sources of information, such as the official Pi Network account on X and other confirmed communication channels managed by the team. PI Price Outlook Despite the big Pi Network update and the substantial resurgence of the crypto market, Pi Network’s native token remains in red territory. It has plummeted by 25% on a monthly scale, currently trading at roughly $0.26 (per CoinGecko’s data). PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Many community members have started to lose hope that the asset can reclaim its peak levels witnessed at the start of 2025, whereas some important metrics suggest that the pullback might intensify in the short term. The amount of tokens stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise, which increases the selling pressure. On top of that, millions of coins are set to be unlocked over the next 30 days, giving investors an opportunity to cash out.

Its quick rise and huge gains caught the attention of investors all over the world. Analysts are now pointing out that purely speculative surges lack the structural support needed for long-term growth as they look back at past success. This has made people pay more attention to decentralized finance tokens that use new technology to do useful things. More and more investors and market watchers see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a great chance in this situation. It combines stability, liquidity, and governance-driven protocols to provide a new alternative to traditional crypto rallies. Stablecoin innovation and risk-controlled growth There is already a lot of pre-sale activity for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 6 is now live at $0.035, having earned about $16.8 million. More than 16,750 holders have taken part, and 55% of this phase has already been sold. In the next step, the price will go up by 15% to $0.040, so this is one of the last chances to get in at the presale price. Analysts say that this kind of structured presale growth, along with strong technical roots, makes it possible for both individuals and businesses to participate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that is meant to make lending and borrowing easier and more flexible. The project gives users many ways to manage their crypto assets, get liquidity, and make yield by combining Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with a Peer-to-Peer marketplace. The mtTokens, staking rewards, buy-and-distribute mechanics, and planned multi-chain expansion are all meant to give both short-term and long-term players in the DeFi sector stable growth possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is releasing a decentralized stablecoin that aims to keep its value at $1 at all times. This stablecoin is different from many others because it will only be created when people borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH or BTC. It will then be burned when loans are paid back or the assets are sold. To keep risk to a minimum, tight limits will be put on minting so that only approved issuers can do it. Mutuum’s government will change interest rates on the fly to keep the stablecoin fixed, and arbitrage opportunities will keep the market balanced on their own. Analysts say that this system’s level of safety and predictability is better than previous speculative rises like the one that happened with XRP in 2021. Investors are interested in the fact that loans, borrowing, and managing liquidity all take place in a controlled setting. This lowers systemic risk and allows for strong growth potential. Price discovery MUTMF’s second pillar is price discovery. The protocol is made to use Chainlink price feeds for USD and a number of native assets. It also has backup oracles to make sure that valuations don’t stop. Time-weighted average price calculations and other on-chain measures from decentralized exchanges will be used as an extra check to make sure that overcollateralized loans are correct. This integration makes sure that both lenders and borrowers can trust MUTM, which makes it one of the safest places to trade in crypto coins. Based on pool usage, borrowing interest rates will be established. When there is a lot of cash on hand, rates will stay low to urge people to borrow. When cash is scarce, on the other hand, rates will go up to encourage deposits and repayments. This adaptable model makes sure that capital is used efficiently, keeping the protocol safe from too much risk while giving users good returns and liquidity. Roadmap and security: building trust for investors The growth plan for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is organized into four main stages. In Phase 1, the pre-sale, marketing campaigns, giveaways, smart contract audit, and AI-powered support were all run. In Phase 2, the focus will be on building core smart contracts, the front end of the DApp, back-end infrastructure, advanced features, and risk management tools. In Phase 3, the platform will be finished with beta testing, a demo launch, getting ready for an exchange listing, and thorough security checks. Phase 4 will make the platform live, let people claim their MUTM tokens, set up relationships with institutions, add more chains, and improve features so that many people can use them. Each step is timed to coincide with important events that will support strong price action. This makes the timing of your presale participation very important. Security and credibility are central to MUTM’s strategy. The protocol has been audited by CertiK, achieving a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program with tiered rewards (Critical up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium up to $500, Low up to $200) incentivizes continuous testing and improvement. Additionally, the $100,000 ongoing giveaway rewards early participants, and a growing community of over 12,000 Twitter followers reinforces market trust. Phase 1 buyers have already seen strong theoretical gains. An initial $12,000 investment at $0.01, totaling 1.2 million MUTM, would be valued at $42,000 at the current $0.035 presale price. Analysts project that under Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s governance-driven model and upcoming exchange listings, the token could reach $0.45 in the medium term, representing a 45x return and outperforming XRP’s 2021 rally by over 700%. The presale is approaching a critical threshold. With 55% of Phase 6 already sold and the next phase at $0.040, missing this window will deny retail investors the chance to enter before institutional and whale activity begin driving demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines technical innovation, stablecoin-backed safety, and strong presale dynamics to position itself as the next must-watch token for investing in crypto.

The uncomfortable truth is that markets no longer run on just earnings reports and balance sheets; they run on stories, memes, and cultural ideas that gain momentum through social communities like X and Reddit and move faster than analysts can reliably keep track of. As much as we want to call GameStop a glitch, it’s only a preview of how markets now work. Crypto investors had an outsized role in driving this shift that spilled over into traditional markets. And now, retail investors have evolved from spectators to active market movers and makers, armed with platforms that let them coordinate, analyze, and act upon market intelligence at scale and unprecedented speed. While not every retail investor can outpace professional analysts, the most plugged-in communities have shown they can collectively move faster than institutions still operating by outdated playbooks. Look at Reddit’s WallStreetBets users, who drove the 2021 GameStop rally that led to massive losses for short sellers, citing that retail traders were the real force behind the market upheaval. Investors who have learned to read the cultural signals and narratives alongside financial ones will stay ahead. Markets Don’t Crash From Speculation A Wall Street secret is that markets don’t crash because of meme stocks — they crash because of stubborn loyalty to yesterday’s winners. The historic Dot-com Bubble didn’t burst because traders shifted their attention, but because both institutional and retail investors were in denial about industry over-valuation. Instead of recognizing the underlying stories that showed early signs of tech stocks’ crumbling prices, they chose to put their trust in past performance. Crashes happen when conviction in positions hardens into blind faith and unquestioning belief, and markets force a hard reset. Speculation keeps markets honest by forcing constant reevaluation. Retail investors do this daily by actively debating a stock or token’s prospects or deep diving into company fundamentals with fellow market participants. When they engage critically and stress-test every narrative in real time, they perform an invaluable and increasingly rare service as the active asset management industry shrinks in favor of passive investing strategies. The smartest retail investors ride a stock or token’s momentum but pivot as soon as the story changes. Their willingness to be wrong and adapt quickly helps prevent the kind of slow-moving institutional groupthink that leads to massive corrections, while still acknowledging that even retail communities can fall into faster, more volatile herd behavior. This mix of flexibility and collective attention makes them a uniquely influential force in today’s markets. Retail Runs the Show - and It’s About Time Retail stock trading is up to 20-35% of volume in the U.S. and UK alone, while crypto trade volume has also surged this past month exceeding a total market cap of $4T , but the change they’re forcing isn’t numbers — it’s intelligence. They’re networked, fast, and often spot trends before your dad’s broker does. Communities on platforms like Reddit and Discord can collectively analyze news, filings, and earnings calls, surfacing insights that sometimes catch institutional investors off guard. During the AMC rally, coordinated attention from retail communities amplified price swings and forced institutional adjustments. Today, AI-driven tools and educational platforms are making retail investors more capable and informed than ever, allowing them to process data and sentiment in real time. They might not always be right, but they’re influential enough to matter. Taking a page out of what crypto has been doing for years, some companies are starting to get it: CEOs now engage directly with retail communities, and IR departments track social sentiment. They understand the passion retail investors have for their stocks and are more willing to stick with them through poor performance than with an institution that’s judged on quarterly performance. Fighting Speculation is Fighting Reality It’s 2025 and talking heads are still warning about how the gambling mentality is ruining price discovery, pointing to meme stocks and crypto volatility as proof that retail has turned markets into a casino floor. They say that embracing speculation encourages poor decision-making, market instability, and over-exposure to risk. This way of thinking misses that prices have always been driven by collective beliefs about future values. Now that more people are able to participate, it’s just happening faster. Crypto is the ultimate example. Early critics called it pure speculation, divorced from the fundamentals of market movements, but it was actually just genuine price discovery happening at warp speed. The crypto market tested more ideas in a few years than traditional VCs could explore in a decade. While some ideas were garbage, the winners were massive. How Do You Win in the New Game? Don’t throw the fundamentals out the window just yet — success involves a hybrid approach of solid analysis and narrative awareness. More often than not, a great company with a boring story will underperform a decent company with a compelling narrative. Success means knowing narratives can change quickly and taking positions that capitalize on that. By diversifying based on assets and stories, risk management is more comprehensive. It allows investors to stay plugged into the communities and platforms where market-moving conversations are happening, while being willing to admit being too certain about any position means you may be setting yourself up for a painful lesson in market dynamics. However, it’s also about being able to distinguish between market volatility and noise, and recognizing the distinction between legitimate analysis and the misinformation that can spread rapidly in these communities. Adapt or Get Left Behind Retail is here to stay — the technology exists and the communities keep growing. By acknowledging this is the new normal and learning to navigate social intelligence and narrative-driven momentum, all investors like will thrive. The future belongs to those who are flexible and can expand their toolkits beyond earnings reports and balance sheets to a world where information flows instantly and communities coordinate buying and selling in real time. Speculation lets investors read both the fundamentals and social sentiment to spot undervalued assets and emerging narratives before the crowds catch on.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a major alternative by providing a working DeFi ecosystem that is made to appeal to both individual and institutional investors. Market watchers are hopeful about the token’s pre-sale progress, structured roadmap, and Layer-2 infrastructure. They are keeping a close eye on crypto fear and greed index readings and ETF inflows for signs of systemic interest. Practical utility and Layer-2 advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 presale at $0.035, with over 55% of the 170 million allocation sold. Approximately $16.8 million has been raised, and the community now counts more than 16,750 holders. The next presale phase will increase the price by 15% to $0.040, creating an immediate incentive for early adopters to secure positions before broader market demand pushes valuations higher. The development team has announced that the V1 lending and borrowing protocol will deploy on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, initially supporting assets such as ETH and USDT. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a fully functional DeFi platform when it goes public, unlike ADA, whose growth has been slowed by late feature rollouts. People will be able to lend, borrow, and stake mtTokens right on the site after the beta launch. Conservative and treasury-level investors will be drawn to stable interest rates and known borrowing costs, which will keep the protocol busy. Better Collateral Efficiency will help put money to better use, which will increase liquidity and TVL without adding to systemic risk. Layer-2 scalability makes sure that MUTM can handle more transactions more quickly and for less money than many Layer-1 rivals. Because it works so well, DeFi no longer has any problems that slow it down. This makes the token a good choice for busy traders and long-term investors. With the addition of a stablecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will create a second demand vector that will grow on its own. This is because users will need the token to borrow, lend, and put up security. Roadmap execution and exchange visibility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making progress toward important roadmap goals that make investors feel better about the company. The Sepolia Testnet V1 will have a cash pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot, so people can get a feel for how the platform works in a real-world setting. Listings on Tier-1 exchanges, like Binance and Coinbase, will make it easier for people to get funding and raise their profile around the world. Community tools like the ROI dashboard and Top 50 leaderboard will reward active players, which will lead to long-term participation and staking. Analysts are increasingly predicting that MUTM will go on a steep path. In contrast to ADA, which has slower adoption cycles and limited instant use, MUTM’s presale traction, Layer-2 integration, and stablecoin ecosystem create multiple demand drivers at the same time. The crypto fear and greed index shows that people are becoming more optimistic, and crypto ETFs continue to highlight projects with institutional-grade infrastructure. This means that MUTM is ready to take advantage of both market momentum and strategic allocations. The math behind early investments makes the chance even more appealing. With a $1,000 investment at $0.035, you can get 28,600 tokens. If MUTM hits the $3 mark by the second quarter of 2026, that investment will have grown to $85,700, which is an 85x gain. Early participants have an incredibly good chance to get in because of the presale price, strong DeFi mechanics, and Layer-2 scalability. More than 55% of Phase 6 has already been sold, and Phase 7 will raise the price by 15% to $0.040 within hours. This makes it even more important to place yourself in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM is becoming more and more popular as an alternative to ADA among traders and investors who want to make money and get exposure to useful things at the same time. It has instant platform utility, strong adoption prospects, and measurable revenue-driven demand. Early entry makes sure that everyone can take part before the market as a whole realizes the full potential. This gives everyone a chance to see the token’s expected $3 valuation and beyond.

The Tokyo Growth Market-listed company announced plans to integrate a Solana (SOL)-based treasury strategy to strengthen its financial position and sustain its listing amid evolving stock exchange standards. This move mirrors earlier initiatives by Metaplanet in Japan and several U.S. firms adopting Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet strategy. Solana Treasury Plan and Fundraising Goals According to Coindesk Japan data, Mobcast said its Solana Treasury Business will support long-term growth while enhancing shareholder value. The company aims to raise approximately 1.4 billion yen through the issuance of new stock acquisition rights and corporate bonds. Proceeds will be allocated to reinforce its treasury and business operations. The primary recipients of the shares are EVO FUND and Mobcast CEO Takaki Yabu. Founded in 2004, Mobcast’s strategy marks a major shift toward blockchain integration. The firm plans to align its new Solana initiative with its Social Entertainment and Media segment, creating a “virtuous cycle” between technology adoption and corporate expansion. Consequently, Mobcast joins the emerging class of Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) firms leveraging crypto holdings to boost liquidity, market visibility, and shareholder confidence. Solana Price Outlook Remains Bullish Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has maintained a steady uptrend despite minor intraday corrections. The token traded around $228 , marking a 1.14% daily drop but a 13.71% weekly gain, with a market cap of $124.8 billion. Market analysts suggest that a sustained rally could emerge if the token closes the week above the key $260 resistance. According to analyst Ali Martinez, a decisive breakout beyond this level may trigger an extended move toward $520, aligning with Fibonacci extension projections. Martinez noted that maintaining support above $200 will be essential to preserve the bullish structure. This trend reflects growing institutional interest in Solana’s network strength and scalability upgrades. Source: X Long-Term Projections Suggest Exponential Growth Analyst curb.sol identifies a broader “cup and handle” pattern forming on Solana’s multi-year chart. The formation, which began after its 2021 peak, suggests a potential long-term breakout if the price exceeds $260–$300.

Belo Horizonte becomes Brazil’s official ‘Capital of Bitcoin’ Belo Horizonte’s mayor has formally signed Municipal Act No. 11,905, proclaiming the city as Brazil’s “Capital of Bitcoin.” The project, led by Councillor Vile Santos (PL) and approved by Mayor Álvaro Damião (União Brasil), seeks to establish Belo Horizonte as a national hub for cryptocurrency innovation, financial education, and blockchain entrepreneurship. The bill, which was approved in record time by the City Council and has broad political support, is a strategic move to attract investment, enhance the local economy, and stimulate digital asset creation. Annual events to commemorate the city’s new title will be added to the official calendar, promoting tourism and new economic prospects in the burgeoning cryptocurrency ecosystem. Beyond symbolic recognition, the law outlines practical steps for creating a viable crypto economy. It mandates the development of research programs, instructional workshops, and training efforts for entrepreneurs, students, and the general public in order to increase financial literacy and knowledge of blockchain technologies. Local technology enterprises and startups are likely to gain from a more conducive climate for innovation and investment. Experts emphasise that education will be critical in ensuring that the benefits reach all social sectors, setting the basis for long-term inclusion and skilled employment growth. With this forward-thinking strategy, Belo Horizonte presents itself not just as a Brazilian leader but also as a global model for how digital finance and public policy may work together to form the future economy. DL Holdings expands Bitcoin mining power with $40 million investment DL Holdings has signed two legally binding letters of intent with BITMAIN to purchase 2,995 Antminer S21 water-cooled mining equipment financed by Antalpha. Combined with an earlier acquisition of 2,200 mining units, the company’s total investment now surpasses 320 million HKD (about USD 40 million), resulting in an overall computing capacity of approximately 2,100,000 TH/s. The new technology will be installed at locations in Oman and Paraguay, with BITMAIN providing complete operational and maintenance support. According to Andy Chen, Chairman of DL Holdings, this large-scale investment demonstrates trust in Hong Kong’s virtual asset rules and the long-term potential of decentralised finance. DL Holdings’ most recent action represents a significant shift in strategy—from traditional asset allocation to direct investment in Bitcoin mining infrastructure. Rather than buying Bitcoin on the secondary market, the company is developing its own hashrate capability to generate cash from industrial-scale mining operations. This method seeks to empower investors by providing direct access to the fundamental layer of digital finance, while also encouraging diversity and transparency in the mining industry. As Chen stated, DL Holdings is transitioning “from buying gold to operating a gold mine,” creating a corporate environment centred on Bitcoin production, technological innovation, and long-term cash flow generation. Bitget featured in the Animoca Brands report as a model for the next phase of exchanges Bitget, the world’s largest Universal Exchange (UEX), has been highlighted in Animoca Brands’ most recent research, “Exchanges’ Next Phase: Reaching the Mainstream.” The research investigates how exchanges are growing as the primary gateways to the on-chain economy, using Bitget’s UEX concept as a notable example of this metamorphosis. It observes that centralised exchanges, which were previously focused primarily on cryptocurrency trading, are now diversifying into sectors such as tokenised assets, payments, and real-world financial integration. According to a press release sent to Invezz, Bitget’s positioning is highlighted as an excellent example of how exchanges may bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralised economy, altering the user experience for both retail and institutional investors. Bitget’s UEX strategy is already evident in its varied product portfolio, which includes AI-powered trading via GetAgent, Onchain integration for early-stage token access, and stock futures trading, illustrating the growing desire for hybrid exchange models. CEO Gracy Chen noted that exchanges must now serve as bridges between centralised and decentralised ecosystems, providing customers with seamless access to all layers of digital banking. Ming Ruan, Head of Research at Animoca Brands, shared this view, characterising exchanges like Bitget as emerging into “cultural and financial gateways” that connect gaming, payments, identities, and tokenised assets. As Bitget expands globally, supporting over 120 million users in 150+ countries, its UEX framework establishes a new standard for how exchanges should function as universal, interconnected platforms that enable the future of on-chain participation.

Transformational technologies are often integrated gradually, hidden beneath layers of institutional partnerships, regulatory progress, and infrastructure development. For XRP, that quiet integration is already underway, positioning the digital asset not as a speculative token but as a tool with a defined role in the future of money movement. Crypto analyst Versan Aljarrah has emphasized that “everything seen around Ripple and XRP is soft disclosure of what’s already built.” His statement highlights that XRP is already being integrated into financial systems, not just a concept waiting to be developed. According to Aljarrah, XRP has a specific time and place within the global financial system, designed for liquidity, settlement, and interoperability. XRP’s Role in Liquidity and Settlement Ripple’s flagship solution, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), highlights XRP’s ability to bridge currencies in cross-border transactions without the need for pre-funded accounts. By deploying XRP as a settlement asset, banks and payment providers can free up capital and reduce friction in global money transfers. Everything you see around @Ripple and #XRP is soft disclosure of what’s already built. XRP has a specific time and place in the financial system, designed to enable liquidity, settlement, and interoperability. It’s all about making the system flow. pic.twitter.com/bxkpAZV6Yb — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 3, 2025 This use case is more than theory; it has been tested and implemented in corridors where efficiency gains are measurable and repeatable. Infrastructure Already in Motion The quiet rollout of complementary infrastructure reinforces XRP’s long-term position. Ripple’s launch of its enterprise stablecoin RLUSD in December 2024 expanded liquidity options for institutions, while ongoing integrations with fiat rails and custody providers are strengthening the ecosystem’s practical usability. These developments are concrete steps to integrate XRP into existing financial systems, not just speculative promises. Real-World Adoption and Partnerships Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions demonstrate how XRP is being tested in production environments. From remittance providers to banks piloting cross-border corridors, the technology is proving that settlement with XRP can be faster and cheaper than traditional alternatives. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These case studies demonstrate that XRP is designed to improve banking efficiency, not replace banks, by serving as a neutral bridge asset that eliminates liquidity bottlenecks. Interoperability, Regulation, and the Road Ahead For XRP to fully realize its potential, it must operate seamlessly with legacy systems while navigating regulatory landscapes. Ripple has invested heavily in interoperability through acquisitions and partnerships, particularly in custody, prime brokerage, and settlement services. As regulatory frameworks take shape worldwide, institutions are gaining the clarity they need to adopt with confidence. This dual track—technical integration and regulatory alignment—defines XRP’s pathway to broader utility. In summary, Versan Aljarrah’s view highlights XRP’s current status: its role in the financial system is being shaped by practical adoption, regulatory advancements, and infrastructure development. The narrative has shifted from speculation to implementation, with XRP quietly anchoring itself as a solution for liquidity, settlement, and interoperability. What remains is not invention but recognition—acknowledging that much of the groundwork is already laid for XRP to serve as a core component of tomorrow’s financial architecture.

The debate concerns whether the UK should retain the 61,000 BTC seized in 2018 as a strategic reserve or realise it under the Proceeds of Crime Act to compensate victims and support public finances. Policymakers weigh legal obligations, fiscal risk, and market impact. How does UK law (POCA) affect the fate of seized BTC? POCA prioritises recovery of criminal proceeds and restitution for victims. Seized BTC therefore faces legal scrutiny in civil recovery proceedings to determine how many coins must be returned to identified victims. Officials and legal advisers interpret POCA as limiting long-term government holding for investment; disposal consistent with victim recovery is the primary aim. Why do some industry groups support holding a crypto reserve? CryptoUK and other industry representatives argue that an immediate sale could signal instability and harm the UK’s competitive position in crypto markets. They point to growing global interest in strategic crypto reserves and public company allocations as precedents. What are the practical options for government action? Options range from full realisation for restitution and treasury receipts to phased, transparent disposal to limit market disruption. A third option is commissioning evidence-based pilots and research into measured reserve allocations (e.g., 0.1%–0.5% of assets) before any policy shift. Who are the experts and what do they say? Professor Naseem Naqvi MBE, President of the British Blockchain Association, emphasises POCA’s victim-focused objective and warns that long-term holding would conflict with established Treasury and Bank of England reserve management principles. A CryptoUK spokesperson urged a long-term view, noting symbolic benefits of holding, but also calling for careful policy consideration and transparent rationale for any strategy that departs from current practice. Frequently Asked Questions How much is 61,000 BTC worth today? Bitcoin’s market value fluctuates; multiply the current BTC price by 61,000 for a real-time valuation. Historical context: some estimates have valued the seizure near $7 billion at various price points. Can the government set up a Bitcoin reserve without changing law? Not easily. POCA and Treasury reserve policies constrain using confiscated assets as de facto reserves. A formal reserve policy for crypto would likely require policy reviews and potentially legislative or procedural changes. Key Takeaways Legal constraint : POCA prioritises restitution and recovery over investment. Market risk : Rapid disposal risks price disruption; phased sales reduce impact. Policy path : Research, pilots, and international dialogue offer a prudent route to any future reserve consideration. Conclusion The 61,000 BTC seizure presents a policy crossroads: honour POCA’s victim-focused mandate while exploring evidence-based approaches to crypto in reserves. COINOTAG recommends transparent disposal options, targeted research, and pilot programmes to balance legal duties, fiscal needs, and market stability.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-04 13:09:40

Year‑to‑date growth near 47% and large USDC mint events show rising velocity and institutional use. stablecoin supply hits $300B — learn what it means for crypto markets and next steps. Read our analysis and outlook. What does a $300 billion stablecoin supply mean for crypto markets? The $300 billion stablecoin supply indicates substantial dollar-equivalent liquidity onchain that can quickly rotate into digital assets or be used for payments and settlements. This level of supply suggests both rising adoption and increased transaction velocity, which may support asset price rallies and deeper financial integration. How is this stablecoin supply growing and where is the liquidity moving? Stablecoin supply has expanded roughly 46.8% year‑to‑date, driven by minting events and broader adoption. For example, large USDC minting on Solana and sustained monthly transfer volumes point to active capital flows across networks. Analysts report high transaction velocity and frequent use in trades and settlements. Source: DeFiLlama.com How are stablecoins being used beyond trading? Stablecoins now serve multiple roles: settlement rails for exchanges, payment rails for merchants, remittance corridors in dollar‑short economies, and dollar access where banking services are limited. Industry practitioners note stablecoins are increasingly integrated into payment systems and institutional flows. Expert perspectives: Andrei Grachev, founding partner at Falcon Finance, says stablecoins are “moving through markets with purpose” and show transfer volumes in the trillions monthly. Ricardo Santos, CTO at Mansa Finance, points to adoption in markets like Nigeria, Turkey and Argentina where dollar‑pegged tokens act as de facto dollars. Source: Lookonchain Blockchain data shows notable minting and issuance events—for instance, multi‑billion USDC minting on Solana in recent weeks. These events, combined with stablecoin integration into payment infrastructure, reinforce the view that the supply is active capital rather than idle reserves. When could this liquidity affect Bitcoin or altcoin prices? Liquidity impact depends on rotation speed and destination. If a meaningful portion of new stablecoin supply converts to Bitcoin or Ethereum during bullish phases, it can amplify rallies. Historically, months with strong inflows and ETF developments have coincided with price momentum, but timing remains data‑dependent. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the $300 billion stablecoin supply simply cash on the sidelines?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. Analysts report high transfer volumes and velocity metrics indicating stablecoins are actively used for trading, settlements and payments rather than sitting idle."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will stablecoin growth cause an immediate crypto bull market?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Not necessarily immediate.

Stablecoin supply has increased by roughly 46.8% year‑to‑date, reaching a record above $300 billion. Growth is driven by minting events, broader adoption and increased use cases such as payments and settlements. What role do stablecoins play in institutional flows? Institutions use stablecoins for rapid settlement, cross‑border transfers and liquidity management. Integration into existing payment rails and custody solutions has expanded institutional access to dollar‑equivalent onchain liquidity. Key Takeaways Fresh on‑chain liquidity : $300B stablecoin supply signals substantial dollar‑equivalent liquidity available for markets. Active usage : High transfer volumes and minting events show stablecoins are circulating in trading, payments and settlements. Market impact potential : If rotated into crypto assets, this liquidity can fuel price moves; monitoring velocity and destination is key. Conclusion The record $300 billion stablecoin supply highlights growing integration between digital assets and global finance and reflects both increased adoption and active usage.

Strong year‑to‑date performance (around 34.3% growth) and limited downside relative to peers emphasize stability rooted in usage metrics and protocol positioning. How volatile has XPL been and what caused the swings? XPL experienced extreme valuation swings in 2025, falling from roughly $18 billion to $3 billion before rebounding to a mid‑year high near $16 billion and settling near $9.4 billion FDV.

TRX’s steady growth and dominance with a $32.4B FDV underscore its resilience and investor confidence despite market volatility. XPL’s sharp swings highlight the risks of speculative hype as its FDV plunged from $18B to $3B before rebounding to $16B. ENA’s partial recovery and ETHFI’s weak momentum reveal how execution and strategy, not hype, define long-term DeFi strength. The DeFi market is witnessing sharp contrasts in valuation trends, sparking investor debate on sustainability and execution. On October 2, 2025, data from CoinGecko revealed that TRX remains the dominant force with a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of $32.4 billion. Meanwhile, XPL, once hailed as a proxy to Tether, finds itself caught in a challenging position as investors reassess its long-term value. According to analyst Sam on X, “$XPL is caught in a tricky spot. Investors were eager to treat Plasma as a proxy to Tether, but at a $10 billion valuation, the market appears to be overpricing its ability to monetize that alignment.” Sam further stressed that Plasma’s success depends on its neobank strategy, not just chain fees or Tether proximity. Source: Sam TRX demonstrated notable stability throughout 2025. It fluctuated between roughly $20 billion and $35 billion, peaking near $35 billion between January and August. Modest corrections emerged from August onwards, but TRX retained strength above $30 billion, reflecting steady demand and network usage. Consequently, TRX maintained a lead in the DeFi sector with a 34.3% year‑to‑date increase, separating it from more speculative rivals focused on narrative over execution. Why did XPL and ENA struggle to maintain valuations? XPL’s volatility stemmed from rapid changes in market expectations and unclear monetization paths. The token’s FDV collapsed to $3 billion before rebounding; as of early October it traded at about $9.4 billion FDV after a short spike to $16 billion. Market participants shifted from narrative‑driven valuation to revenue and product milestones. ENA showed a softer but similar trajectory: starting near $12 billion, falling to $3–4 billion, recovering to $10 billion, and stabilizing near $8.7 billion. ENA’s negative performance of roughly 36.2% in 2025 highlights execution challenges despite late‑year recoveries. ETHFI remains the smallest protocol of those covered, with valuations below $2 billion—standing at about $1.4 billion and reflecting a 34.2% yearly decline. These contrasts underscore that long‑term DeFi strength depends on product delivery and sustainable monetization. Frequently Asked Questions How can investors separate hype from sustainable DeFi projects? Focus on on‑chain metrics, clear monetization plans, roadmap progress, and third‑party audits. Prioritize projects delivering predictable revenue or demonstrable product adoption over speculative narratives. Is FDV a reliable single metric to value a protocol? FDV is useful for market perspective but must be combined with TVL, active users, fee revenue, and tokenomics to form a comprehensive valuation view. Key Takeaways TRX strength : Consistent FDV and YTD gains point to resilience rooted in usage metrics. XPL risk : Sharp FDV swings highlight speculative exposure tied to narrative shifts. Execution matters : ENA and ETHFI show recovery and decline patterns that reward operational execution and revenue clarity. Conclusion TRX’s robust FDV and relative stability through 2025 emphasize the value of execution and on‑chain fundamentals in DeFi. XPL and ENA illustrate how quickly valuations can reprice when monetization and strategy lag. Investors should prioritize demonstrable adoption, revenue models, and transparent milestones when evaluating DeFi projects.

According to CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium Gap — which tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and global exchanges, such as Binance — has surged to +86.4. A positive premium means Bitcoin is selling at a higher price on Coinbase, a platform that attracts institutional and regulated investors. This usually means stronger US demand as funds and asset managers step in to buy. In simpler terms, big buyers are willing to pay more to get in, indicating they are more confident in Bitcoin’s long-term. Bitcoin: Coinbase Premium Gap – Source: Cryptoquant Historically, these Coinbase Premium spikes have preceded big rallies. Institutional flows tend to dry up across exchanges, setting up price breaks. This time, the data aligns with Bitcoin consolidating above $120,000, indicating that institutional investors are entering the market early for potential new highs. The Coinbase Premium Gap is +86.4, indicating stronger US dollar buying. Bitcoin is trading above $ 120,000 after breaking a key resistance level. Institutional flows align with the “Uptober” momentum that historically accompanies 4th-quarter rallies. Bitcoin Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction remains in a strong uptrend. The asset recently broke above resistance at $119,500 and continues to hold well above both its 50-period and 100-period simple moving averages (SMAs) at $115,013 and $114,523, respectively. These crossovers signal a continuation of bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, the chart also reveals the formation of a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern, a setup that often signals exhaustion near the top of a rally. If Bitcoin continues upward, the following resistance levels stand at $124,600 and the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. As price approaches this region, overbought conditions, reflected by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 73, could trigger short-term profit-taking. Candle action is cautious with smaller candles and long upper wicks showing hesitation at higher levels. A dip below $121,140 could retest $118,500, and stronger selling could take us down to $115,000. Market Outlook: Institutional Flows Drive Confidence Despite potential short-term corrections, the broader sentiment remains positive. Institutional buying, rising ETF volumes, and improving macro liquidity continue to support Bitcoin’s long-term case. The premium on Coinbase — often viewed as a leading indicator — reinforces the idea that professional investors are quietly accumulating ahead of the next major leg higher. If Bitcoin holds above $120,000 and institutional demand persists, we could be setting up for a test of the $128,000-$130,000 zone by year-end. A break above that would open the door to a new all-time high (ATH) and potentially another institutional milestone.

Notably, bullish sentiments around the crypto market leader are presently strong as analysts speculate that another accumulation phase may have commenced. On-chain analytics page, Swissblock has now provided an in-depth analysis of the present market situation, with insights on potential drivers for profits or losses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Levels, Predictions Point To $140,000 By Early 2026 BTC Dip To $108,600 A Constructive Reset Earlier this month, Bitcoin registered a sharp decline from $117,000 to $108,600, sparking fears of a deeper correction. Although the market has since recovered, Swissblock explains that several on-chain indicators show the move was less a collapse and more a constructive reset. The notion of a “reset, not capitulation” is key as resets allow markets to flush out excess leverage, absorb weak-handed sellers, and create room for fresh demand. Swissblocks explains that this is exactly what occurred in the $114,000–$118,000 range, where many late buyers from August had been looking for an exit. Their supply was absorbed, clearing a cluster of resistance and unlocking the path to retest all-time highs. Notably, this price drop also highlighted the resilience of Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) base. Glassnode data shows the STH cost basis, or the average purchase price for recent buyers, sits at roughly $111,600. This level has now been defended five separate times since May, making it an important pivot point in the present market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $119,000: Analyst Says $139,000 Could Be Next Long-Term Behavior Encourages Bullish Shift But Downside Risks Remain At the same time, Swissblock notes that long-term holders (LTHs) have noticeably slowed their rate of distribution. While they continue to sell, the pace is far less intense than in previous months. This cooling of supply pressure allows new participants to accumulate with less resistance. Historically, such phases have marked the transition from distribution to accumulation, creating structural stability and setting up bullish continuation. However, downside risks remain in that a resurgence of heavy selling could tip the balance and reintroduce fragility. However, as long as Bitcoin avoids slipping into a high-risk regime, the outlook favors resilience and upside potential. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $122,052, reflecting a slight 1.47% gain in the last 24 hours. Daily trading activity has also surged by 19.28%, reinforcing the strength and momentum behind the ongoing market rally. With a market cap of $2.43 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the world’s largest cryptocurrency and fifth-largest asset.

Each of these products will be reviewed under a simplified approval procedure, similar to their previous successful filings. The upcoming ETFs will cover a wide range of digital assets: from AAVE to UNI and XLM, and will invest directly in the underlying cryptocurrencies, classifying them as spot ETFs. Fast-Track Approval Through Simplified SEC Process According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffarth, the new ETFs are being structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows for streamlined SEC processing. This mechanism has already been used successfully for prior spot ETFs based on Solana (SOL) and XRP. By using this legal framework, the companies can significantly shorten review times, even with the SEC’s new spot ETF regulations introduced in mid-September 2025. “Any crypto ETF you can possibly imagine will be filed w/ SEC over next several months. You all have no idea what’s coming,” said Nate Geraci, ETF analyst and president of NovaDius Wealth Management. Meanwhile, market experts note that ETF competition is heating up fast, with dozens of similar applications now pending — including several hybrid ETF models that combine crypto with traditional financial instruments. Analysts See Near-Guaranteed ETF Approvals Earlier, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas suggested that under the SEC’s updated rules, the approval probability for spot crypto ETFs is now close to 100%. If approved, these new funds could mark a major turning point for altcoin exposure in traditional finance — potentially triggering a broader wave of institutional investment across the crypto market.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-04 13:31:08

The brokerage began offering trading in four Strategy (MSTR) preferred stocks on Oct. 2, with tickers STRC, STRD, STRF, and STRK now available on the platform. The next day, CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed the move on X, saying Robinhood had “heard from many Strategy investors that this was an important factor before moving their accounts.” Robinhood’s rare policy shift That detail matters because Robinhood’s own website still states that it does not currently support preferred stocks , grouping them with foreign equities and mutual funds under “unsupported assets.” The inclusion of Strategy’s securities is therefore a rare policy shift, suggesting unusual demand from retail investors seeking exposure to the company’s bitcoin-linked products. Inside Strategy’s preferred stock program Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has developed a suite of four preferred stocks —STRC, STRD, STRF, and STRK — as an alternative way to raise capital for its bitcoin acquisition strategy. These instruments function like digital credit products, giving the company fresh funding without directly diluting holders of its common equity (MSTR). Each class offers a different blend of yield, seniority and conversion terms: STRC serves as the flagship, perpetual preferred stock, paying a floating yield linked to U.S. Treasury rates. STRD features a fixed-rate coupon and shorter maturity, appealing to more conservative investors. STRF provides flexible redemption rights for institutional holders. STRK is the riskiest, higher-yield tranche, designed for investors seeking maximum exposure to Strategy’s bitcoin strategy. For investors, this structure is important because it enables Strategy to aggressively expand its bitcoin holdings while limiting equity dilution for existing MSTR shareholders. It also creates yield-bearing securities tied indirectly to the company’s bitcoin playbook — something traditional yield-bearing stablecoins have struggled to achieve under U.S. regulation. What does it mean for bitcoin On X, Stony Chambers, a Seeking Alpha analyst, called $STRC “the iPhone moment” for crypto-linked securities — arguing that its debut as Robinhood’s first-ever preferred listing shows “real product-market fit.” Chambers speculated that future catalysts such as ratings coverage, tokenization, or even stablecoin allocation could trigger “vertical jumps” in demand for STRC. While his projections are highly speculative, his comments underscore how the new listings could expand retail participation in Strategy’s ecosystem. Ultimately, the change gives Saylor’s firm a potentially powerful new funding avenue — and for bitcoin, another indirect demand driver as one of its largest corporate holders gains easier retail access to capital.",Markets|Robinhood|Strategy|MSTR|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|STRK|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 13:32:05

The project developers argued that the tokens sold were locked assets from the WLFI treasury and did not represent new issuance or dilution. Related News: Will the Rally Continue After Bitcoin's Recent Surge? Expert Comments The WLFI team stated, “WLFI recently conducted a token sale for Hut8’s treasury at $0.25. This transaction was solely for the purpose of completing a specific sale; it does not constitute new issuance or an increase in supply. We appreciate Hut8’s long-term support.” Meanwhile, WLFI co-founder Donald Trump Jr. dismissed criticism that the crypto venture linked to his family could create a conflict of interest. Speaking to CNBC at the Token2049 conference in Singapore, Trump Jr. said, “The claims that World Liberty Financial investors are seeking favors from the Trump administration are complete nonsense.

According to data from Reuters, the STOXX 600 closed 0.5% higher, notching a record for the third consecutive session. Across the week, the index gained 2.8%, cementing its place at the top of the global rally while hitting intraday highs along the way. The biggest surge came from healthcare names. The sector climbed 1.3% on the day, as AstraZeneca jumped 1.6% and Novo Nordisk advanced 2.1%. The momentum followed a U.S. Pfizer pricing deal that gave the industry breathing room from tariff and cost worries Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management told clients: “While the Pfizer deal is not an outright ‘all clear’ signal for the sector, with key details lacking on the tariffs, a boost in near-term sentiment and robust long-term drivers should support a positive outlook.” That line perfectly captures why healthcare shares outpaced every other sector across Europe this week. Healthcare and banks push European markets higher Banks were not left out of the rally. The sector added 1%, with Raiffeisen Bank standing out after surging 7.4%. The rally came as the Financial Times reported the European Union is weighing the removal of sanctions on assets tied to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska in an effort to compensate the Austrian lender. ABN Amro also moved sharply, climbing 2.7% after Goldman Sachs reversed its stance on the Dutch bank, upgrading it to a “buy” rating from “sell.” Mining companies joined the advance. The Basic Resources index, home to Europe’s leading mining stocks, rose 1.7% as prices for base metals pushed higher. These gains helped narrow the performance gap between Europe and the United States, with the STOXX 600 now up 12.4% for the year compared with a 14.7% rise in the U.S. S&P 500. Markets focus on Fed as U.S. shutdown delays jobs data The picture in Washington added more uncertainty. The U.S. government shutdown delayed the release of a key jobs report that had been expected on Friday. That report is vital for the Federal Reserve, which is tracking labor market trends to guide its next monetary decision. Even with the delay, investors leaned into the expectation that the Fed will deliver another rate cut. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said, “It does very much feel that the market is looking past the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and focusing on Fed rate cut expectations.” Traders backed that view. The CME FedWatch Tool showed market bets pricing in an almost certain cut before the end of the month, a shift that followed a weaker-than-expected private payrolls report earlier in the week. Optimism over looser U.S. policy combined with Europe’s healthcare rally sent the STOXX 600 surging to new records. Economic data across the continent painted a mixed picture. Growth in the euro zone services sector accelerated to an eight-month high in September, with Germany’s services sector also recording its fastest expansion in eight months. But France’s services industry contracted more sharply than first thought, and in Britain, business activity grew at its slowest pace in five months. Among individual movers, Sofina dropped by 3.2%, one of the weakest showings on the STOXX 600. The investment company’s decline came after it announced a 545-million-euro ($639.67 million) rights issue, leaving the stock near the bottom of the index.

Bitcoin (BTC) has traditionally been a store of value and a measure of where the cryptocurrency’s prices are going. However, insiders and regular traders are becoming more interested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized finance protocol that blends a smart lending platform with long-term tokenomics. Bitcoin’s value goes up and down depending on how many people use it and how fast the market grows overall. MUTM, on the other hand, is meant to be useful all the time through its dual loan model and stablecoin innovation, giving investors many ways to make money. BTC road to 120K? Bitcoin (BTC) has broken above $116,000, sparking renewed optimism that $120,000 could be in its sights if momentum holds. This upside push is being underpinned by fresh ETF inflows, strong accumulation from institutional buyers, and a favorable technical setup expanding out of a bull-flag pattern. If BTC can hold above $116K and clear near resistance zones around $117,500, the path toward $119–$120K becomes much more viable. That said, the market still faces key risk levels below $114,800–$115,200, which must hold to prevent a fallback. Lending mechanics and stability drive investor confidence At $0.035, Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has begun, and about 55% of the 170 million tokens have already been claimed. Over $16.8 million has been raised, and more than 16,750 users are getting ready for Phase 7, which will see the price rise by 15% to $0.040. This pre-sale momentum shows that the market is very confident, and it gives buyers a chance to get in on a project that will be useful and have huge growth potential. The next-generation DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is based on two loan models that work well together: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Participants in P2C pools can put up large amounts of money, like ETH or USDT, and earn interest through mtTokens that represent their share of the pool. P2P lending is for goods that are hard to sell or have a high risk of default. It allows for direct negotiations with limited risk. Mutuum’s Stable Interest Rate Model helps both methods work better. Borrowers who choose steady rates get the benefit of knowing what to expect. To balance out the risk of rate changes, an initial rate is locked at borrowing, which is higher than the current flexible rate. If there are big changes in the market, the system will rebalance the rate to keep things fair and stable for liquidity. This method not only keeps lenders and the protocol’s reserves safe, but it also gets more people to borrow money because they know rates will be stable. Every loan has too much security, which makes sure there is a strong safety net against changes in the market. If the value of the collateral falls below the liquidation level, some of the assets can be sold. Bonuses are given to liquidators who buy discounted collateral and pay off outstanding debt. This keeps total liquidity high. Reserve factors take in a small amount of the borrower’s interest, adding another layer of safety against extreme volatility or defaults. The platform also has limits on how much you can deposit and borrow, limited collateralization modes, and enhanced collateral efficiency. These are all meant to make the best use of capital without putting the protocol at too much risk. Through Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE), high-quality, stable assets can borrow more, while unpredictable or illiquid tokens are carefully limited to keep systemic problems from happening. Roadmap, security, and ROI signals Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap outlines a clear path to utility and adoption. Phase 2 focuses on building the core smart contracts, DApp front-end, and back-end infrastructure while introducing advanced analytics and risk parameters. Phase 3 will see beta testing on testnet, functional demo launches, final audits, and preparations for exchange listings. Phase 4 is aimed at delivering the live platform, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and the official activation of MUTM claims. Security credibility further strengthens investor confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has received a CertiK audit with a 90 Token Score and 79 Skynet Score. Its $50,000 bug bounty program offers rewards by severity: Critical up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium up to $500, and Low up to $200. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway and an AI-powered helpdesk support community engagement. Investors who bought MUTM in Phase 1 at $0.01 are already seeing a 3.5× value return at $0.035, and a 6× paper gain is expected at the $0.06 listing. In the medium term, analysts and insiders expect returns of up to 25%. This will happen because of loan income, the use of stablecoins, and platform integrations. MUTM’s utility-driven model sets it up for better growth than BTC’s, which has a more conservative upside compared to its price. This means that both early investors and regular users can make multiples that BTC can’t match in the same time frame. As Phase 6 gets close to being sold out, the next presale step at $0.040 is about to start. MUTM is likely to do better than other crypto coins because it has busy lending pools, a stablecoin that is pegged to $1, strong risk management, and is about to be listed on an exchange. Retail investors who want to get in on high-growth, utility-driven crypto prices should act quickly before the entry window closes. MUTM’s roadmap and long-term mechanics support strong 25¢ returns that are well above BTC’s present path.

It is now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, and more than 55% of the available shares have already been claimed. This has raised about $16.8 million from over 16,750 users. Total supply is 4B MUTM, and Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040. This will be the last chance to buy at a deal before the price rises by 15%. Traders who want to know if crypto is a good investment are looking more and more at MUTM for its use and huge potential gain. Insiders predict a run toward $2 by 2026. Beta launch and Layer-2 expansion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a two-way lending system that combines P2C pools for safe assets and stablecoins with P2P desks for risky tokens. This separation protects core liquidity while letting higher-risk assets find their own market, which brings in a wide range of players. The design of the protocol is based on predictable borrowing and lending, which creates long-term fee streams that support the demand for tokens. Early users will be able to personally experience lending and borrowing, as well as stake mtTokens and see how liquidation works, when the beta starts soon. As soon as investors and companies test the protocol and commit assets, this real-world exposure will lead to more users and more cash on hand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will build trust and encourage adoption before the mainnet goes live by giving users early access to functional tools. When compared to Layer-1 options, Layer-2 connections will make transactions go much faster and cost less. This advantage in scalability will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more attractive for borrowing, lending, and staking over and over again. Higher daily activity will be attracted by faster execution and lower running costs. This will lead to consistent fee generation that supports staking rewards and token buybacks. For investors keeping an eye on crypto prices right now, this efficiency means a higher chance of making money and less trouble with using the system. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the Sepolia Testnet V1 will host the first liquidity pools for mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot. This will allow the team to fine-tune risk factors like LTV ratios, liquidation triggers, and collateral efficiency. These features will make the infrastructure strong for both individual and business users, which will boost trust that MUTM is not just another speculative asset but a money-making environment. Utility drivers justifying the $2 projection A lot of things point to the bold prediction that MUTM will hit $2 by 2026. The new stablecoin will add to the demand because every loan issued against collateral will need operations and fees backed by MUTM. This keeps putting pressure on people to buy the token because of its usefulness. Major listings on Binance and Coinbase will make it much easier for individual and institutional buyers to get into the market. Wide exchange availability speeds up the formation of liquidity, lowers losses, and allows for quick price discovery. This makes sure that the token’s market value reflects how widely the protocol is used. Features that focus on the community will encourage early engagement even more. Heavy users and stakers will be rewarded with bonus MUTM tokens through the dashboard ROI calculator and Top 50 leaderboard. This will create a loop where involvement increases token accumulation while encouraging more people to use the protocol. These kinds of incentives will turn protocol action into measurable demand, which will keep the price of the token going up. The possibility is shown by investment math. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, a $1,000 share buys about 28,600 MUTM tokens. When MUTM hits the expected $2, that position will be worth $57,150, which shows how much of a benefit early participation is. As the price of Phase 7 rises to $0.040—an impending 15% rise—investors who act now will get in at a lower price and get the most out of future price increases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also reinforces security and credibility with its CertiK audit, including a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. Combined with a $50,000 bug bounty and $100,000 community giveaway , these features signal a professionally managed ecosystem with transparent incentives. As presale demand continues, the Phase 6 allocation is rapidly depleting, intensifying FOMO for investors seeking both utility and outsized returns. For those evaluating crypto prices today and asking if crypto is a good investment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a rare combination of real-world utility, structured revenue mechanics, and aggressive growth potential. Early investors in this Phase 6 presale are positioned to capture the initial 15% price uplift to $0.040 while benefiting from long-term protocol-driven demand that could propel MUTM toward its $2 target by 2026.

The Exchequer admitted that the growth of living standards was way below expectations, as it criticized government spending. The Treasury argued that stagnant productivity was responsible for holding back the working population as the government spiraled into wasteful spending. Asylum services were at the top of government spending, and the Treasury is considering ways of tackling that problem ahead of November’s budget. The Cryptopolitan reported in August that the UK Treasury is considering an income tax trap to fill a budget hole, raising £7 billion yearly until 2028. Rachel Reeves, Chancellor of the Exchequer, is preparing to launch even more tax rises in November. However, the OBR’s forecasts will set boundaries for the Chancellor as she balances the books. Monks warns of perpetual annual tax rise cycles Allan Monks, a Senior Economist at the European Commission’s Monetary Policy & International Relations Department, warned that the November budget will likely deal with part of the problem. He added that Britain could be trapped in an endless cycle of annual tax raises as Reeve’s fiscal plans barely meet the sustainability threshold. Mr Monks’ warning came as the British tax and spending watchdog cautioned Reeves that next year’s growth could be lower and inflation higher than expected. The fiscal watchdog projected that growth is unlikely to be realized despite an optimistic outlook. Meanwhile, Monks believes Labour will preside over the record tax-raising parliament if the budget’s £130 billion is raised primarily through taxes rather than by reducing expenditure. “The Chancellor can avoid the questions, but she can’t escape the facts. Under Rachel Reeves, we have seen inflation double, debt balloon, business confidence at its lowest level, borrowing costs at a 27-year high, and taxes up – with more pain on the way in the autumn.” – Sir Mel Stride , Shadow Chancellor Sir Stride stressed that Reeves had only herself to blame for the economy’s underperformance. The Chancellor is reportedly under pressure from Labour backbenchers to lift the two-child benefit cap, which could cost taxpayers more than £3 billion annually. Reeves is also expected to find £5 billion to fund winter fuel payments and the U-turn on the humiliating welfare reform. Bailey says regulators are not to blame The Bank of England’s Governor , Andrew Bailey, defended regulators, saying they were not to blame for the economy’s poor performance. He argued that over-regulation has not stymied growth, adding that restricting business investments through financial regulations did not cause the decline in productivity growth. However, Reeves believes that regulation acts like “a boot on the neck” of businesses. Meanwhile, Bailey urged policymakers not to “throw the baby out with the bathwater” by staging deregulation drives. He pointed out that there is no trade-off between competitiveness, growth, and financial stability objectives. The IMF also weighed in on the matter, suggesting that Labour’s pursuit of industrial policies risked pushing up public debt and prices. The fund noted that spending on tax breaks and other subsidies was, on average, higher in the UK than in the EU. It warned that UK policies lowered overall productivity by reducing competition. The Treasury claimed that misinformation is circulating from individuals who claim to know what the budget includes before critical decisions are made by the relevant authorities. The Exchequer clarified that only the Chancellor will make those decisions, discouraging people from relying on rumors. Reeves will reportedly try to convince the watchdog over the next seven weeks that Labour’s planned reforms, string of trade agreements, and deregulation drive are enough to offset the budgetary damage partially. Monks said Reeves could be forced to raise an extra £50 to £80 billion in taxes through parliament. JPMorgan said tax raids will likely become the norm for the rest of parliament if Reeves wants to keep debt from spiraling out of control. The investment bank warned that Britain could face spending cuts or tax rises of up to £130 billion over the course of this parliament. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Less focused on price charts and trading pairs, the São Paulo-based company now talks more about Brazil’s central bank’s PIX payments, digital fixed income, and streamlined remittances. Mercado Bitcoin’s head of corporate development, Daniel Cunha, told CoinDesk in an interview on the sidelines of the exchange’s DAC 2025 conference that the firm wants to become the app where Brazilians manage their financial lives. A kind of “super app” for spending, saving, and investing. Yet, calling MB a “super app” may not quite capture the essence of the strategy. Its leadership prefers a different term: a financial hub that blends legacy finance with blockchain, letting users tap into both without needing to understand either. “The revolution happens when the protocol disappears,” Cunha told CoinDesk. “The customer doesn’t want to hear about blockchains and tokens. They want to know the rate, the risk, and the maturity date,” he said, referring to the exchange’s tokenized fixed income offerings. 'Invisible blockchain' That thinking has reshaped how MB presents itself to users. Instead of relying on crypto-native vocabulary, the company now emphasizes features in its offering. One major change involved scrapping the term “tokenization” in user-facing materials altogether, Cunha said. “We tried a ton of variations,” Cunha said. “When we stopped saying ‘token’ and started saying ‘digital fixed income,’ things took off.” The idea is to have a product whose backend is powered by blockchain technology, but the frontend remains more recognizable to the masses. Essentially, MB’s bet is that “invisible blockchain” is the next frontier. “We’re going to see a lot of people use blockchain without realizing they’re using blockchain,” MB said. “That’s when you know the revolution has happened.” The firm’s flagship blockchain-based investment products focus on tokenized private credit, a segment it believes is underserved and ripe for disruption in Brazil. Brazil ranks among the top five countries for retail crypto usage, according to Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index . MB is positioning itself as an answer to a pain point common in the country through a stablecoin-based remittance service. A pivot from trading Despite all the new initiatives, MB’s core business, crypto trading, still accounts for the majority of its revenue. But that balance is shifting. At its peak, trading made up 95% of the firm’s income. Today, that number is closer to 60%, with the rest coming from payments, custody, tokenized investments, and services like asset management. Over time, the company expects trading to fall below 30%, Cunha revealed. As part of that shift, the firm is also expanding geographically. It now has a client-facing operation in Portugal and is building institutional channels in the U.S., aiming to link capital and investment opportunities across markets. Mercado Bitcoin, where a significant portion of assets under management are made up of small and medium enterprises’ treasuries , expects to surpass 3 billion reais ($563 million) in tokenized credit issuance by year-end. About 20% of assets under custody on the platform are now tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), up from virtually zero just a few years ago. The pivot sits within a wider push to build “financial super apps.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said Coinbase aims to be a crypto-powered “super app” that would provide “all types of financial services.” Beyond crypto, fintechs such as Revolut and Paytm are bundling payments, lending and investing. The playbook borrows from WeChat and Alipay, apps that bundle social, financial, and other features.

Designed to simplify the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) and offer built-in compliance, the new token standard aims to position the Ripple’s XRPL as a go-to network for secure, high-volume institutional finance. About The Ripple XRP Ledger MPT Standard Dr Martin Hiesboeck, Head of Research at Uphold, took to X social media on Friday to announce that the XRP Ledger has officially activated the MPT standard on its mainnet. The MPT standard is a protocol-native fungible token designed to streamline the issuance of RWAs and institutional-grade instruments on-chain. Unlike traditional token standards that rely heavily on custom smart contracts, Hiesboeck says that MPT integrates core control features into the Ripple’s XRPL protocol. He explains that this approach mitigates the risks and complexities associated with smart contract development , offering a secure, battle-tested foundation that is particularly appealing to regulated institutions. The Uphold executive also stated that MPT tokens come with built-in critical compliance features for regulated entities, including “granular asset freezing” and “fund clawback” mechanisms, which allow issuers to react instantly to sanctions, fraud, or operational errors. He highlighted that the tokens incorporate advanced access control through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and credentials, ensuring that only authorized KYC-verified participants can hold and transfer assets. By embedding these capabilities at the protocol level, Hiesboeck noted that MPT reduces the need for high-cost coding, audits, and additional regulatory capital allocation, effectively lowering operational risk while accelerating adoption. In terms of regulated settlements, Hiesboeck states that the MPT standard is designed for high-throughput financial operations, leveraging XRPL’s core strengths of fast transaction speeds (3-5 seconds) and extremely low, predictable fees in XRP. The Uphold executive reported that the protocol enforces transparency by automatically burning tokens returned to the issuer, effectively maintaining an auditable circulating supply. He also stated that MPT supports native metadata standards, such as XLS-0089d and the Actus Standard, enabling tokens to function as digital contracts with machine-readable terms. Hiesboeck said that this facilitates a smooth integration with external financial risk and valuation systems, allowing MPT to function as a true digital contract while creating a robust environment for institutional adoption. Implications For XRP’s Utility And Investors Moving forward, Hiesboeck stated that the widespread adoption of MPT or RWA tokenization, a market projected to reach trillions of dollars , will directly impact XRP’s utility and value. He reported that every MPT issuance, transfer, or management operation requires a fee paid in XRP that is permanently burned , ultimately increasing scarcity as institutional trading grows. For investors, this creates a steady deflationary mechanism that could drive long-term upward pressure for the XRP price. The Uphold executive further highlighted that each new MPT issuance requires a fixed XRP reserve , further reducing circulating supply and creating a verifiable connection between ledger activity and the cryptocurrency’s demand. Hiesboeck concluded that this utility-driven approach shifts the narrative of XRP from just a speculative asset to a functional utility layer based on high-throughput global financial activity.",Ripple|Actus Standard|Decentralized Identifiers|DIDs|Dr Martin Hiesboeck|MPT|Multi-Purpose Token|real-world assets|ripple|ripple news|RWAs|The Uphold|XLS-0089d|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 14:00:59

Bitcoin Price keeps setting the tone, Ethereum follows, and mid caps jockey for flow. Cardano’s reputation still draws respect, yet a fresh payments-focused contender is pulling attention as liquidity rotates. If the momentum that drove the Bitcoin Price this quarter spills into select altcoins, the token that solves real-world transactions first can run ahead. Miss the early window and you may end up chasing green candles later. The Pulse of ADA: Current State & Forecasts Cardano (ADA) trades in the $0.84 to $0.90 band after a failed push toward $0.98. Bulls want a decisive break above $1.00 to open room toward $1.50 or even $2.00, while bears point to fragile support near $0.84 to $0.85 and a tightening range that could sap energy without a new catalyst. The setup remains balanced, but in a market led by Bitcoin Price, patience can turn into slippage if dominance keeps crowding out slower movers. ADA is still a respected best DeFi altcoin candidate, yet it must re-prove momentum, not rely on legacy. Remittix: Payments Pioneer Aiming at ADA’s Crown Now to the elephant in the room. That rising payments rail you keep hearing about is Remittix , and it is not selling a dream. It is building a cross-border utility where crypto meets bank accounts, real-time FX, and fast settlement. Remittix is not just loud on social. Security due diligence has been done with the toughest names in blockchain auditing, and the team sits at the very top tier for pre-launch verification. The wallet beta is already in the wild with community testers, which means product proof points, not promises. The current token price of Remittix is around $0.1130, placing it in the top crypto under $1 bracket that early-stage crypto investment money loves to accumulate before the crowd catches on. Why Remittix Is Being Considered by Top Analysts Crypto to bank payouts already span 30+ countries, offering a direct fiat off-ramp for everyday users. Network design focuses on low gas fee crypto execution through batching and smart routing. A deflationary scheme is in place to reward holders who think in months, not minutes. The mobile wallet launch in Q3 is positioned to onboard non-crypto natives at scale. Community participation is deep, with measurable traction rather than vanity metrics. The Conversion Case Here is the blunt truth. Flows follow certainty. Bitcoin Price sets the tide, but upside comes from assets with real world pull. Remittix has security stamps from Certik, sits ranked at the summit for pre-launch tokens, and already lets testers click through the product today. Add listings that are live, a price at $0.1130 that leaves room for multiple re-ratings, and a simple thesis forms: accumulate before the broader market wakes up.

The deal follows the AI industry trend of the CEO jumping ship with the acquisition. The announcement was made by chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith on his personal X account on Friday. “I’m excited to announce that Roi has been acquired by OpenAI!” he posted. He also said, “We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience. Along the way, we realized personalization isn’t just the future of finance.

We’re extremely grateful to our users, investors, friends, and family who made this journey possible,” he added. According to several sources close to the matter, he is the only one making the switch out of the four-person staff at the company. I’m excited to announce that Roi has been acquired by OpenAI!

The latest OpenAI acquisition marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from the company. Earlier this year, the company completed the acquisition of Context.ai, Crossing Minds, and Alex. While it remains to be seen what part of Roi’s tech will transfer to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition is in line with OpenAI’s new bet. The company is now betting on personalization and life management as the next layer of its AI products . Roi is coming with a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale, a challenge whose lessons can be applied broadly. Rio, based in New York, was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding. The funding involved investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Spacecadet Ventures, and Gradient Data, according to PitchBook data. Roi acquisition aligns with consumer-based efforts According to the firm, its mission was to aggregate a user’s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, real estate, DeFi, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades. Aside from tracking, Roi also allows users access to a financially savvy AI companion that is programmed in ways that make sense for them. According to the company behind Roi, its software is designed in a way that it should not just provide generic answers but adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal and human, and keep the users engaged. “The products we use every day won’t remain static, predetermined experiences.

Once viewed as a token locked in cyclical volatility, it is now attracting renewed institutional attention and on-chain activity that suggest deeper structural changes are underway. The question is no longer whether XRP can climb, but what baseline price it can realistically sustain in the coming cycle. Market strategist XRP_Cro argues that $10 is not a far-fetched target, but the next logical foundation for XRP’s valuation. Consolidation at $3 Signals Strength XRP is currently trading in the low-$3 range, with recent sessions showing stability between $2.90 and $3.10. This consolidation is significant. In traditional market terms, such price action suggests the asset is establishing firm support, often a precursor to larger directional moves. The resilience at this level reflects improved liquidity and sustained demand across exchanges, setting the stage for what could be the next major leg upward. #XRP is about to explode These current prices won't matter soon! $10 isn’t a dream — it’s the new baseline! pic.twitter.com/kanblEwj58 — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) October 3, 2025 Institutional Products Nearing Decision One of the clearest catalysts for XRP’s potential repricing lies in the institutional product pipeline. Several spot-exchange traded fund (ETF) applications are under review, with decisions expected in October. ETF approval would open the door for both passive and active institutional flows, providing unprecedented accessibility for capital allocators. The presence of firm timelines — tied to regulatory calendars — has already shifted investor sentiment, as markets begin to price in the probability of fresh demand. Derivatives Markets Show Rising Activity Parallel to ETF anticipation, XRP’s derivatives markets have been heating up. Open interest and trading volume on regulated venues are increasing, particularly in futures contracts that give professional investors a structured way to gain exposure. This growth matters because institutional players typically scale into assets through risk-managed instruments before deploying direct spot allocations. The result is a layered demand pipeline that supports both short-term speculation and long-term positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Whale Accumulation Tightens Supply On-chain data further reinforces the bullish case. Large holders — often referred to as whales — have been moving XRP from exchanges into cold storage. This type of accumulation has two effects: it signals confidence from long-term investors, and it reduces the liquid supply available for trading. With less XRP on exchanges , future demand exerts greater upward pressure on price. In past cycles, similar patterns have preceded major breakouts across the digital asset market. Why $10 Looks Plausible Taken together, these dynamics make XRP_Cro’s assertion more than just optimism. A $10 baseline would require sustained institutional flows, ETF approval, and continued whale-led supply reduction. None of these are guaranteed, but the pieces are aligning in a way not seen in prior cycles. If momentum continues to build across these fronts, the case for a new baseline becomes credible. In conclusion, XRP_Cro’s bold forecast reflects a market that is fundamentally stronger than in previous years. With ETFs nearing a decision, derivatives activity rising, and whales tightening supply, the foundation for higher valuations is taking shape. Whether XRP firmly establishes $10 as its new baseline will depend on how these catalysts converge — but the argument is no longer rooted in speculation alone. For the first time in years, XRP’s potential trajectory is being underpinned by structural, measurable factors that investors cannot ignore.

The renewed momentum follows a shift in global monetary sentiment as traders weigh the Federal Reserve’s path for interest rates and anticipate fresh easing that could boost digital assets like Ethereum. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Thursday that while the central bank’s September quarter-point rate cut was justified to cushion a cooling labor market, policymakers must remain cautious not to overstimulate the economy. Inflation remains above target, and rising tariffs could lead to higher prices in the short term. Target Rate Probabilities 29 Oct 2025 Fed Meeting – Source: CME Group Still, markets remain confident that the Fed will proceed with further cuts. CME Group’s FedWatch Tool now assigns a 97% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in October, and an 85% chance of another reduction by December. The postponed non-farm payrolls report, due to the U.S. government shutdown, hasn’t deterred traders, who are instead relying on alternative data pointing to a gradual softening of labor markets. Why Rate Cut Bets Are Fueling ETH’s Momentum Expectations of lower interest rates have become one of the strongest macro tailwinds for Ethereum. When borrowing costs fall, investors typically shift from yield-bearing assets into riskier, growth-oriented assets, such as technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. For Ethereum, this shift means more liquidity flowing into both the token itself and its surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Ethereum, in particular, tends to benefit because it underpins most blockchain applications, from stablecoins to NFTs and staking protocols. As real-world yields ease, ETH staking — which currently offers an estimated annualized return of 3–4% — becomes comparatively more attractive. This helps explain why Ethereum has outperformed smaller altcoins in recent weeks. Rising institutional participation also amplifies this dynamic. Funds anticipating easier monetary conditions often rebalance portfolios toward long-term innovation assets. If rate cuts materialize, capital inflows into Ethereum-based ETFs, staking products, and DeFi platforms could expand further, reinforcing ETH’s status as the second-largest asset in the market and a key barometer for crypto liquidity cycles. Ethereum Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Technically , the Ethereum price prediction remains bullish as ETH consolidates above $4,500, holding firm within a rising parallel channel formed since late September. The chart shows a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, underpinned by a bullish SMA crossover — with the 50-period average ($4,372) now above the 100-period ($4,294). Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators remain supportive. The RSI near 58 signals the market has cooled from overbought levels but still holds positive traction. Recent candlesticks show smaller bodies and several Doji formations, indicating brief consolidation after a strong rally. Ethereum holds steady above $4,500, riding a strong uptrend within an ascending channel. RSI cooling near 58 hints at healthy consolidation — a bounce from $4,440–$4,420 could fuel the next leg toward $4,675–$4,765. #Ethereum #ETH #Crypto pic.twitter.com/JxjWCnrAAL — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 4, 2025 A potential bounce from the lower trendline near $4,440–$4,420 could offer an attractive buy-the-dip setup, targeting resistance at $4,675–$4,765. For downside protection, stops may be placed below $4,375, aligning with the short-term support level. A break below that could expose $4,200, though as long as Ethereum maintains its channel, the bias remains upward.

The exodus landed at the exact moment the government entered another shutdown, with more job losses likely still on the way. This drop is the direct result of a policy that allowed employees to resign months ago while still collecting their salary and benefits through September 30, the final day of the federal fiscal year. The program had 154,000 federal employees sign up. Two-thirds of them stayed on the books until the end of last month, even though they technically no longer worked. That buffer expired this week. Trump’s team has made no secret of its intention to downsize the federal bureaucracy. Now, the expectation is that the government will wrap up this year with hundreds of thousands fewer staff, driven by voluntary resignations, a hiring freeze, and layoffs that could become permanent. During the shutdown , around 750,000 people have been temporarily furloughed, and Trump has warned that some of them will not be returning. Layoffs pile up as workers take exit deals or get pushed out The administration says this effort is part of a broader plan to overhaul the federal system and clean out what Trump called “unaccountable” employees. Layoffs, buyouts, and early retirement packages have taken a heavy toll on civil servants, disrupting operations across the country and shrinking services the public depends on. While federal workers make up a small percentage of the entire U.S. labor market , the losses are coming during a year already filled with job cuts in other industries like finance and manufacturing. Ryan Sweet, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said this trend is one of the reasons the job market has taken such a hard hit lately. And while these departures were voluntary on paper, many felt forced out. Cynthia Iglesias Guven, a longtime staffer at the Agriculture Department, said her work dried up quickly after the new administration took over and canceled her agency’s main programs. “Going into work every day was extremely tense,” Cynthia said. Rick Beevers, who worked at the U.S. Army’s program executive office for aviation in Huntsville, Alabama, left in February under the same deal. Rick had spent two years in federal service, but a recent promotion had him classified as a probationary employee, exactly the type Trump’s team began targeting. “It just wasn’t worth it,” he said. “There was a much better opportunity to find something else that wasn’t government.” Rick tried to get ahead of the job-hunting crowd and started applying early, and reportedly got interviewed at seven defense contractors but didn’t land anything until the end of September. Job market crowds as former workers flood hiring platforms While some former federal workers, especially in specialized fields, have secured jobs quickly, others are hitting a wall. White-collar hiring has slowed, and there are simply too many applicants competing for the same roles. On Indeed, job applications from federal workers jumped 41.2% between January and September. But Frank Grossman, a career coach based in Philadelphia who works with former federal employees, says most people who took the deal haven’t seriously started job-hunting. “Reality hasn’t hit for a lot of people yet,” Frank said . The shutdown is making things worse. Ryan Sweet warned that furloughed federal workers could now be listed as unemployed in official jobs reports. When combined with the deferred-resignation exits, the next report might not be pretty. “A hideous employment report could be coming,” he said. Research from business schools at the University of Virginia, Emory, and Stanford shows federal workers furloughed during shutdowns are 31% more likely to quit within a year. Christoph Herpfer, assistant professor of finance at UVA’s Darden School of Business, said many workers feel like disposable pieces in a political game. He added that going unpaid for weeks only adds more stress and instability. Cynthia, who had worked at USDA for over two decades, now runs a career coaching business that focuses on helping federal workers transition out. She said several local therapists even reached out, asking her to help explain why so many of their clients who worked in the federal government were showing up completely burned out. Still, Cynthia isn’t sure she’s in the clear. She’s worried her pension could be delayed due to backlogs or short staffing. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.7676 Market cap $767.44M Trading volume $246.90M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.7997 24-hour low $0.7621 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.15% 50-day SMA $0.8454 14-Day RSI 44.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.8104 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF faces rejection at $0.783 resistance level. The MACD shows fading momentum. Short-term consolidation is visible between $0.756 and $0.802. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for October 4, WIF is trading at $0.765 after a failed attempt to close above $0.783. This rejection shows fading bullish strength, particularly as the MACD remains weak, with the signal line still negative. The Alligator lines are compressed, hinting at an indecisive phase before a possible directional move. Volume at 33.6M remains steady but not enough to confirm strong buying interest. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The next support sits at $0.748–$0.750, aligned with the Alligator’s green baseline, while resistance levels are seen at $0.783 and $0.805. If the price fails to hold above $0.760, a drop toward $0.730 or even $0.710 could follow. For bullish traders, a confirmed close above $0.783 would open the path toward $0.802 and possibly $0.845. Short-term entries near $0.755–$0.760 remain viable, with profit targets between $0.800 and $0.820. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart shows WIF struggling to break the $0.802 resistance after several attempts. The short-term structure is forming a consolidation channel between $0.756 support and $0.802 resistance. The 21-period SMA at $0.772 acts as a pivot line, with price currently trading just below it, suggesting a minor bearish bias in the short term. The MACD is flat, with histogram bars weakening, confirming the lack of strong momentum. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview If bulls regain control and price climbs above $0.772, the next target remains $0.800–$0.802. However, if selling pressure persists and the price drops below $0.756, a decline toward $0.712 is likely, where strong demand previously supported recovery. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7941 SELL SMA 5 $0.7740 SELL SMA 10 $0.7710 SELL SMA 21 $0.8392 SELL SMA 50 $0.8454 SELL SMA 100 $0.9091 SELL SMA 200 $0.8104 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8059 SELL EMA 5 $0.8140 SELL EMA 10 $0.8237 SELL EMA 21 $0.8502 SELL EMA 50 $0.8915 SELL EMA 100 $0.9003 SELL EMA 200 $0.9978 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is entering a period of consolidation after an initial bounce failed to break $0.78 convincingly. The market looks undecided, leaning slightly bearish in the short term. Holding above $0.755 keeps buyers in the game, but a breakdown under that level could lead to $0.712. Conversely, a breakout above $0.783 could quickly revive bullish sentiment toward $0.80–$0.84. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The service will let users buy, hold, and convert bitcoin and ether within the app, with crypto infrastructure provided by Chicago-based Zerohash, CNBC reports , citing sources familiar with the matter. Though OnePay hasn’t publicly confirmed the rollout, the move would put it in line with competitors like Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal, which already offer crypto trading to U.S. users. Founded in 2021 by Walmart and venture firm Ribbit Capital, OnePay has been building what it calls an “everything app” for digital finance. Its existing services include high-yield savings accounts, debit and credit cards, peer-to-peer payments, and buy now, pay later options. By adding crypto, OnePay is banking on the idea that its users, many of whom shop at Walmart’s nearly 4,600 U.S. stores, will want to spend, save, or transfer crypto on the same platform they handle cash. Though OnePay is closely tied to Walmart, the app is operated as a separate company to appeal to a broader user base, particularly Americans underserved by traditional banks.

While that forecast is typical of the mania for DOGE’s loyal following and previous price spikes, enthusiasm in the crypto community is already shifting quickly towards a project with much greater potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . As much as DOGE remains social momentum and sentiment-dependent, MUTM is building actual, utility-based value through its two-pronged lending mechanism. Its presale has already raised over $16.8 million, attracted over 16,750 buyers, and is already over 55% sold out in Stage 6, a testimony to high retail and institutional confidence. Mutuum Finance can take flight from its current price of $0.035 to $3.50 in 2026 and possibly yield 100x returns, making it an even more revolutionary investment than DOGE for the next bull cycle. Dogecoin Bulls Steer as Momentum Builds Towards Key Resistance Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) is recovering its strength after bouncing from the $0.221 support level, with the price now trading at around $0.245 following a bullish intraday run that briefly hit $0.246. Analysts anticipate that maintaining support above $0.240 is the parameter to sustaining this trend, which can see DOGE hit $0.255 and $0.270 in the short term. A firm breakout can even lay the foundation for a charge to the psychologically significant $0.30 level, with buyers continuing to pile in and pace picking up. Heartening as this rebound is for DOGE holders, though, those in search of larger, utility-driven growth potential are increasingly focused on breakout DeFi player Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a trend that reflects changing market appetites away from meme-based gains. Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches New Heights Mutuum Finance is causing a splash in DeFi with its presale, having gained over 16,750 investors and raised over $16.8 million so far. Phase 6 of the presale is on course at 55% completion and selling MUTM tokens at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of its early investors, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , to give 10 lucky winners 10,000 MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance is set to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to bear markets-stopping algorithmic stablecoins, the token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and designed to become price-stable even in bear markets. The protocol also has a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism where each asset has an associated collateral cap depending on its risk factor. That is to facilitate proportionate and arm’s length lending. Besides covering users in bad times, the protocol also has a buffer reserve mechanism where riskier assets have higher reserves assigned as additional collateral and to subsidize the ecosystem. With its presale growth, risk management innovations, and transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its position as a safe, stable, and innovative DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance Announces Development of Its Lending & Borrowing Solution Mutuum Finance has announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a milestone in its DeFi strategy. The initial release (V1) of the protocol will be released on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. Lending, borrowing, and the functionality of ETH and USDT as collateral will also be available at the initial release for users to make their first interactions with a robust open-and-shut matter for a rapid and secure decentralized finance platform. Dogecoin’s rise to $1.20 is a product of community-driven strength, but for those who crave true exponential growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has much greater potential. With tokens still only at $0.035 in phase 6 and well over 55% sold out already, MUTM’s two-sided lending system, overcollateralized stablecoin, and risk-adjusted architecture make it in a league of its own. Backed by $16.8 million in funds raised and 16,750+ investors, analysts believe MUTM has a chance to hit $3.50 in 2026, a potential 100× return that makes it a much more groundbreaking potential than DOGE in the next bull cycle.

While many analysts remain bullish on a move toward $200,000 or higher, others warn that the current rally may need to cool off before the next surge. A correction toward $100,000 could be the shakeout that resets the market — creating the base for a renewed push higher. At the same time, the spotlight is shifting beyond Bitcoin. As the world’s largest crypto consolidates, retail traders are turning their attention to new opportunities in the meme coin sector. One name rising fast is AlphaPepe (ALPE) — a project that’s being called the next Dogecoin, combining meme culture with tangible investor incentives and early-stage growth momentum. Why a Bitcoin Pullback Might Be Healthy Bitcoin’s parabolic rally through Q3 2025 has created conditions for a potential short-term correction. Technical analysts note that BTC’s relative strength index (RSI) remains overheated, suggesting the market could cool before resuming its climb. Institutional inflows through spot ETFs remain positive, but funding rates and leveraged positioning are at multi-month highs — a sign that the market might be overextended. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced sharp retracements of 20–25% before entering its strongest phase of an uptrend. If Bitcoin were to dip back to around $100,000, it would still represent a higher low within a long-term bullish structure. Analysts call this type of move “the reset before lift-off,” a pattern that often precedes new all-time highs. Macro & On-Chain Factors Support Long-Term Growth Despite short-term caution, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain robust. Exchange reserves are near five-year lows, suggesting fewer coins available for sale. Whale accumulation continues to rise, and long-term holders are not distributing — both key bullish indicators. From a macro perspective, expectations of monetary easing in 2026 could reintroduce liquidity to global markets, benefitting risk assets like BTC. Analysts at major funds maintain that institutional interest remains the dominant long-term driver, reinforcing a base case for eventual six-figure expansion once consolidation ends. A temporary drop to $100K, therefore, may not signal weakness — but rather opportunity. AlphaPepe: Rising as the Next Dogecoin While Bitcoin consolidates, retail traders are chasing fresh narratives — and AlphaPepe has quickly become the standout meme token of 2025. Marketed as a fun, community-driven project with real token utility, AlphaPepe captures the same viral energy that propelled DOGE from a joke to a global brand. But AlphaPepe is building on what Dogecoin lacked early on: structure and engagement rewards. The project has introduced a multi-pool liquidity system, with its second USDT pool surpassing $5,000, reflecting healthy investor activity. It also incorporates staking mechanics, giving holders passive income opportunities — something DOGE never offered. Community traction has been equally strong. Social metrics show exponential growth across X and Telegram, and meme campaigns have gone viral multiple times. Analysts believe that AlphaPepe could achieve DOGE-like returns in its early cycles, as hype, utility, and community sentiment converge. The Market Dynamic: Bitcoin Leads, Meme Coins Follow Historically, meme coins tend to explode during phases when Bitcoin cools down. When BTC consolidates after a rally, liquidity often rotates into speculative assets — the so-called “altseason” effect. This is exactly the environment AlphaPepe is thriving in. While Bitcoin pauses near its highs, traders looking for exponential returns are funnelling into meme coin projects with strong narratives and viral reach. AlphaPepe fits the bill perfectly — the right coin, at the right moment in the market cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin may experience a dip toward $100,000 before continuing its march toward higher valuations, but that doesn’t weaken its long-term outlook. If anything, it could create an ideal setup for the next leg higher — fueled by ETF inflows, supply scarcity, and institutional adoption. Meanwhile, AlphaPepe is capturing the retail imagination, echoing Dogecoin’s early rise but with modern mechanics and stronger fundamentals. With its liquidity pools expanding, social metrics exploding, and meme culture thriving, AlphaPepe is quickly emerging as the next DOGE-style success story — one that could define the retail side of this market cycle.

Price action has held above several support levels, and traders are watching $123,500 as the immediate test before a fresh run at records. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Bitcoin Price Tests Final Resistance Bitcoin’s trading channel has held firm for weeks, with a steady pattern of higher highs and higher lows. After finding support near the channel low — a point that lined up with the market’s point of control — the rally reached the $123,825 high-timeframe resistance zone. Based on reports, that level is now the last major cap before prices move into untried territory. If the barrier is taken cleanly, the next target inside the channel sits near $131,000. Momentum is being backed by rising open interest. As price climbed, the number of active positions has also grown, which traders read as a sign of broadening participation rather than a brief retail flare-up. Reports have disclosed that Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings rose to $77.4 billion as BTC reclaimed the $120,000 mark, a move that market watchers say reflects stronger institutional interest. Source: Coinglass Institutions Add Large Positions Spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn substantial money. According to figures cited in the market, inflows into these ETFs reached $58 billion overall, with $23 billion coming this year. Some analysts expect another $20 billion could arrive before year-end. That kind of demand is being called by some investors a structural bid that tightens available supply on exchanges. Analysts on Wall Street are now issuing bold price targets. One large bank has put a $231K figure into circulation, while Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, offered a $135,000 near-term call and said $200,000 could be possible by the end of 2025. Kendrick bases his view on three pillars: sustained ETF inflows, faster adoption across firms, and steady market sentiment despite broader macro worries. Price structure and open interest are aligned in a way that many traders find convincing. Each rally so far has been followed by measured pullbacks, which some see as healthy consolidation rather than a breakdown. Still, the region above prior highs is thin on liquidity; moves there tend to be quick and wild.

If the level holds as resistance, expect a sharper correction that could test lower support inside the channel.

As Dogecoin gains renewed attention thanks to institutional interest and its first U.S. spot ETF launch, Remittix (RTX) stands out for its real utility narrative. Holding both in your portfolio gives you exposure to the meme-driven upside of Dogecoin and the payments infrastructure upside of Remittix. Dogecoin: Meme Power with Institutional Tailwinds Dogecoin recently exploded past key resistance levels, topping above $0.25 and gaining strong momentum amid rising institutional interest. The launch of the REX Osprey DOJE spot DOGE ETF opened regulated access for institutions, providing a fresh catalyst. Its trading volumes tripled during breaks above pattern catalysts, signalling renewed buying pressure. Some analysts argue that its next targets, $0.50 or $1, are ambitious unless major adoption changes occur. Its role remains largely speculative, and much depends on continued ETF flows and community narratives. Remittix: The Payments Token Your Portfolio Should Have Dogecoin’s strength comes from meme appeal and brand, while Remittix aims for real transaction volume across borders. In a portfolio, Dogecoin might carry upside from hype cycles, but Remittix offers a foundation for sustained growth beyond speculative waves. Remittix has already achieved major milestones to support that vision. The Remittix team is now fully verified by CertiK, and Remittix is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens on CertiK. Its beta wallet is live, with community users actively testing transfers and features. The platform rewards community growth via a 15% USDT referral program, claimable every 24 hours through its dashboard. A $250,000 giveaway fuels engagement and expands user reach. Remittix also holds two confirmed CEX listings (BitMart and LBank), with a third underway. It has sold over 674 million tokens, trades at $0.1130, and has raised over $27million. Here are five core strengths that make Remittix an essential hold alongside Dogecoin: Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Ranked number one among pre-launch tokens Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd These features provide Remittix with a narrative that extends beyond cycles of hype. By combining security, real rails, listing momentum, and token incentives, Remittix positions itself not as a meme alternative but as a payments infrastructure play with upside. Why Holding Both Adds Balance Dogecoin offers upside via community and ETF momentum, which can yield sharp rallies during meme seasons. Remittix offers depth through a payments infrastructure, which can produce steady adoption and volume growth. The risks differ: Dogecoin is vulnerable to sentiment shifts, while Remittix is already proving its utility. Together, they give you exposure to speculative energy and foundational expansion in one portfolio.

Bitcoin laid the foundation by proving that decentralized money could exist, but the conversation has now shifted to what can deliver real-world payments at scale. In this evolving environment, XRP is increasingly positioned as the network that doesn’t just demonstrate possibility — it perfects functionality. From Experiment to Utility The debate resurfaced recently when John Squire referenced a remark by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who said during the 2017 Singapore Fintech Festival that Bitcoin was a great experiment, but not for payments. The comment, made nearly a decade ago, remains highly relevant. While Bitcoin validated the concept of blockchain-based money, its limitations for everyday transactions continue to drive the search for networks built for payment purposes. BTC PROVED IT. $XRP PERFECTS IT. Brad Garlinghouse: “Bitcoin was a great experiment, but not for payments.” The new financial era runs on utility, not experiments. pic.twitter.com/hZ5cdJwIAu — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) October 3, 2025 What Bitcoin Achieved Bitcoin’s achievement cannot be overstated. It proved that decentralized, censorship-resistant digital money could function at scale, sparking a technological and financial revolution. It remains a trusted store of value, often described as “digital gold.” Yet its proof-of-work system and limited capacity — processing only around seven transactions per second — have long restricted its role as a practical payment network. Rising fees during periods of congestion further highlight the challenge of using Bitcoin for low-cost, high-frequency transfers. How XRP Advances the Model This is where XRP diverges. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was designed specifically for payments, focusing on speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Transactions settle in three to five seconds, fees remain consistently negligible, and the network is capable of thousands of transactions per second. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work, XRPL relies on a consensus mechanism optimized for performance, making it well-suited for cross-border transfers, remittances, and enterprise-grade financial infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Utility Over Ideology The contrast highlights a critical evolution in the crypto space. Bitcoin proved the philosophy of decentralized value transfer, but XRP is designed to deliver the mechanics of seamless payments. The two assets are not in competition for the same role — rather, they represent different phases of blockchain’s progression. Bitcoin continues to serve as a store of value , while XRP is engineered as financial infrastructure for a world increasingly driven by speed, efficiency, and interoperability. A New Financial Era Institutions, payment providers, and fintech innovators are seeking scalable and reliable solutions, driving demand for networks that offer tangible benefits and real-world utility. John Squire’s framing of the debate captures this turning point: the next era of finance will not be built on experiments but on systems that can meet the demands of global commerce. XRP’s design and growing use cases position it at the heart of this transition. In summary, Bitcoin pioneered the concept of decentralized digital money, paving the way for an entire industry to emerge. But as Garlinghouse observed, proving the concept is not the same as perfecting it for payments. XRP’s speed, scalability, and low costs make a case for its potential to serve as the foundation for the future financial infrastructure. In a world now focused on utility rather than ideology, XRP offers a blueprint for how blockchain can truly power the future of global payments.

These claims, which spread on social media, claimed that the XRP ETF application prepared by Teucrium was not directly approved by the SEC, but was “automatically activated” because the decision period had expired. Cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett clarified these claims, stating that this was a misinterpretation. According to Terrett, Teucrium's XRP ETF falls under Section 40 (Investment Company Act of 1940) because it is structured around Treasury bonds, cash, and derivative receivables. These types of ETFs don't require an active SEC approval process; the product automatically becomes active once the application period is over. Related News: Tether Moves to Purchase $200 Million Worth of Its Own Altcoin on the Market Terrett also noted that futures-based ETFs generally go through the same process, but spot crypto ETFs are completely different. Because spot ETFs are registered as “commodity trusts” under Section 33 of the Securities Act of 1933, they require explicit SEC approval to trade. Therefore, spot crypto ETFs like LTC, SOL, or XRP cannot be automatically approved or begin trading while the government shutdown continues.

From Elon Musk tweets to a robust community, DOGE has managed to stay alive. But in 2025, things appear slightly different. Will Shiba Inu keep pursuing Dogecoin, or will new contender Little Pepe pass them both by? Dogecoin (DOGE): Still the Benchmark Dogecoin is trading just above $0.2452, up 10.63% over the past week. That steady climb shows why DOGE still matters: it has the liquidity, the listings, and the recognition that few meme tokens can match. Analysts see its price grinding higher into year-end, supported by altcoin momentum and ETF launches in the U.S. But here’s the thing: DOGE is no longer a scrappy underdog. With a market cap already in the tens of billions, turning $100 into $10,000 here is nearly impossible. It’s the Bitcoin of meme coins: reliable, liquid, and still iconic, but its days of 1,000× gains are behind it. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Big Name, Slowing Engine Shiba Inu sits at $0.00001349 with a market cap of $7.6 billion. It’s clawed back momentum with a 3.98% monthly surge, and analysts project a further 9.26% weekly gain to $0.00001418. Token burns and the expansion of Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution, keep the ecosystem alive. That said, SHIB’s size is also its weakness. Even with whales accumulating another 62 billion tokens, growth projections hover in the 400%–500% range, which is impressive but pales in comparison to what early buyers saw in 2021. SHIB is in the odd position of being too big to vanish, but too large to repeat its breakout magic. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The New Challenger SHIB grew on pure hype, but LILPEPE comes with real infrastructure. The project is building an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network designed for meme tokens, with near-zero fees, sniper-bot resistance, and a dedicated Pump Pad launchpad for spawning new meme projects. The presale tells the story: Over $26.364 million raised so far More than 16.154 billion tokens sold Price has doubled from $0.001 in Stage 1 to $0.0022 in Stage 13 Community Energy and Giveaways Meme coins live and die by their communities, and LILPEPE’s is exploding. Little Pepe is everywhere with meme threads, chart screenshots, and traders flexing their presale buys. And the team hasn’t left the hype to chance; they’ve been stoking it with massive giveaways and nonstop community events that keep everyone hooked. First is the $777,000 Giveaway , where ten winners each score $77,000 in tokens. Second is the Mega Giveaway , which offers 15 ETH prizes split between top presale buyers and random participants. The bigger you buy, the bigger your chance of winning, but even small investors get a fair shot. Tokenomics and Roadmap With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, LILPEPE has carved out allocations for liquidity (10%), staking rewards (13.5%), marketing (10%), and reserves (10%). Significantly, it charges zero taxes on trades, keeping the ecosystem friction-free. The roadmap follows themed phases: “Pregnancy” (development), “Birth” (mainnet launch and listings), and “Growth” (CEX partnerships and global expansion). Each stage is tied to tangible utility rather than vague promises of a refreshing change in meme land. How to Buy Into the Presale Getting into LILPEPE’s presale is straightforward: Head to LittlePepe.com Connect a MetaMask or Trust Wallet Purchase with ETH or USDT (ETH required for gas) Claim tokens on the dashboard after the presale wraps With each stage pushing prices higher, early entry remains the most brilliant move. Conclusion: Who Wins The Crown DOGE will keep its relevance. SHIB is likely to remain in the top 20. But if you’re asking which meme coin has the best chance to take the crown, the answer is Little Pepe . It combines meme culture with real blockchain utility, has already raised more than $26 million in presale, and is turning heads with massive giveaways and grassroots hype. For those who missed SHIB in 2021, LILPEPE in 2025 might be the second chance no one thought would come again.

52662694,https://cryptonews.com/?p=433103,1759591778,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52662694.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: Massive Liquidity Inflows Boost Confidence – Is SOL Next to Hit an ATH?,https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-massive-liquidity-inflows-boost-confidence-is-sol-next-to-hit-an-ath/,"Solana (SOL) is trading at $227.69, holding steady after a week of heavy institutional inflows and rising market confidence. On-chain and derivatives data indicate a significant shift in market structure; institutions are becoming increasingly convinced, while retail remains cautious. Velo.data shows Solana futures open interest (OI) on CME has reached an all-time high of $2.16 billion, as price has rebounded 23% from $195 to $235. This institutional positioning is ahead of the Oct 10 SEC decision on a Solana based ETF. Timing suggests pros are positioning for a volatility spike. SOL CME futures data. Source: Velo.data CME’s annualized basis is 16.37%, down from 35% in July, so it’s not speculative. Retail OI across exchanges is flat and funding rates are near neutral. This is a clear picture — institutions are buying strength while retail is still recovering from the $307 million in liquidations on Sept 22, when longs worth $250 million were wiped out. This is a balanced yet bullish setup — institutional accumulation is building a base, while retail leverage remains low. Historically, this type of structure has led to a measured move up, rather than a blow-off top. Solana ETP Inflows Reinforce Confidence Another sign of institutional demand is the inflow into Solana ETPs. Total Solana ETP AUM has surpassed $500 million , led by the Solana Staking ETF (SSK) from REXShares, which has over $400 million AUM. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) has surpassed $100 million in AUM, and both products have proliferated since their launch. This represents a structural shift in how investors gain exposure to Solana — from speculative trading to regulated products that offer yield-bearing exposure through staking. This is a sign of market maturity and confirms Solana is one of the most accumulated altcoins in 2025. These inflows also tighten up liquidity on the spot market, supporting price as supply on exchanges declines. With CME’s record futures activity, this means institutional positioning is increasingly driving the price of Solana. Solana Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Technically, Solana price prediction remains bullish as SOL is in a defined uptrend, trading at $227 after moving up from $205 last week. The 50 SMA ($214.50) and 100 SMA ($216.35) are below the price, indicating a bullish crossover and an intact trend. Candlesticks show smaller-bodied candles with upper wicks, consolidation after a big move. RSI is 55.9, so the market has cooled off and there’s room for another push higher. Resistance is at $237.00, then $244.85, with a potential target at $253.44 if momentum continues. For traders, the optimal setup is between $224 and $225, where the lower channel serves as a buy-the-dip zone. As long as Solana is above its moving averages, the broader bias is bullish, so SOL should be positioned for a breakout to new all-time highs in the coming months.

Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of POL to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the POL price to record a maximum price of $13.01. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, POL. This raises the question: Can POL’s price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

POLUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but currently hovers around 47, showing that bears are aiming to control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. POL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour POL price chart suggests POL continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.6, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL’s price successfully breaks above $0.2662, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2985. POLUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2130, resulting in a correction to $0.1650. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is the POL price down today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price faced increased bullish pressure around the $0.25 level. However, lack of buying demand around higher levels resulted in a bearish pressure. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option.

We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.22 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.27 in October. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction October 2025 $0.22 $0.27 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

XRP spot ETF launch delayed by SEC operational pause, stalling ETF-driven inflows. Technical analysis shows consolidation between $2.60–$3.20; a confirmed move above $3.20 suggests bullish continuation.

XRP spot ETF delayed by SEC shutdown; watch $3.20 confirmation and $3.90–$4.60 breakout targets. Read analysis and next steps. XRP faces ETF delays from the SEC shutdown while Elliott Wave charts show bullish breakout potential, keeping traders watchful of momentum. XRP’s spot ETF launch remains stalled as the SEC shutdown delays approvals, leaving investors balancing regulation risks and market momentum. Elliott Wave analysis shows XRP consolidating between $2.60 and $3.20 with bullish targets eyeing $3.90 and $4.60 on breakout strength. Market confidence in XRP now depends on both regulatory clarity and bullish confirmation, highlighting execution as the driver of growth. What is causing the XRP spot ETF delay? XRP spot ETF approvals are delayed because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scaled back operations during the government shutdown on October 1, 2025. The pause prevents the SEC from completing approvals, leaving spot ETF listings on hold until regulators resume full capacity. How does the SEC shutdown affect ETF launches? The shutdown halts active review and finalization of ETF listings. Journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that the Teucrium $XRP ETF structure involved Treasuries and swap receivables and was registered differently; however, spot ETFs require explicit SEC approval under the 33 Act. Industry observers, including Chad Steingraber, pointed out procedural deadlines that resulted in automatic allowance for some filings, but overall clarity and active approvals remain suspended. Technical outlook: Where could XRP move next? Analysts using Elliott Wave and pattern analysis see XRP trading in a triangular consolidation range between $2.60 and $3.20. A confirmed close above $3.20 is widely viewed as the first bullish confirmation and could set targets at $3.90 and $4.60 . What are the support and resistance levels to watch? Key levels identified by technical analysts include support at $2.33–$2.60 and resistance/confirmation near $3.20. A corrective dip toward $2.33 remains possible, but a validated breakout would shift momentum in favor of buyers. XRP key price levels and targets Level Role Comment $2.33 Lower support Correction risk if wave E completes $2.60–$3.20 Consolidation Triangle formation; watch for breakdown or breakout $3.20 Buy confirmation Close above signals bullish continuation $3.90 / $4.60 Targets Measured breakout objectives from Elliott Wave analysis Why are traders balancing regulation and momentum? Regulatory uncertainty can mute ETF-driven capital flows even when technical setups look constructive. Traders therefore monitor both SEC operational status and price confirmation levels to gauge potential inflows and execution risk. How should traders manage risk while waiting? Traders typically use staged entries and clear stop levels: 1) Wait for a daily close above $3.20 for confirmation; 2) Use a protective stop below the $2.60 support zone; 3) Size positions according to volatility and regulatory news flow. Source: DustyBC Crypto Frequently Asked Questions Will the SEC shutdown permanently block XRP spot ETFs? No. The shutdown pauses active approvals but does not represent a policy rejection. Approvals resume when the SEC operates normally and completes its review processes. When should traders expect clarity on ETF timelines? Timelines depend on the duration of the shutdown and the SEC’s backlog. Market participants should plan for updates once the agency resumes full activity and posts formal notices. Key Takeaways Regulatory pause: The SEC shutdown delays spot ETF approvals and stalls ETF-driven inflows. Technical setup: XRP consolidates between $2.60–$3.20; a daily close above $3.20 would be a bullish trigger. Actionable plan: Monitor SEC status, confirm breakout above $3.20, and manage risk with stops near $2.60. Conclusion Execution, not speculation, will determine XRP’s near-term trajectory. While the SEC shutdown delays potential spot ETF launches, Elliott Wave and pattern analysis show clear breakout levels to monitor. Traders should wait for regulatory clarity and technical confirmation before increasing exposure.

Brazil's Largest Investment Bank's Crypto Arm Names 5 Token Picks,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/04/investing-in-uptober-brazil-s-largest-investment-bank-s-crypto-arm-names-5-token-picks,"Brazil’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual’s crypto platform Mynt, has flagged five cryptocurrencies it believes are well-positioned for gains in October: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), avalanche (AVAX), and sky (SKY). The picks, outlined in a report authored by Matheus Parizotto and João Galhardo, reflect a broader optimism in the crypto market as U.S. interest rates ease and anticipation builds for new crypto ETFs. Bitcoin remains the dominant institutional pick, with more than $3.5 billion flowing into spot ETFs in September and corporate treasuries adding 43,000 BTC, over $5 billion at current prices. Mynt’s report describes it as a long-term anchor. “For those seeking a long-term pillar in their portfolio, BTC offers liquidity, network security, and a track record of adoption that extends beyond retail investors,” it reads. Ether, it says, continues to lead in on-chain finance. BTG Pactual’s team pointed out the network concentrates the majority of stablecoin volume and real-world asset tokenization projects. Over the last six months, U.S. spot ETFs added $11.3 billion in ETH, while corporate treasuries picked up 816,000 ETH in September alone. To the analysts, these flows show institutional appetite remains elevated. Beyond the top two Solana’s case hinges on speed and cost. The network, BTG Pactual pointed out, processed over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for the third straight month, while its total value locked surpassed $30 billion for the first time in a sign of deepening DeFi liquidity. The analysts added that institutional demand has been increasing with the potential arrival of new spot SOL ETFs, which could lead to greater flows and visibility. “For those seeking exposure to high-performance infrastructure with growing adoption in real-world cases, Solana combines scale, competitive cost, and an accelerating network effect,” the report reads. For AVAX, BTG Pactual highlighted its sharp growth in on-chain activity, noting that daily transactions increased by 46% and stablecoin transfers rose by 421% over the last quarter. The network’s subnet architecture allows enterprises to spin up custom blockchains, boosting real-world use cases, it said. Sky Protocol, the rebranded MakerDAO, rounds out the list. Its stablecoin, USDS, has a circulating supply of nearly $8 billion, and its Sky Savings Rate offers a variable return that’s currently at 4.75%. Coupled with a token buyback program that’s already deployed $77 million, the report is positioning SKY as a revenue-generating DeFi token with long-term potential.",Markets|BTG Pactual|Bitcoin|Ether|Avalanche|Solana|CoinDesk Wealth|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SOL|FIAT|BTG,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 15:51:13

HTX Weekly Listings Recap (9.22–9.29): Broad Gains Across Sectors, ASTER Soars 96% to Lead",https://square.htx.com/perp-dexs-surge-htx-weekly-listings-recap-9-229-29/,"The crypto market continued its upward trajectory over the past week (September 22 – 29), with on-chain trading prominently in the spotlight. According to HTX market data, key sectors including DEX, DeFi, AI, and public blockchains all staged powerful rebounds. Several newly listed tokens rallied rapidly. but the Perpetual DEX (Perp DEX) track was a clear standout. Dexu AI data shows that in September, mindshare for Perp DEXs expanded tenfold, far outpacing all other sectors. Perp DEXs and DeFi: ASTER Soars 96% Weekly ● ASTER (+96%｜Perp DEX): Offering both perpetuals and spot trading on-chain,Aster has quickly captured traders’ attention with features like MEV-free execution and one-click orders. Since its launch, market hype has continued to build, pushing ASTER up 96% over the past week. This makes it the best-performing new listing on HTX and clearly demonstrates the explosive potential of on-chain derivatives. ● BLUE (+60%｜Sui DEX): Bluefin is the largest decentralized spot and derivatives trading platform on the Sui blockchain, backed by Polychain, SIG, Brevan Howard, and other top companies. Bluefin is a leading protocol on Sui, with over $37 billion in total trading volume since its launch in September 2023. ● SNX (+55%｜DeFi): The established synthetic asset protocol Synthetix surged 55% this week. Built on Ethereum in 2018, Synthetix is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol designed to enable the issuance and trading of synthetic assets, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. From a market perspective, DeFi remains one of the most dynamic sectors in crypto, and perpetuals are one of the largest segments within the derivatives landscape. In addition to ASTER, other popular Perp DEX projects that deserve attention include Lighter, Avantis, Extended, and Paradex. SunPerp, a Perp DEX in the TRON ecosystem, is also showing breakout potential. Hot Token Listing Winners——9.22-9.29 2025 AI and Layer 1 Blockchains: SQD and New Listing XPL Stand Out ● SQD (+48%｜AI): As the AI narrative heats up, SQD climbed 48% this week. SQD Network is a decentralized data lake and query engine, designed to deliver high-performance, permissionless data access for developers. ● XPL (+47%｜L1): As a newly listed token on a public blockchain, XPL delivered an impressive weekly gain of 47%.

As the foundational network of the blockchain industry, L1 remains a primary focus for both capital and developers. XPL has quickly captured market attention through its innovative narrative. Meme and Ecosystem Tokens: RATS, BLUM, KAITO Deliver Solid Performance ● RATS (+30%｜BRC20): Amid ongoing excitement in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the BRC20 inscription meme token RATS continued to be driven by community momentum and rose 30% this week, becoming a flagship asset in the BRC20 narrative. BRC-20 is a token standard that defines the rules for creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. ● BLUM (+20%｜TON Ecosystem): Blum is a hybrid exchange within the TON ecosystem, providing access to tokens through gamified Telegram mini-apps. Supporting over 30 chains, Blum allows access to both CEX and DEX tokens on a single platform while offering additional features such as AI navigation, P2P trading, and derivatives trading. ● KAITO (+19%｜InfoFi): Anchored in the information finance (InfoFi) sector, $KAITO empowers decentralized decision-making, allowing token holders to propose and vote on key protocol and algorithm updates.

HTX’s Multi-Sector Coverage: Asset Growth Across the Board Across the week, HTX’s new listings spanned hot sectors including DEXs, DeFi, AI, public blockchains, meme tokens, ecosystems, and InfoFi. The impressive performance of new listings like ASTER and XPL clearly demonstrates HTX’s keen ability to onboard promising projects.

Available to sell at $0.035 and already well over 55% sold out under Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance is drawing attention for all the right reasons. With more than 16,750 owners and up to $16.8 million raised, the project is building something far more durable than hype, a twin lending infrastructure of peer-to-peer and pooled lending, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contracts giving users full control of their assets. In a market where memecoins once dominated, Mutuum Finance is a rare under-$1 cryptocurrency with actual technical sophistication and long-term growth potential. Meme Coins Lose Some Shine as Investor Interest Shifts The once-darling memecoin market is obviously tired now, as the GMCI Memecoin Index sticks at 220, a long way from its 600 price last year amid the speculative frenzy. Tokens like Fartcoin, BONK, and WIF, which were once behind colossal retail interest, are struggling to gain traction these days. Even experienced players such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were unable to revive momentum, indicating a shift in general investor sentiment. While top altcoin indexes have reached new all-time highs since November, the memecoin sector remains overlooked as funds continue to flow into projects that have utility in the real world and tangible value. It is against this background that the vast majority of investors are seeking fundamentally superior alternatives, a phenomenon fueling rising attention towards next-generation Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Reveal Fervent Investor Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees its Stage 6 presale attract investors globally. Demand remains robust, with over 16,750 individuals engaged with over $16.8 million spent already, indicating increasing trust in the long-term destiny of the project and vision. Mutuum Finance Lending & Borrowing Protocol Implementation Mutuum Finance has stated that it is launching its new lending and borrowing protocol , an important new addition to its growing DeFi platform. It will release version V1 of the protocol in Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will introduce a suite of foundational components including liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and others. With ETH and USDT available for lending, borrowing, and collateral from the very beginning, the protocol would be able to provide a strong, quick, and scalable platform for decentralized financial transactions. Dynamic liquidation ratios and live LTV are calculated dynamically to respond to the prevailing market conditions at the moment to enable the protocol to hedge actively against volatility. Reserve multipliers are set between 10% on lower risk assets and 35% on higher risk assets to provide a degree of systemic insurance. Efficiency is also Mutuum Finance’s top concern. Collateral is maximized to create maximum borrowing capacity and correlated assets are utilized to create lending and borrowing efficiency as flawless as possible. Those structures create low insolvency risk with a safe, sustainable DeFi protocol A Rare Sub-$1 Gem With Real Utility and 100x Potential As the memecoin era ends and investor capital seeks better alternatives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most robust altcoins under $1. Over 16,750 investors have invested more than $16.8 million, and Phase 6 of its presale is already more than 55% sold at just $0.035 per token. The project’s momentum leaves little to chance. Its twin-lending network, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial design set it apart from recent hype tokens, and the forthcoming launch of its lending and borrowing protocol can prove to be a turning point in terms of growth. With the potential to make 50x–100x in the next bull market, MUTM offers early adopters an opportunity to invest in a fundamentally sound DeFi project before the mainstream rush.

If the government reopens within the next few weeks, it shouldn't have too much of an effect on D.C.'s crypto policymaking. The longer the shutdown stretches, however, the more delayed crypto efforts will be. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Waiting for a reboot The narrative The government shut down on Wednesday, and at least as of press time, Democrats and Republicans do not appear to be close to a deal to reopen it. Why it matters As discussed in last week's newsletter , the immediate effects of the shutdown are pretty straightforward: Market structure legislation will likely be delayed, federal agencies' rulemaking will probably be delayed, and new spot crypto exchange-traded funds will not launch as many hoped in the coming days. If the shutdown is just a few days — or potentially as long as two weeks — these efforts should resume pretty seamlessly. If the shutdown goes beyond that, the picture becomes much muddier. Breaking it down The longest U.S. government shutdown in history took place between December 2018 and January 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term. At the time, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives while Republicans controlled the Senate. This latest shutdown is only a few days old as of press time, and could last just a few days or may stretch on further. Perhaps the most immediate and tangible effect of the government shutdown on crypto issues is on exchange-traded funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to allow ETFs tracking the prices of assets like Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) to launch this past week. While there was some movement last week and Monday, the clock ran out before all of the final paperwork could be pushed through, and the issuers have not yet been able to launch . The SEC was able to finalize a pair of no-action letters prior to the shutdown as well. Other agencies, like the IRS, were similarly able to publish interim guidance prior to the shutdown. Ron Hammond, head of Policy and Advocacy at Wintermute, told CoinDesk that, ""It can't be understated how busy the crypto policy developments have been."" With the shutdown, policymakers are in limbo around these types of regulatory actions, he said. On the legislative front, one individual familiar with the dynamics in Washington, D.C. said that they do not expect the timeline for market structure legislation to change much should the shutdown end within the next two weeks or so. While lawmakers are looking to hold a possible markup — a hearing where lawmakers debate bills before potentially voting to advance them to the full Senate (or House) — by Oct. 20, 2025, this seems unlikely, regardless of when the shutdown ends, given they are still working on the text of the bill. Another individual familiar with these dynamics said an additional complicating factor for lawmakers and their staffers is the fact that the regulatory agencies they might consult with are currently furloughed, so the lawmakers writing the market structure bill won't be able to receive feedback or answers to any questions they might have for these federal regulators. Hammond said that December ""is still feasible"" for moving legislation through Congress at the moment. ""The longer this shutdown drags on, the more partisan bitterness seeps into the necessary bipartisan discourse on important topics like crypto market structure,"" Hammond said. ""Still, this shutdown drama isn't affecting our calculus on odds of market structure legislation chances of passing being more probable than not before the 2026 election ramps up."" Hammond said he was watching to see if a markup in the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees by Thanksgiving. This week This week There are no hearings or events being held by lawmakers this week around crypto.

This move comes as the American crypto exchange seeks to expand its payment operations amid the rise of favorable crypto policy in the US. Coinbase Does Not Aim To Be A Bank, VP Says By definition, the National Trust Charter is a federal charter that allows an institution to operate as a national trust bank. Unlike full-service commercial banks, these types of banks are usually non-depository institutions with their primary activity being limited to fiduciary and trust service, and custody and asset management. Therefore, this license is particularly attractive to many crypto firms that want to offer trust-type services (e.g., custody of digital assets, stablecoin reserves) at scale and across jurisdictions in the US. However, Coinbase’s focus is on the fiduciary status the license offers. The exchange has expressed its intentions to expand its services beyond custody towards payments and other services, while also denying any intention to morph into a bank. Coinbase’s VP of Institutional Product, Greg Tusar, explained in a blog post saying: Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security. If approved, the charter would continue to open up opportunities for Coinbase to launch new products beyond custody, including payments and related services, with the confidence of regulatory clarity, fostering broader institutional adoption. Tusar has described Coinbase’s application for a national trust charter as a “significant step” in growing the exchange’s business operations and encouraging innovation in the mainstream adoption of crypto assets. The exchange exec. said: While progress is underway in Congress to craft clear market structure, crypto is already woven into the fabric of the financial system. An OCC charter will streamline oversight for new offerings and enable continued innovation to integrate digital assets into traditional finance. We’re not the first crypto company to seek a federal charter and we won’t be the last. Aside from Coinbase, Other crypto firms that have filed similar applications with the OCC include blockchain company Ripple Labs and stablecoin operator Paxos. Coinbase Payments Push In addition to seeking a national trust charter, Coinbase has taken other steps to force a venture into the payment markets. In June, the exchange popularly struck a deal with Shopify , which would allow the e-commerce platform to introduce the USDC stablecoin as part of its payment options. At press time, COIN trades at $382 following a slight 2.14% gain in the past day.",Coinbase|coinbase|COINUSDT|Greg Tusar|national trust charter|OCC|Paxos|ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 16:00:35

A supposed shareholder letter circulating online drew attention for its bold claims, but was widely criticized for obvious inconsistencies. Rather than reflecting Garlinghouse’s polished communication style, it contained misspellings, awkward phrasing, and formatting errors. Prominent community commentator Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem was among the first to question the document’s authenticity. She stressed that Garlinghouse’s official communications are always precise and eloquent, and that no legitimate shareholder letter would contain such mistakes. Re: the SWIFT comment to shareholder letter. @bgarlinghouse writes eloquently, with excellent vocabulary, and proper punctuation. A communication to shareholders would not have misspelled words. Is this letter circulating a poorly written third party transcript? Or just fake?… — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) October 4, 2025 Her observations raised the possibility that the text was either a clumsy transcript of remarks or an outright fabrication, prompting wider scrutiny from analysts and researchers. How the Memo Spread The document did not come from Ripple’s verified channels or Garlinghouse’s official accounts. Instead, it appeared through independent commentators and was circulated across social media without clear attribution. That lack of provenance was a significant red flag, given Ripple’s highly controlled process for shareholder communication. Why Experts Say It’s Fake Analysts examining the text have pointed to numerous flaws inconsistent with Ripple’s corporate standards. The uneven punctuation, typographical errors, and uncharacteristic phrasing suggest Ripple’s investor-relations team didn’t produce it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shareholder communications linked to major industry developments, such as SWIFT’s blockchain initiatives , undergo rigorous internal review. Experts believe the document is likely either a poorly transcribed version of a real statement or a deliberate forgery, rather than an authentic one. A Familiar Problem in the XRP Space The XRP community has faced repeated attempts to spread misinformation through impersonation. Over the past year, deepfake videos of Ripple executives, hacked social media accounts, and fabricated announcements have circulated widely, often timed to coincide with market-moving news. The “shareholder letter” fits this pattern, exploiting Ripple’s prominence and Garlinghouse’s credibility to influence sentiment. To stay informed, community members should rely on official channels: Ripple’s website, press releases, or Garlinghouse’s verified channels.

On-chain metrics continue to show Shiba Inu investors liquidating their funds and investing in an emerging PayFi, which is tagged the new ‘New Shiba Inu’. This new project is called Remittix (RTX), and it’s built on the Ethereum blockchain to revolutionize the crypto-to-fiat payment utility space. Let’s talk about why Shiba Inu investors are diversifying, Remittix’s launch, and its potential. Shiba Inu’s Rise To Fame And Decline Although launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) surprised critics with its strong community and ever-expanding ecosystem. The ecosystem has built many applications, such as ShibaSwap, NFTs, and its own Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. Shiba Inu made many investors millionaires; however, as SHIB continues to establish itself, its large market cap has made it hard to recreate such a price surge again. Analysts believe this decline is due to the broader loss of interest in the meme coin sector.

Big names like Dogecoin and Solana are still drawing capital, but a newcomer, Little Pepe, is quietly stacking numbers that hint at far greater upside. Here’s how each project positions itself and why one could realistically deliver 45x gains. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Energy With Real Tech Underneath Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another token riding Ethereum’s coattails. It’s building its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network that handles transactions cheaply and at scale. Think of it as a meme coin with the backbone of a serious blockchain. The presale tells the story. With a hard cap of 100 billion tokens, 26.5 billion are set aside for early buyers. Stage 13 is live at $0.0022; more than 16.15 billion tokens have already been sold, pulling in $26.36 million. Stage 14 will tick up to $0.0023, a 120% jump from the starting price of $0.001. Early participants have already locked in triple-digit paper gains before a single exchange listing. Every presale round has increased the price. Stage 1 raised $500K at $0.001, Stage 2 climbed to $0.0011 for $1.325 million, Stage 3 reached $0.0012 for $2.5 million, creating a built-in momentum machine that rewards early conviction. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Little Pepe isn’t just relying on hype. Its feature set is designed to solve real issues in the meme coin space. There’s zero trading tax, so holders keep every bit of their gains. Sniper-bot protection ensures a fairer launch and less manipulation, and staking functionality enables long-term investors to earn passive income. Yet the most interesting element is the Meme Launchpad, an incubator that natively enables emerging meme projects to launch within the Little Pepe ecosystem. With DAO-based governance, NFT integration, and cross-chain compatibility on the roadmap in the future, the project is building foundations that could extend far beyond its current Layer 2 focus. To keep the community buzzing, the team has stacked giveaways. The headline is a $777,000 presale prize pool , with ten winners taking home $77,000 each, and a minimum buy-in of just $100. A separate Mega Giveaway across Stages 12–17 adds over 15 ETH in rewards, split between top buyers and random participants. Few meme projects have aggressively combined hype, utility, and incentive structures. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Giant Faces New Challenges Dogecoin still holds cultural sway, but its momentum has certainly slowed. DOGE has not returned to the heights of around $0.74, and subsequent corrections in 2025 have tempered investors’ expectations. All that could change with the recently launched Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, which could introduce institutional money into the picture and potentially drive DOGE to $0.40 or even $1. Still, the days of 100x returns are likely behind it. As the meme coin landscape shifts toward projects with stronger utility and more robust ecosystems, Dogecoin’s once-unassailable throne looks more vulnerable than ever. Solana (SOL): The Backbone of DeFi’s Next Wave Solana remains one of the most essential blockchains in the Web3 space and for good reason. It can process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost and become the go-to network for lending platforms, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi protocols. If adoption keeps climbing at the current pace, analysts predict a price range of $500–$750 by 2030, particularly as institutional capital continues to pour in. Solana’s Firedancer will continue to enhance stability, solidifying Solana as a foundational layer for the next generation of dApps. Bottom Line Dogecoin and Solana offer proven ecosystems and the comfort of established networks, but their upside is capped. Little Pepe , still priced at just $0.0022, sits where past giants once stood, early, hungry, and built to scale. If its Layer-2 tech, launchpad, and aggressive presale strategy keep gaining traction, a 45x move isn’t a fantasy. The window to grab LILPEPE under a quarter of a cent is barely open for investors chasing the next breakout before the market wakes up.

While momentum remains strongly bullish, the market is still exposed to a brief pullback toward $114K–$118K to rebalance before any potential continuation toward new highs. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has continued its upward expansion, breaking through the mid-range resistance and invalidating the prior descending structure that defined September’s price action. The breakout was followed by a rapid move into the upper boundary of the macro range, likely targeting the buy-side liquidity just above the all-time high around $124K. The price is now holding above the breakout level around $116K–$118K, with the previous decision point at $112K–$114K serving as key support in case of a retracement. Holding above this zone maintains the bullish structure, keeping the $124K–$125K region, where the next liquidity pool sits, as the primary upside target. Momentum indicators, however, suggest the potential for a short-term corrective move before continuation, allowing the market to build a healthier base for another impulsive leg higher. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The recent surge from the $108K demand zone triggered an impulsive rally that left behind several unmitigated areas of interest. The breaker block at $115K–$117K and the Fibonacci retracement cluster between $114.4K and $113.1K now mark the nearest re-entry zones for buyers. A controlled pullback toward these levels would likely attract renewed demand for continuation toward $124K, where the next major buy-side liquidity cluster lies. If price maintains its current momentum, a sweep above $124K could occur before a corrective phase, aligning with the broader bullish expansion structure as long as the market holds above $111K–$112K. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin’s open interest on Binance has reached a new record, edging past the August peak of $14.306B. This surge coincides with the latest rally, as BTC has climbed from $108K to $124K, while open interest has expanded from $11.5B to $14.3B in just a few weeks. The parallel rise in both price and open interest confirms that the move has been powered by fresh inflows and new position openings, rather than a short-covering squeeze. This expansion highlights strong conviction from traders on both sides, with institutional and retail participation adding depth to the market. However, the sheer scale of leverage now in play introduces risk. Elevated open interest often acts as a double-edged sword: it can amplify upside moves as trapped shorts unwind, but it can just as quickly trigger liquidation cascades if price momentum stalls. For now, the structure favors continuation, with BTC pressing into new liquidity zones between $125K and $130K. Yet, the danger lies in the market’s fragility. If Bitcoin fails to extend higher and consolidates while open interest stays elevated, the likelihood of a sharp flush grows, potentially dragging price back toward key demand zones before the broader bullish trend resumes. In short, record-high open interest reflects both confidence and vulnerability. Traders should closely watch whether open interest continues rising or starts to unwind, as this will determine if the next leg extends smoothly into $130K or if a leverage-driven shakeout interrupts the rally.

Bitcoin tops $123,000 JPMorgan projects a potential target near $165,000; market views remain mixed. Ethereum rose ~9% to $4,500; analysts cite institutional inflows and macro risk as drivers.

Bitcoin has climbed above $123,000 driven by increased institutional interest, macro uncertainty tied to a U.S. government shutdown, and momentum from ETF inflows. Market participants cite both fundamental demand and short-term liquidity dynamics as contributors to the rapid advance. How credible is JPMorgan’s $165,000 projection? JPMorgan analysts argue Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to gold and could reach near $165,000 by late 2025 driven by institutional allocation. This view rests on models comparing digital scarcity to gold and assumes steady inflows from large financial players. Why do some analysts call the move a “liquidity wave”? Alex Blume of Two Prime described the rally as a “liquidity wave,” suggesting short-term capital and trading flows may amplify prices without sustained retail or institutional demand. In this scenario, price action can retrace quickly if liquidity conditions shift. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin's Uptober rally"", ""description"": ""Steps for investors to evaluate whether the Uptober rally is sustainable or a temporary liquidity-driven move."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check institutional signals"", ""text"": ""Review reports and filings referencing institutional allocations and ETF flows for sustained demand indicators."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor macro drivers"", ""text"": ""Assess macro events such as government shutdowns, currency weakness, and rate expectations that can increase crypto demand."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Analyze on-chain data—exchange flows, large-wallet accumulation, and active addresses—to differentiate liquidity spikes from genuine accumulation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Set risk management parameters"", ""text"": ""Define stop-loss levels and position sizing in case the rally proves transient; prepare for volatility when liquidity fades."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bitcoin’s rise above $123,000 a new bull market?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Not necessarily; the price rise may signal the start of a sustained bull run if institutional inflows continue, but it can also be a short-lived liquidity-driven spike."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What risks could stop Bitcoin’s momentum?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key risks include a reversal in liquidity conditions, unfavorable regulatory actions, rapid interest-rate moves, or a sharp drop in ETF inflows."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How are altcoins responding to Bitcoin’s move?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Ethereum and many large-cap altcoins have rallied alongside Bitcoin; Ethereum rose roughly 9% to around $4,500 as of the latest trading session."" } } ]} When might the rally become a sustainable bull run? For a sustainable bull market, Bitcoin prices must be supported by persistent demand across multiple channels: continued institutional allocations, steady retail participation, and improving on-chain adoption metrics. Confirmation typically requires price holding key support levels and consistent net inflows over several weeks. What does Ethereum’s move tell us about market breadth? Ethereum’s ~9% weekly gain to $4,500 indicates broader market participation beyond Bitcoin. Strong moves in large-cap altcoins often suggest increased risk appetite and can support the narrative that the rally has participation across crypto sectors. Frequently Asked Questions How high could Bitcoin go this year according to major banks? JPMorgan has a target scenario near $165,000 by year-end, based on relative value versus gold and expected institutional flows. These are analytical projections, not guaranteed outcomes. What should traders watch during Uptober? Monitor liquidity measures, ETF flows, macro headlines (e.g., government actions, rate expectations), and on-chain indicators to gauge whether gains are demand-driven or liquidity-driven. Key Takeaways Bitcoin moved above $123,000 : This level is the immediate pivot for bulls and bears. Institutional outlook is supportive : JPMorgan projects potential upside, reinforcing institutional narratives. Risks remain : Analysts warn some gains may be liquidity-driven; risk management is essential. Conclusion Bitcoin’s Uptober rally—pushing prices above $123,000—reflects a complex mix of institutional interest, macro uncertainty, and short-term liquidity dynamics. While projections such as JPMorgan’s $165,000 target add bullish context, caution from market experts reminds investors to weigh on-chain data and liquidity signals.

He noted that the heads of the SEC and Bank of England, along with BlackRock’s CEO, have all signaled that digital assets could reshape payments and securities markets. Hougan added that this narrative resonates strongly with investors who understand the scale of change such technologies could bring. Hougan said that once audiences begin to consider how to gain exposure to blockchain, comparisons between platforms inevitably follow. In that evaluation, he argued, Solana’s combination of speed, throughput and near-instant finality makes it “extraordinarily attractive.” He cited improvements from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds in settlement speed, describing the feature as intuitive for those accustomed to trading environments where execution and latency are critical. Framing Solana as “the new Wall Street,” Hougan said the blockchain’s technical edge is resonating with market participants. He said the narrative is “really resonant” and added that “you’ll see substantial flows.” Technical Analysis of SOL's Price Action According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session from Oct. 3 at 15:00 UTC to Oct. 4 at 14:00 UTC, SOL traded within a narrow $8.40 range between $228.19 and $237.04, reflecting a period of consolidation. The high was set at $237.04 around 16:00 on Oct. 3 before steady selling pressure pushed the price lower toward the $228–$229 area, which acted as support. Trading activity was strongest early in the session, with volumes peaking at 3.29 million units around 17:00, but gradually declined to just 42,637 by the closing hour of the analysis period. This sharp reduction in volume suggested weakening participation and a potential pause before a larger directional move. In the final 60 minutes, from 13:11 to 14:10 UTC on Oct. 4, SOL broke below the established $228–$229 support zone. Prices fell from $229.84 to $228.94, a 0.39% drop that confirmed the bearish shift. Within this window, the market showed two phases: an early rebound attempt that briefly lifted the price to $229.78 at 13:38, followed by renewed selling that drove the token down to $228.72. Importantly, this breakdown coincided with a surge in volume. The single busiest minute occurred at 14:01, when 18,011 units traded — the highest one-minute reading of the session. This pattern of falling price alongside rising volume suggested larger sellers were active, potentially increasing the likelihood that bearish momentum continues.

Little Pepe (LILPEPE) built on Ethereum is not just another meme coin. It has already climbed more than 120% from its starting presale price and is currently offering about 36.36% projected gains before its public launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, having raised an impressive $26.37 million out of a $28.77 million target. A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

A recent forecast by a prominent figure in the crypto space that BTC is likely to hit $1 million has just been backed by professional stock trader. Million-dollar mark is possible for Bitcoin, Russian financier agrees The value of Bitcoin can reach, and even exceed $1 million by 2030, at the earliest, or sometime before 2035. That’s according to Russian financial analyst Oleg Reshetnikov. Reshetnikov, an expert on stock markets at BCS group, one of Russia’s oldest and largest providers of investment services, remarked that his assessment was still theoretical, but, nevertheless, based on stats. He was commenting on this week’s bullish prediction by Pavel Durov, founder and owner of the popular among crypto enthusiasts messenger Telegram. In an interview with American computer scientist and YouTube podcaster Lex Fridman, Durov revealed he bought Bitcoin early, admitting his BTC investments kept him afloat in challenging times. The Russian-born tech entrepreneur emphasized he didn’t care when BTC was falling and didn’t stop buying when it was up. He also stated: “I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” Durov suggested looking at the trends, especially with respect to “governments printing money like no tomorrow,” when Bitcoin has a predictable inflation that will eventually stop. Sharing his thoughts on the scenario outlined by Durov with the leading Russian online news website Gazeta.ru, Oleg Reshetnikov concurred: “One can indeed conclude that the price of Bitcoin, given its limited supply, could reach $1 million at some point, especially when compared to money printed by governments and subject to inflation.” Dogging the US for inflating the Greenback The Russian analyst gave an example with the United States, where money supply has grown almost fivefold since the year 2000, from $4.7 trillion to $21.9 trillion. Over the same period, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.5 times. According to Reshetnikov, for money to function as a means of payment, a 2.5-fold increase in the money supply, or even less, would have been sufficient. He is convinced there is a good reason to believe that money supply may continue its growth, whether linear or not. This will also be a factor determining how long it would take for Bitcoin to reach $1 million, the financial specialist noted, elaborating further: “In an ideal world, if the dollar’s purchasing power halves, the price of Bitcoin, whose supply is limited, should double. But in reality, this increase could be greater or lesser.” A lot will depend on how much investors believe in the cryptocurrency as a store of value and how much of their wealth they are willing to invest in it, Reshetnikov pondered in conclusion. BTC is currently trading at over $122,000, at the time of writing, after rebounding from a September low of below $109,000 per coin. In his conversation with Fridman, Pavel Durov was certain Bitcoin is here to stay, while he pointed out it’s yet to be seen if that will be the case with most fiat currencies that exist today. Attitudes regarding Bitcoin have been changing in his native Russia, where a business advisor to the Kremlin recently likened cryptocurrency to gold, stating it’s already just as stable. Durov left the country more than a decade ago. He did that under increased pressure from Russian authorities over refusing to censor content on his popular social media platform VK (Vkontakte), which had been effectively taken over by allies of the Putin administration. Last year, he found himself arrested in France, where he is still dealing with a legal case based on accusations of complicity with crimes allegedly enabled by his messaging app. Durov told Fridman he faced similar requests from the French government regarding Telegram channels during election campaigns in Romania and Moldova, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan.

The early-day investors who saw $200 turn into $5,000 have largely exited that window. Newer entrants in 2025 are looking at high-utility early-stage projects and still provide explosive upside. A crypto that already provides such an opportunity is Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a meme coin that has a real-life blockchain application. Having sold a record presale and increasing token price, Little Pepe is coming out as a top choice. Little Pepe: Ethereum Layer 2, Zero Tax, Staking, and DAO Governance Little Pepe is an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain with a combination of meme culture and real utility. The project features staking rewards, voting in the DAO, and launching memes, and zero taxation is applied to the trading. Future integrations are NFTs and cross-chain compatibility, expanding its possible application. The LILPEPE ecosystem will be designed to ensure that there is a balance between liquidity, reserves, staking, marketing and CEX preparedness with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. $26.3M raised so far: a clear presale trajectory Since launching its presale on June 10, Little Pepe has advanced through 13 stages, steadily increasing in value. Stage 1 began at $0.001, with subsequent stages climbing by $0.0001 per phase. By Stage 13, now active, the token price has reached $0.0022. To date, $26,382,101 has been raised out of a $28,775,000 target. A total of 16,162,317,775 tokens have already been sold from the 17,250,000,000 allocation. Stage 14 will introduce yet another uptick at $0.0023, which will be a 130% increase compared to the price of Stage 1. This continued flow has placed early investors near breakeven or gaining even before the presale ends, thus showing strong momentum and interest. $777,000 giveaway now live for presale contributors A $777,000 giveaway is currently live to celebrate the presale. Ten winners will receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. To enter, participants must contribute at least $100 to the ongoing presale. The promotion is active during presale stages only and also includes random big buyer rewards (15+ ETH) between Stages 12 and 17. Little Pepe presents a new investment window that mirrors the early Solana days. The project shows actual blockchain value with a fast-moving presale, the Layer 2 architecture, zero tax on trading, staking, governance of the project through DAOs, and future NFTs. According to the present momentum and tokenomics, LILPEPE has all the potential to become one of the most successful crypto assets in 2025.

The analyst suggested that XRP’s price could rally to double digits once this rally occurs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $19 As It Completes Double-Bottom Pattern In an X post, Bobby indicated that the XRP price has completed the macro double-bottom pattern, which it had spent over seven years building. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the altcoin is now gearing up for a rally to as high as $19 following the completion of this consolidation pattern. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces 25% Drawdown Risk, But This Technical Point Is Key Meanwhile, the analyst noted that the XRP price spent over nine months building support near the neckline of the massive W pattern. He added that the altcoin spent the same amount of time consolidating below the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of its latest macro swing high to swing low. Bobby indicated that the XRP price rally will begin once it breaks through $3.02 and gains monthly acceptance above that level. He expects this move to take XRP into the take-profit levels he has highlighted on several occasions. These levels include $4.7, $6.4, $7.4, and possibly $19, all of which mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the altcoin. The analyst also predicts that the XRP ETFs could spark a rally to between $8 and $13 with possible wicks into the $20 range. These funds are expected to launch this month, depending on when the U.S. government shutdown ends. They provided a bullish outlook for XRP due to the amount of inflows that they could drive into the altcoin’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bobby had also earlier alluded to previous cycles as the reason XRP could rally to $13. Analyst Sounds Warning To Bulls Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned XRP bulls that the XRP price needs to close above $3.13 to $3.20 on the 3-day chart to sustain the current bullish momentum. His warning followed XRP’s reclaim of the psychological $3 level, which he noted has wrecked the bears. However, the altcoin needs to close above this range, or the bulls are also in danger of getting wrecked. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could follow suit if Bitcoin and Ethereum get rejected on their current rallies. He added that the altcoin could head lower, which he believes might actually be better. He assured that the last impulsive move would be explosive and could lead to life-changing gains for the bulls. However, for now, he believes that XRP is simply ranging until it closes above $3.20. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This week, the spotlight spreads across three very different narratives: the WLFi (WLFI) app launch, Solana’s massive (SOL) whale move, and BlockDAG’s explosive presale momentum. WLFi is rolling out a retail app and debit card that ties its stablecoin USD1 to Apple Pay, promising to merge everyday payments with investing. Solana, meanwhile, is caught in the wake of an $836M whale transfer that could push price back to $200 before any rebound. Then there’s BlockDAG , the project that has raised nearly $420 million, shipped over 20,000 miners, and secured whale confidence with single buys of $4.4M and $3.6M. With Dashboard V4 giving presale participants transparency and DAG-based technology promising 15,000 TPS, BlockDAG is already viewed by many as the best crypto for 2025. WLFi App Launch Targets Payments And Investing At Korea Blockchain Week, co-founder Zak Folkman revealed details of the WLFi (WLFI) app launch, confirming it will connect USD1 stablecoin with Apple Pay. The goal is simple: make crypto payments seamless for everyday users. Folkman described the platform as “Venmo meets Robinhood,” combining peer-to-peer transfers with trading features. The WLFi (WLFI) app launch reflects a shift toward practical adoption rather than speculation. By staying blockchain-agnostic, WLFi avoids building its own chain and instead focuses on flexibility across networks. This design should expand compatibility, but it also means reliance on external infrastructure. If successful, it could bring stablecoins into mainstream finance. Solana Whale Move Signals Pressure The biggest market mover this week comes from a massive Solana (SOL) whale move, with over 2.5 million SOL worth $836M transferred to exchanges. Such inflows usually imply selling pressure, putting SOL’s $214–$220 support at risk. Technical signals back this cautious view: the DMI shows +D crossing below -D with ADX at 31, a pattern that has historically preceded sharp declines. Analysts now warn of a possible retest at $200 before any rebound toward $260–$270. At the same time, on-chain activity is weakening. Daily Active Addresses fell 27% in a week, undercutting confidence in long-term sustainability. Weighted sentiment has also turned negative, reflecting skepticism among traders. Still, derivatives show funding rates slightly positive, meaning some bulls remain committed. BlockDAG Explodes With Miners, Whales, & Breakthrough Tech While WLFi experiments with fintech tools and Solana contends with whale-driven volatility, BlockDAG is transforming momentum into measurable adoption, growing as the best crypto for 2025. The project has already raised almost $420 million in its presale, with coins priced at $0.0015 in Batch 30 and a confirmed $0.05 listing. This setup offers early participants a staggering 3,200% potential upside, a rarity in today’s market. Adoption is accelerating at scale. More than 20,000 X-Series miners have been shipped worldwide across 130+ countries, embedding Proof-of-Work security into everyday environments. Backing this physical expansion is deep-pocketed whale conviction. Single purchases of $4.4M and $3.6M have reshaped BlockDAG’s leaderboard, demonstrating strong market sentiment in the project’s long-term vision. On the software side, Dashboard V4 elevates the presale experience with exchange-style tools, including live charts, simulated order books, referral leaderboards, and gamified engagement. This focus on transparency and usability strengthens trust ahead of mainnet. At its technological core, BlockDAG employs a multi-parent DAG architecture capable of handling 2,000–15,000 transactions per second. By merging Proof-of-Work with Proof-of-Engagement, the network achieves both scalability and decentralization, addressing challenges that hinder many blockchain rivals. This trifecta of miner adoption, whale backing, and advanced technology places BlockDAG far beyond typical presale hype. Analysts increasingly argue that BlockDAG isn’t just another competitor but a proven project establishing itself as a frontrunner for the best crypto for 2025. Final Say! This week’s developments highlight how adoption, whales, and invention define crypto’s next wave. The WLFi (WLFI) app launch signals a push toward everyday usability, though execution against fintech competitors will be the test. The Solana (SOL) whale move reminds traders how quickly sentiment can shift under the weight of big transfers, leaving price action fragile but with potential for rebound. Then there’s BlockDAG, where a nearly $420 million presale, 20,000 miners shipped, whale buys, and DAG technology are all aligning into a credible growth story. For investors weighing the best crypto for 2025, the contrasts are clear. WLFi promises usability, Solana battles whale-induced volatility, and BlockDAG already delivers adoption and transparency. With its mix of miners, whales, and tech, BlockDAG looks less like a presale gamble and more like a long-term competitor ready to shine.

Sources told news outlets that users will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) inside the app, a move that would expand OnePay’s lineup of financial services beyond savings and cards. OnePay To Add Crypto Trading Reports have disclosed that the crypto functions will be powered through a tie-up with Zerohash, a firm that provides custody and settlement services for digital assets. That suggests OnePay will rely on outside infrastructure rather than build all systems itself. OnePay was launched in 2021 and is majority owned by Walmart, with early backing from Ribbit Capital, and the company has been steadily rolling out banking features since then. Partnerships And Product Plans OnePay is working with Synchrony to relaunch Walmart’s credit card offerings, and Reuters reported a Synchrony announcement dated June 9, 2025, about card programs set to return this fall. The app also aims to offer savings accounts and buy-now, pay-later options alongside the new crypto window. Users may be given the ability to convert crypto to fiat and then use those funds for purchases in Walmart stores or to pay card balances, though the exact mechanics have not been fully detailed by company spokespeople. How Much Will Users Get Access To At First? Several outlets suggest OnePay will start with the two largest tokens, BTC and ETH, rather than a long list of coins. Limits, fees and state availability were not disclosed in the reports, and those details could change before any public launch. Sources said the rollout is expected sometime later in 2025, with the credit card program arriving in fall 2025, but no firm launch date for crypto trading has been announced. Regulatory Hurdles And Timing Regulators at the state and federal level are actively watching crypto offerings from consumer apps, and compliance requirements could shape how quickly OnePay moves. Based On reports, the company has not publicly filed detailed disclosures tied to the crypto service, and both Walmart and OnePay declined to comment to reporters. That leaves open the possibility of a phased release, restricted to certain users or states at first. What This Means For Shoppers And Users If the plan proceeds, Walmart customers who already use OnePay could gain another way to access BTC and ETH without signing up for a separate crypto exchange. Analysts and users will be watching fees, protections for deposits, and whether the app allows spending crypto directly in stores or requires conversion first.

During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

Solana faces a weakening $230 resistance due to realized profits and low rotational flow. Key risk: $200–$220 long clusters could trigger a retest of $200 if bids fail to hold.

Solana resistance analysis: Solana resistance at $230 is weakening amid heavy profit-taking and clustered longs; read our data-driven breakdown and what traders should watch. Read more. What is causing Solana’s $230 resistance to weaken? Solana resistance around $230 is weakening because large profit realization and a lack of rotational buying reduced bid support. On-chain indicators show concentrated long liquidity and realized losses that increase downside vulnerability while buyers reassess risk around the $200–$230 band. How could SOL move before the next leg up? SOL could retest $200 if the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed. Short-term dynamics: a sell-off clears weak hands, potentially enabling a later push toward $250–$300, but only if bulls re-establish $200 as firm support and rotational flow returns. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana resistance at $230 weakens as heavy profit-taking and long clusters accumulate"", ""description"": ""Solana resistance at $230 is weakening; on-chain data shows large realized profits and long liquidity clustered in $200–$220, raising retest risk to $200."", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SOLUSDT_2025-10-04_13-14-25.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T13:14:25Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T13:14:25Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/solana-resistance-230-analysis"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess Solana $230 resistance and $200 support"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks analysts use to evaluate Solana resistance at $230 and downside risk to $200."", ""image"": ""https://COINOTAG.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SOLUSDT_2025-10-04_13-14-25.png"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check realized profit/loss metrics"", ""text"": ""Review realized profit data to see where large profits were taken; recent moves show ~ $1.03 billion realized near $234."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Locate long liquidity clusters"", ""text"": ""Identify long clusters between $200–$220; $200 million in overexposed longs increases retest risk."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor NRPL and supply distribution"", ""text"": ""Watch NRPL flips and supply concentration at key price levels (5% supply at $224 noted) to gauge capitulation potential."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm support with on-chain bids"", ""text"": ""Validate whether $200 holds with order-book bids and renewed rotational flow before positioning for a higher target."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana resistance at $230 breaking?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Solana resistance near $230 is weakening due to profit-taking and absent rotational bids; a retest of $200 is possible if $200–$220 long clusters are flushed."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much SOL was realized around the recent top?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Approximately $1.03 billion worth of SOL was taken off the table around $234, equating to roughly 4.4 million SOL changing hands."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain signals should traders monitor?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders should monitor NRPL, realized loss metrics, long liquidity clusters in the $200–$220 band, and supply concentration at $224 to assess risk."" } } ]} Solana’s $200 support tested by heavy long positioning So far, Solana has been the most exposed to capitulation risk. NRPL flipped red at the back end of September as price broke below $224, triggering roughly $1.7 billion in realized losses and accelerating sell-side pressure. Massive profit-taking followed the run-up: on 2 October, nearly $1.03 billion in SOL were realized around $234, meaning approximately 4.4 million SOL changed hands. The immediate reaction pushed SOL down to $228 (about -2.5%), showing the resistance wall at $230 struggled to absorb selling. On-chain distribution matters: around 5% of supply remains clustered at $224. With $200 million in overexposed longs concentrated in the $200–$220 range, the risk of a move toward $200 remains material if bids fail. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) The market is shrugging off rotational bids, and on-chain data shows investors avoiding altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index fell four points to 67 at press time, highlighting muted risk appetite and constrained alt flows. After capitulation, SOL bounced ~18.5% off $200, with bulls briefly turning $200 into support and testing $230. But resistance around $230 remains a near-term ceiling unless rotational buying and fresh bids return. Source: Glassnode Frequently Asked Questions Could SOL test $200 again this quarter? Yes. If $230 resistance holds and the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed, SOL could retest $200. A sustained reclaim of $200 by bulls is needed to resume a bullish trajectory toward $250–$300. What on-chain metrics signal capitulation? Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) flips, large realized-loss events (~$1.7 billion in this episode) and concentrated supply at specific price points (e.g., 5% at $224) are classic capitulation signals. Key Takeaways Resistance weakness : Heavy profit-taking near $234 weakened the $230 resistance and removed buying momentum. Support vulnerability : $200 is critical; $200–$220 long clusters ($200M) raise retest risk. Actionable insight : Traders should monitor NRPL, realized volumes, and order-book bids around $200 before adding exposure. Conclusion Solana resistance at $230 is under pressure as realized profits and concentrated long liquidity increase downside risk. Watch on-chain NRPL, realized-loss events and the $200–$220 long cluster for clues; if $200 holds, SOL could clear weak hands and target higher levels in Q4.

Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

Since late September, the OpenAI executive has sought alternative long-term low-cost supplies for his company’s multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. Altman is looking to the Middle East and East Asia to finance the accelerated build-out of his company’s infrastructure. He has so far visited South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan and has met with representatives from Foxconn, TSMC, SK Hynix, and Samsung. Altman previously claimed that his $850 billion OpenAI expansion plan is valid, as reported by Cryptopolitan. He acknowledged that people are worried about his company’s expansion, but emphasized that he is not backing down from the plans. The OpenAI boss said the biggest issue is not chips or money but power. Altman recently led a $500M funding round for fusion firm Helion Energy and helped fission startup Oklo go public through his SPAC. Altman plans to visit the UAE for more AI infrastructure and research funds The tech billionaire has planned a visit to the UAE, where he will meet investors. However, previous discussions are still in the early stages. Altman is encouraging these companies to increase production capacity and prioritize orders from OpenAI. Altman’s planned trip to the UAE echoes his 2024 effort to pitch a $7 trillion infrastructure plan to the same companies he hopes to get funds from in the region. However, some industry leaders dismissed his previous effort as unrealistic, given the limited revenue generated by AI services at the time. Shortly after the 2024 UAE trip, TSMC’s CEO, C.C. Wei, said that Altman was too aggressive, but now believes the OpenAI boss will garner more support this time. There is a renewed confidence in OpenAI following its deal with Nvidia, in which Nvidia agreed to invest up to $100 billion to lease 5 million AI chips over time to OpenAI. Altman has recently rubbed shoulders with tech leaders from Hitachi, and the announcement of their partnership has boosted the shares of both companies. During his Middle East stop, the OpenAI boss plans to meet with representatives from Abu Dhabi’s investment funds, Mubadala and MGX. He will also meet with representatives from operations partner G42, and the potential new capital will partly fund the Abu Dhabi Stargate data center. OpenAI sets aside $16B to rent computing servers Sam Altman pledged to spend roughly $16 billion this year and up to $400 billion by 2029 on renting computing servers. Altman claimed that the computing supply chain is facing manufacturing bottlenecks as his company seeks to meet growing global demand. Altman’s OpenAI has also partnered with South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung as memory chip suppliers. The ChatGPT maker plans to co-develop AI data centers in South Korea with both companies, as it projects a monthly demand of up to 900K wafers. OpenAI has a deal with the Japanese firm Hitachi to help develop its AI infrastructure and provide power transmission and distribution equipment to its data centers. The company will, in turn, provide Hitachi with its models and other technologies. “Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.” – Sam Altman , CEO at OpenAI OpenAI revived global enthusiasm this past week after releasing its video-generating model, Sora 2, on September 30. The AI firm also agreed with Nvidia to deploy at least 10 GW of Nvidia’s computing systems to train and run the next generation of OpenAI’s models. Last month, OpenAI announced five new data center sites across the U.S., which it plans to build in collaboration with Oracle and Japan’s SofBank. Samsung and SK Hynix also signed letters of intent earlier this week to supply OpenAI with memory chips for its data centers. Three years after launching ChatGPT, OpenAI is valued at $ 500 billion, on par with ExxonMobil and Netflix. The company will also be among the first to receive Nvidia’s Rubin system in H2 2026.

52666990,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827657,1759598925,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52666990.jpeg,OpenAI offers rights holders new controls in Sora,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/openai-plans-sora-monetization/,"OpenAI is moving quickly to turn Sora, its new AI video app, into a money-making machine after its debut this week on Apple’s App Store. The app lets users type prompts to generate short clips, and it has already filled timelines with animated characters, brand logos, and even political figures. Chief Executive Sam Altman said on Friday that the company will soon introduce ways for rights holders to control how their characters are used, while also testing revenue-sharing with those who allow their properties inside the app. Speaking in a video surrounded by Pokémon, Sam added bluntly, “I hope Nintendo doesn’t sue us.” The company acknowledged that users are generating far more clips than expected. Many of those videos, though, are for small audiences and include material protected under copyright law. That reality has lawyers warning that OpenAI could soon face major lawsuits. The app, still invite-only and available only on iOS, shot to the top of Apple’s download charts by Wednesday, just a day after launch. According to CNBC, users have already created videos with characters from SpongeBob SquarePants, Rick and Morty, South Park, and Despicable Me. Some showed Ronald McDonald escaping police in a burger car, while others depicted Patrick Star, Pikachu, Starbucks cups, and even The Simpsons. OpenAI offers rights holders new controls in Sora On his blog , Sam said two major changes are coming. The first is new tools for rights holders to give “more granular control over generation of characters.” This builds on the opt-in model for likeness already in place but goes further. Sam wrote that OpenAI is hearing from rights holders who see value in what he called “interactive fan fiction,” but those same owners also want to decide exactly how their characters can or cannot be used. He said the company plans to apply one standard to everyone while letting rights holders decide if they want in. “There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration,” Sam explained. He also pointed to Japan, noting the “remarkable creative output” from its users and how deep the connection is between fans and Japanese content. The second change will be monetization. Sam said OpenAI needs to “somehow make money for video generation” as usage has far exceeded expectations. He said the company will begin experimenting with revenue sharing for rights holders who allow their characters in user-generated videos. “The exact model will take some trial and error to figure out, but we plan to start very soon,” he wrote. Sam compared the pace of change in Sora to the early days of ChatGPT, promising rapid testing and quick fixes when mistakes are made. Varun Shetty, OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, said that the company would work with rights holders who want characters blocked from Sora. “We’ll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests,” Varun said. He also added that the demand for fan interaction is strong. “People are eager to engage with their family and friends through their own imaginations, as well as stories, characters, and worlds they love,” said Varun. Copyright experts warn OpenAI about lawsuits Legal experts are not impressed. Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, said that “a lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright.” He warned that OpenAI is “opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this.” Mark also emphasized that if a company loses control of its copyrighted characters, the fallout could be serious. “You can imagine why Taylor Swift wouldn’t want, even if pornography is off the table, wouldn’t want videos of her purporting to say things she doesn’t say,” he said. “I think the same is going to be true of cartoon characters.” The copyright pressure is already visible across the industry. Disney and Universal have filed lawsuits against Midjourney, accusing it of distributing AI-generated characters taken from their films. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI last week to stop it from using Disney characters without authorization. With Sora generating the same type of user content, OpenAI now sits on the frontline of a fresh legal storm. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

But while Shiba Inu relies on hype, real buzz surrounds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-oriented DeFi token that most analysts are now saying is the top crypto to invest in. With its presale Stage 6 already over 55% sold, and backed by 16,750+ holders and $16.8 million+ raised, Mutuum Finance is being supported by its strong foundation of dual lending protocols, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial infrastructure. In a market tired of hype moving towards substance, Mutuum Finance stands to have upside leadership over SHIB in the subsequent market cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holds Key Rebound Level, Can Bulls Seize Control? Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at a very significant technical level of around $0.0000115, a level that has had a proven track record of holding firm as a good support in past market cycles. With exchange reserves at a near two-year low, pressure to sell appears to be easing, strengthening the argument for a potential rebound from here. If SHIB can sustain this level, an extended rally could ignite fresh momentum into Q4. A breakdown below support, however, may bring additional downside targets. While investors debate the next move for SHIB, there are also plenty of long-term players looking at prospects in emerging DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s generating increasingly higher degrees of interest ahead of the next bull cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Gains More Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees sharp progress in round six of presale as demand goes through the roof and the project raises over $16.8 million. Early investors are preparing themselves for potentially astronomical profits when the token is released for sale on the open market. Mutuum Finance is also creating new waves for a healthily flourishing DeFi ecosystem with the projected launch of a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In order to fulfill its promise of investor confidence and platform security, Mutuum Finance has signed up with CertiK to roll out a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The initiative is calling coders, white-hat hackers, and security researchers to participate to discover bugs rewarded in terms of severity ranging from low and minor to high and critical. The project is supporting community interaction with an early bird $100,000 giveaway , offering an extra motivation to join the presale. Mutuum Finance Prepares to Launch Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance publicly announced its preparations for launching its lending and borrowing protocol , an enormous development of its decentralized finance abilities. Scheduled for release on the Sepolia Testnet within V1 in Q4 2025, the protocol will introduce fundamental aspects such as liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and other key features. Supporting ETH and USDT initially for lending, borrowing, and collateral purposes, the platform is focused on a user-friendly and multi-purpose DeFi solution. Mutuum Finance protocol architecture is founded on close-order book topology, which will be reducing market risk and constraining illiquidity. Determining the primary parameters of liquidation levels, close-level conditions, and liquidator incentives is to make lending safe and stable. LTV and liquidation ratios are also calculated dynamically in relation to asset volatility, and riskier assets will be imposing more stringent lending terms. In addition to that, multipliers risk-weighted are employed across asset classes in a way as to maximize utmost aggregate resilience, security, and stability with varying market conditions. Shiba Inu’s Q4 confirms that hype is still alive, but for the investor looking at real utility and enormous potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) wins hands down. With the tokens still at just $0.035, over 55% of presale already sold in stage 6, $16.8 million raised, and 16,750+ early adopters onboard, MUTM is building a crushing DeFi platform that has nothing to do with hype. Its two lending protocols, addition of stablecoin, and advanced risk architecture place it with the potential to outperform SHIB, and become one of the top-performing cryptos of the next market cycle.

Tokenized DAT companies face 24/7 price swings, settlement complexity, and code/hack vulnerabilities that can quickly impact both token holders and ordinary shareholders. Immediate risk: 24/7 onchain trading can trigger rapid runs on tokenized treasury shares. Smart contract exploits and custody failures can affect both tokenized shares and the treasury’s crypto reserves. Tokenized stocks reached over $1.3 billion in value, highlighting growing exposure (source: RWA.XYZ). Meta description: Tokenized stocks risks rise for crypto treasuries—understand tokenized DAT company exposure and mitigation steps. Read expert analysis and key takeaways. Crypto treasury companies are already capitalizing on highly volatile digital assets, and tokenizing company shares introduces new risks. What are tokenized stocks risks for crypto treasury companies? Tokenized stocks risks include amplified market volatility, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainty. Tokenized DAT companies that issue blockchain-based shares expose investors to both the treasury’s crypto exposure and the complexities of equity governance, increasing systemic and investor-level risk. How do tokenized DAT companies increase investor and corporate risk? Tokenized DAT companies create layered exposure: investors are exposed to the treasury’s crypto holdings and to the tokenized equity’s legal and governance complexity. Kadan Stadelmann, CTO of Komodo, notes that blockchains trade 24/7 while traditional markets do not, enabling price moves outside normal trading hours. Sharp onchain price movements that occur during off-hours can trigger liquidity runs. That risk is heightened when a company issues both traditional shares and tokenized equivalents and cannot respond in time to rapid price shocks. Tokenized stocks have crossed $1.3 billion in value. Source: RWA.XYZ What technical and governance vulnerabilities matter most? Smart contract bugs, custody hacks, and oracle manipulation directly threaten tokenized share value and the treasury’s underlying assets. Kanny Lee, CEO of SecondSwap, warns that tokenizing DAT equity “creates a synthetic on top of a synthetic,” exposing investors twice: to crypto volatility and to securities complexity. Regulatory ambiguity increases legal risk. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring blockchain-based stock trading, and traditional exchanges such as Nasdaq and NYSE are considering extended hours to compete with crypto markets. That policy evolution may change compliance demands for tokenized offerings. How can investors and companies mitigate tokenization risk? Adopt layered risk controls: comprehensive smart-contract audits, robust custody (multi-signature and cold storage), and clear corporate governance for tokenized shares. Require independent smart-contract audits and public audit reports. Maintain segregated custody reserves for tokenized assets versus operating crypto holdings. Implement circuit breakers and settlement limits for token trading during off-hours. Disclose legal status and investor rights clearly in token terms. How does round-the-clock trading change market dynamics? 24/7 onchain trading reduces market friction but increases the probability of sudden, large price moves. Nasdaq has announced plans to expand trading hours, and SEC discussions on tokenized stocks point to a potential future of extended market accessibility. These changes demand faster corporate responses and clearer disclosure frameworks. Nasdaq president Tal Cohen announces the push for 24 hour stock trading.

Smart contract exploits can freeze tokens, drain funds, or alter token rules. Token holders may lose value if contracts are not audited and if custody practices are weak. Will regulators allow 24/7 tokenized stock trading? Regulatory frameworks are evolving. The US SEC has discussed tokenized stock models publicly, and exchanges are testing extended hours, but clear, enforceable rules for 24/7 token trading are still under development. Key Takeaways Layered exposure : Tokenized DAT companies expose investors to both crypto volatility and equity complexity. Technical risk : Smart-contract and custody failures are primary attack vectors for tokenized shares. Mitigation : Audits, segregated custody, circuit breakers, and clear disclosures reduce systemic risk. Conclusion Tokenized stocks risks present a new frontier for corporate treasuries and investors. The blend of onchain trading, software risk, and regulatory uncertainty demands stronger governance and technical safeguards.

With institutional accumulation and retail adoption increasing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is still set for further growth. Forecasts indicate that Bitcoin could soon clear resistance zones last seen in August, which is promising for the entire crypto sector. Yet, even while Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, investors are tapping the market for opportunities with a higher return potential. This search has pushed MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already gaining momentum. With the speculation of a listing price of $0.007, community-driven growth has led to talk of bringing 100x ROI in less than a year. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong at $122K and Technical Indicators Bitcoin has risen by 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $122,300 at press time. This extends a 12% weekly gain. The move outperformed the market-wide 1.9% rise by the overall crypto sector, cementing this coin’s status as a trendsetter. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutional activity continues to gain ground for Bitcoin’s case. Public miners Marathon Digital and CleanSpark increased their treasuries in September. CleanSpark added 184 BTC, and Marathon increased reserves to 52,850 BTC, worth $6.4 billion. Disposal by both firms featured minimal sales and an emphasis on accumulation. By this strategy, the circulating supply is reduced, signaling confidence in a long-term value. Marathon’s expansion into AI and data infrastructure offers resilience to its operations. With several sources of revenue, the company does not heavily rely on the liquidation of BTC. Such institutional positioning gives credence to Bitcoin as a store of value. Retail adoption is another driver. Walmart-backed fintech OnePay announced plans to integrate Bitcoin trading to its mobile app by late 2025. With access to Walmart’s 150 million weekly customers, Bitcoin could have new use cases in retail payments. Enabling crypto-to-fiat conversions at checkout facilitates a payment bridge like Cash App’s, which historically led to increased transaction-driven adoption. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin has regained the $120K, moving above its 7-day SMA & 30-day EMA. The MACD histogram exploded to +688, its strongest signal since August highs. RSI is at 66.48, which indicates there is still momentum before overbought conditions develop. Analysts are targeting Fibonacci extensions at $124,451 and then $128,733 as the next resistance levels. Sustained closes above $122K may clear the path to retesting August’s record high near $125K. MAGACOIN FINANCE Forecast to Deliver 100x ROI by Next Year While Bitcoin’s climb reinforces its role as the market’s anchor, investors are increasingly turning their attention to opportunities with higher upside. That search has brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. Trading at a low price, the project is being hailed as one of 2025’s most promising tokens, with forecasts projecting a staggering 100x return by next year. The contrast is clear. Bitcoin offers stability and institutional adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to those seeking exponential growth. Speculation around a potential exchange listing has only amplified the excitement, suggesting that early participants could benefit from a surge in liquidity and demand once trading begins. Community momentum adds another dimension. Investor groups across Telegram and X have been buzzing with updates and coordinated buying strategies, echoing the grassroots energy that has fueled past breakout tokens. For many retail participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of l ow-cost, high-reward opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its early years. As Bitcoin tests resistance near $125K, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own narrative, one centered on accessibility and the possibility of turning small allocations into transformative gains within the next cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its strength as a dominant market force. With institutional miners accumulating, retail adoption expanding, and bullish technical indicators, the coin remains well-positioned for growth. However, the upside is moderated by its large market cap, making exponential returns less likely compared to smaller tokens. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With a forecasted $0.007 listing price and strong community engagement, it presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns. For investors balancing stability and growth potential, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive trajectory may shape one of the most compelling strategies of 2025.

However, two key metrics point to the possibility that the bull market may actually be in its early stages. Glassnode data shows that the 200-week moving average (200WMA), which smooths bitcoin’s price over a long-term horizon and has historically only trended upwards, has just breached $53,000. Meanwhile, the realized price , the average price at which all bitcoin in circulation last moved onchain, has just risen above the 200-WMA at $54,000. Looking back at previous cycles, we see a consistent pattern. In bull markets, the realized price tends to stay above the 200-WMA, while in bear markets, the opposite occurs. For example, in the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, the realized price steadily climbed higher and widened its gap above the 200-WMA, before eventually collapsing below it and signaling the start of the bear markets. While, during the downturn of 2022, the realized price fell below the 200-WMA, it has only recently moved above it. Historically, once the realized price remains above this long-term moving average, bitcoin has tended to push higher as the bull market progresses.",Markets|Bitcoin|realized price|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 18:00:00

Among the multiple questions currently being asked, one is more demanding of an immediate response: Is an XRP whale sell-off on its way? XRP Supply Surges Across Major Exchanges In an October 3rd post on the social media platform X, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted a recent shift in the behavior of XRP’s largest holders, the whales. The online pundit’s report was based on the Exchange Supply Ratio indicator, which tracks the proportion of XRP tokens on exchanges relative to its total circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Exchange Inflows Hit $5.7B: Profit-Taking Already Underway? This metric can be used to derive insights on potential selling pressure for a crypto asset (XRP, in this case), seeing as higher values would suggest increased availability of tokens on the exchange for sale. According to CryptoOnchain, there has been a spike in XRP supply across major exchanges, suggesting that whales might be positioning for a significant sell-off. The data shared reflects the increase in selling pressure across these exchanges, including Bithumb, Bitget, Bitfinex, and Binance, putting the XRP price at an increased risk of a sharp correction. XRP Displays Bearish Divergence As Sellers Dominate Futures Market In a separate post made on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain also revealed a budding negative divergence across the XRP futures market. The relevant indicator here is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which monitors the balance between aggressive buy and sell orders in the futures market. This metric is typically used to assess whether buyers or sellers are dominating the market in the short term. The analyst noted that while the price of XRP has been mostly around $3 after its recent rise, the ‘Taker Ratio’ across exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since November 2024. Interestingly, data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, further supports this bearish signal, as patterns similar to those seen on other exchanges have also been surfacing. Related Reading: Ethereum Matches Bitcoin In Annual Gains: What This Means For The Market CryptoOnchain explained that this situation could either mean that the market participants are booking profits or anticipating a price decline in the near future. However, the spike in XRP supply across major crypto exchanges, alongside the clear dominance of sellers in the perpetual futures market, strongly suggests the imminence of a price correction. It is therefore advisable to watch the psychological $3 level closely before market decisions are made. As of this writing, XRP is hovering around the $3 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours.

Coinbase Integrates Samsung Pay On Platform On Friday, October 3, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced the expansion of its partnership with Samsung. This renewed collaboration will grant Galaxy smartphone users in the United States direct access to crypto through its Coinbase One program. According to the exchange’s website, Coinbase One is a membership program for crypto users, offering zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, priority support, exclusive partner deals, and account protection for lost fund restoration due to unauthorized third-party access. Additionally, this partnership expansion includes the integration of Samsung Pay on the crypto trading platform. The announcement revealed that this will allow Samsung Galaxy smartphone users to interact with cryptocurrencies and other blockchain services. Coinbase’s Chief Business Officer Shan Aggarwal said in a statement: Together with Samsung, we’re pairing their global scale with Coinbase’s trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto — starting with more than 75 million of Galaxy users across the U.S., and soon around the world. The growing partnership between Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, and Samsung is a hallmark sign of the ongoing shift in the US crypto landscape. Following the election of President Donald Trump in November 2024, the improved regulatory clarity has afforded crypto companies the freedom to push for further expansion. Coinbase Revenue To Improve In Q3 2025? The improving crypto climate in the US has not particularly translated to increased revenue growth for Coinbase. According to the shareholder report released in August, the crypto exchange recorded a revenue growth of just 3% in the year’s second quarter, its lowest in recent years. These revenue growth numbers were not only low by the company’s standards but also lagged behind industry performance. For instance, Kraken registered an 18% jump in crypto revenues, while Robinhood posted almost a 100% increase. Investors will be looking forward to the revenue report of the recently concluded third quarter, as it is likely to impact the crypto company’s shares. Coinbase shares (with the ticker COIN) witnessed a sharp drop in value following the release of the second-quarter revenue report. As of this writing, COIN is trading at around 380.02, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours. According to recent market data, the stock’s value has increased by more than 53% year-to-date.",Coinbase|coin|coinbase|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Samsung,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 18:00:52

Ray III in November 2022 was his “biggest mistake.” Bankman-Fried stated that the decision “destroyed the exchange’s chance to save it.” Bankman-Fried's statements garnered attention during the investigation following FTX's collapse, during which the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell received more than $171 million in fees. SBF maintains its innocence: “I didn't defraud anyone,” it says. However, the jury's verdict confirmed that FTX's collapse was one of the largest financial crimes in history. Serving a 25-year prison sentence as of 2025, Bankman-Fried didn't abandon her habits even while criticizing prison rules in an interview: “We're only allowed to wear overalls from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. I don't know who made such a pointless rule,” she said, humorously describing prison conditions. SBF's parents, Stanford University law professor Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are on their son's defense team and are preparing to appeal the conviction. “I'm outraged to think of Sam sitting in prison; everything he could have contributed to the world has been destroyed,” Fried said. The family alleges that Sullivan & Cromwell was primarily responsible for FTX's bankruptcy. The law firm allegedly took control of the company from SBF, appointed John J. Ray III as CEO, and profited significantly from the bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried's team argues that this accelerated FTX's collapse. Related News: Donald Trump's Altcoin WLFI Announces Major Token Sale John J. Ray III, however, says SBF is “deceiving itself.” According to Ray, during the Bankman-Fried era, FTX was a veritable “house of cards,” and he and Sullivan & Cromwell managed to save thousands of customers money. FTX's 2022 collapse began with a financial report published by Coindesk. According to the leak, SBF's proprietary trading firm, Alameda Research, relied heavily on FTX's own token, FTT. This eroded investor confidence, leading to massive withdrawals and eventual bankruptcy. *This is not investment advice.

Price May Pop at Any Point,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-we-are-in-a-breakout-territory-price-may-pop-at-any-point/,"In the world of digital assets, momentum can shift in an instant. A single technical signal—especially on a higher-timeframe chart—can mark the difference between quiet consolidation and explosive upside. For XRP, that moment may be near. Analysts are closely monitoring the charts, where a rare combination of bullish signals is emerging, suggesting a potential price breakout could be imminent. Cryptoinsightuk Flags Bullish RSI Signal Market analyst Cryptoinsightuk has sounded the alarm for XRP holders, noting that the asset’s three-day chart is now showing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover alongside a strong three-day candle close. The analyst emphasized that this particular alignment has preceded major upward moves for XRP in the past—pointing to the last three instances on November 5, 2024, April 19, 2025, and June 27, 2025. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI. Here are the last 3 times we saw this happen pic.twitter.com/NzPHCMjvqS — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 4, 2025 Each of those historical signals coincided with significant bullish momentum, suggesting the current setup could mark the beginning of another leg higher. “We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for XRP at any point,” Cryptoinsightuk wrote, reinforcing that the chart structure remains technically constructive. Understanding the Technical Setup A bullish RSI crossover occurs when short-term momentum breaks above its longer-term trend line—an early indication that buying pressure is starting to dominate. When this signal appears on the three-day timeframe, it’s more significant than similar signals on shorter intervals because it indicates sustained market strength rather than short-term volatility. Coupled with the recent strong candle close, this crossover suggests that bulls are regaining control after a period of consolidation. Historically, such alignments on XRP’s chart have led to strong continuation rallies, provided they are confirmed by volume and price action in subsequent sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Resistance Levels and Market Context From a technical perspective, XRP faces its next resistance band between $3.20 and $3.65, a region that has repeatedly capped price advances in 2025. A decisive breakout and sustained close above that zone could unlock further upside momentum , potentially validating the “pop” scenario that traders like Cryptoinsightuk anticipate. Broader market conditions also favor bullish sentiment. Bitcoin remains strong above six-figure levels, overall liquidity has improved across digital assets, and institutional participation in on-chain settlement projects continues to grow. These factors collectively create an environment in which XRP could benefit from renewed investor confidence. Risk and Confirmation While optimism is building, analysts caution that no technical indicator guarantees results. RSI crossovers can produce false signals if volume fails to confirm or if sudden macro news shifts sentiment. Traders are advised to manage risk carefully, watch for volume-supported breakouts, and avoid over-leveraging positions during volatility spikes. The Bottom Line With momentum indicators in sync and historical patterns resurfacing, XRP seems poised for a potential breakout. As Cryptoinsightuk highlights, the market is once again positioned where a strong upward move could emerge at any time. Whether that surge materializes will depend on confirmation in the coming days—but for now, XRP sits squarely in what analysts call breakout territory .

Bitcoin offers fractional ownership, wide liquidity, and a proven long-term return profile that has turned small stimulus allocations into substantial gains over multi‑year windows. Immediate hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often used as a store-of-value alternative to cash. Small allocations (e.g., $1,000–$2,000) buy fractional BTC and fit dollar-cost averaging strategies. Historical data: past U.S. stimulus rounds invested in crypto produced multi-hundred-percent gains for some investors. tariff distribution Bitcoin — Learn why investing a tariff check in Bitcoin can hedge inflation and capture growth. Read step-by-step guidance and key takeaways. What is a tariff distribution and how could Bitcoin benefit? tariff distribution Bitcoin refers to using tariff revenue to distribute cash payments to citizens. Investing that cash in Bitcoin can offer inflation protection, fractional exposure to a liquid global asset, and potential long-term capital appreciation compared with holding fiat. How would a $2,000 tariff distribution affect Bitcoin demand? A $2,000 distribution increases retail liquidity available for markets. Historical parallels: U.S. stimulus rounds in 2020–2021 saw an estimated portion of checks flow into stocks and crypto. A $1,200 stimulus invested in Bitcoin on April 11, 2020 (~$6,878 per BTC) would have harvested roughly 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 at a later valuation—illustrating how modest amounts can compound. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Why investing a tariff distribution in Bitcoin could make sense"", ""alternativeHeadline"": ""How a Trump-era tariff distribution might be invested into Bitcoin"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""An analysis of why directing tariff distribution payments into Bitcoin could be a practical hedge and investment strategy for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 payments."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/tariff-distribution-bitcoin"" }} Why consider Bitcoin for a tariff-inspired payout? Bitcoin offers scarcity (21 million supply cap), global liquidity, and fractional ownership, enabling even $1,000 purchases to meaningfully participate in long-term market moves. For many investors, those attributes make Bitcoin a practical option for preserving purchasing power and pursuing growth. How did past stimulus payments impact crypto markets? Past U.S. stimulus checks coincided with crypto rallies. According to reports at the time, up to an estimated $40 billion of stimulus funds flowed into stocks and crypto.

Conservative savers should consider allocating a small portion of the distribution to Bitcoin while keeping emergency funds in cash and bonds. A modest allocation provides inflation exposure without overconcentration. Key Takeaways Small allocations can matter : Even $1,000–$2,000 buys fractional BTC with long-term upside potential. Historical precedent : Prior stimulus rounds saw material flows into crypto and stocks, producing significant gains for some holders. Security first : Use trusted custody solutions and best practices to protect holdings. Conclusion Redirecting a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can serve as a pragmatic hedge and growth tactic for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 checks. COINOTAG recommends weighing personal risk tolerance, using secure custody, and considering dollar-cost averaging to integrate cryptocurrency exposure responsibly.

The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

The findings indicate that 317 stolen fund reports were filed between July and September, with assets worth more than $3.73 million successfully frozen or recovered in ten of those cases. Private Keys Remain the Core Vulnerability The report highlights that most crypto thefts rely on compromised credentials rather than sophisticated attacks. It notes that unauthorized dealers continue to sell fake hardware wallets, which remain a common scam. These devices often contain pre-written seed phrases or have been tampered with to secretly capture recovery information, allowing attackers to access funds once victims deposit assets. SlowMist advised users to only purchase hardware wallets through authorized vendors, create seed phrases on their device, and try tiny transfers before transferring large sums of money. Simple checks, such as verifying packaging integrity and avoiding pre-set recovery cards, can help prevent losses. Attackers are also developing new methods using phishing and social engineering. The report examined some occurrences of EIP-7702 delegate phishing, where compromised accounts were linked to contracts that automatically drained assets once a transfer was initiated. In such cases, victims believed they were engaging in regular activity, but hidden authorizations allowed hackers to gain control. The analysis shows that social engineering remains a persistent threat, with phishers posing as recruiters on LinkedIn and building trust with job candidates over several weeks before convincing them to install “camera drivers” or other malicious code. In one case, attackers paired the program with a manipulated Chrome extension during a Zoom call, leading to losses of more than $13 million. Old Phishing Scams Remain Effective Traditional methods also continued to prove effective. Fraudulent Google ads cloned legitimate services such as MistTrack, while spoofed dashboards for decentralized finance platforms like Aave generated over $1.2 million in losses through hidden authorization requests. The exploiters also hijacked unused Discord vanity links left in project folders to trick communities. Another attack vector disguises malicious commands as CAPTCHA verifications, tricking victims into copying code that steals wallet data, browser cookies, and private keys. SlowMist explained that Web3 exploits are not about complex tricks but involve hackers taking advantage of everyday actions. That being said, simple actions like slowing down, double-checking sources, and avoiding shortcuts are the best ways to stay safe in a space where threats keep changing.

The increased Bitcoin ETF inflows, as the U.S. government remains shut down , have led analysts to note the diversion of funds into safe-haven alternatives like Bitcoin and gold, with the latter setting all-time high prices during the week. Bitcoin ETF inflows reach 2025 high According to data from SosoValue , Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.24 billion in net inflows this week. It is their largest weekly inflow since the year began and is also their second-largest weekly haul since they launched last year. Bitcoin ETFs posted their strongest week in 2025 in the first week of the U.S. government’s shutdown. Source: SoSoValue The Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.24 billion in weekly inflows between Monday and Friday this week, with Friday’s net inflow of $985 million being the second-largest daily inflow, second only to the $987 million they poured in on January 6. This reversed the $902 million outflow from the previous week and pushed four-week inflows close to $4 billion. The record Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly inflows are also happening alongside the rally in BTC’s price that kicked off the month. The price is already up over 10% this month, living up to the “Uptober” hype based on the fact that October is BTC’s second-best-performing month based on historical data. Year-to-date, Bitcoin ETFs have drawn in $23 billion of the $58 billion in total net inflows since their inception, a factor analysts claim is proof of growing institutional adoption. Aside from the increased inflow, the market also seems to be pricing in another potential Fed rate cut. BTC shines as U.S. government shutdown continues The increased ETF inflows may have triggered another rally in BTC’s price; however, the U.S. government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, may sustain the trend for the rest of the month. The political uncertainty that led to the government shutdown has also coincided with dollar price turbulence and talk of a capital flight as investors rush to hedge against the fall with BTC and precious metals. Observers are now predicting a month-long rally, including JPMorgan analysts, calling out the “debasement trades,” as investors continue to move to BTC and gold to hedge against inflation and macro uncertainties, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown . Prediction marketplace Polymarket has suggested there is over a 60% chance that the shutdown will last 10–29 days, during which BTC will really have a chance to shine as a store of value and hedge against inflation. On Kalshi, the current forecast implies the stoppage will last 11.1 days, up sharply in recent days as there has been no progress in negotiations happening on Capitol Hill. The shutdown formally started early Wednesday morning following a deadlock between top Democrats and Republicans, including President Donald Trump, on a short-term deal to keep the government funded. Government shutdowns usually last about 14 days, based on data from Bank of America going back to 1990. The S&P 500 has averaged a 1% increase during these events, but a prolonged closure this time could affect the already fragile markets.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-on-the-brink-of-its-parabolic-run-heres-the-timeline/,"Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

This surge — including a near $1 billion daily inflow — signals renewed allocation to Bitcoin from investors anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut. $3.24B total ETF inflows in first week of October $1B nearly one-day inflow reversed prior $900M outflow Analyst targets: JPMorgan $165k, Standard Chartered $135k–$200k, Citigroup $132k Bitcoin ETFs pull in $3.24B in early October, sparking renewed institutional buying and driving BTC toward $125K — read the latest market signals and analyst forecasts. What caused Bitcoin ETF inflows to surge to $3.2B? Bitcoin ETF inflows surged as institutional investors returned after a weak September, driven by optimism for an “Uptober” rally and a sharply higher probability of a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. The inflows included one of the largest single-day ETF deposits, signaling renewed capital allocation into BTC. How large were the flows and what do they mean for price action? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs registered about $3.24 billion in net inflows during the first week of October, with nearly $1 billion entering on Friday alone. This reversed a roughly $900 million outflow from the previous week and coincided with Bitcoin briefly touching $124,000, placing $125,000 as the next clear resistance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin ETFs Hit $3.2B in Flows, Setting the Stage for a Breakout"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T22:05:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T22:05:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-etfs-hit-3-2b-flows"" }, ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.24B in early October, sparking renewed institutional buying and pushing BTC toward $125K as analysts update targets."", ""keywords"": ""Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC price, Uptober, institutional adoption""} Why did institutions return to Bitcoin funds now? Institutions cited macro drivers and portfolio rebalancing. Futures markets are pricing in more than a 90% chance of a Federal Reserve policy easing, which historically favors alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Wealth managers and financial advisors reported renewed client interest in crypto exposure. What are major banks forecasting for Bitcoin? Major banks have revised targets upward: JPMorgan projects $165,000 by year-end, Standard Chartered sets nearer-term targets of $135,000 with upside to $200,000 before 2026 if ETF demand persists, and Citigroup raised its target to $132,000. These projections were shared in institutional research notes and public commentary. How should investors interpret ETF flow data? ETF flows offer a near-real-time gauge of institutional demand. A sustained inflow trend typically precedes broader price appreciation as new capital increases liquidity and lowers volatility for large buy orders. How to monitor ETF-driven momentum (step-by-step) Track daily and weekly net flows for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Compare flows with on-chain metrics (exchange reserves, open interest). Monitor macro signals (Fed minutes, rate-cut probabilities) for directional bias. Watch resistance levels ($125K) and volume confirmation for breakout validation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin ETF inflows"", ""description"": ""Steps for investors to use ETF flows to assess Bitcoin market momentum and risk."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check ETF net flows"", ""text"": ""Review daily and weekly inflows and outflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs to identify demand trends."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Cross-check on-chain indicators"", ""text"": ""Compare ETF flows with exchange reserves and futures open interest for liquidity signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Factor in macro conditions"", ""text"": ""Monitor monetary policy expectations and risk-on sentiment to assess sustainability."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Set tactical price levels"", ""text"": ""Use resistance and support (e.g., $125K resistance) to plan entries and stops."" } ]} When could inflows trigger a sustained breakout? A sustained breakout is more likely if ETF inflows remain consistently positive week-over-week and price breaks and holds above the $125,000 resistance on strong volume. Confirmation would include shrinking exchange reserves and expanding derivatives open interest in the same direction. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Bitcoin ETFs net in the first week of October? Bitcoin ETFs netted approximately $3.24 billion in the first week of October, including a near $1 billion daily inflow on Friday that reversed a prior $900 million outflow. Will ETF inflows guarantee a price rally to new highs? ETF inflows increase the probability of price appreciation but do not guarantee new highs; market confirmation requires sustained flows, healthy volume, and supportive macro conditions like an easing Fed. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much did Bitcoin ETFs net in the first week of October?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin ETFs netted about $3.24 billion in the first week of October, including a roughly $1 billion single-day inflow that reversed the previous week's outflows."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Do ETF inflows mean Bitcoin will hit new all-time highs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETF inflows increase upward pressure on price and can support a rally, but a new all-time high requires sustained capital, volume confirmation, and supportive macro conditions."" } } ]} Key Takeaways Immediate impact : $3.24B weekly inflow pushed BTC near $124,000 and set $125,000 as near-term resistance. Institutional signal : Large daily inflows indicate renewed allocation from wealth managers and advisors. Watch points : Sustained ETF inflows, exchange reserves, and Fed policy expectations will determine if the rally continues. Conclusion Bitcoin ETF inflows of roughly $3.24 billion in early October reflect a notable return of institutional demand, elevating BTC toward the $125,000 resistance. Analysts from JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Citigroup have revised targets higher, reinforcing a cautious but constructive outlook. Investors should monitor flows, on-chain metrics, and macro signals for confirmation before adjusting allocations.

He argued that there’s a good chance that not all of those investments will deliver big returns. He noted that the internet craze of the late 1990s and early 2000s drew a frenzy of investment in tech companies at the time. Solomon reminded the crowd that the internet craze was followed by a dramatic collapse, which is commonly known as the “dot-com bubble”. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets.” David Solomon , Goldman Sachs CEO Jeff Bezos referred to the AI investment wave as an “industrial bubble.” He also emphasized that innovation stemming from such AI investment cycles can still yield long-term advantages. According to Bezos, the market is seeking the next big breakthrough, reminiscent of the dynamics of previous bubbles. He added that the previous bubble dynamic is why many small AI ventures with weak foundations receive investment. On October 3, Dario Perkins, TS Lombard’s Managing Director of Global Macro Research, raised an alarm when he noticed that big tech companies were increasingly using off-balance-sheet loans and special purpose entities (SPVs) to finance AI equipment. According to Perkins, this is a “recognition that this is getting out of hand.” Perkins emphasized that the real leverage and risk exposure of businesses like Meta, which has requested $29 billion in private finance for the expansion of its AI data centre, are concealed by such borrowing techniques.

ARB’s dip reflects natural profit-taking after a strong quarter and shifting focus toward competing L2 developments. While the network’s fundamentals (DeFi dominance, Robinhood’s RWA integrations) remain intact, traders are cautiously awaiting clearer signals. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news SWIFT announced its blockchain will use Linea (Ethereum L2), challenging Arbitrum’s dominance in institutional adoption. Linea’s TVL ($2.27B) now ranks fourth among L2s. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

52670508,597747,1759606220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52670508.jpeg,Big Move: Ethereum Foundation Trades $4.5M ETH For Stable Assets,https://bitcoinist.com/big-move-ethereum-foundation-trades-4-5m-eth-for-stable-assets/,"Ethereum’s steward moved part of its crypto coffers this week, converting a chunk of ETH into stablecoins as it adjusts how it funds projects and grants. Foundation Moves To Stablecoin Holdings According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation converted 1,000 ETH into stablecoins using the decentralized trading router CoW Swap, a transaction worth about $4.5 million at the time. The move was executed as part of the foundation’s ongoing treasury actions and was presented as a step to secure more predictable funds for research, grants, and donations. The specific stablecoin or coins received in exchange were not publicly named in initial reports. The Foundation’s treasurer has been managing a broader plan. Reports have disclosed a previously stated intention to convert up to 10,000 Ether over a period of weeks, and this latest trade appears to be an element of that phased approach rather than a one-off sale. Holding stable assets gives the foundation a clearer view of its short-term spending power while it evaluates longer-term strategy. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap ‘s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Use Of Decentralized Trading Tools The choice to use CoW Swap — a decentralized aggregator that aims to reduce slippage and market impact — was highlighted in public coverage. By routing the trade through decentralized infrastructure instead of a single centralized exchange, the Foundation reduced some counterparty and custody concerns. The execution method was described as careful and aimed at protecting the value of the sale during the swap. Alongside the transaction, internal operational decisions have also been articulated. The Foundation indicated it temporarily applied the breaks on open submissions of a grant for its Ecosystem Support Program in order to give attention to the large influx of proposals and prioritize urgent or high-impact work. Changes in leadership and institutional reorganization, have also been discussed publicly as part of recent organizational action, portrayed in a manner that suggests a transition is underway internally to accompany any change in the direction of treasury management as well. What Comes Next For The Treasury Market watchers noted that converting ETH to stablecoins is a common liquidity-management tactic. Volatility in ETH’s price can make budgeting for multi-month support programs difficult; stable assets can smooth out planning. While some community members saw the sale as a reduction of ETH holdings, others pointed out that the foundation’s core mission — to support Ethereum’s development — remains unchanged.

The claim, posted by several researchers on X, marks the latest security incident for the project, which has previously been targeted by hackers. According to Vladimir S ., a blockchain threat researcher with the X handle, @officer_cia, the protocol was drained of $1.7 million before the attacker transferred the stolen funds into Tornado Cash . The researcher’s claim followed an earlier post on X by Weilin William Li (@hklst4r), who had flagged the incident as a vulnerability in Abracadabra’s smart contracts but stopped short of confirming the exploit at the time. Vulnerability in ‘solvency check’ logic Li said the suspected attacker may have exploited a flaw in the protocol’s logic that allowed them to bypass a solvency check, a safeguard designed to ensure that borrowers cannot withdraw more funds than they are entitled to. “It seems Abracadabra @MIM_Spell is hacked again,” Li wrote . “This time a more obvious vulnerability, where an ‘else’ branch clears the status variables and sets ‘needSolvencyCheck’ to false by default.” Li also implied that Abracadabra Money was already aware of the situation as he wrote “They have paused all their contracts now,” while cautioning that his findings were preliminary and could be subject to revision. Abracadabra Money is a familiar target for hackers If confirmed, this would be the third exploit the platform has suffered in roughly two years. The first was in January 2024, when it suffered a $6.49 million exploit. That exploit caused its MIM stablecoin to lose its peg to the US dollar. The second exploit occurred in March 2025; the protocol lost an estimated $13 million after attackers exploited vulnerabilities in its “cauldron” smart contracts tied to GMX. That’s the largest breach the platform has suffered to date, and it caused Abracadabra to pause borrowing across its ecosystem and offered a 20% bounty to the hackers for the safe return of funds. DeFi’s persistent security challenges Abracadabra Money’s recurring vulnerabilities have drawn criticism from parts of the DeFi community. The relatively modest amount involved, $1.7 million compared to earlier multi-million-dollar DeFi exploits, may indicate a partial drain or that the vulnerability was discovered and mitigated before further damage occurred. An estimated $307 million is reported to have been stolen from crypto platforms globally in the third quarter (Q3) of 2025, with DeFi exploits coming second after centralized exchanges, according to data shared by CertiK. This is an improvement to the figures that were lost to exploits in Q2 and Q1. This year alone has seen over $3 billion lost to hacks. With Q4 just starting, Abracadabra Money is one of the first casualties of the quarter. As of the time of writing, Abracadabra Money has yet to issue an official statement addressing the reported exploit.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns. Professional mining services allow you to participate in this growth without the technical complexities. As energy costs rise globally, individual mining becomes increasingly impractical, while professional operations benefit from economies of scale and renewable energy sources. This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

ChatGPT Breaks It Down and Names a Cheaper Must-Buy Crypto for 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/,"The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-04 20:00:00
52671734,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85351,1759608336,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What XRP Market Cap Multiplier Effect Means,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-xrp-market-cap-multiplier-effect-means/,"Every crypto bull market has its buzzwords, but few have sparked as much curiosity among XRP holders as the so-called “market cap multiplier effect.” It’s the idea that XRP’s true price potential isn’t limited by its large total supply — because only a fraction of that supply is actively available on the market. In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges.

Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.
