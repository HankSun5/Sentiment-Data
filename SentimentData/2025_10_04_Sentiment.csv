CleanSpark Bitcoin production for September totaled 629 BTC, with 445 BTC sold for approximately $48.7 million and the company holding 13,011 BTC in its treasury. The update also highlighted a 26% year‑over‑year improvement in fleet efficiency and an average operating hashrate of 45.6 EH/s. COINOTAG reviewed the company’s disclosed figures and comparable industry data to contextualize the results. Sales are consistent with CleanSpark’s stated strategy to monetize production for liquidity. How did CleanSpark’s efficiency and sales affect its treasury and liquidity? CleanSpark sold 445 BTC in September at an average realized price of about $109,568, generating roughly $48.7 million in proceeds. The company ended the month with 13,011 BTC after the sale, reflecting a balance between accumulation and cash-generation objectives. Fleet-level efficiency improved 26% year over year, which supports lower unit costs per BTC mined. Average operating hashrate of 45.6 EH/s sustained production despite rising network difficulty. CleanSpark shares performance. Source: Yahoo Finance Why are miners facing new pressures? Bitcoin miners face higher energy costs and potential tariffs on imported mining rigs, which can materially affect margins and capital expense forecasts. Tariff exposure has been reported as a significant risk for several publicly traded miners. Customs allegations that some rigs were manufactured in China have created potential tariff liabilities for firms, with reported exposures reaching into the hundreds of millions for certain companies. Tariff rates reported in industry commentary vary by origin and may reach an effective duty of over 50% for China‑origin machines. Network mining difficulty also reached record highs in September and October, increasing the computational work required per BTC and pressuring energy consumption and cost per coin. Bitcoin mining difficulty over 3 years. Source: Coinwarz.com When did CleanSpark change its sales strategy and why? CleanSpark began selling a portion of monthly production in April to pursue greater financial self-sufficiency. The firm also opened an institutional Bitcoin trading desk to facilitate scheduled sales and improve execution. In August, CleanSpark sold 533.5 BTC for about $60.7 million, illustrating the company’s recurring liquidity approach. Management framed sales as a tool to support operations and capital needs rather than a change in long‑term accumulation policy. Frequently Asked Questions How many BTC does CleanSpark hold now? CleanSpark reported 13,011 BTC in its treasury at the end of September after mining 629 BTC and selling 445 BTC during the month. Does selling monthly production mean miners are abandoning accumulation? Selling part of monthly output is a cash-management tactic. Many miners balance accumulation with sales to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures while still retaining strategic BTC reserves. How do tariffs affect miner economics? Tariffs on imported mining rigs increase upfront capital costs and extend payback periods. Reported potential liabilities and duties can materially change project IRRs and equipment replacement cycles. Key Takeaways Production and sales: 629 BTC mined in September; 445 BTC sold for ~ $48.7M. Operational improvement: Fleet efficiency +26% YoY; 45.6 EH/s average operating hashrate. Industry pressures: Rising energy costs, tariffs on rigs, and record mining difficulty are key headwinds. Conclusion CleanSpark Bitcoin production strengthened in September, combining improved fleet efficiency with an active sales program to support liquidity. COINOTAG analysis shows the company balancing accumulation (treasury 13,011 BTC) with operational funding amid rising difficulty and tariff risks.

If approved, this will make it the first major U.S.-regulated exchange to offer around-the-clock access to crypto derivatives, aligning it with DeFi standards. Rising Client Demand The derivatives marketplace announced in a Thursday statement that, subject to regulatory green light, it plans to offer customers the ability to trade cryptocurrency futures and options “24 hours a day, seven days a week” starting in early 2026. The initiative is driven by growing user demand for continuous risk management and liquidity. “While not all markets lend themselves to operating 24/7, client demand for around-the-clock cryptocurrency trading has grown as market participants need to manage their risk every day of the week,” said Tim McCourt, Global Head of Equities, FX and Alternative Products at CME Group. The expanded operation hours will apply to CME’s suite of crypto products, including Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and options. Trading will be available continuously via the CME Globex electronic platform, except for a two-hour maintenance window on weekends. On the other hand, weekend and holiday trades will be done on the next business day, with clearing, settlement, and regulatory reporting processed in the same way. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said the development shows that traditional finance is quickly conforming to DeFi practices, stressing that it was “just the beginning.” At a joint roundtable hosted by the SEC and CFTC this week, CEO Terrence Duffy said he expects demand for around-the-clock trading to grow, noting that crypto offers the clearest path to achieving it. Other executives shared the same views, with Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeff Sprecher highlighting that markets should determine which assets are suited for continuous trading. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman explained that her firm is working toward 24/5 equities but still faces practical challenges. Crypto Derivatives Hit Record Highs CME’s initiative might attract institutions seeking the security of a regulated exchange while avoiding the limitations of standard market hours. If approved, it could position the platform ahead of offshore rivals that already run nonstop but operate with less regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, the company’s crypto derivatives have reached new highs in 2025, with notional open interest hitting a record $39 billion in September. In August, average daily open interest rose by 95% from last year to 335,200 contracts, while average daily volume jumped 230% to 411,000 contracts. The exchange also reported a record of more than 1,010 large open interest holders across its crypto offerings.

The coin design was ordered by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, who currently oversees the Mint. It shows Trump’s face on one side, and his fist raised before an American flag on the other, with the words: “FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.” The project stems from bipartisan legislation passed in 2020, which Trump signed during his first term. That law gives the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $1 coins in 2026 that must reflect the United States’ semiquincentennial. While the design isn’t final, a spokesperson said the draft “reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.” They added, “Despite the radical left’s forced shutdown of our government, the facts are clear: Under the historic leadership of President Donald J. Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before.” Brandon Beach commented in a post on X that more details would be released “once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.” Trump pushes $1,000 to $2,000 rebate checks from tariffs On Thursday, Trump floated new checks for Americans, paid for with tariff revenues from his trade agenda. In an interview with One America News Network, Trump said the tariffs imposed on foreign countries are now starting to kick in, and he claimed they’d soon total “over a trillion dollars a year.” He added, “We’re thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000 — it would be great,” referring to the payments being considered. He’s previously called it “a dividend to the people of America.” But he acknowledged that Congress must approve any disbursement. The idea comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case next month on whether the president has the power to carry out global tariffs without congressional consent. Trump’s proposal is tied directly to that ongoing legal battle. According to Treasury data cited by Fox Business, the federal government has pulled in around $214.9 billion in tariff income so far this year. In September, $31.3 billion was collected, which was $73 million lower than August’s record. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the U.S. is expected to hit $300 billion in total tariff revenue by the end of 2025. Trump uses shutdown to target Democratic-led agencies As the federal government shutdown entered day two, Trump made it clear he sees it as a chance to slash funding for agencies he calls partisan. Speaking Thursday, Trump said Democrats handed him an “unprecedented opportunity” to start dismantling what he describes as wasteful parts of government. He pointed the blame directly at Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York and leading the opposition to his agenda. Just a day earlier, the Trump administration froze $18 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects in New York City, and canceled another $8 billion in climate-related funding for Democrat-controlled states. These cuts were announced not by the departments involved, but by Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Trump said he’d soon sit down with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut.” He also said they’ll decide “whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” On Truth Social, Trump posted, “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-03 21:53:10

Judge ruled NFTs were consumable collectibles, not investment contracts Judge Fernando M. Olguin found no common enterprise or explicit profit promise tied to Yuga’s NFT sales. Court cited precedent that most digital assets are not securities and noted independent fees and public blockchain trading data. Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge rules BAYC NFTs not securities under Howey Test — read the ruling and implications for NFT buyers and markets. What is the ruling in the Yuga Labs lawsuit? Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed by Judge Fernando M. Olguin concluded the plaintiffs failed to show Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ApeCoin (APE) and other Yuga NFTs qualify as securities under the Howey Test. The court held purchasers bought consumable digital collectibles and membership perks, not investment contracts tied to Yuga’s efforts. How did the court apply the Howey Test to BAYC and ApeCoin? The judge assessed the three Howey prongs—an investment of money, a common enterprise, and an expectation of profit produced by others—and found the plaintiffs proved none. The ruling noted Yuga marketed NFTs as collectibles with membership benefits and did not make explicit profit promises to buyers. Judge Olguin dismisses investor lawsuit against Yuga Labs. Source: Court Listener Why did the court find no common enterprise or profit expectation? Judge Olguin determined the NFTs’ trading on public blockchains and the transactional structure did not create the ongoing, dependent financial relationship required for a common enterprise. Fees paid to Yuga were treated as independent charges, and the roadmap and promotional statements did not equate to enforceable profit promises. The court emphasized: “Statements about a product’s inherent or intrinsic value are not necessarily statements about profit.” Even references to past prices or trading volumes were insufficient to establish an actionable expectation of profit under Howey. What evidence and precedent influenced the decision? The ruling referenced legal precedent that most digital assets are not automatically securities and examined specific contractual and marketing language from Yuga. Commentary from market participants and attorneys — including public posts by industry lawyers — were discussed as factual context without altering the court’s statutory analysis. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge finds BAYC and ApeCoin not securities under Howey Test"", ""description"": ""Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissed: Judge rules BAYC NFTs not securities under the Howey Test and finds no common enterprise or explicit profit promises."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199abe3-4502-79f8-bcbf-3bfe50df810b"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/yuga-labs-lawsuit-dismissed"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How the court applied the Howey Test to Yuga Labs NFTs"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step summary of how Judge Olguin evaluated whether Yuga Labs NFTs are investment contracts under the Howey Test."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199abe3-4502-79f8-bcbf-3bfe50df810b"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the investment of money"", ""text"": ""The court reviewed whether purchasers provided money or its functional equivalent when buying NFTs."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess common enterprise"", ""text"": ""The judge examined whether buyers’ fortunes were linked to Yuga Labs through an ongoing dependent financial relationship."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate expectation of profit"", ""text"": ""The court analyzed marketing, roadmaps and public statements to determine if Yuga promised profits derived from others’ efforts."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are BAYC NFTs and ApeCoin securities after this ruling?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The court dismissed the lawsuit, finding plaintiffs did not show BAYC NFTs or ApeCoin met the Howey Test requirements to be securities."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What did the court say about promises of profit?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The judge ruled that product-value statements and mentions of trading volumes alone did not constitute explicit promises of profit sufficient to meet Howey’s expectation-of-profit prong."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does this ruling change SEC policy on digital assets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""This decision is a federal court ruling applying Howey to specific facts; it provides judicial analysis but does not unilaterally change SEC regulation or enforcement policy."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Do the court’s findings apply to all NFTs? The decision applies to the specific facts of the Yuga Labs case. It reinforces that classification depends on contractual terms, marketing, purchaser expectations and how tokens function in practice. What role did the project roadmap play in the ruling? The roadmap and forward-looking statements were reviewed but the court found they did not create enforceable promises of profit tied to Yuga’s efforts, and thus did not satisfy the Howey expectation-of-profit prong. Key Takeaways Legal outcome : Federal judge dismissed investor claims that BAYC and related NFTs are securities. Howey Test application : Plaintiffs failed to show a common enterprise or clear expectation of profit produced by Yuga. Market implication : The ruling underscores that NFT classification is fact-specific; creators should clarify marketing and purchaser expectations. Conclusion The Yuga Labs lawsuit dismissal clarifies how a federal court applied the Howey Test to iconic NFTs, emphasizing that marketing as consumable collectibles and the absence of explicit profit promises weigh against securities classification. Market participants should document product features and communications to reduce regulatory ambiguity.

Ripple (XRP) remains a favorite, with its strong position in cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory progress maintaining it firmly in the crosshairs of institutional investors. Attention is now, however, trending more in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at a mere $0.035 in its Phase 6 presale, now over 55% sold out, MUTM is generating colossal hype among early adopters and whales alike. With 16,710+ addresses and $16.7 million raised, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be a DeFi altcoin with the potential to overshadow industry stalwarts like XRP, making it one of the most promising cryptos to buy now. XRP Experiences Symmetrical Triangle Breakout as SEC ETF Gives Updates XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, which would represent a breakout after recent price action higher. Price currently is trading in this pattern, where the breakout zone is at approximately $3.15, and a confirmed move above this point would seek to reach $3.50 and beyond based on previous momentum. Close resistance is seen around $3.08, and a heavy volume breakout would signal bullish continuation and good trading entries. With the US SEC withdrawing delay notices for XRP and other crypto ETFs, the market is poised for potential upside, and XRP is a key stock to watch on the watchlist. Meanwhile, investor focus is also turning towards emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is drawing rising interest in addition to established rivals. MUTM Presale Momentum Expands Velocity MUTM tokens currently cost $0.035 during Presale Round 6, a 16.17% rise from the previous round. Extremely firm investor appetite persists with over 16,710 investors moving over $16.7 million into the project so far. As a further step in enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat developers and hackers are welcome to report bugs. Four levels of severity of bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are made available so that bugs could be detected early and remediated. It is based on robust collateral management to protect the network and participants. Unlimited deposit limits, lending limits, and collateral ratios are some of the properties that secure it. Undercollateral position real-time closing and remediation charges and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the very center of the design of Mutuum Finance. Through LTV ratio optimization and assuming overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages as much capital as possible with effective guards. Reserve requirements are employed to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, and reserves overlying can be employed to hedge volatility in risk assets. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance on three axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is bringing DeFi to the retail and institutional investor bases. As a gesture to its growing base, Mutuum Finance launched a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 winners would be given $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The move is an indication of the platform’s intent to reward early adopters, as well as showcase its vision more prominently. Position Early for the ETF-Driven Surge With the ETF approval environment growing as rapidly as it is, both Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are set to benefit. XRP’s proven track record as a major international payment contender and regulatory progress keep it among the institutional exposure leaders. Yet those hoping for even greater upside have a limited early-stage window in MUTM. The project has already raised more than $16.7 million from more than 16,710 investors so far, with Phase 6 of its presale more than 55% sold and tokens still at $0.035. Its dual lending ecosystem, collateral optimization, and $50,000 bug bounty contribute to platform security and long-term upside, while a $100,000 giveaway encourages early adoption. Since ETF approvals drive market expansion at an accelerating pace, securing a stake in MUTM today might provide substantial returns during the next notable bull cycle.

It has clear resilience in one coin but overall weakness. Even during bouts of volatility, it is evident that the bull market shows no sign of dying. The conditions for expansion continue to be in place, from broad accumulation and undervalued altcoins to macro tailwinds, sentiment cycles and narrative rotation. If you aren’t looking at Bitcoin or Ethereum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could potentially benefit greatly as capital looks for profit upside. In the following paragraphs, I will highlight five major signs of durability this cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s role within the larger ecosystem, and provide tactical guardrails for participation. 1. High Proportion of Altcoins Below Key Moving Averages The altcoin universe is rife with latent upside, which is one of the most promising signals for bull market longevity. Despite a wider rally in crypto, 76 % of utcoins on major exchanges are still trading below their 200-day simple moving average (SMA), latest data indicates. This suggests that much of the market could still be in accumulation/discount zones instead of overbought areas. This difference means that if the feeling and money availability are right, many altcoins can go up. Furthermore, it lowers the odds of a straight reversal because strong bull markets tend to rally off weakness, meaning capital rotations in from laggards after leading assets confirm strength. 2. Declining Selling Pressure and Stabilizing Accumulation A strong bull market comes from confidence, not just momentum. A drop in selling pressure by long-term holders is one subtle but strong sign, paired with steady accumulation. Based on on-chain and exchange metrics, large level distributions appear to have slowed, whereas mid-tier wallets are seeing inflows. In other words, that kind of behavior indicates building of patience behind the moving averages, not panic buying at tops. In this market, crypto does not necessarily have to keep making new highs, but must avoid aggressive breakdowns. That ability to be resilient under pressure is a sign of deeper cycles. When accumulation zones hold, confidence returns and rotation into speculation becomes possible. 3. Macro Liquidity Tailwinds & Rate Dynamics Supporting Risk Assets Bull markets in crypto rarely exist in a vacuum. The situation with macro backdrops, especially liquidity flows and central bank policy direction affects strength. The latest investor expectations regarding interest rate cuts for late 2025 could lessen discounting pressures on the growth assets. Liquidity across the global markets is loosening and money flows from equities, private markets, and institutional allocations are eyeing digital assets. That cross-asset momentum can amplify crypto cycles. In previous runs, a considerable amount of the strongest legs came from macro/sector alignment. Speculators are aggressive when the risk appetite arises and rates fall. 4. Narrative Rotation and Expanding Themes Analysts are pointing to five key signals showing the bull market remains intact, from ETF inflows to rising retail participation. Within that framework, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining mention as a presale embodying the speculative wealth-creation angle. With contract audits from CertiK and HashEx , it avoids the pitfalls of many short-lived launches, while still carrying scenarios of 100x-style generational wealth outcomes under extreme bullish conditions. For long-term investors, the takeaway is clear: combining secure majors with small presale bets like MAGACOIN FINANCE is a way to capture both safety and exponential potential. As signals confirm bull strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being highlighted as the speculative ticket that could transform modest entries into cycle-defining wealth stories. Rather than competing with top alts, MAGACOIN FINANCE acts as a high-reward complement, an asset where flows looking for hidden alpha might concentrate once macro and narrative conditions are favorable. 5. Institutional & Retail Flows Still Entering – Not Exiting One of the easiest distinctions between a bull market that is tired and one that has matured is large flows. At the high points in the market cycle, we see exits and liquidations. For the time being, we’re seeing flows into Bitcoin and early-stage speculative allocations. ETF trackers are indicating sustained demand for spot Bitcoin funds. Retail and small cap interest remains healthy. Metrics show people are just re-engaging, not capitulating. In addition, retail search trends and social sentiment show this. The so-called “stable core inflows” plus speculative appetites form a stable core around which other financial systems can revolve. It indicates that there is more than just momentum driving the market, but new capital. Putting the Signs Together: Bull Market Underlying Strength A combination of five items including selling pressure, altcoins trading below long-term averages, macro tailwinds, narrative expansion, and institutional/retail flows can provide a blueprint for a bull market with legs. These signals show structural resilience, rather than a single breakout or hype event. Many cycles fail when one or more of these pillars breaks—the macro tightening, the narrative exhaustion, and the wholesale exits. But for now, the architecture remains intact. Tactical Strategy & Risk Management To position yourself through such a phase, here’s a disciplined approach: Anchor a core portfolio in BTC/ETH and market leaders. Allocate a growth bucket to promising alts with fundamentals. Reserve a tactical optional bucket for high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Use layered entries in speculative assets – don’t rush all capital at once. Watch confirmation triggers : volume breakouts, listing announcements, accumulation bursts. Maintain tight stop or reallocation zones to guard against sharp reversals. Track macro and narrative inflection points closely – liquidity, rate shifts, regulatory developments matter. Conclusion The crypto bull market still shows signs of life in the midst of noise. The entire cycle architecture is still intact, from undervalued alts and decreasing selling to macro support and narrative rotation and consistent inflows. Now, the real difference comes from where capital allocates next. During this stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE type projects are not very core holdings rather leveraged optionality at this stage. When the cycle expands outwards, they often capture disproportionate upside. For traders and allocators who are ready to balance the structured as well as the asymmetric bets; this stage could be one of the most rich when it comes to opportunities in the evolving history of crypto.

MAGACOIN FINANCE can be seen as one of the highest analyst picks that is expected to have an ROI of 55x at the end of 2025. XRP is in the meantime clinging to major support, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing the interest of whales from ETFs. Analysts indicate that the next altcoin season might be determined by these three coins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE becoming one of the best presale opportunities to deliver high returns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale Analysts place MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best crypto presale that could bring a 55x ROI by the end of 2025. This is an early-stage project that operates on the Ethereum blockchain with a deflationary token model and a transaction burn rate of 12% , meant to lower supply and push demand long term. It has independent smart contract audits, adding credibility to it, while aiding in ensuring investors of transparency and security in a time when trust is critical. Future exchange listings increase the presale momentum. By offering early buyers a potential return from increased demand when listings become available, analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE to have a healthy debut. Its mix of proven smart contracts, tokenomics based on scarcity, and aggressive growth strategy makes it stand out among dozens of speculative crypto presales on the market. In addition to technical strength, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in line with the major market trends. History has demonstrated that quality projects with strong fundamentals and a supportive community can perform well during the altcoin season. The project is anchoring its value proposition on both scarcity and adoption, thus creating a place of sustainable relevance. XRP price holds support as analysts monitor october move XRP is still under the watch of analysts, retaining the $2.67 support level , which has been defended over the months. Starting around $3.65 in July, XRP calmed down following Bitcoin, which went down to a low of about $109,000 after reaching a high of $125,000. However, analysts suggest the pullback is a good rest before possible upside to $7 in October. Supported by many macro and regulatory triggers, the spot crypto ETF application is undergoing review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, while the MiCA framework in Europe is progressing towards bringing digital asset clarity. Also, a speculation by traders that the Federal Reserve rate may be cut to $3.75-$4.00 could open up institutional inflows. Such advances would raise liquidity and trust in crypto markets, and XRP would have the catalyst to break out. Under this larger construct, MAGACOIN FINANCE will attract investors willing to have an early exposure with high growth prospects, rather than well-established projects such as XRP. With analysts estimating the Ethereum-based presale to yield 55x ROI , some traders are cashing in on XRP profits to purchase outsized presales to earn disproportionate profits. DOGE price steadies as whales accumulate and ETF buzz builds Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing attention from analysts, having withstood volatilities in the market and held the support level of $0.22 . On-chain data show that whales purchased 2 billion DOGE in 48 hours , contributing almost $480 million to its market value. This aggressive buildup has been a historical precursor of price rallies, which is an indicator of a possible bullish action in the coming weeks. On the other hand, sentiment is also driven by institutional adoption. The recently introduced REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF had inflows in excess of $8.7 million, and corporate investors like Thumzup Media are introducing DOGE to treasury reserves. Moreover, such moves, coupled with technical arrangements towards $0.30 and $0.35, according to analysts, indicate a stronger long-term development. With this bullish backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a presale opportunity that strengthens the upside of established names such as Dogecoin by having greater early-stage growth prospects. Conclusion According to analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto presale with a 55x ROI expectation , whose smart contracts and tokenomics are audited. As both XRP and Dogecoin remain strong contenders with institutional-level engagement and solid price action, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents an exceptional opportunity to get outsized returns before mainstream listings, placing the altcoin at the center stage in the next altcoin season.

According to crypto analyst Kevin, the historical risk levels that usually mark cycle tops are currently nowhere near flashing red for Dogecoin. Chart analysis of Dogecoin’s historical risk levels shows that the meme coin is still sitting in what looks like a mid-cycle phase, and the kind of overheated price action that preceeds exhaustion has not yet appeared. Dogecoin Historical Risk Levels Point To More Upside Kevin’s latest post on the social media platform X showcased Dogecoin’s historical risk levels in a color-coded chart between 0 and 1, with 0 being the lowest risk and 1 being the highest risk. The chart, which covers many cycles going as far back as 2014, shows moments when risk was at extreme levels and prices were near exhaustion. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Dogecoin Investors Should Expect Price-Wise This Month Periods of high market exhaustions are classified in warm colors, with red being the highest. For instance, Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021 was classified by a red risk level. On the other hand, those of low market activity are classified in cool colors, with deep blue being the lowest level of activity. The current reading of 0.52 is far from those red danger zones, which have historically aligned with blow-off tops. Instead, Dogecoin is currently in what Kevin describes as a mid-cycle state. That assessment aligns with the latest price action, which shows Dogecoin now holding above $0.25 after last week’s consolidation between $0.22 and $0.23. Dogecoin’s Biggest Move Still Ahead? With the latest Dogecoin risk level sitting at around 0.52, this suggests that Dogecoin has not yet entered the type of frenzy that often defines the final phase of a cycle. Therefore, it means that the king of meme coin still has a lot of rally to play out, and there’s the possibility of charting a path to a new all-time high if crypto market conditions provide the right backdrop. We have not had that type of price action yet this cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs Kevin’s latest update builds on observations he made earlier in August, where he noted the importance of monthly Stoch RSI crosses during bull market environments. Whenever Dogecoin registered such crosses outside of bear markets, the result was a massive upside rally. At that time, the Stoch RSI was climbing from the 13 level, and this is associated with weak momentum turning into strength. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2554, meaning it is up by about 12.5% in the past 24 hours. Given the current setup and the possibility of a Spot Dogecoin ETF hitting the US market soon, it is reasonable to expect that Dogecoin could climb much higher before it enters the overheated territory. In this case, hitting the $1 price level is not out of the question.

Solana’s ongoing upward trend in price has coincided with a remarkable surge in the blockchain’s on-chain activity and adoption. Q3 Blockchain Revenue Race Heats Up, And Solana Is Leading Following a recent rally in the price of SOL, there has been a strong uptick in on-chain activity and engagement. Specifically, the Solana blockchain is experiencing substantial inflows, as revenue increases sharply. The report from Solana’s official page on the social media platform X reveals that the blockchain is witnessing one of the fastest revenue growth rates in history. A surge in user activity, active DeFi participation, and a surge in demand for on-chain applications likely drive this sharp growth in revenue . Furthermore, the development highlights the blockchain’s competitive advantage and durability in a dense market. While competitors have found it difficult to keep up, Solana’s effectiveness and scalability keep drawing in developers and funding, putting it at the vanguard of blockchain ecosystem expansion and profitability. According to the data, Solana has cemented its position as a top-performing blockchain in the third quarter of this year in terms of overall revenue generated in the quarter. With over $222 million in revenue recorded in Q3, the blockchain has surpassed all major crypto networks in the sector. It is worth noting that after dominating Q3 of 2025, Solana has now led all major crypto networks for 4 consecutive quarters as number 1. SOL’s persistent dominance in revenue for the past four quarters is obviously sending a strong message about SOL’s place in the future of decentralized finance and scalable blockchain infrastructure. Over the last year, the platform highlighted that users on the SOL blockchain have paid the network more than $2.1 billion for blockspace. Interestingly, data shows that over 46% of the entire fees were paid in cryptocurrency. SOL Blockchain Is Becoming The Hub For Stablecoins The Solana blockchain’s adoption and interest are evidenced by the large number of stablecoin flows on the chain. In another X post from the official Solana page, stablecoin adoption on SOL is surging at an unprecedented pace when compared to other chains. In terms of stablecoin inflows , the SOL blockchain is at the top, outpacing all layer 1 and layer 2 chains over a period of 24 hours. This development implies that SOL is becoming the go-to settlement layer for stablecoin transfers due to its lightning-fast transaction speeds and incredibly cheap costs, which encourage record inflows and on-chain activity. With this dramatic increase in stablecoin inflows, SOL’s role in global crypto payments and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is clearly growing. In addition, it solidifies the network’s standing as the leading hub for dollar-pegged assets in the dynamic blockchain market.",Solana|decentralized finance|DeFi|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Blockchain|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|stablecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 22:00:30

The charter would allow Coinbase to build on its existing custody business by offering services such as payments and settlement, without seeking a charter as a full-service bank. ""Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank,"" Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase, said in a blog post. ""It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security."" Today, the U.S. crypto exchange's main regulated custody service is run through Coinbase Custody Trust Company (CCTC), which is licensed under New York state’s BitLicense regime. That framework, introduced in 2015, was one of the earliest state-level regulatory models for crypto in the U.S. A federal trust charter would give the company more flexibility to launch new financial services such as crypto payments without needing state-by-state approvals.

World Liberty Financial Sets Its Sights on Expansion Witkoff, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, made the announcement alongside WLF co-founder Donald Trump Jr. at the Singapore-based crypto event on October 1. “We’ll be rolling out a pilot program here in the next quarter, and that debit card will either be live Q4 or Q1 ‘26,” Witkoff said. The WLF CEO also touted that the organization is “actively working” on the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, oil, and gas.

In March 2025, WLF launched USD1, a dollar-pegged stablecoin that the digital asset organization dubs “the US dollar…for a new era.” In May, WLF announced that MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi firm, planned to invest $2 billion worth of USD1 into crypto exchange Binance. Critics have argued that the deal poses serious ethics violations , with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley calling it “a staggering conflict of interest.” “This deal raises the troubling prospect that the Trump and Witkoff families could expand the use of their stablecoin as an avenue to profit from foreign corruption,” the U.S. lawmakers said. Despite concerns, it appears that WLF is pressing ahead with its tokenization and crypto payment ventures.

In a statement released on October 2, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), chaired by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, pointed out vulnerabilities in so-called “third country multi-issuer” stablecoin models and called for immediate policy action. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a steady value by pegging to fiat currencies or government securities, have surged over the past five years into a market worth more than $300 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. The sector is dominated by dollar-backed tokens, with Tether’s USDT controlling more than 58% of the market. Euro-backed tokens, by contrast, account for just 0.15% of the global total. The ESRB, during its 59th General Board meeting on September 25, stressed that interchangeable tokens issued both within and outside the EU contain “built-in vulnerabilities.” Lagarde Pushes Back on Offshore Stablecoin Structures Under MiCA Gaps Under this structure, EU-regulated issuers must hold reserves locally, while non-EU partners manage identical tokens backed abroad. Regulators warn that during times of stress, investors could rush to redeem in the EU, overwhelming local reserves and leaving the bloc exposed to offshore liabilities. According to people familiar with discussions, the ESRB endorsed a recommendation to ban such models. Though non-binding, the move places pressure on EU authorities to either impose restrictions or outline other protections. At its meeting on 25 September, the General Board assessed the main risks to EU financial stability. Read the press release https://t.co/WHx4JHyIWc pic.twitter.com/YmVEGSIB4D — European Systemic Risk Board (@ESRBofficial) October 2, 2025 Both the ECB and ESRB declined to comment on the proposal, but Lagarde has repeatedly shown concern that the bloc’s regulatory framework, known as MiCA, leaves gaps in coverage for cross-border schemes. Lagarde compared the risk to past banking crises, where liquidity mismatches and inadequate reserves destabilized institutions across borders. She argued that unless strong equivalence regimes and safeguards for cross-border transfers are introduced, multi-issuer models should not be permitted to operate in Europe. The warnings come as global financial risks remain elevated. The ESRB noted that investor optimism has pushed asset valuations to record highs, leaving markets vulnerable to reversals. While stress tests show European banks are resilient, weak growth prospects and rising fiscal pressures continue to weigh on stability. The board pointed to ongoing geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies as additional challenges for Europe’s financial outlook. Stablecoins Face Rising Global Scrutiny as Regulators Warn of Systemic Risks Stablecoins are also under scrutiny elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee warned that poorly managed reserves could trigger fire sales and destabilize broader markets. The committee also flagged the risk of currency substitution, where foreign-denominated stablecoins weaken the use of domestic money. On October 1, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said systemic stablecoins may gain access to central bank accounts but warned that such tokens could reshape Britain’s financial system by separating money-holding from credit provision. Bank of England Governor says stablecoins could reduce UK reliance on commercial banks while proposing controversial ownership caps. #UK #Stablecoin https://t.co/TW5EGT8a6O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 In the United States, regulators have moved in a different direction. In July, Congress passed the GENIUS Act , the first federal law covering stablecoins, which sets capital and reserve requirements for issuers. Analysts at Morningstar DBRS project the market could exceed $1 trillion in annual payments by 2030. The firm described stablecoins as programmable money, combining fiat stability with blockchain efficiency to deliver faster, cheaper payments compared to systems such as SWIFT or wire transfers. Still, the rapid expansion of stablecoins has unsettled parts of the U.S. banking sector. Trade associations warn that adoption could drain deposits and disrupt lending. Coinbase has countered this view by releasing research in August , arguing that fears of deposit flight are overstated and that stablecoins reinforce the global role of the dollar. Coinbase published a defense against banking claims that stablecoins threaten financial stability, calling the ""deposit erosion"" narrative a ""myth"" protecting banks' $187 billion monopoly. #Coinbase #Stablecoin https://t.co/Kpshr7e1K2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 The exchange noted that banks already hold trillions in reserves at the Federal Reserve, offering little benefit to depositors, while stablecoins provide higher yields and near-instant settlement. For European regulators, the debate extends beyond banking competition. Officials warn that reliance on dollar-based tokens undermines financial sovereignty and weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy. ECB adviser Jürgen Schaaf has cautioned that the dominance of U.S. issuers such as Tether and Circle leaves Europe dependent on offshore structures. Circle and Paxos are among the issuers most affected by the EU’s proposed restrictions. Both manage reserves primarily in U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, while their EU operations are overseen by regulators in France and Finland. Authorities in both countries have so far declined to comment. The ESRB said it will publish a detailed report on stablecoins, crypto-investment products, and multi-function financial groups in the coming weeks. Its latest risk dashboard shows systemic risks in the EU remain “elevated,” reinforcing why stablecoins are now viewed as a pressing concern.

AI agents will route liquidity to the best-priced, most reliable stablecoins. Regulatory clarity and growing market depth have pushed stablecoins past $300 billion in market cap. Autonomous agents could compress fees, boost transaction volume and reshape payments infrastructure. AI agents stablecoins — Learn how AI routing can turn fragmentation into a competitive advantage; read expert insights and next steps. AI agents stablecoins are autonomous programs that can detect pricing and liquidity across issuers and instantly move funds to the most efficient stablecoin, potentially making fragmentation a market-level optimizer rather than a barrier to adoption. What is the role of AI agents in stablecoin adoption? AI agents stablecoins means autonomous software will analyze rates, liquidity and counterparty risk, then execute transfers to the optimal issuer. This capability can reduce user friction and ensure liquidity concentrates where execution and economics are best, speeding stablecoin adoption for payments and commerce. How could fragmentation become an advantage? Fragmentation historically creates liquidity silos and user confusion. But AI agents can treat fragmentation as a selection mechanism. By continuously comparing issuer economics, agents can route transactions to the lowest-cost provider. That competitive pressure may compress spreads, raise service quality and force issuers to improve fundamentals. Why has stablecoin market cap reached $300 billion and what does that mean? The stablecoin market exceeded $300 billion due to clearer regulation in major jurisdictions, institutional demand and increased retail use. Higher market cap increases depth and reduces slippage, making automated routing by AI agents more effective and reliable. Who are the key market participants and emerging models? Major dollar-backed issuers, algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins, and corporate-backed tokens like PayPal’s PYUSD now coexist. Each model offers different tradeoffs in liquidity, redemption mechanics and settlement speed. Market participants include industry leaders and new entrants building on unique business integrations. The rise of AI agents in crypto: what industry leaders say Paxos Labs co-founder Bhau Kotecha warns fragmentation can create confusion but adds AI agents will “switch instantly” to the best economics, turning fragmentation into a market optimizer. Similar views were expressed by other industry figures who expect agents to become core stablecoin users. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz highlighted that AI agents can drive transaction volumes for stablecoins by handling routine purchases on behalf of users, replacing slower settlement rails. Which companies are building relevant infrastructure? Cloudflare announced a project called NET dollar to enable instant AI-driven transactions. Other industry teams are experimenting with payment standards—examples include discussions around HTTP 402 as a payments primitive for agent-driven commerce. These initiatives point to an emerging stack combining fast rails, stablecoins and intelligent routing. NET Dollar stablecoin characteristics. Source: Cloudflare (mentioned as plain text) How will AI agents change fees, liquidity and user experience? AI agents can compress fees by constantly selecting lower-cost execution venues and aggregating liquidity. That reduces friction for end users and can enable micro-payments that were uneconomical with higher fees. Improved UX arises from agents handling complexity—users delegate choices and see fewer failed transactions or confusing options. Stablecoin ecosystem participants. Source: Ethereum Foundation (mentioned as plain text) What are the risks and required infrastructure changes? Risks include concentration of systemic liquidity, oracle and routing manipulation, and interoperability gaps across chains and custodians. Addressing these requires intent-based blockchain primitives, robust auditability and user data controls. Experts like Adrian Brink emphasize the need for intent-based infrastructure so users retain control over data and assets while agents act on their behalf. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can AI agents reduce stablecoin fragmentation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

AI agents evaluate economics, liquidity, settlement speed and counterparty risk, then route transactions to the issuer that optimizes those factors for the user’s intent. Are AI agents already using stablecoins today? Companies and research teams are building prototypes and standards; early production use is limited but accelerating as rails and regulation mature. Key Takeaways AI agents can optimize liquidity : Autonomous routing concentrates flows to efficient issuers, improving execution. Fragmentation may become competitive : Multiple issuer models can coexist if agents handle selection efficiently. Infrastructure matters : Intent-based primitives, fast rails and transparent pricing are prerequisites for safe adoption. Conclusion AI agents stablecoins are poised to change how stablecoins are used by routing liquidity, lowering costs and enabling new commerce models. As market cap grows past $300 billion, the focus shifts to building secure rails and standards so agents can safely act on users’ behalf.

Bitcoin is holding strong near $120,400, just 3% away from its record-breaking ATH in August. But while BTC holds the spotlight, smart money is flowing rapidly into altcoins and top-performing meme coins , many of which have already hit new highs this year. What’s behind this surge? Two historic policy shifts from Washington are rewriting the rules of the game. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act , the first-ever U.S. law built to legitimize and regulate stablecoins. Then came the SEC’s Project Crypto , a sweeping initiative to modernize securities laws for the digital asset era—a clear green light for broader institutional involvement. With bullish momentum accelerating, tokens like XRP, Zcash, and Aster are quickly emerging as top picks for traders hunting the next breakout opportunity. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Pioneer and Best Large Cap Crypto Altcoin of 2025 XRP ($XRP) reached a fresh peak of $3.65 on July 18 following the passage of the GENIUS Act, surpassing its 2018 high of $3.40. Since then, it has cooled to about $3.04, reflecting a 16.5% retracement. The asset’s appeal lies in its efficiency as a low-cost, fast settlement network for international transactions, positioning it as a viable challenger to traditional payment rails like SWIFT. Partnerships with organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and rising adoption among U.S. financial firms have only strengthened its credibility. Ripple’s growing influence was highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House crypto policy roundtable earlier this year. Its launch of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, shows its ambition to carve out a slice of the potentially trillion-dollar stablecoin sector. A decisive 2023 court ruling confirmed retail XRP sales are not securities, removing a long-standing regulatory overhang and allowing the token to rally to multi-year highs. Over the past year, XRP has gained 492%, far outperforming Bitcoin’s 98% rise. After a summer breakout, the coin consolidated near $3 before its typical September correction. Currently, its RSI has risen from 45 mid-week to around 57 today, indicating that a fairly broad and quick buy-in has been happening this week. While recent rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t spark an immediate breakout, likely due to markets pricing in the news, technical patterns show multiple bullish flags forming. With additional ETF decisions expected in mid-October, analysts suggest XRP could climb anywhere between $5 and $10, or higher. Zcash ($ZEC): Privacy-First Crypto Rallies an Astonishing 172% in 7 Days Zcash ($ZEC) is a developing privacy-focused cryptocurrency that emerged in 2016 from a fork of the Bitcoin codebase. While Bitcoin’s transactions are public and pseudonymous, Zcash was engineered to offer a solution for those who seek genuine financial privacy. The core of its technology is a cryptographic breakthrough known as zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). This innovation allows for transaction validation on a public blockchain without revealing key metadata, such as the sender, recipient, or the amount transacted. The Zcash protocol provides a unique dual-address system, giving users the choice between transparent, Bitcoin-like addresses and completely shielded addresses, allowing for selective disclosure and enabling users to share transaction details for auditing or compliance purposes while maintaining confidentiality for other transactions. In the last seven days, Zcash rallied a phenomenal 172% and now trades around $147, as demand for privacy coins surges with a broader “Uptober” rally. Zcash may have gained the most, but other projects like Dash ($DASH) and Verge ($XVG) rallied close to 100% over the last seven days. That said, Zcash’s high RSI of 92 indicates it is due a correction, which could take it back to the sub-$100 level in the short-term. However, as we move towards the New Year, bulls will likely be eying $300 as the next leg up. Aster (ASTER) Aster ($ASTER) represents a new generation of decentralized perpetual exchanges, a project born from the strategic merger of two successful DeFi protocols, Astherus and APX Finance. The platform’s objective is to bridge the gap between the user experience of centralized exchanges and the security of on-chain trading. By offering both perpetual contracts and spot trading on a single interface, Aster aims to simplify and enhance the DeFi trading experience for a broad spectrum of users, from novices to seasoned professionals. In the last fortnight, Aster rose 206% and now trades at around $194. In the last 24 hours, the price rose 6%, making it one of the most profitable cryptos all around. With Binance’s CZ continuing to promote the project, ASTER has a real chance of reaching $5 and beyond soon. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Infused Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales For those looking outside the listed tokens, over in the presales market, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is gaining momentum as one of 2025’s standout ICOs. It blends Bitcoin’s proven security with Layer-2 scalability while tapping into the viral energy of meme culture and community-led governance. The project’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster payments, smart contract support, and decentralized governance. So far, the presale has raised more than $21 million, with some analysts projecting 10× returns or more once it launches. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers ultra-low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, meme tokens, and seamless payment rails. A recent Coinsult security audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, increasing confidence among early investors. The HYPER token underpins the ecosystem by powering staking, governance rights, and transaction fees. Early backers can currently earn up to 56% APY through staking while also securing voting privileges once the DAO activates.

Bitcoin, the $2 trillion cornerstone of the digital asset market, is currently trading about 4% shy of its record high of $124,128. It advanced 2% overnight, mirroring the 2% increase in overall crypto market capitalization, which has now reached $4.19 trillion. Historically, October, (nicknamed “Uptober”), has been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, adding weight to expectations that new peaks for leading cryptocurrencies may be just around the corner. Meanwhile, U.S. policy shifts are providing additional tailwinds. In July, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first federal law requiring stablecoins to maintain full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, a sweeping modernization effort to align securities regulations with the digital asset space. With clearer rules emerging, some analysts believe the upcoming altcoin run could even surpass the heights of 2021. If DeepSeek’s predictions play out, XRP, Solana, and Pepe could be at the forefront of this move. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Sees Path Toward $10 According to DeepSeek, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could rally to $10 by the end of 2025, more than triple its current $3.04 price point. Source: DeepSeek AI The token has already shown resilience this year, briefly touching $3.65 on July 18, its highest since 2018’s $3.40 peak, before sliding back 16.5% due to various macro-economic and political pressures. Ripple continues to strengthen its payments infrastructure, securing institutional adoption worldwide. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as a cost-effective remittance tool for developing nations. A major turning point came in early 2025, when the SEC officially dropped its long-running lawsuit after a 2023 court decision ruled that retail XRP sales did not constitute securities. DeepSeek believes that a decisive breakout above the July high could set XRP on course for $5 to $10 before year-end. ChatGPT and other AI models even suggest a more aggressive scenario, projecting potential runs toward $20. Over the past year, XRP has gained 492%, dramatically quintupling Bitcoin’s 99% and Ethereum’s 90% gains over the same period. Technicals are favorable as well, with three bullish flag formations developing in 2023, hinting at high upside potential into Q4. Although Fed rate cuts and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t trigger an immediate breakout. However, Uptober hype, new ETF approvals in mid-October, and fresh U.S. crypto legislation by Christmas could be powerful catalysts. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek AI Predicts a Surge Toward $1,200 Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself as a leading smart contract blockchain, boasting a market cap above $124.8 billion and over $12.6 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem. Developer activity and institutional adoption remain strong and expanding. Speculation is building that a spot Solana ETF in the U.S. could soon emerge, potentially sparking inflows similar to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding fuel to the narrative, President Trump has floated the possibility of incorporating Solana into a proposed U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Under his concept, however, the government would only acquire SOL through asset seizures, not direct buying. In terms of price action, Solana peaked at $250 in January, slipped to $100 in April, and rebounded to $247 on September 19, nearly retesting this year’s highs. At it’s current price of $230, it’s once more eying a new high watermark. Now breaking out of a bullish flag, DeepSeek projects that Solana could reach $1,200 by year-end, more than quadruple its all-time high of $293.31. Still, this target hinges on ETF approval and ongoing regulatory clarity. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin With 10× Upside Potential Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, has quickly cemented itself as a top-three meme coin with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, the most valuable meme coin not tied to a dog theme. Its appeal lies in cultural relevance, drawing from Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic series. Despite fierce competition, Pepe’s strong liquidity and community backing have helped it stay relevant. Elon Musk has even joked about holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin on X, further boosting its visibility. Currently priced at $0.00001003, Pepe has pulled back but continues to hold firm at key support levels. A decisive breakout above $0.000018–$0.000022 could open the path to $0.00003 by mid-autumn. DeepSeek envisions a bull market scenario where Pepe could climb as high as $0.0001, a staggering 10× jump. While such gains may be constrained by its already substantial market cap, the token could still deliver outsized performance compared to other meme plays. Technical charts show a descending wedge between November and March, a typically bullish pattern that could help drive Pepe to $0.00005 by winter, effectively quintupling its value. With U.S. regulatory clarity improving, Pepe could be positioned for far larger moves. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Side Play While DeepSeek sees propitious things for the above coins, one project that is flying under its radar is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a speculative meme coin marketing itself as Dogecoin’s long-lost degen gym bro cousin. It caters to traders drawn to high-volatility, small-cap bets backed by community hype. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap asset, Maxi Doge embraces its high-risk, meme-driven identity. Since its launch, it has already raised $2.7 million in just a few weeks. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI focuses on community-led growth via Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading competitions, and upcoming partnerships. Out of its 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing and collaborations. Staking is live, offering rewards up to 125% APY, though yields will decline as participation increases. At present, presale tokens are available at $0.0002605, with higher pricing scheduled in future rounds. Investors can buy through the Maxi Doge website using wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet .

XRP trading range compressed in a descending triangle with $2.70–$2.80 support and $3.60 as the immediate breakout target. Fibonacci resistances at $3.12 (0.5), $3.25 (0.382) and $3.40 (0.236) align with recent rejection zones. Long-term inverse head-and-shoulders structure sets a $4.80 potential if neckline support holds and volume confirms the breakout. Meta description: XRP breakout setup front-loaded with primary keyword. XRP breakout nears $3.60; monitor Fibonacci resistances and volume — read technical outlook and next steps. XRP trades at $3.03 with analysts eyeing $3.60 breakout as Fibonacci levels and long-term patterns point toward $4.80 potential. XRP consolidates in a descending triangle, with analysts targeting a potential $3.60 breakout. Fibonacci levels show key resistance at $3.12, $3.25, and $3.40 before a move higher. Long-term structure signals a possible path toward $4.80 if neckline support holds firm. XRP is showing technical signs of strength as it trades near a critical breakout point. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $3.03 after rebounding from September’s low of $2.71. Chart structures and Fibonacci levels are pointing toward a possible upward move toward the $3.60 mark. What are the key technical breakout levels for XRP? XRP breakout technicals center on the descending triangle that has contained price action since August. The immediate support range sits at $2.70–$2.80 while near-term resistance clusters at $3.12, $3.25 and $3.40. Clearing these zones increases the odds of a move to $3.60 within the triangle projection. How do Fibonacci retracements shape short-term targets? Fibonacci retracement plotted from $2.67 to $3.66 places the 0.618 at $2.93, a level buyers have defended. The 0.5 and 0.382 levels at $3.12 and $3.25 respectively map to recent rejection areas. The 0.236 near $3.40 is the final resistance band before the projected $3.60 breakout target. $XRP looks set to break out of a triangle, with $3.60 as the target. pic.twitter.com/ldP7rMCCn4 — Ali (@ali_charts) October 2, 2025 Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the triangle’s projection to $3.60, matching the July swing high. The pattern shows compressed volatility typical before decisive moves, meaning volume confirmation and a clean weekly close above the descending trendline would be meaningful confirmations. What does long-term structure indicate for XRP? Higher-timeframe structure suggests a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a neckline near current resistance bands. If support above the neckline holds and buyers sustain momentum, the measured target from that structure sits around $4.80. Source: JavonMarks (X) Market participation supports the technical case: spot and futures activity show elevated open interest and near $7 billion in trading volume across major venues. Rising volume during a breakout would add conviction to extension targets in the $3.85–$4.00 area and the longer-term $4.80 projection. How should traders monitor the breakout and manage risk? Traders should watch for a weekly close above the descending trendline and $3.12–$3.25 resistance band, confirmed by rising volume and open interest. Risk management should prioritize keeping stops below the $2.70–$2.80 support zone and scaling position size ahead of major resistance tests. Frequently Asked Questions Will XRP reach $3.60 soon? Short-term price action favors a move to $3.60 if XRP breaks above the descending trendline and clears resistance at $3.12–$3.40 with volume confirmation. The probability increases with a weekly close above the triangle’s upper boundary. Is $4.80 a realistic long-term target for XRP? Yes. A confirmed inverse head-and-shoulders on higher timeframes points to a measured target near $4.80, provided the neckline holds and macro liquidity conditions remain supportive. Key Takeaways Triangle consolidation: Price compressed between $2.70–$2.80 support and a descending trendline, signaling a potential breakout. Fibonacci alignment: Resistance at $3.12, $3.25 and $3.40 are key levels to clear for a move to $3.60. Volume & structure confirm: Rising volume and a weekly close above the trendline would support extensions toward $3.85–$4.00 and $4.80. Conclusion Front-loaded technical signals for the XRP breakout show a clear short-term path to $3.60 if resistance zones and the descending trendline are overcome. Long-term structure offers a $4.80 upside scenario contingent on neckline support and volume confirmation. Monitor Fibonacci levels, volume, and weekly closes for actionable signals. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-technical-outlook-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""XRP Nears $3.60 Breakout; Fibonacci Levels and Long-Term Structure Point to $4.80"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-33.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-03T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""XRP trades at $3.03 with analysts eyeing a $3.60 breakout; Fibonacci resistance and long-term patterns point toward $4.80 potential if neckline support holds."" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will XRP reach $3.60 soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""If XRP breaks above the descending trendline and clears resistance between $3.12 and $3.40 with confirming volume, the projected triangle target of $3.60 is likely."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is $4.80 a realistic long-term target for XRP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A higher-timeframe inverse head-and-shoulders pattern targets approximately $4.80, conditional on sustained neckline support and continued market participation."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor an XRP breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks to validate an XRP breakout using price, Fibonacci levels, and volume."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-33.png"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-technical-outlook-2025#step1"", ""name"": ""Identify pattern and key levels"", ""text"": ""Locate the descending trendline and support at $2.70–$2.80.

Short sellers bore the brunt, which helps explain the sudden surge. Rapid liquidations can push a price higher quickly, and that kind of move often brings extra volatility right after the spike.

An unexpected ADP payroll print showed a decline of 32,000 jobs in September versus forecasts calling for a 50,000 gain. Official US employment data took a timeout amid stoppage of government functions, leaving traders to weigh partial signals. The CME FedWatch tool put the odds at about 97% for a 25 bps rate cut at the October 29 Fed meeting, and it flagged another potential cut at the December 10 meeting. Those shifting rate expectations appear to have pushed some investors toward assets like gold and cryptocurrencies. Network Changes And Fee Cuts BNB Chain’s own moves helped the rally. Validators cut the minimum gas fee from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei earlier this week, following prior reductions that moved fees from 3 Gwei to 1 Gwei in April 2024 and then to 0.1 Gwei in May 2025. Block intervals were tightened from 750 milliseconds to 450 milliseconds, and proposals now aim for per-transaction fees near $0.005 with a longer-term target of $0.001. Today, all BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators and builders have adopted the new minimum gas price of 0.05 Gwei and BSC is fully ready to accept transactions at this rate. That’s ~$0.005 per transaction, making BSC one of the most cost-efficient blockchains in crypto.

Community Speculates,https://bitcoinist.com/what-ripple-cto-resignation-mean/,"With Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz announcing plans to resign, community members have begun to speculate what this could mean for the XRP price . This comes as XRP reclaims the psychological $3 level, providing a bullish outlook for the altcoin. What Ripple CTO’s Resignation Means For The XRP Price In an X post , community member unknowDLT said that it is no coincidence that the Ripple CTO is stepping down right before XRP ETFs and global ISO 20022 adoption . He added that Schwartz knows the liquidity flood will trigger a supply shock and push XRP’s price up as it becomes the backbone for settlements. However, it is worth noting that the Ripple CTO stated that he will not be stepping down until the end of the year. As such, he is expected to still be in his role when this projected XRP price surge occurs. The XRP ETFs are expected to launch as early as this month, while the adoption of ISO 20022 could occur in November. While unknowDLT believes that the XRP price is set to rally amid Ripple’s CTO departure, crypto pundit Bitlord has suggested that this is bearish for the altcoin. He stated that it was time to sell XRP, highlighting why the resignation was suspicious. The pundit further remarked that the market is at the stage where Ripple will begin to openly admit failure. Resignation Comes Amid Increased Competition Bitlord also noted that Schwartz’s announcement came at a critical time, when SWIFT announced plans to launch its blockchain ledger. The crypto pundit had declared that it was ironic that XRP was replaced overnight by the very thing it sought to replace. With SWIFT building its ledger, there is a belief that XRP may not be the foremost crypto for payment settlement, which is bearish for the XRP price. He further explained that there is increased competition to look forward to and no clear answers from Ripple. In line with this, he remarked that the Ripple CTO stepping down to enjoy life and hobbies isn’t exactly bullish for the XRP price. The pundit also speculated that XRP can no longer dump successfully on retail, which is why Schwartz was joining Ripple’s board. He believes that this move is in preparation for an IPO . Bitlor questioned what this would mean for XRP holders , adding that they would find out in the coming months. The XRP price has climbed above $3 amid the speculations about what the Ripple CTO’s resignation could mean for the altcoin. It is also worth noting that the altcoin showed little reaction on the day Schwartz announced plans to resign. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $3.02, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|Altcoin|Bitlord|Coinmarketcap|David Schwartz|ISO 20022|ripple|SWIFT|UnknowDLT|XRP|XRP holders|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|WALLET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-03 23:00:23

Analysts point to the similarities with a 37,800% explosion rally in 2017, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on a climb following a trend breakout. Similarly, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making altcoin headlines with high presale demand and DeFi integrations. XRP Price Could Hit $5 This Altseason XRP price ended Q3 2025 at around $2.90, equivalent to a 28% quarterly gain which is the highest price recorded by the crypto. Analysts such as Milkybull Crypto believe the trend is reflecting 2017, when a comparable breakout was followed by an eventual rally to $3.31. The decisive move of the Ripple token over the $2.20-$2.30 resistance band is an indication of further strength. Moreover, there is on-chain data that confirms this bullish rally. The MVRV Z-Score is in the middle range, meaning that it can gain between $3 to $5. Mid-sized holders, with 10,000 to 100,000 XRP, are not selling, hence adding to the market confidence. Additionally, further buying pressure may be ignited by pending October ETF decision deadlines, such as Grayscale and 21Shares filings. Regardless of the above positives there is technical caution. XRP is currently 470% above the low it had in November 2024 and the weekly RSI shows divergence, indicating that it is losing momentum. XRP Price $15 Long-term Target Meanwhile, several analysts see Ripple’s current formation as the beginning of a multi-year rally toward $15 . Top analysts compared today’s quarterly breakout to 2017, when XRP quickly surpassed multi-year resistance. Technical indicators such as a symmetrical triangle and bull flag indicate eventual price increase within the range of $5-$15. Source: TradingView Following this perspective, the long-term projection of XRP gives an average price of $3.40 by December 2025 and a possible increase to $4.48 in 2026. By 2030, certain models project a peak of up to $9.86 and with the long term market momentum, there is a possibility of reaching as high as $15 with the right macroeconomic factors. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently broke above a descending trendline on the 2-hour chart, sparking predictions of a 25% short-term rally. Market analyst Satososhi1242 predicted a move toward $0.00001460 after SHIB rebounded from a retest at $0.00001158. Source: TradingView Community optimism is reinforced by larger patterns, including a potential falling wedge breakout on the weekly chart. Analyst expects a climb toward $0.00004567, while MMBTrader predicts a long-term rally as high as $0.00007730. Key SHIB price support remains near $0.00001230, a crucial level that must be maintained to sustain bullish momentum. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is Leading the Altcoin Buzz As XRP and SHIB dominate price discussions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is redefining the crypto presale market. The Ethereum-based DeFi project has gathered over $14 million with over 13,500 holders. Alternatively, the capital efficiency and security of the project are also attractive to retail and institutional investors. Anti-rug systems and transparent vesting plans, as well as Hashex and CertiK audits all create trust in the coin. Analysts estimate returns of up to 400x , making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best-performing altcoins to watch in the next crypto bull cycle . Conclusion XRP price records an all-time high quarterly close, supporting the argument of a rally to $5 in 2025 as well as $15 in the long term, with short-term corrections. In the meantime, a breakout in Shiba Inu price trend supports a short-term upswing, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is a powerful presale, having DeFi utility and 400x ROI. These strong points are influencing investor sentiment as the market enters the next altcoin season.

PolyMarket Split 50/50 as $500M Meme Coin Factory Faces Crash Fears,https://cryptonews.com/news/pump-fun-ath-this-year-polymarket-split-50-50-as-500m-meme-coin-factory-faces-crash-fears/,"Polymarket has opened a new prediction market centered on Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin launchpad that has rapidly become one of the most active platforms in the crypto ecosystem. The market lets users wager on whether Pump.fun’s token, PUMP, will reach a new all-time high by December 31, 2025. NEW POLYMARKET: Pump​.fun ATH this year? https://t.co/JqBmmJqSZn — Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 3, 2025 At present, the betting odds are split evenly, with “Yes” and “No” outcomes each priced at 50%. The balance reflects uncertainty among traders, who are weighing Pump.fun’s rapid growth against questions about its long-term sustainability. Pump.fun Drives Nearly 13M Token Launches on Solana, $500M in Fees Collected Since launching in early 2024, Pump.fun has facilitated the creation of more than 7 million tokens, according to Galaxy Research. Nearly 13 million of the 32 million tokens on Solana have been launched through Pump.fun, marking a near 300% increase in under two years. Tokens on the platform represent $4.8 billion in fully diluted market value, while Pump.fun itself has generated close to $500 million in fees. The platform’s expansion has had a direct impact on the wider Solana ecosystem. High trading volumes on Pump.fun have funneled liquidity into Solana, at times supporting gains in SOL’s price. At its peak, Pump.fun revenue reached $13.48 million in a single week between August 11 and August 17, its strongest performance since February. Over the past 30 days, the launchpad has generated around $120 million in fees, according to DefiLlama. Source: DefiLlama Daily activity remains high. In the last 24 hours, Pump.fun recorded $134.3 million in trading volume and 114,457 active addresses. More than 20,000 new tokens were deployed on the platform, while 95 “graduates” advanced beyond the bonding curve stage. Fees collected over the same period totaled $1.29 million. Source: Dune Despite these milestones, concerns linger. Data shows that 98.6% of Pump.fun tokens are classified as scams or pump-and-dump projects, raising questions about sustainability. Median holding times for Solana meme coins have also collapsed to about 100 seconds, down from 300 seconds a year earlier, showing the dominance of bots and scalpers in trading activity. Pump.fun launched its own token, PUMP, in July through an initial coin offering that raised $500 million in under 12 minutes. The token has since seen sharp moves. It reached an all-time high of $0.008819 but now trades at $0.007028, about 20% below that peak but still up 75% in the past 30 days. Its market capitalization stands at $2.48 billion, ranking it 66th on CoinGecko. The introduction of Polymarket’s new betting market adds another dimension to the story, giving investors a structured way to quantify sentiment. With odds currently split, the market highlights both confidence in Pump.fun’s explosive growth and caution over the volatility of meme coin-driven ecosystems. Pump.fun Token Gains Momentum Amid Ecosystem Upgrades and Institutional Interest Pump.fun has continued to draw attention with a mix of ecosystem updates, exchange listings, and corporate adoption, fueling bullish sentiment for its native token, PUMP. The platform’s major upgrade, Project Ascend, announced on September 2, introduced a new creator fee structure aimed at improving token sustainability . The system, called Dynamic Fees V1, lowers fees as market capitalization rises, encouraging long-term projects rather than short-lived speculative launches.

Expansion efforts have followed swiftly. In mid-September, Binance added PUMP to its spot market, offering traders a chance to share in a 350 million token reward pool. On October 1, Pump.fun announced new payment integrations with Apple Pay, Robinhood, Phantom, and others, streamlining onramps for users with low fees and instant trading access Institutional interest has also emerged. On October 2, Australia’s Fitell Corporation disclosed a purchase of 216.8 million PUMP tokens worth $1.5 million , adding them to its treasury as part of a broader Solana-focused investment strategy.

Tron supply squeeze: ~89% staked, tight circulating supply. Strong taker-buy CVD and positive funding rates support continued gains.

Key levels, funding rates and CVD confirm bullish bias with elevated volatility risk.""} What is the Tron supply crunch? Tron supply crunch refers to the steady reduction of liquid TRX available for trading as a large portion of the circulating supply is locked in staking. With nearly 89% of circulating tokens staked, the circulating float is thin, which intensifies price moves on relatively small flows. How does TRX staking affect liquidity? High staking ratios reduce available liquidity and magnify the market impact of inflows and outflows. When 89% of supply is staked, even modest taker-buy volume in futures can push the TRX price sharply higher. Conversely, a wave of unstaking or exchange inflows can produce swift corrections. Can TRX price sustain momentum above its ascending trendline? The daily chart shows TRX holding above a multi-month ascending support trendline, preserving a bullish structure. Key technical levels to watch are support near $0.331 and resistance at $0.355 , where a sustained breakout could open targets toward $0.40 and higher. Failure to maintain the ascending support would increase downside risk and could shift sentiment quickly, given the market’s elevated leverage and concentrated staked supply. Source: TradingView (price chart) What market signals confirm Tron’s next major move? Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) shows persistent taker-buy dominance, indicating futures traders are aggressively leaning long. Positive funding rates and strengthening momentum together validate the bullish thesis while also increasing liquidation risk if momentum reverses. Futures taker buy volume signals: What does CVD reveal? The CVD surge demonstrates that buy-side flow is strong and consistent, reinforcing price resilience. When taker-buy CVD rises alongside price and positive funding, it signals conviction among leveraged participants that the trend will continue. Source: CryptoQuant (on-chain / derivatives flow) TRX positive funding rates: Why they matter? Funding across TRX perpetuals is modestly positive (≈0.009% at time of writing), meaning longs pay shorts. This confirms leverage is skewed to longs and supports higher spot prices, but prolonged positive funding raises liquidation vulnerability.

High staking tightens float, and elevated leverage amplifies both gains and losses; traders should size positions conservatively and use stop management because liquidity shocks can trigger rapid moves. What signals would invalidate the bullish case for TRX? A decisive daily close below the ascending support near $0.331, combined with falling CVD and a shift to negative funding, would weaken the bullish outlook and increase downside probability. Key Takeaways Supply squeeze : Heavy staking (~89%) reduces circulating TRX and magnifies price sensitivity. Derivatives confirmation : Rising taker-buy CVD and modestly positive funding support continuation. Risk management : Monitor $0.355 resistance and $0.331 support; use position sizing and stops to manage volatility. Conclusion Tron’s supply dynamics and derivatives positioning create a bullish setup for TRX price, but the same factors raise volatility risk. Traders should watch the ascending trendline, CVD and funding rates closely. With demand intact, TRX can continue higher — yet disciplined risk controls remain essential.",News|FLOW|TRX,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRX|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-03 23:14:05

X user Kevin Capital, who is followed by more than 24,000 traders, pointed out that DOGE’s monthly chart has just triggered several buy indicators that have historically marked major breakouts.

The goal is to get the StochRSI to cross the 20 level and show follow through as anything below that level is… pic.twitter.com/FxrohrzlXo — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) August 27, 2025 The combination of these technical indicators favors a bullish Dogecoin price prediction that could see the token rising to $1 first during this cycle and possibly to $10 in the long term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Needs to Break Out of This Pattern to Start Its Next Leg Up The daily chart shows that Dogecoin has been on an uptrend for a while, making a series of higher lows along the way since October 2024. A bullish breakout above the price channel shown in the chart would set off a strong rally for the token that would likely reach those levels first. Meanwhile, if DOGE surpasses that mark, the stage will be set for another move toward $1 , meaning a new all-time high for the token. Although getting to $10 may take a while, DOGE’s long-standing upward trajectory should continue as Wall Street keeps embracing meme coins. The launch of an ETF linked to DOGE is evidence that institutional adoption is on the rise. Similarly, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could outperform well-established tokens during this cycle. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings 1000x Energy to the Trading World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the legendary doge meme and turns it into the face of a trading community built for degens who love going big.

With total market capitalization climbing above $4.24 trillion, investors are preparing for what could be the most explosive phase of this cycle. XRP, ETH, and SOL are all showing signs of major breakouts following weeks of overselling and quiet accumulation. This article breaks down the technical and fundamental signals behind each coin, highlighting the levels to watch as the market gears up for its next leg higher. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Rising Open Interest Signal New ATH Incoming XRP has risen to $3.04 today, equalling a 2% gain in 24 hours and a 10% increase in a week. The major altcoin is also up by 7% in a month, while also boasting an impressive 490% increase in a year, underlying its growth in the wake of Donald Trump’s inauguration and the end of the Ripple-SEC case. There are many reasons to be bullish about XRP, including the fact that a wave of XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the coming weeks , boosting institutional demand for the token. Demand for XRP is also growing as a result of Ripple’s expansion as a firm, with the company signing multiple new partnerships in recent months, as well as expanding into new territories. This means that XRP is in a fantastic position to ride what may be the start of an end-of-year rally, judging by recent moves. Source: TradingView It looks as though XRP is going to break out of the pennant in which it has been trading in recent weeks, while its indicators are both rising strongly from oversold positions. Such changes come as open interest for XRP futures has risen back to $8 billion , having risen from just over $7 billion in August. This points to rising prices, with XRP likely to rise beyond $3.50 by the end of the month, before reaching $5 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – Institutions and Company Reserves to Push Altcoin Even Higher in Q4 Ethereum has risen by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $4,487 also representing a bullish 15% increase in the last seven days. The coin is also up by 96% in a year, giving it a good platform from which to post more gains, especially when it’s still undersold relative to recent moves. Looking at its chart, we see that it has begun to gain strong momentum, with its relative strength index (yellow) bouncing from 30 in late September to just over 50 today. Likewise, its MACD (orange, blue) is about to turn positive for the first time in a couple of weeks, implying that buying pressure will be ramping in the near term. Source: TradingView And when combined with Ethereum’s almost peerless fundamentals, this makes for a fantastic crypto price prediction for ETH. Ethereum continues to dominate the crypto ecosystem in terms of TVL ( at $93.7 billion ), while a growing number of firms have been establishing ETH reserves in recent weeks. Based on this, and based on the expectation of a bull rally, we could see the ETH price break the $5,000 barrier by the end of this month, before hearing towards $10,000 in the longer term. Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Altcoin Could Break ATH in Matter of Weeks Solana has risen to $230 today, making for an 18% increase in a week and a 10% return in a month. Also of note is the fact that Solana has risen by 67% in the past year, which is arguably not that much in comparison to other major alts (especially XRP). Yet the argument to make from this is that it means that Solana still has big gains left in it this year, with the coin only 21% away from its ATH of $293. Probably the most exciting thing about Solana right now is that, as with XRP, it has several ETFs waiting to launch. We could therefore see an explosion in its price in the next couple of months, also helped by public firms opening SOL reserves and funds . Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that it has begun to break out after the correction it sustained in late September, and its next stop is $250, which if broken could predict a climb towards its ATH. Because of the bullishness surrounding SOL, it has every chance of rising above $300 in the next few weeks, while it could comfortably near $500 in December. PEPENODE Crosses $1.6 Million in Presale: Could Mine-to-Earn Be Next Big Pepe Token? As good as the tokens above look, some traders may want to diversify into newer coins, so as to widen their exposure to potential market-beating gains. One way of doing this is to look at presale coins, which under the right circumstances can rally big once they list for the first time. An interesting example of such a token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 coin that recently opened its ICO. Just as the legends predicted… A Virtual Mine-to-Earn platform in the palm of your hand. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/tOsvFJMgo4 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 1, 2025 It has now raised over $1.6 million in this sale, testifying to its potential once it launches. Much of this potential stems from its status as the market’s first ‘mine-to-earn’ crypto, one which gives holders the ability to earn rewards by building their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, users can earn greater rewards, which the project will pay out in established meme coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. This could drive demand for PEPENODE, which will also be open to staking, with its current yield in excess of 800%. All of this makes PEPENODE one of the more exciting presale tokens, with investors able to join its sale by going to the project’s official website . The token is currently available at $0.001083, but newcomers should act quickly since this price will continue to rise regularly until the sale ends. Buy PEPENODE Here.

The release, which took place on Thursday, October 2nd, coincides with the start of a bullish period many in the crypto community have dubbed “Uptober.” According to blockchain monitoring platform Whale Alert , the unlocked XRP was distributed in four separate transactions: two batches of 400 million and two batches of 100 million, totaling 1 billion XRP. Based on XRP’s trading price at the time, these tokens represented approximately $3 billion in market value. While Ripple’s monthly escrow releases are predictable, this month’s release was slightly delayed, occurring a day later than the usual schedule. Ripple’s Escrow System Ripple’s escrow mechanism is designed to regulate the circulation of XRP and prevent excessive supply from destabilizing the token’s value. Each month, the company releases up to 1 billion XRP, often returning unsold portions to escrow after limited market activity. This structured approach aims to balance liquidity and scarcity, ensuring that XRP’s price is not unduly impacted by large, uncontrolled sales. The October release attracted particular attention due to its timing. The market momentum surrounding XRP has been strong, with the token recently breaking above the $3 resistance level. As of press time, data from CoinMarketCap shows XRP trading around $3.02, reflecting a 1.3% gain over the past 24 hours. Investors are closely monitoring the impact of the unlocked tokens, which could influence short-term price movements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Market Activity Market analysts suggest that the freshly available XRP could serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, increased supply sometimes pressures prices by reducing scarcity. On the other hand, the additional liquidity may facilitate institutional transactions and broader adoption, particularly as regulatory decisions on XRP ETFs approach . Several major ETF filings are under review, and investor confidence remains elevated with the expectation that these products could bring substantial capital into the XRP ecosystem. The release also underscores Ripple’s commitment to transparency and predictability in its token management. By adhering to a monthly schedule and providing clear data on unlocked amounts, the company aims to minimize market uncertainty and maintain investor trust. As the market enters October, XRP’s recent performance, coupled with the escrow release, has prompted optimism among traders. While supply increases can sometimes trigger short-term corrections, many analysts believe the event strengthens XRP’s infrastructure for institutional use. If combined with potential ETF approvals, these developments could reinforce upward momentum throughout the month.

Be ready. https://t.co/5JtfTm82Wi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Solana Price Predictions: Could TradFi Exposure Push SOL Beyond $1,000 These new touchpoints for TradFi demand come as Solana nears the apex of a 6-month ascending wedge pattern. The Solana price now approaches a retest of its upper support as momentum indicators flip decidedly bullish. SOL / USD 1-day chart, 6-month falling wedge points bullish. Source: TradingView. The RSI has found its footing above the neutral line at 55, a sharp rise from recent oversold conditions as buyers overwhelm sellers. The MACD histogram has also mounted a golden cross above the single line, suggesting the current move represents more than a bounce, but a potential lasting uptrend. However, psychological resistance found at $335 today could threaten the integrity of the push, particularly as technical indicators only just scratch bullish. The key threshold for a breakout sits around $300, Solana’s early-year high. Flipping this level into support would validate a potential 130% move to $500 . But with U.S. interest rate cuts expected to stimulate risk appetite, ETFS could see the s olana price extend 350% to $1,000 before year-end. And with CME Group’s global market tapping in, round-the-clock TradFi exposure could push it further in 2026. Solana Waits For 2026 While These ICO Investors Are Raking In Gains For large-cap coins like Solana, a noteworthy breakout takes months of built-up momentum and catalysts at just the right time to see it surge. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) takes a different approach. PEPENODE is the first mine-to-earn meme coin that lets anyone earn rewards by building virtual mining rigs – no expensive hardware, no tech skills needed. Think of it like a crypto game where you buy digital nodes , upgrade your rigs , and collect rewards in popular meme coins like $PEPE – all before the token even launches. It’s a fun, low-barrier way to tap into passive income during the presale phase, and early players are already stacking up gains while others are still waiting on the sidelines. Deflation is hardwired into the system: 70% of $PEPENODE tokens spent on rigs and nodes are burned, driving scarcity and supporting long-term returns. Momentum is rising fast. The presale has surged past $1.6 million, while early adopters are still earning a massive 800% APY on staking. Join the $PEPENODE presale now on the official website to start mining. With the next price increase only hours away, waiting could make entry more expensive. To stay updated, you can also follow PepeNode on X (formerly Twitter) . Buy $PEPENODE Here.

Bitcoin is currently consolidating above $119,000. Traders are looking for an altcoin that will dominate the next two years. Most tokens won’t survive the competition, but those with strong narratives, institutional catalysts, and vibrant ecosystems usually outlive the hype. The three names that are starking the noise for the year 2026 are DeAgentAI (AIA), PancakeSwap (CAKE), Coin98 (C98). Each have varied strengths, with some offering specialised AI-driven products, others crafting DeFi upgrades and some focused on regional adoption roadmaps that differ from US-centric players. At the same time, investors are also watching for new projects with the potential to amplify growth beyond today’s majors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly positioned as one such asset, combining audit-backed credibility with viral momentum. Together, these four names highlight the shifting dynamics of capital rotation heading into the next stage of the bull cycle. DeAgentAI (AIA): AI Agents Meet Multi-Chain Infrastructure Not many projects have come out of the woodwork like DeAgentAI. In the middle of September 2025, it was listed for the first time on Binance Alpha and Binance Futures to facilitate spot trading and perpetual contracts, with a maximum leverage of up to 50×. In just 24 hours, the price skyrocketed by 179.83%, with an increase of 401.68% over the course of the week; market cap nearly $137 million. DeAgentAI is gaining momentum with an airdrop for Binance users that broadened its initial distribution and contributed to its liquidity. What makes it special is its infrastructure that consists of decoupled AI agents running on Sui, BNB Smart Chain and Bitcoin. This ties in nicely with one of the hottest narratives in Web3 – AI meets DeFi. Still, sustainability remains the key challenge. Getting listed on exchanges will get you the publicity you need but the real long-term price growth will depend on actual developer activity, real adoption of its AI tools and continued cross-chain integrations. If DeAgentAI turns hype into real usage, it could be one of the most relevant tokens by 2026 PancakeSwap (CAKE): DeFi’s Veteran Reinvents Itself PancakeSwap has been present in the DeFi space since 2020. However, PancakeSwap Infinity aims to change this trajectory. The launch of this gas-efficient Layer 2 solution at the end of September 2025 sparked unprecedented trading activity, with volumes reaching over $772 billion in Q3. The price of CAKE surged by 27.92% within 24 hours and increased by nearly 29% in the past week as its market capitalization stands at $1.16 billion. The upgrade added custom liquidity pools and accounting following ERC-6909 standards to enhance scaling while reducing costs for liquidity providers. These new ideas help improve capital efficiency, a DeFi pain point. PancakeSwap will certainly be tested on its ability to maintain dominance with Uniswap moving into new territory. In 2026, CAKE’s ability to keep expanding total value locked (TVL) and maintain protocol revenue from swap fees and staking will be the key to its future appeal. As institutions get comfortable with revenue-backed tokens, I believe PancakeSwap’s combination of innovation and track record makes it one of the best possible DeFi plays for the next cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Beyond the Noise While DeAgentAI, PancakeSwap, and Coin98 dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a different kind of narrative. Looking toward 2026, analysts are building lists of the most promising altcoins to hold long-term. Alongside majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is finding its way onto those watchlists as the speculative piece of a multi-year portfolio. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics and cultural branding offer potential for 100x wealth-style outcomes in bullish cycles. What sets it apart is that it isn’t just narrative hype: its contracts are verified through CertiK and HashEx audits , providing reassurance for longer-term holders. For those constructing portfolios aimed at 2026 and beyond, the idea is simple, combine infrastructure leaders like ETH and SOL with small allocations into speculative presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The blend of security and risk could position investors for the generational outcomes crypto is known for. Coin98 (C98): A Regional Powerhouse Finds Momentum Coin98 might have a smaller market cap than other cryptos but has recently made headlines. C98 saw trading volume skyrocketing by nearly 1,930% in early October 2025. This caused the crypto to gain 21.81% in 24 hours and 45.55% weekly. Currently, this crypto has a market cap of $64.8 million. Its momentum stems from both macro and micro catalysts. Bitcoin’s rise to $116,000 this week has caused a chain reaction on the macro front which is uplifting low-cap tokens. In August 2025, Coin98’s integration of Concordium ID will add an important privacy-preserving age verification layer that may prove critical to Southeast Asia’s Web3 development on the micro side. C98 is the right crypto project that can take advantage of the fast-growing crypto adoption of the region. The key watchpoint for Coin98 is token unlocks. In June 2025, more than 5.5 million C98 will unlock, which could pressure the token to sell-off in the short term. If partnerships continue and adoption takes off in Southeast Asia, premier small-cap names to hold into 2026 could include (C98)? Coin98. Investor Psychology Heading Toward 2026 DeAgentAI, PancakeSwap, Coin98 and MAGACOIN FINANCE share a commonality in their ability to tap into investor psychology. Traders don’t just want utility. They want growth. They want the narratives that power the market. They want leverage coins in a bull cycle. DeAgentAI satisfies the hunger for AI-driven DeFi. PancakeSwap delivers proven utility and innovation. Coin98 appeals to regional adoption narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE is appealing because they’re scarce and community-focused. The winning portfolios in 2026 will likely be a balanced mixture of established platforms, emerging leaders and credible growth plays across all the four. Conclusion Which Altcoins can hold the price surge in the long term from now to 2026? DeAgentAI has a daily increase of 179.83%, PancakeSwap achieves record volumes, and Coin98 gains from regional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be a solid growth-oriented complement to the majors, credible and with some upside. Investors looking to position their strategy for the next cycle are not looking for a winner, rather a series of assets that optimally balances scalability, adoption, and growth optionality. Portfolios will be able to handle fluctuations in the crypto space and still benefit from major gains.

The announcement has revived one of the most ambitious XRP price forecasts in the community, a long-term projection of $20,000 per token. The discussion began after RippleX Senior Director of Engineering, J. Ayo Akinyele, shared updates on his team’s work in a recent Ripple Insights article . Akinyele revealed that Ripple is developing tools designed to support private yet regulatory-compliant transactions. Over the next year, the company plans to implement zero-knowledge proofs, which would allow financial institutions to process sensitive data more securely while maintaining performance and scalability. Steingraber’s Bold Valuation Model The renewed focus on privacy has drawn attention back to a valuation model introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP community analyst Chad Steingraber . In his analysis, Steingraber described a framework that could theoretically drive XRP toward a $20,000 price point, relying on three key dynamics: demand, market perception, and scarcity. This is where it gets interesting… XRP https://t.co/2L9UgxJ17j pic.twitter.com/g8Wxz5v6Dx — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 2, 2025 First, he highlighted demand as the central force behind value creation. In his view, assets that lack meaningful demand are undervalued, while surging demand can result in rapid price appreciation. Second, he pointed to how shifts in market perception can elevate valuations without necessarily requiring new inflows of capital, a dynamic he said applies broadly across financial markets. Finally, he emphasized scarcity, noting that XRP has a capped supply of under 100 billion tokens and is subject to gradual deflation, as a small amount is destroyed with every transaction. Steingraber argued that traditional market capitalization figures do not always reflect true investment in an asset. At the time of his model, XRP’s reported market capitalization was around $18 billion, but he maintained that this overstated real exposure due to thin trading volumes and retail-driven activity. He asserted that circulating supply and available liquidity, rather than theoretical market cap numbers, ultimately determine price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Privacy Matters for Institutions Building on this framework, Steingraber predicted that major banks and payment providers would not rely on public exchanges or standard liquidity tools. Instead, he suggested they would adopt private ledgers while holding XRP as a reserve asset. According to his model, banks could issue internal digital instruments backed by XRP reserves, using them for customer balances and interbank transfers. He further projected that liquidity providers would play a key role by accumulating large pools of XRP to facilitate settlement between institutions. In this scenario, competition among major financial players to secure XRP would significantly reduce available supply on public markets. Steingraber also pointed to the permanent loss of some XRP, including tokens locked in inaccessible accounts, as a factor that compounds scarcity. He estimated that only about 20 billion tokens are available on exchanges, meaning institutional accumulation could quickly drain order books and accelerate price increases. Linking Ripple’s Strategy to Price Theories Ripple’s current focus on integrating zero-knowledge proofs aligns with the type of privacy and compliance features that Steingraber’s model assumes institutions will require. For proponents of his $20,000 projection, the company’s technology roadmap offers support for the idea that banks and large-scale payment systems may adopt XRPL for settlement. While most analysts view a $20,000 valuation as highly speculative, the intersection of Ripple’s privacy initiatives with Steingraber’s institutional demand thesis has kept the debate alive within the XRP community. At minimum, the company’s efforts to expand privacy and scalability are seen as essential steps in preparing the ledger for broader enterprise use.

Bitcoin will not realize this massive potential unless mechanisms are created to move and utilize capital directly on its network. Why Bitcoin Can’t Absorb Global Wealth Overnight Analyst BRITISH HODL presents a powerful thesis on BTC’s role, arguing that its impact extends far beyond its own valuation, fundamentally changing how global capital is allocated. In an X post, BRITISH HODL stated that while BTC aims to absorb global capital, this is conditional, and BTC will not capture all of the capital flow on earth unless it is redirected onto the BTC network. Related Reading: No Accident: The Powerful Factors Behind Bitcoin’s Late-September Rally However, as BTC becomes more widely understood, capital will become extremely sensitive, and only the highest quality equities will attract capital. This is simply an existing, long-term trend, evidenced by the dominance of a select few, such as the Magnificent Seven (Mag7) stocks in traditional markets over the last 30 years. Bitcoin intensifies this trend because it provides a highly accessible and transparent standard for risk-free returns. As the risk hurdle rate increases, investors are no longer satisfied with marginal gains from poor-quality assets. The consequence of this will be a significant market cleaning and a lot of concentrated value-creating innovation as companies are forced to deliver exceptional performance to earn capital. Meanwhile, there will be a very fast turnover of terrible companies as BTC’s value proposition becomes increasingly understood by investors. BRITISH HODL makes it clear that in a BTC-dominant era, you must outperform BTC on a risk-adjusted basis to capture any capital. The Growing View Of Bitcoin As An Alternative Money Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, maintains a balanced yet skeptical view of Bitcoin, acknowledging its growing influence while pointing out fundamental flaws that will prevent its ultimate adoption by nation-states. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Expands As Ohio Approves Vendor For State Cryptocurrency Payments Dalio starts by stating that while he can’t say exactly how effective BTC is as a money, the fact that it’s being perceived by many as an alternative money is worth paying attention to. He frames the utility of any currency as both a medium of exchange and a store of wealth, emphasizing that the latter is more important. Despite its revolutionary technology, Dalio highly doubts that any central bank will take it on as a reserve currency. However, since all of the transactions are public, there is no privacy, which is unacceptable for sovereign entities managing vast financial operations. As a result of the risk in the future, the code could be broken to make it less effective through government controls. The expert confirms that he does have some BTC in his portfolio, though not a significant amount.

An analyst has shared a bold view that the token could one day reach extremely high price levels if banks and financial institutions begin to use it on a large scale. He believes that past patterns in the crypto market show growth, but the next step for XRP could be something new and far bigger. The argument is that actual global adoption would create a situation that has never happened before in crypto history. If that happens, the token’s price could rise far above the levels that many traders currently expect. Analyst BarriC Argues XRP Price’s True Potential Lies In Mass Adoption He said that anyone who claims the XRP price will “never reach $1,000” does not understand what they are talking about. According to him, there is no historical data that shows what happens when a cryptocurrency is adopted and used by banks and large financial institutions. Because of this, it is incorrect to place limits on how far XRP could rise in the future. BarriC explained that analysts cannot only study XRP’s future value from past charts or price action . Instead, they have to view it through the lens of global adoption . If banks and financial systems around the world start using XRP to move money, then the market would be facing something new, something without comparison in past cycles. That is why, he says, XRP should not be thought of as a coin that can only climb to trim levels like $4 or $5. Why The XRP Price Could Go Beyond $20 And Toward $1,000 BarriC also pointed to XRP’s past growth as an example of what could be possible. He reminded his followers that the token once skyrocketed from $0.006 to $3. This rise occurred within the limits of a typical four-year cycle, which follows the Bitcoin halving event, bull runs, altcoin season, and then the bear market. Even without large-scale adoption, XRP still managed to make that giant leap. The analyst said the real question is what will happen when banks and institutions adopt XRP on a mass level. If banks and institutions begin to move millions, billions, and even trillions of dollars through XRP, then the demand and usage will be unprecedented in the crypto world. In his view, when money of that scale flows into XRP, the price cannot stop at $20. Instead, such adoption could create the conditions for the XRP price to reach $100, $1,000, or even higher. BarriC said this is why he believes people should look at the token’s future differently from most altcoins. For him, the combination of market cycles and real-world adoption could set XRP apart and make it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the market.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 00:00:54

Ayo Akinyele says he’s pushing to make the XRP Ledger (XRPL) the “first choice for institutions seeking innovation and trust” — and to do it with privacy-first tooling. Akinyele, a senior director of engineering at Ripple, lays out the case in a blog post published Thursday, arguing that finance can’t function without confidentiality while public blockchains are built for transparency. The way through, he says, is programmable privacy that lets “honest participants control what is revealed, to whom, and under what circumstances,” while still giving regulators the disclosures they need. Privacy as infrastructure, not secrecy Akinyele contends privacy on-chain should be a baseline protection, analogous to the encryption that secures online banking. He points to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — cryptography that proves a statement is true without exposing the underlying data — as a mechanism for private but compliant transactions (for example, proving KYC completion without broadcasting identities to the entire network). In his view, without built-in confidentiality, institutions won’t move core workflows to public ledgers; without accountability, regulators won’t sign off. ZKPs, selective disclosure and hardened wallet infrastructure are meant to square that circle. Scaling without sacrificing trust Beyond privacy, Akinyele argues scalability must not come at the expense of security or decentralization. He highlights trusted execution environments (TEEs) for fair transaction ordering to curb frontrunning and confidential computation for running sensitive logic off-chain while emitting verifiable outputs — both intended to reduce market-structure risks without reverting to intermediaries. Looking ahead, he sketches two milestones. First, over the “next 12 months,” he says he’s focused on making XRPL the institutional default by applying ZKPs to enable private, compliant transactions that also improve throughput. Second, in 2026 he expects confidential multi-purpose tokens (MPTs) — a forthcoming XRPL standard — to bring privacy-preserving tokenized collateral to market. That, he says, is an essential step for institutional adoption of real-world assets (RWAs) and DeFi (decentralized finance). Akinyele also positions XRPL as “uniquely positioned to bridge” what he describes as “many trillions of dollars in assets set to move on-chain over the coming decade,” citing the ledger’s decade-long operating history, built-in decentralized exchange, escrow and payment channels as finance-oriented primitives already at the protocol layer. “The future of blockchains belongs to builders who remove unnecessary trust,” he concludes — arguing that if systems can prove correctness, prevent misuse and protect data, public ledgers can deliver the privacy, compliance and efficiency institutions require.",Tech|Ripple|XRP Ledger|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|WALLET|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 00:10:12

MoonBull’s 11,800% ROI Packs a Punch as Hedera and Aster Rally",https://timestabloid.com/chasing-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-2025-moonbulls-11800/,"The best crypto to invest in is the question every trader and student of blockchain keeps asking in 2025. The market is buzzing again, with meme coins stealing the show and established networks holding their ground. Three names stand out for different reasons this October: MoonBull, Hedera, and Aster. Each project carries its own flair, yet one of them is pulling all the eyeballs with a presale that feels like catching lightning in a bottle. Meme coins have dominated crypto headlines for years, from Dogecoin’s internet-fueled rise to Shiba Inu’s viral run. They’ve taught the market that humor and culture can be just as valuable as tech-heavy whitepapers. Now in 2025, the trend is shifting toward meme coins that pair laughs with real tokenomics. This is where MoonBull enters, a meme-fueled rocket propelled by a solid economic engine. MoonBull Presale is live now, and it is shaping up as a second shot for traders who missed early giants like Dogecoin or Solana. Hedera and Aster may have strong market caps and proven adoption, but MoonBull’s first-come, first-served model with 23 scarcity-driven stages is where fortunes might be made. Let’s break it down coin by coin. MoonBull Presale: The Best Crypto to Invest in 2025 MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just another meme coin floating in space. It’s an Ethereum-based project combining hype with long-term sustainability. The presale is already in Stage 4, with more than $200K raised and over 700 holders on board. At $0.00005168, early buyers are staring at an ROI north of 11,800% by the time it hits the projected listing price of $0.00616. That’s not peanuts – that’s life-changing money if timed right. Picture this: putting down $20,000 at the current stage translates into nearly 387 million MOBU tokens. By the time the presale reaches its final stage, the value of that bag could soar past $2.3 million. This kind of upside doesn’t come every season, which is why many see MoonBull as the trending best crypto to invest now. What sets MoonBull apart is its ecosystem. It’s not only about flipping tokens. Holders can stake for a 95% APY starting at Stage 10, letting them double up passively. A massive staking pool of 14.6 billion tokens ensures payouts stay smooth. Add the referral program – with 15% bonuses for both referrers and referees plus leaderboard rewards in USDC – and you have a snowball effect designed to grow the community fast. Mobunomics: The Bull’s Engine of Scarcity and Rewards Mobunomics is where MoonBull’s design flexes its muscles. Every trade splits value across three tracks: 2% goes into liquidity for price stability, 2% heads to holders as reflections, and 1% is burned to make supply scarcer. Selling doesn’t weaken the system; it strengthens it. The total supply of 73.2 billion tokens has been carved up to balance presale, staking, referrals, and community rewards. Half the supply is allocated to presale alone, making early stages like today’s a rare golden gate. With its deflationary mechanics, staking pools, referral boosters, and Ethereum-powered backbone, MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just a joke coin. It’s shaping up as the best crypto to invest with ROI, and it’s pulling retail and whale investors into one herd. The bull is charging – and the question is whether you’ll be on its back or in its dust. Hedera (HBAR): Solid Tech, Market Struggles Hedera, priced today at $0.2239, is ranked #25 on CoinGecko with a market cap near $9.5 billion. It has seen a 8.3% gain this week, but that’s still a hair below the global crypto market’s 9.1% rise. With a fully diluted valuation of $11.2 billion, Hedera shows the weight of its token supply, which stretches to 50 billion HBAR in circulation potential. The project remains a favorite among developers for its Hashgraph tech, a faster and more scalable alternative to traditional blockchain. Yet, the coin’s price action often feels like a hippo stuck in mud compared to nimble meme plays. Even though it once soared to an all-time high of $0.569, it’s still trading over 60% below that level today. For long-term holders, Hedera might be seen as the best crypto to invest long term, given its enterprise partnerships and ecosystem stability. However, in short-term cycles, it doesn’t pack the same excitement as a hot presale. It’s steady, but steady doesn’t always get headlines. Aster (ASTER): A Rising Star with Heavy Volume Aster trades at $1.89 with a market cap of around $3.18 billion, ranked #52 on CoinGecko. It’s riding a 4.1% weekly gain but trails behind the broader crypto market. With 1.7 billion tokens circulating and a fully diluted valuation over $15 billion, Aster is playing in the big leagues, even if the scoreboard shows mixed signals. Its all-time high of $2.41 is still within reach, though it sits 20% below that mark right now. On the flip side, Aster has climbed an eye-popping 1,824% since its all-time low. That kind of rebound reminds traders that Aster can run when the bulls wake up. Its trading volume of $1.07 billion in 24 hours shows liquidity isn’t a problem, though it did slip slightly compared to the day before.

Attention is quickly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At $0.035 and 55% sold in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has twin lending infrastructure, real-utility, and non-custodial smart contracts offering investors a utility-driven option in a growing DeFi market. With over 16,710 holders and $16.7 million raised, Mutuum Finance is attracting the attention of retail and whale investors as well and is a high-upside altcoin that can leverage rising institutional and regulatory adoption patterns. Visa Stablecoin Initiative Represents Growing Institutional Onboarding and Regulatory Clarity Visa’s intention to test a platform allowing businesses to make cross-border business-to-business payments using stablecoins is a strong step toward crypto mainstream onboarding. By eliminating the need for local account pre-funding, the initiative can bring faster cross-border payments and reduced capital inefficiency to banks, remittance companies, and other financial institutions. The program has backing from the U.S. Genius Act, which gave stablecoin issuers clear regulatory guidance and enabled companies to have confidence experimenting with digital currencies without a cloud of legal uncertainty. As Visa collaborates with unidentified firms and is planning to roll out the scheme next year, stablecoins shift from a niche cryptocurrency fad to core financial infrastructure, with some potential to disintermediate traditional payment rails while supporting existing networks. This institutional adoption trend of rising institutional adoption mirrors investors’ appetite for new, utility-driven digital assets, opening room for early-stage projects with credible DeFi applications to draw capital. Mutuum Finance Presale Figures Show Lively Investor Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sees its Stage 6 presale figures skyrocket with tokens sold at $0.035, a 16.17% boost over the previous round. The demand remains high, and over 16,710 individuals have engaged with over $16.7 million committed to date, indicating increased faith within the longer-term future of the project and vision. Mutuum Finance will award $100,000 giveaway to early adopters. It will have ten winners and award each winner with $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The project’s vision is thus to bring long-term value and enable growth in the space of community-building. Enhanced Security and Risk Management Security is the top priority for Mutuum Finance. To this effect, the platform introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to invite security researchers and developers to stress test and report bugs. Bugs are rated on a four-level severity level as critical, major, minor, and low for ultimate assurance against any threat. Mutuum Finance is risk-weighted Loan-to-Value (LTV) protocol that holds adequate collateral for every asset based on its risk factor, thereby a more stable and well-balanced lending process. For containing market volatility, the protocol also maintains a buffer reserve, with excess reserves on higher-risk assets as extra collateral. Dynamic liquidation ratios and live LTV are dynamically set to respond to prevailing market conditions at the moment to enable the protocol to actively offset volatility. Reserve multipliers are set from 10% on less risky assets to 35% on more risk assets to add a layer of systemic insurance. Efficiency is Mutuum Finance’s top priority as well. Collateral is maximized to create maximum borrowing capacity and correlated assets are employed to create lending and borrowing efficiency as flawless as possible. These structures result in low insolvency risk with a stable, sustainable DeFi protocol. MUTM Ready for the Next Adoption Wave Visa’s foray into stablecoins and the Genius Act bring a sea change in adoption of mainstream crypto, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to gain big time. Having already raised more than $16.7 million from 16,710+ investors and with Phase 6 already being 55% sold, tokens won’t budge from $0.035 for the time being. Its twin borrowing system, security knowledge, and $100,000 giveaway establish it as one DeFi project that shines. Act now to be in on the presale before the next price spike and be part of this rapidly-growing ecosystem.

The analyst begins with a quick framing of Bitcoin, noting that the market sits at a psychologically charged inflection just below all-time highs. He characterizes this zone as the “best risk-reward area to take a short,” not as a trend call but as a hedge for portfolios given proximity to prior peaks and well-defined invalidation. “I’m bullish, but I am cautious at $106,000,” he reiterated, referring to a visible liquidity pocket that he continues to flag as a magnet for price probes. He emphasizes his stance has been consistent: fully exposed on spot, cautious on leverage near resistance, and mindful of how quickly sentiment can flip when price revisits extremes. XRP Price Could Rip 400% XRP is the focus. On lower time frames, he sees open interest rebuilding and liquidity clustering overhead—most notably around the $3.40–$3.45 region—with thinner, newer pools below near $2.66 and $2.55. In his read, this is typical when an upside move begins to organize: resting liquidity accumulates above recent highs while late shorts leave footprints below. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash To $2.33 Is Still Possible In This Scenario, Here’s Why On the daily, he identifies additional liquidity density around $2.11–$2.40, but stresses that the stack above is far larger, with a notable band between roughly $4.02 and $4.25 and intermediate reference points near $4.10. “The times when we’ve had big dense areas of liquidity like this… we run into that area, we struggled in it, and then boom—when we do break out higher, we’ve ripped,” he said. He points back to the earlier breakout from the $0.50s, where a similar pattern of layered overhead liquidity resolved into a multi-week melt-up. The near-term momentum tell, in his view, is the three-day RSI crossing up from below 50—something he says closes today and has historically mattered for XRP. He logged three recent instances. The first preceded the move from roughly $0.50 to $2.70, a run he pegs at approximately 400% from mid-range to peak. The second produced a smaller, but still notable, ~27% advance. The third, in late June, was followed by a ~68% climb. “The minimum push… was 27%,” he said, arguing that even a conservative replay would take XRP “just above this high that we’ve recently set,” while the upper bound of historical outcomes opens the door to far higher prints. “If we do madness… 470% would take us to $17 right now. Bring your emotions back in check,” he cautioned, underscoring that these are scenario brackets, not guarantees. Different Price Scenarios From there, he moves into structure. On the daily chart he sketches a still-valid five-wave advance, with the present upswing acting as wave three of a larger third. Using Fibonacci extensions anchored to the last impulsive leg, his 4.236 projection lands around the $6.50–$6.80 zone, with one read producing ~$6.79 and another shorter-range draw yielding about $4.78. Related Reading: Ex-Ripple Dev Explains Why XRP Is 10x The Value Of LINK He notes that prior extensions overshot by roughly 20%, which—if repeated—would imply a spike toward the “$8.20 region” before a sharper corrective reset and a subsequent fifth-wave push. To unlock those paths, he wants to see a series of higher-time-frame closes reclaiming major retracement thresholds: “A daily close above $3.20 would be great. If we start closing above $3.36–$3.43, we’re on for that $6.80 price target, especially if we can get the close above $3.65.” Market-wide context could help. XRP dominance has broken its range and is building what he calls a bull-flag pattern on the three-day. The last confirmed three-day RSI bullish cross in XRP dominance marked the start of major upside phases; another cross now would, in his words, be “the time. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is flirting with a bearish rollover on the daily, complete with divergences near resistance. A renewed bleed in BTC dominance would mechanically free up relative performance for large-cap alts; in his ideal scenario, Bitcoin grinds higher toward or through the highs while XRP “just runs faster.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.0246.

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Shows Whales Are Still Selling In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score for the various investor cohorts on the network. The “ Accumulation Trend Score ” refers to an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC holders are participating in accumulation or distribution. The metric calculates its value by not only considering the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also by accounting for the size of the wallets themselves. This means that larger entities have a higher influence on the score. When the value of the indicator is greater than 0.5, it indicates that large investors (or alternatively, a large number of small investors) are leaning toward a trend of accumulation. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger this behavior is. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold implies that distribution is the dominant behavior on the BTC blockchain. The zero level acts as the extreme point on this side of the scale. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score turned neutral-red across the investor cohorts last month, suggesting the network was facing distribution. Recently, however, the metric has recorded a shift. The mid-sized BTC investors, those holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC, have started participating in some aggressive buying, with the indicator sitting close to the 1 level. The 10 to 100 BTC cohort has also seen the indicator rise into the accumulation zone. On the smaller end of the scale (below 1 BTC and 1 to 10 BTC groups), a neutral behavior is still the dominant one, indicating that retail hands are still unsure about the asset’s direction. The whales , holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, have seen their selloff calm down a bit in recent days, but these humongous entities nonetheless remain in a phase of distribution. Finally, the 10,000+ BTC investors, popularly known as the “ mega whales ,” have only stepped deeper into distribution, with the Accumulation Trend Score near zero. Considering this trend, it would appear that the latest bullish push in Bitcoin could be fueled by the fresh demand that’s coming from the mid-sized entities. It now remains to be seen how the Accumulation Trend Score will develop for the groups in the coming days, and whether this structural shift will only advance further. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a sharp rally of more than 10% in the last week, which has taken its price beyond the $120,000 level.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score|Bitcoin Mid-Sized Holders|Bitcoin Selling|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 01:00:55

BNB confirmed a bullish flag breakout, targeting $1,236 with potential extension toward $1,500. Institutional adoption and treasury strategies boosted BNB demand, strengthening its long-term growth outlook. BNB Chain activity surged with $8.23B locked value and 73.24M active addresses supporting momentum. BNB is continuing its strong rally after breaking out from a bullish flag formation. The breakout confirmed upward continuation, positioning the token toward $1,200 and marking a potential new all‑time high. At the time of writing, BNB was trading at $1,145.99, reflecting steady growth and rising market participation. What price structure and momentum support the breakout? Bullish structure: BNB’s 4‑hour chart showed a clear pennant then flag, with the pole rising from $960 to $1,120. The subsequent breakout with expanding volume projects a target near $1,236 (about 22.46% from the consolidation low). $BNB is doing the same, which i told you earlier. Bullish flag got a break, and the target is $1200 for the new ATH. We are so close to that. Cycle top vibes hitting different. Congrats to the real diamond hands who held through 2022. Finally, @cz_binance words true — Henry (@LordOfAlts) October 3, 2025 According to analysis prepared by Henry, BNB has maintained higher lows within a rising channel since mid‑August. Strong buying pressure supported this structure, keeping momentum intact during recent sessions. Market volume surged after the breakout, signaling continued accumulation. Source: NekoZ(X) Analyst NekoZ described BNB’s chart as a “masterclass in trend continuation,” noting three major breakouts since July. Each breakout led to expansion, and the current cycle targets $1,500 as traders monitor higher resistance levels. Why is institutional demand important for BNB price? Institutional demand increases capital inflows and treasury support for price discovery. Several funds and corporate treasuries have allocated to BNB, raising buy‑side pressure and reducing available supply on exchanges. Examples of institutional activity include Kazakhstan’s Alem Crypto Fund selecting BNB as a reserve asset and Nasdaq‑listed Windtree Therapeutics allocating a majority of a recent raise into BNB. These actions, reported by market observers, contribute to a firmer long‑term outlook. Network growth also supports the rally: on‑chain data shows BNB Chain’s total value locked at $8.23 billion (up 2.5% in 24 hours) and 73.24 million active addresses, with 4.34 million transactions in September—the second‑highest monthly activity on record. These metrics indicate both liquidity and engagement that can sustain higher prices. Frequently Asked Questions What is the nearest resistance and upside target for BNB? Nearest resistance sits around $1,200–$1,236 (measured move); extended targets reach $1,500 and, under strong momentum, higher psychological levels such as $2,000 in longer scenarios. How should traders confirm the breakout? Confirm with increased breakout volume, higher lows on shorter‑timeframe charts, and supportive on‑chain metrics such as rising TVL and active addresses. Risk management is essential—use stop levels below the flag structure. Key Takeaways Technical breakout: Bullish flag projects a $1,236 near‑term target with potential extension to $1,500. Institutional flows: Fund and treasury allocations bolster demand and reduce circulating supply. On‑chain support: $8.23B TVL and 73.24M active addresses provide structural backing for momentum. Conclusion BNB’s bullish flag breakout, reinforced by institutional demand and expanding BNB Chain activity, places the token within reach of $1,236 and tests above $1,200. Traders should watch volume and on‑chain metrics for confirmation while managing downside risk. COINOTAG will continue to monitor developments and provide timely updates.

52636136,597122,1759543225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52636136.jpeg,Analyst Says XRP Price Target Of $27 Still Holds – ‘The Ride Has Just Begun’,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-target-of-27-still-holds/,"A new technical analysis by crypto analyst ChartNerd has predicted the long-term trajectory of the XRP price . According to the expert, the cryptocurrency could be gearing up for a new all-time high, with price targets set at an impressive $27. Already, XRP is showing signs of building momentum after its recent rebound from the $2.8 level , but ChartNerd suggests that “the ride has just begun.” XRP Price Structure Points To $27 ATH ChartNerd’s latest analysis on X social media outlines XRP’s long-term price structure, which has been forming since its 2018 all-time high of $3.84 . After peaking and then spending nearly seven years suppressed and consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, the altcoin has finally broken free of its constraints. This breakout had triggered an explosive rally in the cryptocurrency’s price, carrying it from $0.5 to $3.6 this year in rapid succession. Despite this impressive performance, ChartNerd explains that XRP’s price rally is far from over . The cryptocurrency’s structure suggests a much larger expansion is on the horizon, with Fibonacci Extension levels reinforcing the case for a $27 price target. Specifically, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension on the chart has been pointing to $27 ever since XRP’s 2018 high. A surge to this level would see the cryptocurrency exploding by an impressive 800% from current levels around $3. With the symmetrical triangle pattern now broken to the upside, the long-term chart suggests the token is finally ready to move toward higher levels. The analysis identifies critical points in the cryptocurrency’s bullish journey: a breakout impulse that shattered descending resistance, a new cycle of ascending support, and the confirmation of the previous Fibonacci targets. ChartNerd concludes his analysis by urging traders to prepare for a ride that has only just begun. Analyst Says XRP To Hit $5 First In addition to his long-term projection, ChartNerd presented a short-term analysis that predicts XRP could skyrocket from its current price of $3 to $5, representing a roughly 66% surge. He shared a price chart that shows the cryptocurrency displaying a classic Bull Flag formation —a pattern that often signals bullish continuation after an upward move. During the time of his analysis, ChartNerd noted that XRP was bouncing off its 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around the $2.77 level, a key area of support to prevent further declines. The Bull Flag structure is clearly visible on the chart, featuring a strong flagpole that moves upward, followed by a period of consolidation within a downward-sloping flag. The breakout target from this Bull Flag formation points directly to the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension at $5.35. ChartNerd emphasized that while the altcoin still has work to do, holding above the 20-week EMA and breaking through flag resistance are critical to fueling this projected rally. More importantly, he says that the current Bull Flag pattern lies inside a larger flag with a bullish target set at $15.",XRP|Bull Flag Structure|ChartNerd|Fibonacci Extension|ripple|Symmetrical Triangle Pattern|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 02:00:25

Analyst Calls To “Stay Alert”,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoins-big-breakout-incoming-analyst-stay-alert/,"An analyst has pointed out how a Dogecoin breakout could be coming, based on this technical pattern that the asset has followed over the years. Dogecoin Is Currently Inside Accumulation Zone Of Long-Term Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Dogecoin is still in the accumulation phase of a technical analysis (TA) channel. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $119,000: Analyst Says $139,000 Could Be Next Parallel Channels form when the price of an asset travels between two parallel trendlines. There are a few different variations of the pattern, depending on how the trendlines are oriented with respect to the chart axes. The Ascending Channel, the type that’s of interest in the context of the current discussion, involves trendlines that are sloped upward. That is, these channels correspond to a phase of upward consolidation in an asset’s price. The upper line of the pattern tends to be a source of resistance, while the lower one is a source of support. Either of these levels not holding up can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel could signal a bullish breakout, while a fall below it may lead to bearish action. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Ascending Channel that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has followed over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin slipped below the support line of the Ascending Channel earlier in the year. This fall, however, didn’t immediately confirm a bearish breakdown, as the memecoin has seen a few instances over its history where temporary declines below the line have taken place. During each of them, the coin ended up finding support in a zone bounded by the channel’s lower level and another parallel support line just some distance below. From the chart, it’s visible that this same pattern could be playing out once more, as the asset has stabilized since entering this historical “accumulation” phase. For now, the coin is still trading inside this zone, but a surge back into the Ascending Channel could eventually arrive, if the past pattern is anything to go by. Each of the previous returns into the channel led to notable gains for Dogecoin. “The breakout is coming,” says the analyst. “Stay alert!” Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder RVT Nears Cycle Lows: A Healthy Reset? Another altcoin, Chainlink (LINK), has also been following an Ascending Channel recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. As is visible in the chart, Chainlink’s 3-day price is currently trading near the mid-line of its multi-year long Ascending Channel. The analyst believes a surge to $47 could be next for the coin, corresponding to the upper line of the pattern. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.255, up more than 13% over the last week.

XLM at critical $0.38 resistance and 0.786 Fibonacci level Rising TVL and improved long-to-short ratios signal growing on-chain activity and bullish sentiment Technical indicators (RSI ~45, MACD nearing crossover) show fading bearish pressure and potential momentum shift Stellar (XLM) price nears $0.38 resistance — watch breakout volume and daily close confirmations for a rally to $0.50. Read our technical summary and trade checklist. Stellar (XLM) is heating up near the $0.38 mark. Charts and on-chain data hint at a breakout. XLM faces major resistance at $0.38, at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. A breakout above the trendline could trigger upside toward $0.50. Rising TVL and bullish trader sentiment point to a potential breakout. Stellar (XLM) is just below the crucial $0.38 resistance level. As of the writing time the price dipped 1.22% to $0.3656, a 0.72% weekly gain and rising trading volume show growing bullish momentum. What is driving Stellar (XLM) toward the $0.38 level? Stellar (XLM) is approaching a confluence of technical resistance: the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement near $0.3725 and a descending trendline around $0.38. Rising on-chain metrics and improving trader sentiment are increasing the probability of an upside breakout if volume confirms a close above the trendline. How does the chart structure influence short-term XLM price action? The 4-hour chart shows a descending triangle pattern that typically signals bearish risk, but current price action has compressed toward the triangle apex. XLM trades around $0.36897, just under the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.37254. A decisive close above the descending trendline with increased volume would shift the technical bias to bullish. Source: Ali Charts Via X Why does on-chain data matter for XLM’s breakout chances? On-chain metrics provide real activity context beyond price. Stellar’s Total Value Locked (TVL) rose from $139.1 million on Saturday to $144.4 million by Tuesday, approaching an August peak of $153.6 million. Rising TVL typically reflects increased ecosystem usage and liquidity, supporting bullish price scenarios when paired with technical breakouts. What do trader positioning and indicators show? Market sentiment has tilted cautiously optimistic. CoinGlass reported a long-to-short ratio of 1.07, the highest in over a month, indicating more traders are positioned long. Daily RSI sits at ~45, moving toward neutral 50, while MACD lines are nearing a bullish crossover. These indicators suggest bearish pressure is fading but confirmation requires volume and daily closes. When will a breakout or rejection be confirmed? A breakout is most credible after: 1) a daily candle close above $0.38 and the descending trendline, and 2) a meaningful surge in trading volume. Conversely, a rejection would be signaled by a strong reversal candle at resistance and weakening volume, targeting $0.34 and potentially $0.32 on further downside. Short checklist for traders monitoring XLM Watch for daily close above $0.38 with increased volume. Confirm MACD bullish crossover and RSI moving above 50. Monitor TVL and network activity for sustained on-chain support.

A sustainable rally to $0.50 requires a daily close above $0.38, elevated trading volume, and supportive momentum indicators. Without these confirmations, any spike could be a short-lived pullback. How should traders manage risk around the triangle apex? Use defined stop levels (e.g., below $0.34) and scale position size until a clear daily close confirms direction. Monitor volume and TVL to avoid trading on false breakouts. Key Takeaways Resistance at $0.38 : A decisive daily close above the 0.786 Fibonacci and trendline is needed to validate a bullish breakout. On-chain support : Rising TVL and a higher long-to-short ratio add credibility to an upside scenario. Confirm with volume : Volume surges and momentum crossovers will be the primary confirmation signals for a sustained rally. Conclusion Stellar (XLM) sits at a technical crossroads near $0.38, where a confirmed break with higher volume could open targets at $0.40 and $0.50, while a rejection risks support at $0.34 and $0.32. Monitor daily closes, volume, RSI and TVL for reliable signals.

Stocks are at all-time highs, and the tech sector is driving the surge even without fresh government data. On Friday, each of the major averages were headed for a winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level over its last five sessions. The S&P 500 broke through 6,700 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed again as semiconductors rallied hard. On Tuesday, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market value. Other assets joined the climb, with gold and Bitcoin moving sharply higher as retail traders piled in. Emerging market stocks are beating U.S. equities this year, and China’s large-cap names are up more than 40% in 2025. For now, the accepted view is that stocks, which historically ignored shutdowns, will keep rising if the suspension of federal operations doesn’t drag on longer than usual. But there are warnings that this shutdown may be different. The blackout of government data could mean the Federal Reserve heads into its October 28–29 meeting without crucial numbers, just as risks grow around both the labor market and inflation. “This time, a shutdown is going to matter,” said Hardika Singh, economic strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “When the Fed meets at the end of October, without this data from the nonfarm payrolls report, it’s going to be very, very difficult for them to make a decision.” Singh added that: “The president is giving them so much flack for being slow with cutting interest rates. And I think that with the Fed independence already under fire, it makes it all the more important for us to see rate cuts come at the right time for the right reasons.” Singh, who remains bullish despite concerns, said the lack of clarity heading into the decision could dent a rally that’s already distrusted by many. “The market is in mostly a really good spot, but people are looking for reasons to not believe this rally,” she said. “I think the shutdown here just gives them all the more ammunition to not buy the argument that we’re in a bull market.” Investors weigh rate cuts as shutdown clouds Fed decisions Signs of nervousness are visible across Wall Street. Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman said this week that he thinks the market is in the “late innings” of a bull run and could be vulnerable to losses, though he added it’s still less risky than bonds given higher inflation. Some investors are saying the Fed doesn’t need to cut rates right now, citing elevated inflation, record stocks and a still-growing economy. Markets are pricing in two quarter-point cuts by year’s end, with the next expected later this month according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said the Fed need not cut given the outlook for stronger inflation. On Friday, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said he is leery of cutting rates too quickly. Even so, bullish momentum is hard to fight. High valuations worry some investors, but David Miller, investment chief at Catalyst Funds, said the market’s heavy tilt toward tech makes it more able to handle premium valuations than in the past. Today alone, the Dow jumped 500 points. Fundstrat’s Lee told clients this week he expects the S&P 500 could reach 7,000 by December. “We would not lean bearish because of shutdowns,” he said . “If stocks are down, we would be dip buyers.” Bitcoin gains as traders hedge against shutdown risks Bitcoin rallied Friday to within striking distance of its record high as the U.S. shutdown entered its third day. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency traded up roughly 2% on the day at $123,874, about 1% below the mid-August all-time high of just over $124,000. Investors are moving into the decentralized asset after lawmakers failed to agree on federal funding, forcing the shutdown on Wednesday. Bitcoin is up 12% this week alone. “The shutdown matters this time around,” wrote Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered. “During the previous Trump shutdown (22 Dec 2018 to 25 Jan 2019) Bitcoin was in a different place than now, so it did little.” Kendrick added, “However, this year bitcoin has traded with ‘US government risks’ as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium.” Standard Chartered expects a new high soon and ultimately the crypto reaching $135,000. Traders are also using crypto and other assets to hedge against rising political and economic tensions. Spot gold rose 0.5% to $3,876.55 per ounce early Friday, with prices up more than 2% for the week. Traders also poured money into stocks Friday despite growing geopolitical uncertainties, with the S&P 500 rising 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.27%.

Per a report from Bloomberg, the plan is to create a digital-asset treasury company that will stockpile XAUt, the gold-backed token issued by Tether, while Bitmain supplies about 82% of the planet’s crypto mining machines, according to an April study by the University of Cambridge Judge Business School. Sources also said that Cohen & Co. is the lead advisor on this deal. They declined to be named because the talks are private. This effort adds another layer to the long-running collaboration between Tether and Antalpha. The two companies already work together on Tether Gold, which according to Tether’s site has a market capitalization of $1.5 billion. That token launched in 2020 through a Tether subsidiary and is fully backed by physical gold bars stored in vaults. Tether and Antalpha expand gold token plans On September 29, Antalpha announced that it was expanding its partnership with Tether to make XAUt easier to access. It said it will offer collateralized lending against the token and set up physical vaults in major financial centers so holders can swap their digital tokens for real gold bars. Antalpha confirmed that Tether purchased an 8.1% stake in its company back in June, cementing their financial link. Meanwhile, demand for gold has spiked 46% this year amid fears over inflation and global political tensions. CoinGecko data shows that the market capitalization of Tether’s gold token doubled during the same period. While working on this $200 million fundraise, Tether is also trying to raise as much as $20 billion for its main stablecoin business. If that succeeds, the company would be valued at about $500 billion, which would make it one of the biggest privately held firms in the world, as Cryptopolitan reported . Data from PitchBook shows that more than 80 companies have set up digital-asset treasury companies this year. Many are following a model inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which bought large amounts of Bitcoin. These companies often use reverse takeovers or special purpose acquisition vehicles to build listed proxies for assets like Bitcoin or Ether. Back in April, Tether shared that it had teamed up with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald LP and SoftBank Group to create a Bitcoin treasury company called Twenty One Capital. But even as these crypto treasuries multiply, a growing number of them have seen their stock prices drop recently as interest from institutional investors cools off.

Chinese EV manufacturers are already facing regulatory pressure in Europe, including a countervailing duty and the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR), which has negatively impacted over 70% of them. Ursula von der Leyen wants the EU to become AI-first Ursula von der Leyen believes artificial intelligence could help revive the region’s struggling automotive sector and also improve road safety. During her speech, she urged the European Union to adopt an “AI first” strategy across strategic industries, with a focus on mobility. She cited how self-driving cars have become a reality on the streets of America and China and does not see why Europe is being left behind. To her, “AI first” also means “safety first”. Her remarks come amid Brussels’ attempt to promote industrial competitiveness, even as local automakers struggle to keep up with foreign technology development, particularly from China and the United States. Von der Leyen suggested banding together to form a network of European cities to pilot autonomous vehicles, and claimed up to 60 Italian mayors had already expressed interest. The EU chief has also vowed the bloc will support developing vehicles “made in Europe, and made for European streets”. Europe’s automotive industry is currently undergoing rapid transformation amid pressure to decarbonize and digitize, and von der Leyen thinks AI could play a significant role in reducing congestion, linking remote areas to public transport, and preserving jobs. “The future of cars – and the cars of the future – must be made in Europe,” she said . China EV brands set sights on Europe Chinese EV manufacturers face significant regulatory risks in Europe, including a 17.4% EU countervailing duty and the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR), which has negatively impacted over 70% of these firms. However, they have refused to be daunted by the hostile tariffs and have been leveraging strategies like plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and localized production. It has been effective because, as of June 2025, Chinese EV brands had captured 10% of the European EV market with BYD’s sales tripling to 13,503 units by July 2025, surpassing Tesla for the first time and highlighting the rapid growth and competitive edge of Chinese EV brands. The shift towards PHEVs has worked so well for them because it aligns with the European consumer’s preferences for flexible charging options and long-distance travel, maintaining a stable market share amid tariff challenges. There is also the issue of geopolitical tensions, which have resulted in fragmented EU member states’ policies. As things stand, the future of Chinese investments in Europe is uncertain, and this has affected the EV sector. In 2024, Greenfield projects accounted for £4.9 billion. However, the value of newly announced EV projects has declined significantly, with three major battery projects getting shelved. Analysts have warned that further tariffs — potentially exceeding 20% — could also affect export volumes. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Coinbase applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the OCC to bridge crypto and TradFi. Approval would let Coinbase offer custody plus payments and integrated on‑ramps/off‑ramps under clearer regulation. Several US crypto firms, including Circle and Ripple Labs, have also sought the trust charter this year. Coinbase National Trust Charter: Coinbase seeks OCC approval to expand services under clearer oversight — read the implications and timeline. What is Coinbase’s National Trust Company Charter application? Coinbase’s National Trust Company Charter application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a regulatory step to operate as a federally chartered trust entity, allowing the exchange to broaden services beyond custody while asserting it does not intend to become a bank. The filing targets clearer oversight for payments and integrated on‑/off‑ramp capabilities. How would the charter change Coinbase’s services? Approval would permit Coinbase to expand from pure custody into payments and related financial services under federal supervision. This can reduce reliance on third‑party partner banks for on‑ramps and off‑ramps, streamline customer flows, and create new product paths such as native fiat rails and payment settlements. Coinbase said seeking the license is part of its broader effort to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. Coinbase has formally applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the OCC, joining other US crypto firms pursuing similar federal trust charters this year. “Coinbase is taking a significant step in expanding our business capabilities and regulatory oversight beyond the existing framework, paving the way for innovation and growth in building a modern financial system powered by digital assets,” Coinbase said in a statement on Friday. Why does Coinbase say the charter will “bridge the gap” with TradFi? Coinbase frames the charter as part of a strategy to link the crypto economy with the traditional financial system. The firm emphasizes that clearer rules and federal oversight will support innovation while preserving customer trust and security. Coinbase clarified: “ Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security.” What do industry insiders say about operational impact? Luke Youngblood, who previously led Coinbase staking rewards, said the charter would enable Coinbase to “offer basically built‑in on‑ramp, off‑ramp, and no longer have to use partner banks on‑ramps, off‑ramps.” Political commentator Brendan Pedersen noted that trusts can carry business limitations versus commercial banks, though that distinction has narrowed over time. Source: Coinbase When did other companies file similar charter applications? Several crypto firms have filed trust charter applications in the same period. Stablecoin issuer Circle submitted an application on July 1, and Ripple Labs filed shortly after. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse described approval as a potential benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Frequently Asked Questions Will Coinbase become a bank if the trust charter is approved? No. Coinbase has explicitly stated it does not intend to become a bank. A National Trust Company Charter would provide federal oversight and enable broader services while remaining focused on crypto-native products. How will customers benefit from the charter? Customers could see faster, more integrated fiat on‑ramps and off‑ramps, potential new payment products, and clearer regulatory protections for custody and transactional services. Does the charter change regulatory obligations? Yes. A federal trust charter subjects the firm to OCC supervision, compliance requirements, and reporting structures different from non‑chartered crypto businesses. This can increase transparency and regulatory alignment. Key Takeaways Regulatory move : Coinbase applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the OCC to operate under federal trust oversight. Service expansion : Approval could allow payments, integrated on‑ramps/off‑ramps, and expanded custody offerings. Industry context : Circle and Ripple Labs have pursued similar charters, signaling a broader industry push toward federally chartered trust structures.

Exchanges recorded a net outflow of $2.37M, indicating accumulation and lower short-term selling pressure. Cardano price near $0.87, futures OI $1.5B, exchange outflows show accumulation — read analysis and key levels for traders. (Cardano price update) What is the current Cardano price outlook? Cardano price is trading near $0.87 after a rebound from $0.80 support, showing renewed buyer interest and a short-term resistance zone at $0.88–$0.90. A decisive break above $0.90 could accelerate momentum toward $0.95 and higher, while failure to hold $0.80 would increase downside risk. How did recent price action and technical indicators behave? Price closed near the session high after a range between $0.851 and $0.883, reflecting buying pressure throughout the day. Reported data shows ADA at $0.8855 with a 24-hour gain of about 3 percent. The RSI recovered above 50, and price has formed higher lows since September, suggesting steady accumulation. Cardano trades near $0.87 after rebounding from $0.80 support, with futures open interest at $1.5B and resistance at $0.88–$0.90. Cardano rebounds from $0.80 support, with buyers now targeting resistance at $0.88–$0.90. ADA futures open interest jumps to $1.5B, showing stronger trader participation and inflows. Net outflow of $2.37M from exchanges signals accumulation and reduced short-term selling pressure. Cardano is trading near $0.87 after rebounding strongly from the $0.80 support zone earlier this month. The price action shows consistent buying pressure, with traders closely monitoring the $0.88 resistance area. If this resistance breaks, ADA could see accelerated upward momentum supported by stronger trading activity and higher market participation. How has trading volume and momentum changed? Trading volume rose as ADA advanced from the $0.80 level, with multiple green daily candles confirming renewed upward momentum. Observations indicate buyers aim to overcome $0.88, the next immediate hurdle before $0.91 and $0.95. Volume increases alongside rising price support higher conviction for sustained moves. What do futures activity and exchange flows indicate? Cardano futures open interest increased to roughly $1.5 billion—up from under $300 million earlier this year—pointing to higher derivatives participation. Exchange flow metrics show a net outflow of $2.37 million on October 3, which typically reduces immediate selling pressure and signals accumulation by holders or cold-storage transfers. Price Action and Technical Structure Cardano (ADA) recently traded at $0.8855, recording a 24-hour increase of 3 percent. Market data from Coingecko showed a trading range between $0.851 and $0.883.

Green candles on the daily chart confirmed renewed upward momentum after a series of red sessions. Buyers are now focused on overcoming resistance near $0.88, which serves as the next immediate hurdle before $0.91 and $0.95. Futures Activity and Exchange Flows Cardano’s futures market shows growing interest from traders. Open interest surged above $1.5 billion by early October, compared with under $300 million earlier this year. This expansion reflects stronger speculative inflows and greater engagement in derivatives markets. Source: Popeye(X) Exchange flows further suggest accumulation. On October 3, ADA recorded a net outflow of $2.37 million, indicating coins are moving off exchanges. Such movements often reduce near-term selling pressure while pointing toward longer-term holding behavior. According to an observation by Popeye, ADA’s 4-hour chart displayed strong volatility near $0.8692, with resistance between $0.88 and $0.90. A breakout above this zone could open the way to $0.91, $0.95, and possibly $1.02 if momentum continues. Frequently Asked Questions Is Cardano showing signs of accumulation? Yes. Net exchange outflows of $2.37M and higher lows on price charts indicate accumulation. Increased futures open interest to about $1.5B complements on-chain signs, suggesting traders and holders are building positions. How likely is a breakout above $0.90? Momentum indicators and rising volume improve the probability of a breakout, but traders should watch resistance at $0.88–$0.90 and confirm a daily close above $0.90 before assuming sustained upside toward $0.95. Key Takeaways Short-term support : $0.80 — confirmed rebound and buyer interest. Immediate resistance : $0.88–$0.90 — a decisive break could trigger accelerated gains. Market signals : Futures OI at $1.5B and $2.37M exchange outflows point to higher participation and accumulation; monitor volume and RSI. Conclusion Cardano price has rebounded from $0.80 and trades near $0.87, with futures open interest and exchange flows pointing to increased participation and accumulation. Traders should watch $0.88–$0.90 for a breakout confirmation; a sustained move above this zone may target $0.95 and beyond.

Analyst Sees $800 Trillion Liquidity Boom,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-at-10k-analyst-sees-800-trillion-liquidity-boom/,"A sharp debate has opened inside the XRP community over whether the token could ever reach the kind of eye-popping prices some enthusiasts imagine. Numbers and theory are being thrown around. Practical limits are being argued right back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Market Cap Math And Limits According to reports, the numbers make a simple point: with a circulating supply of close to 60 billion XRP, a price of $1,000 would value the token at about $59.91 trillion. That total would more than double the market cap of gold and top many of the biggest assets on earth. Some analysts use that math to say such prices are not realistic any time soon. Their argument rests on a basic idea — money supply and valuation interact, and extreme price targets imply extreme market value. Garlinghouse Predicts 14% Of SWIFT Volume At the XRPL Apex event in Singapore in 2025, US-based Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse drew a line between messaging systems and actual liquidity. Based on reports from that stage, he told a journalist that XRPL’s future depends more on liquidity than on messaging alone. He estimated the ledger could handle about 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume within five years. That figure is large, but it is an adoption target that sits far below the trillion-dollar claims floated elsewhere. I keep telling everyone, the problem crypto solves is liquidity. You can’t print more money to create liquidity, that will just collapse fiat. But you can have limitless (almost unlimited) liquidity simply by having say a token like XRP reaches $10k, that will create over $800T… https://t.co/YpLUe6Sgal — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 2, 2025 A Different Way To See Liquidity Software engineer Vincent Van Code pushed a contrasting view. According to Van Code, XRP should be judged as a tool that can move liquidity around, not as an asset that must be fully cashed out into fiat to matter. Related Reading: Fast And Furious: XRP’s Next Rally Predicted To Shock Markets He proposed that, at a $10,000 price, XRP could unlock more than $800 trillion in liquidity. Van Code used an analogy likened to a logarithmic decay to explain why converting that liquidity to cash would not simply crash markets. His point: market mechanics and swap processes could expand usable liquidity without requiring a one-to-one conversion into existing money supplies. Easily, because it is just a “swap” or bridge token. Liquidity in FX is more about available trading pairs than simply loads of currency. Further, where that liquidity is sitting in crucial. Your point is more related to economic and monetary policy, which is vastly different… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 3, 2025 Critics Point To Central Banks And Money Supply Other market participants have pushed back. They note that central banks control liquidity through tools like QE and QT, and that broader money measures such as M2 keep changing. Reports show M2 has continued to grow over time in many countries. Those critics ask why governments would hand over control of liquidity to a neutral digital token. They also warn that the math Van Code uses assumes wide adoption, large trading pairs, and guaranteed counterparty trust — all hard to achieve.

52640080,597546,1759546843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52640080.jpeg,Crypto Oversight Concerns: State Regulators Warn Market Structure Bill May Hinder Anti-Fraud Protections,https://bitcoinist.com/state-regulators-crypto-bill-fraud-protections/,"Multiple state authorities shared concerns about the upcoming crypto market structure legislation and its impact on their ability to prosecute fraudsters in crimes related to digital assets. State Regulators Sound The Alarm Over Crypto Bill Regulators from Alabama to Montana sounded the alarms over the highly anticipated crypto market structure bill, warning that it may “diminish their ability to pursue wrongdoers,” Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Amanda Senn, director of the Alabama Securities Commission, told the news media outlet that the Senate’s draft of the legislation, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, does not give state-level regulatory agencies implicit authority to supervise digital asset companies. This oversight could mean that these authorities may not be able to prosecute offenders for fraud. Meanwhile, Federal enforcement against crypto companies has significantly decreased since the Trump administration took office in January. Multiple federal regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have shut down or reduced their digital asset-related enforcement units, dismissing most cases and investigations against crypto firms. According to Cornerstone Research data cited by Bloomberg, the SEC had initiated nine crypto-related enforcement actions by the end of August, a significant drop from the 47and 33 actions taken in 2023 and 2024, respectively. At this pace, 2025 could see the lowest crypto-related enforcement actions since 2017. “The dam is going to break,” Senn argued. “If you don’t have the states paying attention and prosecuting fraud, nobody is looking out.” Montana State Auditor James Brown warned that the bill’s changes to the definition of an investment contract could “let criminals wiggle out of being prosecuted.” “What we are hearing from people, with all the national talk about the benefits of digital currencies and the theory that you are going to get rich quick, you’ve got two factors that lead to easy fraud,” Brown added. State Anti-Fraud Protections In Danger? State regulators have proposed changes to the market structure bill, which is expected to go into markup after late October. Some state officials explained that the Senate’s current draft language would not require crypto businesses to register with states or respond to their inquiries. Additionally, the legislation would change the federal definition of an investment contract, adding new conditions and elements. In September, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) sent a letter to multiple Senators, warning them that Congress must preserve state anti-fraud enforcement authorities in the upcoming crypto bill. The association argued that “it is critical that the resulting framework preserve state anti-fraud protections,” as they protect investors and are “essential in the ongoing fight against online scams.” To achieve this, NASAA offered two recommendations to the lawmakers. First, they suggested that lawmakers reject provisions that redefine the investment contract test, explaining that “upending decades of securities law as contemplated in Section 105 will have devastating effects on anti-fraud efforts by adding so many elements and conditions to the investment contract analysis that form, not substance, will determine whether regulators can take action.” Second, they recommended that Congress enact the Support Anti-Fraud Enforcement (SAFE) Act to ensure states have the anti-fraud authority necessary to respond to residents’ complaints involving digital assets. Despite the concerns, some industry players disagree that the market structure bill will hinder state authorities’ ability to prosecute bad actors. Some suggest that regulators will be able to pursue criminals “in the name of consumer protection.” “I do understand why a state would be worried about it, in particular if the federal system doesn’t engage in any enforcement,” Mauro Wolfe, leading partner of Duane Morris’s Digital Assets and Blockchain Group, told Bloomberg. “I do think this will be an area where defense lawyers will say the states can’t do it, and it will be litigated,” he concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|CLARITY Act|crypto market structure bill|crypto regulation|DOJ|NASAA|Responsible Financial Innovation Act|State regulators|US Congress|US SEC|US Senate,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 03:00:43

Now this doesn’t mean the company is trying to become a bank. Greg made that very clear: “Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank.” What it wants is a green light to go deeper into crypto payments and build more services around them, now that stablecoins are finally being taken seriously in Washington. Payments have become a major focus for Coinbase over the last year. The rise of stablecoins, especially USDC, has made that obvious. In July, President Donald Trump signed new legislation to regulate stablecoins, and since then, things have picked up fast. Coinbase has teamed up with Shopify to promote USDC, which it supports and earns revenue from alongside the issuer Circle. Greg said a national trust charter would give Coinbase one single overseer instead of a patchwork of state regulators, helping it launch new crypto features faster while keeping regulators involved. The charter would also strengthen Coinbase’s ability to weave crypto into everyday payments; on websites, in wallets, and even in big retail checkouts. The exchange wants to simplify how crypto connects with the traditional finance system, but without turning into a bank. Greg called the charter a way to “enable continued innovation” while giving the company room to grow with fewer regulatory blockades. Other crypto firms chase charters while Congress stalls Coinbase isn’t the only one eyeing a national-level license. Circle filed for the same kind of charter in June. Ripple followed in July. Paxos threw in its application by August. One firm, Anchorage Digital Bank NA, already holds a trust charter. All of them want faster access to building crypto tools in a messy U.S. regulatory landscape that still can’t decide who oversees what. Meanwhile, Congress is dragging its feet on another much-awaited crypto market structure bill. Lawmakers are trying to sort out who should regulate what and how to define digital assets under U.S. law. The bill is supposed to go through markup in the Senate by late October, but nobody expects it to actually pass this year, what with all that Trump has dumped on the Congress. Coinbase’s charter application is sort of a workaround this. They go federal, skip the state delays, and push ahead while Capitol Hill sits figuring out how to write rules. And so far, the market seems to approve, because since January, Coinbase stock has surged by 53%, sitting at $380.02 at press time. Coinbase shuts down GiveCrypto and experiments with crypto-based welfare Coinbase has also been experimenting with what to do with its philanthropy programs… or at least, what’s left of them. In 2023, the company shut down GiveCrypto, its own donation effort. It admitted the project failed. “Unable to create lasting change,” the company said at the time. Instead, Coinbase sent $2.6 million in leftover funds to GiveDirectly, a group better equipped to run welfare programs with crypto. As Cryptopolitan reported , that money is now funding a new New York City program called “Future First”, run by GiveDirectly. The goal is to figure out if giving people crypto directly, with no strings, can help them make real decisions around housing, education, and stability. Emma Kelsey, who oversees U.S. programs at GiveDirectly, said the project’s structure is different from traditional basic income tests. Rather than drip-feeding monthly amounts, recipients in NYC are getting one $8,000 lump sum, followed by five smaller deposits of $800 each.

The AVAX four‑hour chart shows price trading near $29.92 with clear support at $27–$25 and a deeper base near $23–$22. Resistance zones sit at $35 and the $40–$42 range. Support levels around $25–$27 have repeatedly acted as rebound points, while intraday swings reflect profit‑taking and short‑term accumulation in the $12.2–12.9 billion market‑cap band. Source: CW Via X Market capitalization movements: why they matter Avalanche market cap swung between approximately $12.1 billion and $12.9 billion in intraday trading, showing both profit‑taking and renewed buying. Holding above $12.5 billion supports short‑term upside, while failing $12.2 billion would increase downside risk. Source: CoinGecko Frequently Asked Questions What caused September 2025 DEX volume to spike for Avalanche? Higher on‑chain activity, increased swap pairs and a cluster of large transactions drove September’s DEX volumes. Market commentary and on‑chain metrics point to renewed trader participation and elevated liquidity demand across AVAX pairs. How should traders interpret the current AVAX support and resistance? Traders should view $27–$25 as immediate support for short‑term longs and $35 as the first clear resistance for breakouts. A sustained move above $40 would indicate broader market confidence; conversely, losing $23–$22 increases downside risk. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What caused September 2025 DEX volume to spike for Avalanche?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Higher on‑chain activity, increased swap pairs and several large transactions drove September’s DEX volumes, indicating renewed trader participation and elevated liquidity on Avalanche."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How should traders interpret AVAX support and resistance now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Treat $27–$25 as immediate support and $35 as first resistance; a break above $40 would signal stronger bullish momentum while losing $23–$22 would increase downside risk."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Avalanche DEX volume surge and AVAX price action"", ""description"": ""Stepwise guide to evaluate the September 2025 Avalanche volume surge and relevant price signals."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm volume data"", ""text"": ""Compare monthly DEX volume series to prior months to verify the $33–34B figure and identify abnormal spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess price support and resistance"", ""text"": ""Locate immediate support at $27–$25 and resistance at $35 and $40–$42 to frame trade bias."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor market cap swings"", ""text"": ""Track intraday market cap between $12.1B–$12.9B for signs of accumulation or profit‑taking."" } ]} Key Takeaways Volume spike : September DEX volume reached about $34B — the largest monthly total in 2025.

The alleged vulnerabilities were reportedly found in Palantir, Anduril Industries and Microsoft’s joint venture called the Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) system, leading to a drop in Palantir’s stock price. Palantir Technologies Inc. rejected claims that its battlefield communications platform suffers from major security flaws after an internal U.S. Army memo warning of “very high risk” vulnerabilities sparked investor concerns and sent its stock tumbling on Friday. Palantir , along with the defense technology firm Anduril Industries Inc. and partners including Microsoft Corp., is building the Army’s Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) system. The platform is designed to connect soldiers, vehicles, commanders, and sensors with real-time data. But a September 5 memo from Army Chief Technology Officer Gabriele Chiulli raised serious red flags, saying the prototype system contained “fundamental security” problems that left it vulnerable to insider threats, external attacks, and data misuse. The document concluded that the platform should be treated as “very high risk” in its current form. Palantir has rejected claims of a security flaw Palantir shares fell more than 8% on Friday, their steepest decline in a day since August, before partially recovering. The company, which has enjoyed a stock rise of over 2,000% in the past three years under President Donald Trump’s administration, was quick to push back on the report. “The concerns raised in the September 5 Army memo were addressed as part of the normal development process. No vulnerabilities were found in the Palantir platform.” A Palantir spokesperson said in a statement . Anduril, which is privately held but eyeing an eventual IPO, also dismissed the report. The company said the memo reflected “an outdated snapshot, not the current state of the program,” stressing that risks are routinely identified early and resolved before systems are deployed in the field. Palantir and Anduril are both riding a wave of lucrative Pentagon contracts under Trump. Palantir recently secured a $480M deal for Maven, an artificial intelligence system designed to analyze battlefield imagery and sensor data, while Anduril signed a $159M contract to develop night vision and mixed reality gear under the Soldier Borne Mission Command program. ‘Very high risk’ concerns Anduril boasts of producing a working NGC2 prototype just eight weeks after winning the Army contract. In September, the company highlighted the system’s success in live-fire exercises at Fort Carson, Colorado. Soldiers using NGC2 reportedly fired artillery missions in seconds compared with minutes for crews relying on legacy communications. Supporters argue that this speed and flexibility are exactly what the U.S. military needs to maintain an edge over adversaries like China and Russia, but the leaked memo, first reported by defense news outlet Breaking Defense, paints a less optimistic picture. The memo stated that the NGC2 prototype’s security posture meant that “any authorized user can potentially access and misuse sensitive classified information,” with no mechanisms in place to log or track their actions. It also noted that third-party applications integrated into the platform had bypassed standard Army security assessments. One app was found to contain 25 high-severity code vulnerabilities, while three others each contained over 200 flaws awaiting review. Perhaps most alarmingly, the memo said the Army could not verify whether the software itself was secure, who was accessing what data, or how user actions could be monitored. “The likelihood of an adversary gaining persistent undetectable access to the platform requires the system be treated as very high risk,” Chiulli wrote. However, Leonel Garciga, the Army’s Chief Information Officer and Chiulli’s supervisor, told Reuters that the findings were part of a structured process to “triage cybersecurity vulnerabilities” and strengthen the system before wider deployment. Lieutenant General Jeth Rey echoed this view, saying, “This is a new capability coming in and we found a risk and we mitigated it right out the gate.” The Army has not said whether the memo will affect the timeline for NGC2’s rollout, but officials insist the development process is designed to treat such problems early, not to reduce confidence in the technology.

The historic plunge comes under President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff policy, which has weighed heavily on India’s trade prospects. Officials in New Delhi are now rolling out long-term plans to cut dependence on the dollar as they try to shore up sentiment for the rupee. The fall of the rupee has made it the worst-performing currency in Asia this year.It has dropped 3.6% against the greenback despite a softer dollar environment. Analysts warn that this slide poses inflation risks for India, which imports a large portion of its fuel, and also makes global investors cautious about deploying funds into Indian markets. Officials are now trying to globalize the rupee in a way similar to China’s strategy with the yuan, but experts say the process is full of obstacles. RBI expands tools to push rupee in cross-border trades The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this week introduced new measures to push global acceptance of the rupee.It announced new reference rates for key partners like the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. By doing so, banks can directly price trades in rupees and partner currencies instead of routing them through the dollar. R. Gurumurthy, a retired regional director at the RBI, said, “Transactions are typically channeled via the dollar, adding a costly layer.” The RBI also broadened the types of assets that holders of some overseas accounts can purchase and allowed banks to lend the local currency in three neighboring countries. Abhishek Upadhyay, an economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd, said the timing of the measures shows the central bank’s effort to strengthen sentiment for the rupee and slow the pace of its depreciation. Experts caution that pushing up the usage of the rupee globally will demand more than publishing a reference rate.Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist at IDFC First Bank, said that “removal of restrictions on the convertibility of the currency” would eventually be required to reach true internationalization. Gurumurthy added that central banks might also need to coordinate interventions to prevent volatility in new currency pairs. “Publishing a reference rate does not by itself create liquidity and banks will only trade actively if there is sufficient demand, hedging tools, and confidence in market stability,” he said. Dollar stays dominant as Indian markets rally under lending reforms Breaking the dollar’s dominance will not be easy. Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed the U.S. currency was on one side of 89% of all foreign-exchange trades in 2025, up from 88% in 2022. While the rupee struggled, India’s stock market index the Nifty 50 rose 0.23% to 24,894.25, and the BSE Sensex added 0.28% to 81,207.17.Both indexes rose about 1% over the week, driven by banks. State-owned lenders surged 4.4%, private banks climbed 2.5%, and high-weight banks increased 2.2% after the RBI eased rules for lending to capital markets and large companies on Wednesday. The RBI kept rates steady as expected but announced plans to raise limits on lending against shares and to cut risk weights for non-bank lenders funding infrastructure projects. “The status quo on rates is a relief for banks as a rate cut would have led to contraction of net interest margins, while the relaxation of restrictions on bank loans will aid credit growth,” said Prakhar Sharma and Vinayak Agrawal, equity analysts at Jefferies. Metals also posted gains. Prices rose 1.8% on the day to a record high, pushing weekly gains to 3.9% on a weaker dollar, supply disruptions, and firmer expectations for an October U.S. rate cut. The broader small-cap and mid-cap indexes gained 1.8% and 2% this week, showing how Indian assets remained strong even as the rupee hit an all-time low. Get seen where it counts.

The recent price surge has fueled optimism that XRP could see further growth in October 2025, with a target price of $4.20 in sight. This potential rally is being driven by upcoming ETF decisions, whale buying activity, and key support levels holding firm. While XRP remains in the spotlight, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as top picks for investors seeking high-upside growth opportunities. With increasing market traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is steadily positioning itself for a major breakout in 2025, joining the ranks of altcoins to watch closely in this shifting market. XRP: Riding on Key Support and ETF Momentum XRP’s price rose 5% in the past 24 hours, up 11% from its local low of $2.69 to trade just below $3 on Thursday. This move positioned XRP for further gains in October, backed by several onchain, technical and fundamental factors. XRP’s record quarterly close on Tuesday came as the price pushed above a key support zone between $2.75-$2.80, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows. The cost basis distribution heatmap shows significant activity in this area, where nearly 4.3 billion XRP were acquired, underscoring the importance of this level. Holding above was critical for a sustained recovery toward $3 and beyond. “$XRP is currently trading within a descending triangle pattern as buyers continue to defend the $2.8 support zone,” said Alpha Crypto Signal analysts, adding: “This compression is setting up for a decisive move.” A breakout above the descending trendline with substantial volume could trigger a bullish leg for XRP toward $3.40–$3.66. As Cointelegraph reported, a decisive breakout from a symmetrical triangle could ignite a rally toward $4.20 in October, fueled by whale buying. October’s ETF spotlight could also add tailwinds to XRP, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deadlines looming mid-month. ETF Momentum Rally Leads Investors to High RIsing Gem While XRP’s growth prospects look strong, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the best altcoins to watch for 2025. The project’s early-stage growth and clear roadmap have sparked interest among both retail and institutional investors. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from other altcoins is its real utility and strong community engagement. As one of the most talked-about projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is poised to deliver substantial returns for those who get in early.

With its steady rise and growing adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a strong contender in the altcoin space, gaining momentum as more investors discover its potential for high returns. Conclusion: From Stability to High-Upside Growth, Diversifying is Key As XRP continues its push toward the $4.20 target, driven by solid support and ETF momentum, it remains one of the top altcoins for stability and growth in the coming months. At the same time, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are offering exciting high-upside growth opportunities for investors looking to diversify and capitalize on future success. With the XRP ETF decision approaching and strong fundamentals driving its momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a key player to watch in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Pedro M., 39, was detained on Thursday, October 3, 2025, following a five-hour manhunt by Thai law enforcement officers. He is wanted across Europe and Asia in connection with schemes allegedly worth more than €500 million ($586 million), involving Bitcoin investment fraud, card skimming, and passport forgery. Fraud suspect arrested after chance encounter Pedro has long been wanted by the Portuguese authorities as well as Thai law enforcement due to various charges. Ironically, an ironic plot twist was about to unfold as the most unlikely person helped nab the two-year fugitive. A Portuguese journalist holidaying in Thailand spotted Pedro in Bangkok and contacted authorities. Facial recognition software and biometric databases helped authorities to confirm the suspect’s identity before plainclothes officers deployed to the scene. After a few hours of surveillance, the suspect was apprehended. Pedro first entered Thailand in 2023 on a tourist visa, but never renewed it or registered an address. Records show his last visa stamp dates back nearly two years. He admitted to overstaying his visa and was formally charged with immigration violations. Authorities said he would face legal proceedings in Thailand before being deported to Portugal, where he is expected to stand trial. He will also be added to Thailand’s immigration blacklist. Pedro ran a wide fraud network According to Interpol records and Portuguese media, Pedro has been on the run for quite a while. He’s the suspect behind a large criminal organization with recorded operations in Europe, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia. Swiss bank accounts linked to hundreds of millions of euros, while victims ranged from retail investors lured into fake crypto platforms to banks and payment processors targeted through credit card fraud. Thai officials said that shortly after his arrival in Bangkok, Pedro was involved in small local Bitcoin scams, defrauding victims of more than 1 million baht, which is about $30,800. According to reports, an arrest warrant was initially issued. However, it was later withdrawn, allowing him to evade capture and resettle in southern Thailand, where he went off radar and dropped off immigration records. By the time of his arrest, European investigators had attributed to him losses exceeding €500 million, placing the case among the largest fraud operations tied to digital assets in recent history. Global stakes in crypto enforcement The arrest throws fresh light on some of the challenges regulators and law enforcement face as crypto-related scams continue to increase. Pedro’s ability to remain in Thailand for nearly two years without valid documentation has raised questions about monitoring processes in the country, even as authorities pointed to the eventual success of biometric tools and international intelligence sharing. While Thai investigators were swift with acting on the tip provided by the journalist, chances are high that Pedro would still have been moving without the chance encounter in Thailand. Pedro is expected to be deported to Lisbon once Thai courts conclude proceedings, where prosecutors are preparing multiple charges, including fraud, money laundering and forgery. Interpol is also expected to assist in attempts to trace and recover assets moved through Swiss accounts. For Portugal, the case will likely mark one of the largest financial crime trials tied to cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Price Poised For October Rally Such projections may seem ambitious, but historical data supports the notion that October has consistently been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months. Over the past 12 years, BTC has closed in the green during October in 10 of those years, and the correlation between strong performances in September and October is noteworthy. Following a positive September—where the Bitcoin price recently posted a gain of 3.91%—the stage appears set for another fruitful October. Bitcoin has an impressive October win rate of 83%, having only recorded losses in the month twice since 2011. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 In 2014, the cryptocurrency fell by 12.95%, and in 2018, it dropped by 3.83%. This remarkable track record highlights October as one of the most profitable months for Bitcoin holders, with an average return of 20.62%. The pattern remains consistent: every time September has closed positively, October has followed suit. Historical data from previous years shows that a green September often leads to substantial gains in October. For instance, in 2015, the Bitcoin price rose by 33.49% after a September increase of 2.35%. Similarly, in 2023, a 3.91% gain in September translated to a substantial 28.52% increase in October. Could BTC Reach $150,000? The bullish sentiment doesn’t end there. In four out of four instances where both September and October closed positively, November also maintained the upward trend. The data showcases consistent gains: in 2015, November saw a 19.27% increase following a strong October. If Bitcoin were to replicate its historical average return of 20.62% this October, a price point around $143,539 could be on the horizon. Even if it aligns with the median return of 14.71%, investors could see new records reaching just above $136,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Levels, Predictions Point To $140,000 By Early 2026 Market expert Michael van de Poppe has also chimed in on the bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price. He noted several strong technical indicators, including BTC’s ability to hold the 20-week moving average as support, breaking through a downtrend at $112,000, and positioning for the highest weekly close in its history. Recent performance has seen a robust 11% weekly candle, further fueling optimism. Additionally, with gold experiencing a significant run, the expert suggests that the Bitcoin price appears poised to catch up. Van de Poppe has expressed confidence that, if current trends continue, the market’s leading cryptocurrency could not only hit $150,000 this quarter but also achieve a new all-time high within the month. When writing, BTC trades at approximately $121,669, only 2% below all-time high levels above $124,000.

Following today’s update, MARA remains the second-largest public company with BTC reserves, trailing Michael Saylor’s Strategy. MARA Holdings Increases Bitcoin Reserves According to an official announcement earlier today, MARA Holdings’ BTC reserves rose by 373 coins in September. The firm’s total BTC holdings are valued at approximately $6.4 billion, according to prevailing market prices. Notably, MARA Holdings mined a total of 736 BTC in September, valued at approximately $88.6 million. In comparison, the company had mined 704 BTC in August 2025, representing a 4.4% increase over the previous month. MARA Holdings’ amount of BTC mined in September represents roughly 5.2% of all miner rewards. This includes the transaction fees generated during the month. Unsurprisingly, MARA Holdings continues to be the largest public BTC miner in terms of BTC held. That said, it is worth highlighting that MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin stack consists of BTC that is loaned, actively managed, or used as collateral. Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO, MARA Holdings, noted: In September, we produced 218 blocks, a 5% increase over August, demonstrating the continued strength and resilience of our operations even as global hashrate grew 9% month-over-month to an average of 1,031 EH/s. This growth in production underscores our ability to execute consistently, even as mining becomes more difficult. As mentioned earlier, MARA Holdings follows Strategy, the leading public company with the largest stack of BTC on its balance sheet. Strategy continued to increase its BTC stack, purchasing another $22 million worth of BTC earlier this week, propelling its total holdings to a mammoth 640,031 BTC, worth around $77 billion. Other public firms that feature among the top BTC holders include the likes of Twenty One (43,514 BTC), Japan-based Metaplanet (30,823 BTC), and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (30,021 BTC). In addition, well-known firms like Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., Galaxy Digital Holdings, Coinbase Global, Tesla, and Jack Dorsey-backed Block rank among the top 15 public companies with the largest BTC reserves. Companies Preferring Altcoins For Corporate Treasury While Bitcoin still reigns supreme in terms of being the most influential cryptocurrency with the highest adoption, altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) are emerging as viable competition to BTC. For instance, NASDAQ-listed VisionSys AI recently announced that it plans to launch a Solana-based treasury program, valued at up to $2 billion.

The company contends that such a move would be too risky, technically complex, and could destabilize the market. Over five days of testimony, witnesses backing the tech firm warned that a divestiture could jeopardize operations expected to generate $15.9 billion in revenue by 2025, based on projections from research firm eMarketer. They further argued that dismantling the company’s ad exchange would sow uncertainty across the digital advertising industry, diminish service quality for smaller publishers, and deter potential investors. Google finds itself in a problem with illegal monopoly allegations Google’s trial process focuses on suitable methods to foster competition in the technology that supports the display advertising industry, which the tech giant controls. The trial came after Leonie Brinkema, an American lawyer and jurist serving as a United States district judge of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, ruled that the tech company held an illegal monopoly in two areas, that is, the advertising exchange and ad server, a publisher-side technology, in April. The tech firm currently sells ads for website publishers, provides tools for advertisers to buy placements, and runs an exchange where transactions are completed through real-time auctions. In response to the ruling, the Justice Department has proposed that the tech firm be forced to divest its AdX exchange and disclose how its ad server determines which ads are displayed. Notably, if these changes fail to fix competition issues encountered in the market, the department has requested that the company gradually sell its ad server. In response to these proposals, Google has suggested integrating its technology with a popular alternative, Prebid, and competing ad servers. It has also pledged not to reinstate certain auction methods that the court found gave them unfair benefits, known as “first look” and “last look.” However, it is worth noting that the company’s efforts mainly focused on fighting against the Justice Department’s proposal to make it sell AdX. On the other hand, the agency argued that they found this proposal appealing because it will control approximately 56% of the display ads market, supporting a significant portion of the open web. Google fights against the Justice Department’s proposal to make it sell AdX Concerning the sales of its ad exchange, Google outlined several arguments to convince the court that the Justice Department’s proposal was not a suitable solution. According to the tech company, selling AdX is technically tricky. This is because many of its engineers and outside experts agree that the ad exchange, unlike the rest of Google’s technology, would be complex. AdX and the publisher ad server are now integrated into a single product under Google Ad Manager. Glenn Berntson, engineering director for Google Ad Manager, stated that this allows them to share processing power and reduces the time it takes to decide which ad to load on a webpage. Heather Adkins, Google’s vice president of security engineering, commented on the situation. Adkins likened the relationship between AdX and Google’s core infrastructure to knitting, explaining that it is very intertwined. Still, the Justice Department argues that the connection of Google’s AdX product to its underlying infrastructure could be replaced with tools from cloud providers, including the tech firm’s own offering, Google Cloud Platform. Although Adkins acknowledged that some of Google’s core services have similar versions, they may not operate in exactly the same way.

Dogecoin price rose 16% after a late-September support bounce, signaling renewed buying interest. SEC action on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETF filings is the near-term event traders expect to move DOGE. Dogecoin sits below major resistance: a move to $1 requires 250%+ upside; technical patterns warn of mixed risk. Dogecoin price surged 16% after a support bounce; monitor the SEC DOGE ETF decision for potential upside — read our analysis and trading checklist. What is driving the recent Dogecoin price surge? Dogecoin price climbed roughly 16% after bouncing off a key support level in late September, moving to $0.2630 as buyers entered the dip. Market participants cite improving technicals and the anticipated SEC decision on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs as the primary near-term drivers. How could an SEC DOGE ETF approval affect Dogecoin? Approval of spot DOGE ETFs could increase institutional accessibility and liquidity, lifting Dogecoin’s visibility in portfolios. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has said regulators are likely to approve many ETF filings; market history shows ETF approvals tend to coincide with increased inflows and heightened volatility. Expect short-term volatility around the announcement. Why is technical analysis mixed despite the rally? Dogecoin cleared its 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages, a bullish short-term sign. However, the chart is forming a rising wedge pattern, which can precede corrections as trendlines converge. Reaching $1 requires more than 250% upside from current levels, making that target unlikely without sustained institutional demand. Dogecoin price has surged by 16% after hitting a key support level. Investors are optimistic ahead of the SEC’s ETF decision. Dogecoin price has surged 16% after bouncing off a crucial support level in September, signaling renewed investor confidence. The SEC’s expected approval of Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs could further boost Dogecoin’s momentum in the coming weeks. While DOGE’s price has rebounded, analysts suggest it will take significant time before it reaches the $1 resistance level. Dogecoin has recently experienced a significant bounce after hitting a crucial support level in late September. Investors bought the dip, lifting the token to approximately $0.2630, a 16% uptick from the local low. The move coincides with growing market optimism as traders anticipate regulatory clarity on spot DOGE ETFs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is widely expected to rule on multiple DOGE ETF applications, including filings from Grayscale and Bitwise. Market commentators such as Eric Balchunas (Bloomberg) have noted a favorable probability for ETF approvals given the current regulatory context and the existence of regulated derivatives tied to Dogecoin. Such approvals typically increase asset visibility to institutional managers. When is the SEC decision likely, and what should traders watch? SEC deadlines vary by filing but are concentrated in the coming weeks. Traders should watch official SEC announcements and major ETF filing timelines. Key on-chain and market signals to monitor include volume spikes, inflows into DOGE-denominated ETFs (when available), and price behavior around the $0.3088 year-to-date high. Source: TradingView Despite the rally, the path to $1 remains long. A move that large needs sustained capital inflows and structural adoption. Analysts caution that a rising wedge increases the probability of a short-term correction even while moving averages point higher. Traders should size positions with risk controls in place. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Dogecoin Price Surges 16% as Investors Eye SEC DOGE ETF Decision"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-32-1024x515.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Dogecoin price rose 16% after a support bounce; the SEC’s decision on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs is the key near-term catalyst for further momentum."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/dogecoin-price-surges-oct-2025"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Dogecoin reach $1 if the SEC approves DOGE ETFs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""An ETF approval would likely boost Dogecoin's visibility and liquidity, but reaching $1 requires sustained institutional inflows and broader adoption; a one-time approval is unlikely to deliver that full move immediately."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When is the SEC expected to decide on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETF filings?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Decision timelines vary by filing, but market participants expect key rulings within the coming weeks; traders should monitor official SEC notices and ETF filing updates for exact dates."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor Dogecoin price ahead of the SEC ETF decision"", ""description"": ""Steps to follow price action, technical signals, and regulatory updates to make informed decisions."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track key technical levels"", ""text"": ""Monitor 50-day and 100-day EMAs, recent support at $0.225–$0.24, and the year-to-date high at $0.3088 for breakout or rejection signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch regulatory timelines"", ""text"": ""Review SEC filing deadlines and public notices for Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETF applications and set alerts for announcements."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Manage risk"", ""text"": ""Use position sizing and stop-loss levels; expect elevated volatility around ETF decision dates and prepare for rapid price swings."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How high could Dogecoin realistically climb after ETF approval? Short term, DOGE could see strong gains due to increased demand, but $1 remains unlikely without sustained institutional adoption. Market experts place higher probability on sizable but incremental moves rather than immediate triple-digit percentage gains. How should retail traders respond to ETF news? Retail traders should avoid emotional leverage. Use alerts, define stop-losses, and consider incremental entries. Keep positions size-limited and prioritize capital preservation during event-driven volatility. Key Takeaways Immediate catalyst : SEC decisions on Grayscale and Bitwise DOGE ETFs are the key near-term drivers. Technical outlook : 50/100-day EMA cross provides short-term support, but a rising wedge warns of possible correction. Risk management : Expect volatility around announcements—use stops and prudent position sizing. Conclusion Dogecoin price has shown renewed momentum after a 16% bounce off key support, with the SEC’s handling of DOGE ETF filings the primary event to watch. Investors should balance bullish catalysts with technical caution and maintain disciplined risk management as regulatory clarity unfolds.

With optimism building across the market, targets as high as $10,000 for ETH have surfaced for 2025. Yet while Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto world, some traders argue the most dramatic multiples may come from smaller projects. One name that continues to generate buzz is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , a presale altcoin priced at just $0.0058 that is already being tipped to surpass $2 in the next cycle. Ethereum price prediction points higher Ethereum has shown resilience in 2025, with ETH recovering strongly after periods of volatility. Analysts now suggest the network’s continued dominance in DeFi and NFTs, along with upcoming scalability improvements could drive ETH toward $8,000–$10,000. While that kind of run would deliver strong returns, critics argue that such gains are modest compared to what smaller tokens could achieve. Institutional inflows remain a critical factor. With spot ETH ETFs gaining traction, liquidity has surged, further solidifying Ethereum’s role as the backbone of Web3. For most investors, ETH remains a safe choice. However, the question many are asking is not whether Ethereum will rise but which new tokens could outperform it. Why smaller caps can deliver bigger multiples Large-cap coins like Ethereum, while safer, are unlikely to deliver the explosive 50x or 100x multiples that draw speculative capital. That is why presale tokens are attracting attention. With low entry prices and rapid growth narratives, they offer a level of upside that even the most bullish Ethereum price prediction cannot match. This is where Layer Brett enters the conversation. By combining meme appeal with Ethereum Layer 2 technology, it represents a unique mix of hype and utility. Traders looking for the next breakout are starting to view LBRETT as a way to complement ETH holdings with higher-risk, higher-reward exposure. Layer Brett’s rapid rise Layer Brett’s presale has already raised over $4.2 million, showing strong demand from early backers. The token’s staking rewards sit at 616% APY at the time of writing, although these yields will decrease as more wallets join. This mechanism creates urgency for investors who want to maximise rewards before dilution. Beyond staking, the roadmap includes NFT launches, gamified staking mechanics and cross-chain bridging, which elevate Layer Brett above the average meme project. Accessibility is also a major selling point: Buying requires only a wallet connection and ETH or USDT, making entry simple for newcomers and veterans alike. The project has also teased a $1 million giveaway, designed to boost engagement and reward early adopters. Combined with its utility features, this has helped Layer Brett capture a wave of attention across crypto communities. Social traction fuels momentum Strong communities often drive meme coin success and Layer Brett is no exception. Telegram and X groups have around 10,000 members, TikTok has over 25,000 followers and YouTube reviews rack up thousands of views. This online presence signals a project already breaking into mainstream conversation — something essential for viral growth. Final thoughts The most bullish Ethereum price prediction sees ETH climbing toward $10,000, cementing its status as a safe long-term bet. But for those chasing exponential returns, Layer Brett offers a far sharper upside. At $0.0058 in presale, with over $4.2 million already raised, staking yields above 600% APY, plus a roadmap including NFTs, gamified staking, cross-chain functionality and a $1 million giveaway, it has all the ingredients for viral success. Ethereum may remain the backbone of Web3 but in terms of multiples, analysts are increasingly pointing to LBRETT as the token most likely to deliver 50x or even 100x gains.

AI Reveals Shocking Answer,https://cryptopotato.com/will-bnb-overtake-xrp-and-when-ai-reveals-shocking-answer/,"The cryptocurrency tied to the world’s largest digital asset exchange has been on a roll lately, smashing new all-time highs on a regular basis, with the latest being above $1,190. This has propelled its market capitalization to a peak of its own at roughly $160 billion as of the time of this writing. This puts BNB in a relatively close proximity to the likes of USDT and XRP. The question that we asked ChatGPT was: Will (or when) BNB can surpass both? Can BNB Overtake XRP? Although the current difference of $30 billion between the duo’s market caps is still quite significant, what’s more worrying to the XRP Army is the lack of actual momentum behind their favorite asset. Ripple’s cross-border token peaked in mid-July at $3.65, but it has failed to resume its run ever since and currently struggles at $3.00 even as the entire market is pumping. In contrast, BNB, perhaps led by the hype around ASTER, has rocketed in the past month, gaining 30% compared to XRP’s more modest 8.5%. Its new all-time high came on Friday evening at just over $1,190. ChatGPT outlined several other bullish factors behind BNB, including the global market dominance of the exchange behind it, the growing activity of the BNB Chain, and the burning mechanism, which reduces the amount of tokens until the total supply is down to 100 million. At the same time, OpenAI’s chatbot acknowledged that XRP has been trading mainly sideways lately, and the momentum surrounding it appears to be lacking. It noted that the adoption progress of the XRP Ledger and RLUSD is relatively slow compared to speculation-driven hype cycles, such as BNB and ASTER. “My take: Based on momentum + fundamentals, BNB has a strong chance of overtaking XRP by end of this year,” commented the AI solution. In a more ‘bullish’ scenario for BNB, ChatGPT said the flippening can happen somewhere in October or November if the asset’s momentum continues and adds another 20-25%, while XRP stalls. Not So Fast ChatGPT also outlined a different scenario in which XRP breaks out of consolidation and reaches new highs, thus maintaining or extending the gap with BNB. In it, the token and the company behind it would require a significant catalyst. The most probable appears to be the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission has over a dozen filings on its desk waiting for a decisive decision after multiple delays . Many of those have a deadline set for October, and a green light could send the underlying asset flying, the AI chatbot said. According to current odds on Polymarket, the chances for such financial products to hit the US markets by the end of the year are almost 100%.

And the buzz? Some are calling for gains of 4,000%. Here’s how these three stack up, and which one might just blow up next bull run. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Power Meets Layer 2 Innovation Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a Layer 2 blockchain purpose-built for meme culture, speed, and ultra-low fees. At the core of its ecosystem lies the $LILPEPE token, which powers every transaction and utility across the network. With meme culture thriving in the crypto space, LILPEPE aims to be the first chain fully dedicated to launching and supporting meme projects. Right now, the presale is in Stage 13, with tokens priced at $0.0022. Out of the 17.25 billion tokens allocated for presale, over 93.45% have already been sold, raising more than $26.29 million. The next stage price is set at $0.0023, showing steady demand from early buyers eager to secure their spot before exchange listings. Security is also a major selling point. LILPEPE has been successfully audited by CertiK, receiving a 95.49% security score, which ranks it among the most secure meme tokens in the DeFi space. The audit covered smart contract logic, admin privileges, vulnerabilities, and compliance with ERC-20 standards, giving investors peace of mind. The Tokenomics Are Designed For Sustainability: 26.5% Presale – Rewarding Early Believers. 30% Chain Reserves – ensuring long-term ecosystem support. 10% Liquidity – deep trading pools for smoother transactions. 10% DEX Allocation – for decentralized exchange listings. 13.5% Staking & Rewards – Incentivizing Long-Term Holders. 10% Marketing – pushing meme dominance through viral campaigns. 0% Tax – no buy or sell fees, keeping it DeFi-friendly. Additionally, the team has launched a Mega Giveaway, rewarding large presale buyers with ETH prizes. Combine this with meme culture, community-driven growth, and a unique Layer 2 chain, and it’s easy to see why analysts are calling LILPEPE one of the few tokens with true 4000% upside potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Veteran Fighting Back Shiba Inu defends $0.0000115 support as whales scoop up 62B SHIB. Falling exchange balances hint at rising self-custody, signaling bullish sentiment and expectations of higher prices ahead. The Shiba Inu burn rate has also surged more than 100%, helping reduce supply pressure. Meanwhile, ecosystem growth continues with the rollout of Shibarium, its own Layer 2 solution designed to boost utility. Some analysts even speculate on the long-term potential of a Shiba Inu ETF, which could bring institutional demand. However, while SHIB has plenty of community support and upside, reaching a true 4000% return from its current levels is less likely compared to newer, smaller-cap projects like LILPEPE. Cardano (ADA): The Smart Contract Powerhouse Unlike SHIB and LILPEPE, Cardano isn’t a meme coin—it’s a smart contract blockchain going up against the likes of Ethereum and Solana. Right now, ADA is hanging around the $0.80 support zone, with bulls eyeing a move back toward $1.50–$2.00, and maybe even $3.00 if momentum really kicks in. One big plus for Cardano is its institutional backing. Cardano’s ETF inclusion highlights its strength, while rising exchange outflows suggest investors are holding rather than selling. As long as ADA holds that $0.80 base, analysts think it could grind higher. The catch? Its growth probably won’t be as wild as meme coins—more slow and steady than a moonshot. Which Coin Holds the 4000% Potential? Cardano (ADA) is a blue-chip project with steady upside, strong fundamentals, and institutional backing. It’s more about slow and sustainable growth than explosive gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains strong in terms of community momentum and technical patterns, indicating a potential breakout. While it could deliver solid returns, its large market cap makes a 4000% rally less realistic. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the wild card with the highest upside. Its combination of meme power, Layer 2 technology, zero-tax structure, and viral marketing strategy gives it a unique edge. Backed by a strong audit score and presale momentum, LILPEPE is positioned to become the next big meme coin explosion. Author’s Note For investors chasing life-changing gains, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most compelling play of the three. With a presale nearly sold out, a launchpad for meme projects, and a Layer 2 chain designed to outpace competitors, it has the ingredients to replicate or even surpass the success of early SHIB and DOGE investors. SHIB and ADA remain solid bets for more conservative traders, but for those seeking the next 4000% crypto rocket, Little Pepe could be the frog that jumps the highest.

ETH current price: $4,463 with $4,505 as immediate resistance. Upside targets: $6,035 (1.618 Fibonacci) and $6,900 (measured move). Market drivers: Spot ETH ETF buys (~$80M), whale accumulation, and steady weekly volumes. Ethereum bull flag gains momentum; ETH price target $6,900 if $4,505 breaks — read analysis and trade implications from COINOTAG. What is the Ethereum bull flag and why does it matter? The Ethereum bull flag is a weekly continuation pattern formed after a strong rally, signaling consolidation before a potential breakout. It matters because a confirmed breakout above $4,505 could accelerate returns toward key targets like $6,035 and $6,900, particularly with ETF inflows and on-chain accumulation supporting demand. How do spot ETH ETFs and $80M inflows affect the ETH price? Spot ETH ETFs increase institutional demand and liquidity, which can tighten available supply and lift price action. Reported single-day ETF purchases of about $80 million coincide with whale accumulation and steady weekly trading volumes, reinforcing the bullish structure and improving probability of a breakout. Market-cap snapshot: ETH market capitalization near $538 billion with 24h volume around $47 billion (CoinMarketCap, plain text). Bull Flag Structure Strengthens The weekly chart shows a classic bull flag: a sharp prior rally followed by a tight, downward-sloping consolidation channel. Ethereum moved from under $2,500 in June to above $4,000 in August, then formed higher lows inside the flag. A breakout above the upper trendline and $4,505 resistance is the technical trigger for measured-move targets. #Ethereum Bull Flag Weekly bull flag pattern forming on $ETH.

The dotted projection on the chart indicates potential continuation once a confirmed weekly breakout occurs. Market Data and Technical Signals Key market data points front-loaded: Price range (24h): $4,396 – $4,550; closing near $4,463. Market capitalization: ~$538 billion (CoinMarketCap, plain text). 24h volume: ~$47 billion (CoinMarketCap, plain text). Analyst notes: Ali Martinez flags resistance at $4,505 as the immediate hurdle. Kamran Asghar notes a confirmed breakout above $4,282 with a 1.618 Fibonacci extension target at $6,035. Institutional flow data reported by SoSoValue shows spot ETF purchases around $80M in a single day, a notable demand signal when combined with on-chain whale accumulation. Source: AliMartinez (X) How should traders interpret the technical setup? Use clear triggers and risk management: a weekly close above $4,505 confirms continuation; a failure below the lower flag trendline invalidates the pattern. Volume confirmation—higher volumes on breakout—strengthens the signal. Apply stop-losses below recent swing lows and scale position sizes to volatility.

A weekly close above $4,505 that breaks the flag’s upper trendline with elevated volume generally confirms the breakout and opens targets like $6,035 and $6,900. How much did spot ETH ETFs buy and why does it matter? Spot ETH ETFs reportedly purchased around $80 million in one day. That volume matters because it signals institutional demand, which can support higher price targets if accumulation continues. Key Takeaways Pattern: Weekly bull flag indicates consolidation with a bullish tilt. Trigger: Weekly close above $4,505 on strong volume confirms continuation. Drivers: Spot ETH ETF inflows (~$80M), whale accumulation, and steady on-chain metrics support upside. Conclusion Ethereum’s weekly bull flag and institutional flows create a high-probability bullish scenario if price clears $4,505. Traders should watch volume and on-chain metrics closely, use disciplined risk management, and monitor targets at $6,035 and $6,900.

The post suggests that SWIFT has incorporated Ripple’s technology into its operations, with XRP positioned to provide liquidity for the evolving financial system. The information was presented alongside a video explaining PaymentSafe’s framework and its role in enhancing payment efficiency through universal connectivity. Breaking: SWIFT has quietly woven Ripple’s tech into its network. #XRP is set to fuel liquidity for the next-generation financial system pic.twitter.com/ayyNGVKn6h — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) October 1, 2025 PaymentSafe and its Functionality The video explains that PaymentSafe is a centralized platform for processing payments across multiple networks, including domestic systems, international corridors, and SWIFT . The design is built around enabling straight-through processing by removing fragmentation in formats and message flows. One of its highlighted features is the “universal translator,” a component that converts between legacy SWIFT MT messages and ISO 20022 standards, including CBPR+. This translation capability allows banks and financial institutions to streamline operations without being constrained by legacy infrastructures. PaymentSafe also includes back-office integration with functions such as core banking, treasury, trade finance, reconciliation, and internet channels. The platform embeds compliance tools like sanction screening and anti-fraud workflows. Additional modules cover reporting, message workflow, and centralized monitoring, making it a broad system designed to meet regulatory and operational requirements while unifying payment activity. Network Connectivity and Ripple’s Presence The screenshot shared alongside the video shows PaymentSafe’s interoperability with multiple networks. These include SWIFT , real-time gross settlement systems, ACH, instant payments, and central bank clearing systems. Notably, Ripple and distributed ledger technology appear as network endpoints within this diagram. The implication presented in the post is that PaymentSafe facilitates connectivity between traditional financial networks and emerging technologies, creating a bridge for new forms of liquidity management. The claim emphasized by CryptoSensei is that SWIFT has “woven” Ripple’s technology into its ecosystem, making XRP a potential liquidity solution within this integrated framework. While the materials presented highlight Ripple’s placement in the PaymentSafe architecture, they do not provide evidence of XRP being directly operational within SWIFT flows . Rather, the diagram and explanation indicate PaymentSafe’s ability to unify multiple networks, with Ripple shown as one of the available endpoints. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Suggested Role of XRP According to the interpretation given in the post, XRP’s role would be to provide liquidity across payment corridors that traditionally rely on pre-funded accounts or correspondent banking. By positioning XRP within a hub that can translate and process multiple formats under a single interface, the argument is made that financial institutions could reduce friction and costs when accessing liquidity. PaymentSafe’s compliance and fraud-prevention features are also cited as crucial for making such an approach viable in regulated financial environments. CryptoSensei’s post connects PaymentSafe, SWIFT, and Ripple into a narrative suggesting a deeper level of integration between legacy networks and emerging technologies.

Shibarium Team Implements New Security Measures According to a post-mortem report , the malicious attack involved a perpetrator submitting three fraudulent checkpoints to Shibarium’s Ethereum mainnet contracts, disrupting the continuity between Heimdall’s local state and the on-chain state. After the attack was detected, Shibarium’s Kaal Dhairya announced on social media platform X (previously twitter) that authorities had been alerted, while also expressing a willingness to negotiate with the attacker in exchange for the return of the stolen funds. However, no agreement was reached, and the attacker has since moved the stolen assets, leaving the Shibarium team to focus on recovery and security enhancements for the platform. In light of this, Heimdall intentionally halted operations, pausing legitimate checkpoint submissions to prevent further damage. They also described the attacker’s method, which included a short-lived stake amplification strategy through a 4.6 million BONE delegation. This tactic allowed the attacker to cross operational thresholds and attempt to gain unauthorized control over the system. To address these issues, the Shibarium team organized their response into multiple overlapping workstreams, functioning around the clock in collaboration with Hexens.io, an independent reviewer. Their approach included daily stand-ups, continuous monitoring of changes, and strict separation of duties among team members responsible for infrastructure, contracts, validator operations, and testnets . This aimed to eliminate any single points of failure, employing hardware custody for keys and ensuring every critical change was rehearsed off-chain or on testnets prior to implementation. Shiba Inu Dev’s Strategy To Compensate Affected Users As part of their actions, Shiba Inu devs introduced a rescue method in the StakeManager to recover at-risk BONE tokens. They executed the AdminConsumeLegacyBound function to clean up legacy unbond states associated with the attacker’s contract. This response verified that the staking ledger updates were successful, ultimately rescuing the 4.6 million BONE and removing the malicious delegation. Looking ahead, Shiba Inu developers detailed their plans for the near future, which include implementing blacklisting measures in the Plasma Bridge. These controls aim to prevent malicious actors from initiating or completing bridge transactions. Once these measures are in place and thoroughly verified, the team intends to restore full bridge functionality. In addition to these technical updates, Shiba Inu developers are designing a comprehensive plan to ensure that affected users are made whole. This plan will incorporate gating, phased limits, and coordination with partners to facilitate safe bridging and withdrawals. Specific details will be communicated only when it is deemed secure to do so.

SOPR Trend Hints At $5,000 Upside",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-breakout-sopr-trend-5000-upside/,"Ethereum (ETH) has been on an uptrend since September 28, surging from around $3,800 to the mid $4,000 range at the time of writing. According to recent data from Binance, ETH went through a “reset” during the second half of September and early October, and may now be eyeing the $5,000 price level. Ethereum Reset Over, New Highs Soon? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, ETH underwent a healthy reset over the past few weeks. While the digital asset initially dropped to $3,800 – $3,900 range, it is now trading in the mid $4,000 level. Related Reading: Ethereum Close To Local Bottom? Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest At the same time, ETH’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remained volatile around 1.0, with multiple spikes above one and a singular outlier, shown in the chart below. It suggests that short-term inflows are generating enough demand to meet the supply. In simple words, any price decline is quickly reversed as long as the ETH SOPR remains above 1.0. The chart shows a local bottom created in late September near $3,800 – $3,900. This local bottom was soon followed by a gradual rebound to $4,500. However, the reversal did not occur at once. Instead, it occurred in multiple stages, with short price corrections that did not go below previous lows. For most of this period, the SOPR hovered between 0.98 and 1.03, a neutral range that suggests a rotation in position instead of a broad market sell-off. Although some flash highs surged above 1.0, these profit-taking bursts were quickly absorbed by the strong demand for ETH. Currently, Ethereum is showing signs of reaccumulation. As long as any pullback keeps the SOPR at or above 1.0 and the support level at $4,000 is not breached, ETH could benefit from a continued upside scenario. Arab Chain added: A sustained break above 4.5K would consolidate demand momentum and open the way for gradually higher targets, while a break below 4.0K with SOPR <1 would be the first clear sign that sellers have taken control. ETH Reserves On Exchange Continue To Dwindle Besides ETH’s bullish momentum that may propel it to $5,000, the digital asset’s reserves on crypto exchanges continue to decline. Recent analysis found that an increasing number of new ETH investors are withdrawing ETH for self-custody or staking. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Sees Sharpest Reset Since 2024 As Price Drops Below $4,000 ETH whale behavior also points toward a potential upcoming price rally for the cryptocurrency. Recently, ETH whales scooped as much as $1.73 billion worth of ETH, sending exchange balances to a nine-year low. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently gave a rare bullish signal, suggesting a potential price appreciation to $8,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,471, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

That kind of start is statistically close to flawless. Now Bank of America says that every time in history the S&P 500 surged at least 10% by September’s end, it kept rising for the rest of the year. Well except in 2012 when the U.S. got slammed by a fiscal cliff and global growth slowed. That year, the index gave back 1% in Q4 after gaining 15% in the first nine months. So far, 2025 doesn’t look anything like 2012. There’s no fiscal cliff, and overseas markets are not in freefall. What there is, however, is momentum. The S&P 500 is actually coming off back-to-back 20%+ gains in both 2023 and 2024. And as of Friday, the benchmark index closed at 6,715.79, barely higher on the day but enough to etch another record into its YTD climb. Analysts project 7,000 by December, ignore shutdown Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, doesn’t see the rally stalling out anytime soon. He told clients this week he expects the S&P 500 to reach 7,000 by December, which would be at least 4% higher than Thursday’s closing level. Tom said the U.S. government shutdown, which stretched into its third day on Friday, wasn’t a concern for markets: “It’s had little impact on stocks in the past,” he wrote. Tom called the postponed release of the September nonfarm payrolls report a “sidebar issue.” That report was scheduled for Friday but got delayed because of the funding lapse. Investors instead focused on other signals, including a report from the Institute for Supply Management, which showed the services employment index shrank for the fourth straight month. That slowdown gave traders more confidence that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are still on the table. Even though the shutdown didn’t move the S&P 500 much this week, Tom did caution that a longer lapse in federal funding could eventually weigh on stocks. He also warned that a spike in investor excitement might become a problem. If too many people pile into stocks at once, he said, there could be no one left to buy and push prices higher later. That could freeze the rally right when people think it’s unstoppable. Dow and S&P 500 close at record highs, Nasdaq slips While the S&P 500 barely moved Friday, it still finished with a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 238.56 points, or 0.51%, to end at 46,758.28, also hitting a new closing high. The Nasdaq Composite wasn’t as lucky. It dropped 63.54 points, or 0.28%, closing at 22,780.51. Beneath the surface, there were some sharp moves. Applied Materials slumped by 2.7% after the chip-equipment maker said Thursday night that it expects a $600 million hit to its 2026 revenue. The tech sector took a hit overall, dragging on the Nasdaq’s performance. Tesla stock fell by 1.4%, showing weakness in big-name growth stocks. But utilities stocks ran in the opposite direction, up by 1.2% on the day, leading the sector gains inside the S&P 500. Despite the noise, the full week looked strong across the board. The Dow added 1.1%, matching the S&P 500’s 1.1% gain, while the Nasdaq closed out the week with a 1.3% rise. That capped off a bullish start to Q4, with the S&P 500 still grinding higher and holding its most perfect track record.

Liquidity inflows surged: $1.1B added in September, $5.9B since March Stablecoin supply rose by $4.42B since June, topping $14.8B 30-day trading volume reached $125.62B; perpetuals contributed $43.61B Meta description: Solana market outlook: liquidity inflows, TVL and stablecoin supply surge—key signals for SOL traders. Read the concise market summary and takeaways. What is Solana’s current market outlook? Solana market outlook is currently positive, driven by rising TVL, strong stablecoin supply inflows and elevated trading volumes. These on-chain signals point to increased network usage and investor accumulation, suggesting a higher probability of near-term upside for SOL without implying guaranteed price direction. Why are liquidity inflows rising on Solana? Liquidity inflows have accelerated as users deposit capital into Solana-based protocols, lifting Total Value Locked (TVL). In September alone, on-chain inflows added roughly $1.1 billion , and cumulative additions since March total about $5.9 billion (DeFiLlama data). Higher TVL typically indicates stronger protocol engagement and capital commitment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana market outlook: Liquidity inflows, TVL and stablecoin supply surge"", ""description"": ""Solana market outlook is positive as liquidity inflows, stablecoin supply and trading volumes increase, signaling stronger investor confidence in SOL."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://COINOTAG.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.17.42.png"" } }, ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.17.42.png"" ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana seeing real inflows or just transient volume?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Data shows sustained deposits: $1.1B added in September and $5.9B since March, plus growing stablecoin supply and rising TVL, indicating more persistent capital commitment rather than only transient volume spikes."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain metrics confirm investor interest in Solana?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key metrics include Total Value Locked growth, a $4.42B rise in stablecoin supply since June, $125.62B 30-day trading volume, and bridge netflows climbing from $23.29B in March to $44.03B at press time."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Solana inflows and volume"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess whether Solana's inflows and volume signal durable network growth."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check TVL trends"", ""text"": ""Compare month-over-month TVL to confirm sustained deposit growth rather than short-term spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Review stablecoin supply"", ""text"": ""Evaluate stablecoin inflows as a proxy for available trading liquidity and capital on the network."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Analyze trading volumes and derivatives"", ""text"": ""Confirm whether DEX and perpetual volumes are increasing in line with on-chain activity to validate broader market engagement."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How much liquidity was added to Solana in September? September saw approximately $1.1 billion of inflows on Solana, reflecting increased deposits into protocols and stronger on-chain capital allocation according to available on-chain analytics data. How large is Solana’s current stablecoin supply increase? Stablecoin supply on Solana rose by about $4.42 billion from a June low of $10.47 billion, pushing total supply above $14.8 billion . In the last seven days, roughly $1.445 billion in stablecoins were added. Liquidity inflow spikes across the market Month-over-month liquidity inflows into Solana have accelerated, driven by higher deposits into DeFi protocols and increased stablecoin balances. Growing TVL indicates capital is being committed to the network’s ecosystem. Since March, roughly $5.9 billion has been added to Solana’s ecosystem (DeFiLlama data). These figures support the view that network usage is expanding and investor interest is rising. Source: DeFiLlama Volume surge on exchanges Exchange volume on Solana has climbed markedly. Over the last 30 days, Solana recorded approximately $125.62 billion in trading volume, led by decentralized exchanges and derivatives trading. Perpetual exchanges accounted for about $43.61 billion of that volume, highlighting rapid growth in Solana-based derivative markets and deeper liquidity pools on DEXs. Source: DeFiLlama Investors shifting to Solana Investor flows also point to accumulation. Bridge netflow data shows a recovery from a March low of $23.29 billion to roughly $44.03 billion at press time, suggesting assets are being bridged into Solana at a faster pace. Source: DeFiLlama These inflows and on-chain engagement metrics suggest investors are increasingly viewing Solana as a platform for capital deployment and trading activity rather than a transient speculative destination. Comparative summary Metric Recent Level Significance Total Value Locked (TVL) + $5.9B since March Shows capital commitment to protocols Stablecoin supply > $14.8B (up $4.42B since June) Indicates available liquidity for trading 30-day trading volume $125.62B Reflects active market participation Bridge netflows $44.03B Signals cross-chain asset migration into Solana Key Takeaways On-chain inflows are strong : TVL and stablecoin supply increases point to sustained capital deployment. Trading activity is elevated : High 30-day volumes and significant perpetual trading highlight robust market depth. Investor behavior favors accumulation : Bridge netflows and deposit trends imply confidence in Solana’s ecosystem. Conclusion Solana’s current market outlook is constructive: rising TVL, a surge in stablecoin supply and record trading volumes together indicate stronger network usage and investor accumulation. Market participants should monitor on-chain metrics and derivative flows for confirmation, while staying mindful of overall market risk.

New Era Is Upon Us,https://timestabloid.com/biggest-xrp-news-in-last-few-years-new-era-is-upon-us/,"The XRP community is reacting to a major announcement that signals a significant change in leadership at Ripple. David Schwartz, the company’s long-serving Chief Technology Officer, has confirmed that he will step down from his role at the end of the year . After more than a decade of shaping the technical foundation of the XRP Ledger , Schwartz will no longer be responsible for the day-to-day tasks of the position. Mason Versluis Highlights the Shift Crypto enthusiast Mason Versluis addressed the development in a post accompanied by a video, presenting it as one of the most important updates surrounding XRP in recent years. In his remarks, Versluis underscored Schwartz’s influence as the creator and primary architect of the XRP Ledger. Biggest $XRP news in the last few years?! New era is upon us! pic.twitter.com/IxxNe4bwWl — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) October 1, 2025 He explained that the decision marks the end of a 13-year tenure but stressed that Schwartz made it clear he is not leaving the XRP community altogether. Instead, he indicated that he is exploring different ways to remain engaged, suggesting an ongoing relationship with the ecosystem. Versluis described the transition as evidence that XRP is entering a new era. He argued that the departure does not necessarily represent a setback for holders, unless Schwartz were to take his expertise to competing blockchain networks such as Algorand or Hedera. In that scenario, Versluis noted, XRP would face more direct competition from projects benefiting from Schwartz’s technical contributions. Nonetheless, his overall stance emphasized continuity and long-term commitment, reaffirming his personal decision to remain invested after holding XRP for seven years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses to the Announcement The news prompted commentary from within the XRP community, including users who noted that Schwartz will still hold a position on Ripple’s board. One observer pointed out that this typically involves a non-disclosure agreement, ensuring that sensitive information remains within the company. This detail added another dimension to the announcement, suggesting that Schwartz’s influence and oversight will not disappear even as he steps back from daily operations. The combination of a formal departure from the CTO role with the retention of a board position highlights a balance between transition and continuity. While some may interpret the move as a signal of change, others view it as a natural progression for someone who has been in a key leadership position for decades. Schwartz’s long history in cryptography, including consulting for government agencies and observing the early stages of Bitcoin, reinforces the perception that his expertise will remain valuable in whatever capacity he chooses to engage. For many, this represents a chance for new leadership to emerge while maintaining a degree of stability through Schwartz’s continued involvement.

ETF inflows: $58B total, $23B this year, $20B expected before year-end Standard Chartered cites institutional demand, adoption pace, and market sentiment as primary catalysts. Bitcoin recently cleared $120,000 and historical Q4 performance supports upside seasonality. Bitcoin price prediction: Standard Chartered sees a new all-time high soon—learn why institutional ETF flows and adoption may push BTC higher. Read the latest outlook. What is Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin price prediction? Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin price prediction is that Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the near term and close 2025 around $200,000. The bank’s outlook is based on institutional spot ETF inflows, adoption trends, and persistent bullish sentiment despite macro uncertainty. How does institutional ETF money support the Bitcoin rally? Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted roughly $58 billion in total inflows, with $23 billion arriving this year alone. Standard Chartered expects an additional $20 billion before year-end, which would increase demand and reduce available supply, providing upward pressure on price. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Set to Break Records Next Week, Predicts Standard Chartered"", ""description"": ""Standard Chartered forecasts Bitcoin could hit $135,000 soon and potentially $200,000 by year-end, citing strong spot ETF inflows and adoption."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-set-to-break-records-next-week"" }} Why does Standard Chartered expect a new all-time high? Standard Chartered points to three primary drivers: sustained institutional demand via spot ETFs, accelerating adoption, and favorable seasonality for Q4. Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research, notes the market is “primed for another surge” as ETFs funnel capital into Bitcoin. When have ETF inflows historically impacted price? Historically, major inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs correlate with periods of price strength because ETFs provide an on-ramp for institutional capital. With $58 billion in cumulative ETF inflows to date, the scale of demand is materially larger than several prior cycles. Frequently Asked Questions How likely is Bitcoin to reach $135,000 next week? Standard Chartered models suggest a near-term push toward $135,000 driven by fresh ETF allocations and sentiment. While probability cannot be guaranteed, the bank cites measurable ETF inflows and market structure as the basis for the projection. Will Bitcoin reach $200,000 by the end of 2025? Standard Chartered maintains a $200,000 year-end scenario based on continued institutional adoption and additional ETF inflows. This is a forecast, not a certainty, and depends on sustained demand and macro conditions. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is Standard Chartered's Bitcoin price prediction?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the near term and has reiterated a $200,000 year-end target, citing strong spot ETF inflows and adoption as key drivers."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much have spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in so far?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $58 billion in cumulative inflows, with approximately $23 billion arriving this year and an additional $20 billion expected before year-end."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin price predictions from institutional reports"", ""description"": ""A short guide to reading institutional Bitcoin forecasts and the key signals to watch."", ""totalTime"": ""PT5M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check the institutional thesis"", ""text"": ""Identify whether the forecast is driven by demand-side factors such as ETF inflows, adoption, or supply dynamics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify cited data"", ""text"": ""Confirm figures like ETF inflows, custody flows, or on-chain metrics when available as quantitative support for forecasts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess market context"", ""text"": ""Consider macro risk, liquidity conditions, and seasonality which can amplify or mute forecast outcomes."" } ]} Key Takeaways Institutional flows matter : Spot ETFs have driven $58B in cumulative inflows, underpinning price support.

Seasonality and sentiment : Historical Q4 performance and renewed bullish sentiment are supportive but not guarantees. Conclusion Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin price prediction frames a constructive outlook built on substantial spot ETF inflows and adoption momentum. While forecasts of $135,000 and $200,000 by year-end reflect a bullish scenario, investors should weigh model assumptions and market risks.

BlackRock’s interest in the company grew after a report from reliable sources revealed that Aligned Data Centres successfully raised $12 billion. Notably, this is more than what several leading AI startups have gathered in a single funding round. This fundraising aimed to significantly expand the company’s footprint amid growing demand for facilities that support AI systems. This deal could become one of the largest transactions of the year and possibly the largest ever for any data centre firm. The The BlackRock-owned company is also in advanced-stage talks to buy utility firm AES in a deal that could be valued at over $40 billion. BlackRock to strike a deal with Aligned Data Centres in the AI boom era Sources familiar with the situation have noted that BlackRock’s acquisition plans highlight the eagerness of investors to make substantial investments in firms considered crucial for the AI surge. To support this claim, AI-related businesses have already generated $141 billion in corporate credit this year, exceeding a total debt of $127 billion encountered last year, according to Goldman Sachs’s report dated Thursday, October 2. Meanwhile, as tech companies uphold their commitment to invest hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in physical infrastructure for AI, there is an escalating need for firms like Aligned that can fulfil these demands. This remains a fact even though Aligned is still planning for most of its data centre capacity and setting targets for the income it will generate. Ari Klein, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, weighed in on the matter, noting that Aligned has “several activities planned.” He added that companies are prepared to invest further in these initiatives and the opportunities they may create. Founded in 2013, roughly ten years before the era of generative AI, Aligned has always prioritised the establishment of custom data centres for businesses, focusing on efficiency and sustainability. The company’s website revealed that it receives a strong support system from Macquarie Asset Management and manages or is creating 78 data centres across the Americas. Aligned intends to build bigger and more numerous data centres Like other data centre providers, Aligned has encountered new pressure to build numerous data centres over the past years as AI becomes increasingly adopted. In January, Aligned said it had raised $12 billion in equity and debt financing to expedite its efforts to construct 5 gigawatts of data centre capacity — enough power to run half New York City on a hot day. In a social media post at the time, Andrew Schaap, CEO of Aligned Data Centres, mentioned that this investment aimed to help the company capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-ready infrastructure. “Aligned is ready to seize this opportunity,” he said. However, the main challenge is that building data centres of the required infrastructure takes time, including power supplies. Today, Aligned has more than 600 megawatts of operational data centre capacity, and another 700 megawatts under construction, according to the firm DC Byte, which tracks the market. Despite this, DC Byte founder Edward Galvin noted that Aligned still operates on a decent-sized scale.

52642713,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827096,1759554900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52642713.jpeg,Solana Price Prediction: Why Analysts Believe BNB And LBRETT Are Set To Outshine SOL,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-analysts-believe-bnb-and-lbrett-are-set-to-outshine-sol/,"The crypto market is buzzing again and a fresh Solana price prediction has traders debating whether SOL can hold its ground or if other projects will surge past it. While Solana’s speed and developer activity remain impressive, analysts argue its dominance may be challenged by both BNB and Layer Brett (LBRETT) — a meme-fuelled Ethereum Layer 2 that has already raised over $4.2 million at just $0.0058 per token . For many retail investors, LBRETT represents the type of low-entry, high-reward play that once made early SOL backers millions. Solana price prediction split At the time of writing, SOL trades around $180 after a period of volatility. Some bullish projections suggest the token could test the $220 mark in Q4, driven by strong NFT volumes and institutional adoption. Still, every Solana price prediction comes with caveats — network congestion, outages and stiff competition could keep SOL capped, with some traders even suggesting a retrace toward $150 if momentum fades. Others remain convinced that the network’s transaction speed and developer base could push it toward new highs in 2025. SOL has always attracted speculative capital but the market is no longer just about speed. Investors want scalability, real-world use cases and liquidity. If Solana can’t address its historic downtime issues, its rivals could draw away significant portions of retail and institutional flows. Why BNB remains relevant Despite regulatory hurdles, Binance Coin (BNB) has been notably resilient. BNB has held above the $500 zone in recent weeks, and multiple BNB price trackers now point to the $600 level as a key resistance. Binance’s global exchange presence, ecosystem expansion and token burns continue to support demand. For some holders, the combination of utility and scarcity means BNB still has a strong case as one of the leading altcoins for the next rally. The fact that it’s the backbone of the Binance Smart Chain also ensures constant demand for BNB, keeping it relevant no matter how the broader market shifts. The rise of Layer Brett (LBRETT) While SOL and BNB are household names, newer entrants like Layer Brett are stealing attention. The project has raised more than $4.2 million in presale funding and offers staking rewards of around 616% APY at the time of writing — though these will decline as more wallets join. Its roadmap includes gamified staking, NFT rollouts, cross-chain bridging and a $1 million giveaway, setting it apart from many meme-driven tokens that lack utility. Accessibility has also helped LBRETT gain traction. Investors can connect a wallet and buy using ETH or USDT in minutes, making it easy for first-timers to get involved. Social media traction is another driver: Telegram communities are buzzing, X threads about Layer Brett are going viral and TikTok mentions are climbing fast. Some traders have even described it as the “escape from Base,” referencing how it upgrades the Brett meme into a full-featured Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. For many, this mix of meme energy and tangible utility is why analysts now believe LBRETT could deliver outsized returns compared to both SOL and BNB. The takeaway A bullish Solana price prediction sees SOL retesting its highs, while BNB remains a steady blue-chip pick. But for those chasing true multiples, Layer Brett may offer the most exciting path forward. With its presale still live at $0.0058, millions raised already and staking above 600% APY, it’s positioned as one of the most compelling altcoin opportunities heading into 2025. Don’t miss out — bag your LBRETT tokens today before the presale ends.

XRP holds $1.93 support while consolidating near the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $3.25. Oscillators reading 70–75 show sustained momentum but allow short-term pullbacks. Recurring accumulation–consolidation–breakout cycles place $6.26 and $21.71 as sequential technical targets. XRP price prediction: consolidation at 1.272 Fibonacci $3.25 with $6.26 next — read key levels and action items now. XRP consolidates above key Fibonacci support as analysts note recurring cycle patterns targeting $6 to $21. XRP holds $1.93 support while consolidating near the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $3.25 ahead of major resistance. Oscillator readings near 70–75 indicate strong momentum, resembling levels seen before previous cycle peaks. XRP’s recurring accumulation, consolidation, breakout pattern suggests $6.26 as the next technical checkpoint. XRP is trading in a decisive consolidation range following a breakout above long-term resistance, with analyst MikyBull Crypto outlining targets between $6 and $21. That view is derived from a Fibonacci expansion setup plus a recurring multi-cycle structure that historically precedes large uptrends. What is the current XRP consolidation above Fibonacci telling traders? The XRP consolidation above the 1.272 Fibonacci extension near $3.25 signals that prior resistance around $1.93 has flipped to support, providing a base for the next technical move. This setup often precedes measured extensions to the 1.618 ($6.26) and 2.272 ($21.71) levels. How reliable are the Fibonacci extensions for XRP targets? Fibonacci extensions are a common technical tool used to estimate target zones after a breakout. For XRP, the 1.0 level acted as resistance near $1.938 and has become support. The 1.272 extension around $3.25 is the current consolidation plane; 1.618 and 2.272 provide sequential targets. Why does momentum matter for XRP’s next leg up? Momentum gauges whether the market has the strength to reach those Fibonacci targets. Oscillator readings between 70–75 imply sustained buying pressure similar to pre-peak conditions in prior cycles, though values above 80 historically accompanied cycle tops in 2017 and 2024. How should traders interpret oscillator readings now? Readings near 70–75 typically indicate active momentum with room to run. Traders should expect periodic cooling—short pullbacks inside an uptrend—while monitoring support at $1.93 and the 50-day SMA for structural health. Source: Steph is Crypto on X The multi-cycle pattern that appeared in 2014, 2020 and 2024 — accumulation, consolidation, breakout — is visible again. Price is stabilizing above the 50-day simple moving average in the $2.60–$3.20 band, a common pivot used historically to time expansions. When could XRP reach the 1.618 extension near $6.26? Timing depends on momentum persistence and macro catalysts. If current momentum continues into late 2025 or early 2026, the 1.618 extension at $6.26 is a plausible near-term checkpoint before any larger Fibonacci expansions play out. What risk management should traders use around these levels? Use defined stop levels under $1.93 support and consider scaled position sizing ahead of the 1.618 resistance. Monitor oscillators for extreme readings and watch the 50-SMA for structural confirmation to avoid being caught by short-term pullbacks. Frequently Asked Questions What is the short-term XRP price target based on this setup? The short-term technical target is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension near $6.26, assuming momentum holds and support at $1.93 remains intact. How do cycle patterns influence XRP forecasts? Recurring accumulation–consolidation–breakout cycles historically led to large moves. With XRP following the same sequence, analysts view current consolidation as a preparatory phase for further expansion. Key Takeaways Support and structure : $1.93 acts as key support after reclaiming the 1.0 Fibonacci extension. Momentum : Oscillators around 70–75 show strength but allow short pullbacks inside the uptrend. Targets : 1.618 at $6.26 is the next technical checkpoint; longer-term Fibonacci points toward $21.71. Conclusion Overall, the XRP price prediction based on Fibonacci alignment and recurring cycle structure points to $6.26 as the immediate technical checkpoint, with longer-term expansions toward $21.71 possible if momentum persists. Traders should monitor $1.93 support, the 50-SMA and oscillator readings for confirmation and manage risk accordingly.

This happened as the SEC announced that:- “Effective October 1 and until further notice, the agency will have a very limited number of staff members available. The SEC has staff available to respond to emergency situations with a focus on the market integrity and investor protection components of our mission.” That notice meant that ETF filings would move forward or stall depending on the law, not on active review. Crypto strategist Chad Steingraber captured the point clearly when he posted :- “The Teucrium XRP ETF was not approved by the SEC directly. They reached the deadline and the SEC didn’t ‘approve or deny’ the listing. So it was automatically allowed. ‘Silence is compliance.’” SEC leaves futures-style ETFs running while shutdown freezes spot crypto funds Financial journalist Eleanor Terrett explained why this happened. Teucrium’s product holds Treasuries, cash, and swap receivables and was filed under the 40 Act, which means the SEC didn’t need to approve it actively. Eleanor added that the Commission typically lets futures-style ETFs go effective after the statutory waiting period passes. By contrast, spot crypto ETFs are filed under the 33 Act as commodity trusts and need explicit approval before trading, which will not happen until the shutdown ends and the agency returns to full capacity. That breakdown shows the dividing line. Futures-style ETFs can run on autopilot after the statutory time limit, but spot products like XRP under the 33 Act can’t trade until SEC staff review and declare the registration effective. Because the agency is on limited operations, those S‑1s are not being processed. Meanwhile, the SEC’s own notice said all non-excepted employees are subject to furlough, official travel is canceled or postponed, training during the appropriations lapse must be canceled or postponed, and paid leave is voided. Any employee excepted must report for duty, but if they are sick their status would be furloughed. The agency emphasized that employees who have not been designated as excepted may not volunteer to work without pay, saying that such voluntary services “are a violation of the Antideficiency Act and will not be permitted under any circumstances.” Crypto issuers file dozens of ETFs while SEC stays frozen Despite the freeze, filings keep piling up. More than 30 crypto ETF applications hit the SEC this week. REX-Osprey filed prospectuses for 21 crypto funds on October 3, and Defiance lodged six more the same day. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart posted about the filings on X, saying that REX-Osprey’s lineup covers single-asset strategies tied to AAVE, ADA, ATOM, and ENA, some with staking features. Defiance’s submissions included six leveraged funds. Three were long on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and three offered short exposure. All six aim for 3x leverage. Seyffart commented that “3x isn’t really allowed by the new leveraged ETP rules,” saying the issuer appears to be “targeting” 3x through options to get around the standard 2x cap. This is all coming after the SEC approved generic listing standards for crypto-related exchange-traded products on September 17 across Cboe, Nasdaq, and NYSE Arca, as Cryptopolitan reported . Those rules were meant to speed up spot crypto listings by removing 19b‑4 approvals and moving the bottleneck to the S‑1 filings. Fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on September 29 that altcoin ETF approvals are “really 100% now,” because the old 19b‑4 “clock” is moot and S‑1s just need Corp Fin’s green light. But now, as Eric put it, “everything is on ice… it’s like a rain delay,” and issuers must wait until the agency reopens.

Many analysts believe LILPEPE could deliver up to 8000% gains for early buyers if all goes well after its exchange launch. Solana (SOL) Shows Steady Strength Solana has become one of the top networks for building decentralised apps. As of writing, SOL trades at $195. The price has pulled back slightly in recent weeks, but analysts say that has helped reset momentum indicators like the RSI, leaving room for a fresh rally. Developers continue to launch new DeFi and gaming projects on Solana. The announcement that CME Group plans to offer Solana futures in 2025 has also excited traders, as it could bring more institutional money into SOL. Analysts believe SOL could move into the $300 to $350 range next year if market conditions improve and demand for Solana’s network keeps growing. Dogecoin (DOGE) Holds Its Meme Crown As of writing, Dogecoin is priced at $0.22. After months of consolidation, its technical charts show that momentum could return. Large holders have been steadily adding DOGE to their wallets, a pattern that often comes before upward moves. Speculation about a potential Dogecoin ETF and its inclusion in some institutional products has given DOGE a more serious investment angle than in previous years. If buying pressure increases and market sentiment improves, analysts see room for DOGE to reach between $0.35 and $0.40, with some more bullish forecasts pushing closer to $0.50. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Leads with Fresh Momentum The most talked-about newcomer is Little Pepe, a project that mixes meme culture with real blockchain infrastructure. Instead of launching as just another meme token, LILPEPE is building a Layer 2 network that enables faster and cheaper trading of meme tokens. It is also sniper-bot-resistant, which means early investors are protected from whales grabbing the supply at launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is in stage 13 of its presale, priced at $0.0022. The presale has raised over $26 million and is already 93% sold out. Early investors from stage 1 have seen about 120% gains before the token has even launched. The presale price will rise again in the next stage as demand keeps growing. Community incentives have been a major driver of growth. The project is running a 777k giveaway with more than 406,000 entries. Additionally, the Mega Giveaway, which runs through stages 12 to 17, has attracted over 72,000 participants. These campaigns have created buzz and strengthened the community ahead of its upcoming CEX listings. Because LILPEPE will launch with a near-zero market cap, every dollar of new buying pressure could outsize its price. That is a big advantage over older coins like SOL and DOGE, which already have large market caps. Bullish Projection for 2025 If the presale momentum continues at its current listings and the community continues to expand, analysts believe LILPEPE could rise as high as 8,000% from its current presale price. An 8000% increase would increase the price to $0.18 from $0.0022. At the current price, roughly 45,454 tokens would be purchased with a $100 investment. That $100 would be worth $8,100 if the token hit $0.18. Conclusion: How to Buy LILPEPE Among the three cryptos, Solana and Dogecoin remain strong, established names, but Little Pepe offers the kind of high-upside story that appeals to early adopters. With the presale price already up 120% and analysts eyeing an 8000% gain potential, it is capturing attention as the one to watch in 2025. To Buy LILPEPE Before The Presale Ends: Visit the Little Pepe website . Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask. Ensure you have ETH or USDT available in the wallet. Choose how many LILPEPE tokens you want to buy. Confirm the transaction on the presale page. After the presale concludes and the token lists on exchanges are complete, claim your tokens through the website. With a starting price of $0.0022 and a potential move to $0.18 if it reaches the 8000% target, early buyers have a clear opportunity to position themselves before the presale concludes.

Cycle defined by emotion and halving events Institutional flows may reduce—but not eliminate—cyclical swings Analysts cite October as a possible 2025 peak if historical patterns repeat Bitcoin four-year cycle: understand halving-driven patterns and what institutional adoption means for price action — read expert takeaways and timing insights. Gemini APAC head Saad Ahmed says Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is rooted in human emotion and may persist, even as institutions reshape volatility and peak dynamics. What is the Bitcoin four-year cycle? Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to recurrent market phases linked to the halving schedule and investor sentiment, producing bull and bear periods roughly every four years. The pattern mixes supply-side shocks from halvings with waves of retail optimism and correction, creating observable peaks and troughs. A senior crypto executive argued the cycle is driven less by deterministic timing and more by recurring human behavior. Saad Ahmed, Gemini’s head of APAC, told Cointelegraph at Token2049 that excitement, overextension and subsequent corrections form the core mechanism behind the pattern. Saad Ahmed spoke to Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Singapore. Source: Cointelegraph How could institutional involvement change the Bitcoin cycle? Institutional participation tends to add liquidity and longer-term capital, which can reduce short-term volatility. Ahmed said growing institutional involvement can “help the market absorb some of the volatility,” meaning cycles may become smoother though cycles themselves may persist. Data points referenced by market analysts support this: crypto analytics firm Glassnode noted recent price action may still track the historical halving cycle, while other observers argue institutional flows are changing amplitude rather than eliminating cyclical structure. When might the next Bitcoin cycle peak occur? Some analysts point to October as a probable peak month if 2024–2025 price action mirrors past cycles. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital estimated a potential October peak approximately 550 days after the April 2024 halving. Short-term performance supports momentum: BTC rose significantly over recent weeks, with market trackers reporting gains near all-time highs. Historical seasonality also matters: Q4 has been Bitcoin’s strongest quarter since 2013 on average, which can amplify late-year rallies. Frequently Asked Questions Does the four-year cycle always repeat? No. The four-year cycle is a recurring historical pattern influenced by halving events and investor psychology, but timing and magnitude can vary due to macro, regulatory, and institutional factors. What drives the largest swings in the cycle? Major drivers include the halving-induced reduction in miner-issued supply, waves of retail sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and the pace of institutional adoption—each affecting liquidity and price discovery. How should investors interpret cycle signals? Use a mix of on-chain metrics, macro context, and risk management. Look for divergences in supply metrics and broker-inflow trends, and avoid assuming exact repeat timing of past cycles. Key Takeaways Cycle persistence : Patterns likely continue in some form, driven by emotion and halving mechanics. Institutional impact : Greater institutional involvement can dampen volatility but not fully erase cycles. Timing signals : Analysts cite October as a potential peak window; historical seasonality favors Q4 strength. Conclusion Bitcoin’s four-year cycle remains a useful framework for understanding broad market rhythm. While institutional flows and evolving market structure may smooth extremes, experts including Saad Ahmed believe the human-driven dynamics that create cycles will persist. Monitor on-chain data and institutional activity to gauge how the cycle may unfold in the coming months. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-four-year-cycle-expert-opinion"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-four-year-cycle-expert-opinion"" }, ""headline"": ""Crypto Executive: Bitcoin Four-Year Cycle Likely to Persist as Institutions Reduce Volatility"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199adab-46aa-7aaa-bee6-e86910f4f4b0.jpeg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Gemini APAC head Saad Ahmed says Bitcoin's four-year cycle is rooted in human emotion and may persist, even as institutions reshape volatility and peak dynamics."" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does the four-year cycle always repeat?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The four-year cycle is a recurring pattern influenced by halvings and investor emotion, but timing and magnitude vary with macro and institutional factors."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How could institutional involvement change the Bitcoin cycle?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutional flows add liquidity and longer-term capital, which can reduce short-term volatility and alter cycle amplitude while leaving cyclical mechanics intact."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When might the next cycle peak occur?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Some analysts estimate an October peak if historical patterns repeat; market seasonality and on-chain metrics should be monitored for confirmation."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin cycle signals"", ""description"": ""A brief guide to reading cycle indicators using on-chain data, market sentiment, and institutional flows."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check halving schedule"", ""text"": ""Note the most recent halving date and expected supply impact, since halvings historically precede bull phases."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Observe supply held by long-term holders, exchange balances, and realized price metrics for divergence signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess institutional activity"", ""text"": ""Track inflows to institutional products and custody adoption as indicators of reduced short-term volatility."" } ] } ]}",Bitcoin|Guides|News|BTC|Core,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-04 05:35:54

Based on Ethereum’s current prices, the sale comes to roughly $4.51 million. The EF added that the 1,000 ETH sale will occur via CoWSwap, utilizing a TWAP strategy to minimise market disturbance and support its DeFi-centric mission. The platform announced on X, “The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via CoWSwap’s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi.” The Ethereum Foundation had planned a sale of 10000 ETH in September The EF’s announcement did not specify which stablecoins it would receive in the swap. The move also appears separate from the foundation’s earlier plan to convert 10,000 ETH into stablecoins, since Friday’s $4.5M sale was smaller and will be carried out via CoW Swap rather than a centralized exchange. The foundation has maintained that its treasury policy seeks a middle ground between earning yields above standard benchmarks and serving as a responsible steward of Ethereum, with an emphasis on DeFi. With the new planned sale, the foundation aims to establish consistent funding for research, grants, and contributions. It also seeks to protect its budget against the instability of crypto by converting ETH into assets based on fiat. The stablecoin move comes at a time when the EF redirected attention to internal changes—pausing grant submissions to the Ecosystem Support Program to handle demand, appointing two co-executive directors, Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak, in April, and restructuring staff and dev teams in June. Currently, EF’s operating costs are set at 15% of its treasury each year, with a runway of two and a half years. EF intends to gradually scale down its expenses to about 5% of the treasury According to industry figures, Ethereum currently holds 68% of DeFi’s locked-up value and remains the top player, although it faces challenges from its rivals. Ethereum DeFi’s total value locked had also surpassed $100 billion by the end of September, delivering its highest daily measurement since early 2022. Now, building on that dominance, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has emphasized the importance of DeFi as a focus for Ethereum, stating that “low-risk” applications could generate predictable income in much the same way Google Search generates revenue for Google. “Low-risk DeFi can and should play a similar role for Ethereum,” he said, noting that in the future, this could help to mitigate arguments within Ethereum over whether or not revenue-generating apps can be true to the project’s vision. Over the next five years, EF also plans to gradually reduce spending before stabilising it at around 5% of the treasury, in line with endowment-style models, which will provide stability and independence. The transition is meant to provide greater financial predictability while preserving Ethereum’s independence. Some observers view EF’s recent ETH sales as further evidence of the ecosystem’s increasing fiscal prudence. Buterin still believes that Ethereum could surpass Google by combining decentralization with ethical finance, allowing DeFi to balance profit and principles. He commented, “The revenue generator does not have to be the most revolutionary or exciting application of Ethereum. But it does need to be something that is at least not actively unethical or not embarrassing.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Prices decline, sentiment hits bottom, and opportunities seem to disappear. But the history of highs and lows shows that the best crypto gains aren’t during the euphoric giddy-ups, but during the silent times when most have given up. The trick is learning to adjust strategies, preserve capital, and still identify growing opportunities when the market sentiment is down. Even though the recent months have been challenging for traders, there is still hope that one can accumulate wealth in the meantime, with upcoming projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE perhaps being an example of this. While there are no guarantees in the crypto market, here are three well-proven strategies to make investors profitable even during red markets. 1. Diversify Smartly Without Overstretching Diversification is a common investing strategy, but it must be approached carefully in the context of crypto. Too many investors spread their portfolios across dozens of tokens, then find themselves with exposure to coins that lose liquidity in bear markets and disappear altogether. Instead, one should be looking for a few good projects with sound fundamentals. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to act as stable anchors due to their long-term compounding and deep liquidity. Initially, it might be advisable to have a few altcoins with established ecosystems, like Cardano or Solana, for a balanced portfolio without excessive risk. The idea isn’t to chase every pump, but to ride assets that won’t die and will do well at the start of any new cycle. At the same time, leaving space for carefully selected new ventures is where some of the life-altering returns are found. This is where presales and early-stage tokens can create asymmetric opportunities when big players just can’t. 2. Focus on Fundamentals, Not Noise In a bear market, substance outweighs speculation. Tokens that spiked on hype always seem to pop, while technologies that have real utility continue to grow in the background. For investors, this is the time to sort long-term winners from short-term distractions. Look for tokens that provide solutions (scalability, DeFi, interoperability, new models of adoption). By studying developer activity, community development, and partnerships, one can often determine which projects are on the brink of the next expansion. In crypto, the riches go to those who learn when everyone is gripped by fear. A good illustration of this strategy paying off is Ethereum. Some investors bought Ethereum secretly in 2019 when it was trading at less than $200, well before the DeFi craze brought it to new highs. Those opportunities exist today if one can dig some depth beneath the surface. 3. Allocate to Early-Stage Winners Like MAGACOIN FINANCE While major cryptocurrency coins offer stability, presale opportunities offer the upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has smashed all early-stage fundraising records by raising $15.5 million-which has raised eyebrows amongst retail investors and analysts alike. This accounts for it selling out so fast, as well as the hype surrounding being only available in small quantities pre-sale. Considered by many to be one of the most promising new altcoins on the market, some analysts are predicting anywhere from 55x returns once the token starts trading on major exchanges. As opposed to existing coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, that are already at multi-billion-dollar market caps, MAGACOIN FINANCE has significantly more potential it has to grow from its starting point. This isn’t to say investors should go all in on a speculative token. But even a tiny percentage of a portfolio invested in ambitious ventures similar to MAGACOIN FINANCE can help get insight into lower returns and minimum exposure, especially in a bear market, when the prices of conventional assets are low. It’s all about dividing riskier, longer-term retirement and financial holdings with the riskier but more rewarding types of investments. Learning to Thrive in Bear Markets There is no doubt that bear markets are where the disciplined investor is rewarded. They weaken the mainstream, fail to spin off their own sustainable projects, opening the door for the next wave of adoption. For those who haven’t given up, they also present some of the best entry points in crypto. By balancing exposure to established assets with a carefully selected mix of early-stage gold, focusing on fundamentals rather than hype, and understanding the unique power behind presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can not only weather a downturn but prosper in it. Conclusion Bear markets challenge investors, but they’ll also pay off patient investors who have a clear strategy. At the core are the well-established coins Bitcoin and Ethereum, while emerging technologies such as Cardano and Solana provide growth opportunities in the ever-evolving space of blockchain solutions. Beyond that, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has so far raised a staggering $15.5 million from investors, have demonstrated that there is still potential for massive upside in even comparably adverse environments. Surviving a bear market while being profitable doesn’t come with luck-it necessitates smart positioning, patience, and an ability to navigate to where the real opportunities are found.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Exchange Inflows Have Shot Up In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the deposits being made by Bitcoin short-term holders to centralized exchanges. The “short-term holders” (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The STHs make up for one of the two main divisions of the network done on the basis of holding time, with the other side being known as the “long-term holders” (LTHs). Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Big Breakout Incoming? Analyst Calls To “Stay Alert” Historically, the former cohort has proven to include the weak hands of the market who panic sell whenever volatility emerges in the asset, while the latter is made up of the blockchain’s diamond hands. Bitcoin has witnessed a sharp rally over the past week that has taken it past the $122,000 level. Considering the nature of the STHs, it would be expected that they would be looking to take some profits. For LTHs, tracking selling can be simple because as soon as a member of the cohort breaks their dormancy, their coins exit the cohort and enter the STHs, as their age counter resets back to zero. It’s not quite as easy in the case of the STHs, however, as the group’s coins are constantly in motion within its members. One way to gauge STH selling is through their transactions to exchanges. Generally, one of the main reasons why investors use these centralized platforms is for trading-related purposes, so deposits to them can be an indication that there is demand for selling the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the exchange inflows coming from the Bitcoin STHs. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin STH deposits to exchanges have shot up alongside the latest price rally. The inflows that have spiked have specifically been the profit ones, with there being no loss deposits at all. Thus, it seems the buyers who got in during the price all-time high (ATH) are choosing to hold through this run. In total, the STHs have transferred 46,276 BTC over a 24-hour span during the latest run. At the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to a whopping $5.7 billion. The analyst notes that this is one of the largest spikes that the indicator has seen recently.

52643960,597403,1759557645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52643960.jpeg,SEC Silence Stalls Litecoin ETF Decision as LTC Price Holds Near Monthly Highs,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-silence-litecoin-etf-decision-ltc-price-holds/,"Litecoin (LTC) remains steady near its monthly highs despite new regulatory setbacks, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) failed to act on Canary Capital’s proposed spot Litecoin STF. The deadline passed on Thursday without any update, leaving the much-anticipated product in limbo. The delay occurs at a crucial time for crypto ETFs, coinciding with a U.S. government shutdown that has hampered financial oversight and added to the complexity of the approval process. SEC Misses Deadline as Litecoin ETF Rules Shift The SEC was expected to decide on Canary’s application by Thursday, but no update was issued. Analysts observe that the delay may be due not only to the shutdown but also to a broader shift in how crypto ETFs are managed. Earlier this year, the SEC began phasing out the traditional 19b-4 filing process, which has been historically associated with strict deadlines, in favour of S-1 registration statements. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas argue this transition means old deadlines “no longer matter” under the regulator’s evolving framework. Instead, approval timelines may now depend on the SEC’s broader review of new listing standards, making the process less predictable. Shutdown Complicates ETF Reviews The U.S. government shutdown is intensifying the delays. Although the SEC continues with limited operations, its contingency plan, published in August, confirmed that reviewing new financial products, including ETF filings, would be paused during a shutdown. This has left Canary’s Litecoin ETF, along with several other altcoin-based products, in a holding pattern. Pending applications for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, and Dogecoin ETFs are among those affected. These would build on the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have already attracted more than $74 billion in inflows. However, Litecoin faces additional scrutiny, as its regulatory classification remains less clear than Bitcoin’s status as a commodity. Litecoin Price Remains Resilient Despite the regulatory uncertainty, Litecoin’s price has stayed resilient. At the time of writing, LTC was trading around $118, approaching a two-month high of $122. Analysts suggest that if the token can surpass resistance near $121, a new rally might be triggered. The consistent upward trend indicates investor confidence that approval is more a matter of timing rather than rejection. Market observers describe the SEC’s silence as more of a “rain delay” than a denial. Once the shutdown concludes and new listing standards are fully implemented, analysts expect the ETF decision process to speed up.

According to the chart, XRP is now in the “take-profit zone,” a range where previous cycles delivered significant returns for investors. Steph’s observation reflects how the asset has reached a historically significant stage within the cycle. XRP has shown strength against Bitcoin this year, and the current shift from Bitcoin season to Altcoin season on the chart positions XRP firmly within another bullish phase. The Take-Profit Zone The marked “take-profit zone” on the chart suggests an environment where XRP holders may consider securing gains after extended accumulations. Historically, these points often represented the culmination of upward momentum within the altcoin season before corrections followed.

The combination of current favorable market conditions , XRP’s positioning, and the repeating cycle of altcoin seasons establishes a moment of heightened interest. In July, XRP experienced a notable rally, rising to an all-time high of $3.65 in the middle of Bitcoin season. While XRP struggled to move in the past, the chart suggests that the current phase could align with outcomes seen during previous altcoin peaks, and a new surge in this season could send it to unprecedented heights.

Trading volumes for both tokens have surged as exchanges report heightened activity, and price swings on major platforms have pulled the broader market into sharper focus. XRP, backed by years of partnerships with payment networks, is pressing its case for streamlined cross-border transfers, while Zexpire promotes a model that removes intermediaries altogether. Analysts point to contrasting legal strategies, governance structures, and target user groups as catalysts for the unfolding rivalry, framing the contest as a decisive moment for how future money might move across borders. XRP’s Second Wind: Will the Speedy Digital Coin Race Past $3 Again Ripple’s native coin, XRP, powers a worldwide payment network that clears about 1,500 transfers every second and settles them in moments for only a fraction of a cent. Banks and remittance firms have embraced the system, attracted by its knack for shuttling both traditional money and other digital coins—such as Bitcoin—across borders in the blink of an eye. This swiftness stems from a streamlined approval process handled by chosen computers rather than energy-hungry mining, keeping the network both nimble and decentralized. Price action has been a roller-coaster: from fractions of a cent in 2013 to a record $3.84 in early 2018, down to below a dollar during regulatory turmoil, and back to $2.42 at the start of 2025. The recent courtroom win over the U.S. securities watchdog, capped by a $125 million fine instead of a multibillion-dollar hit, sparked a 26 percent rally and lifted spirits in the wider market. Compared with the slower yet more famous Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP trades at a discount to its own history while offering faster settlement times that appeal to banks searching for efficiency. First-Mover in Gamified Options Trading: Could ZX Be the Next HYPE? In crypto, the biggest gains often go to first movers in new categories. This cycle has already provided a valid example: HYPE, the token of Hyperliquid, rode the surge in derivatives trading and put on outsized returns for early holders. Zexpire is aiming to do the same — but in an even fresher niche. It’s the first 0DTE DeFi protocol that turns options trading into a simple, one-click daily play. One-Click Options, Fixed Risk Crypto options already see around $3 billion in daily volume, and prediction markets like Polymarket have pushed past $10 billion in cumulative bets. Zexpire combines the two, wrapping volatility trading into a format anyone can play. Zexpire removes the complexity of options trading: no more intimidating charts and Greeks. Just one question: Will BTC stay in range today, or break out? Click your choice and let the market play out. The risk is capped — you’ll never lose more than your stake. Be Among the First to Buy ZX Like HYPE for Hyperliquid, ZX is the Fuel of Zexpire Every play on Zexpire runs on its native token ZX, which is currently in seed access at just $0.003, stepping up stage by stage until it reaches $0.025 at listing. That structure means the earliest participants lock in the lowest entry point, while later buyers pay more. Beyond price, early buyers also get extras like staking yield before TGE, cashback perks, and beta access — benefits designed to reward the first wave of holders. First-Mover Advantage: Getting ZX Before It Explodes Every cycle has tokens that capture a new wave before the market catches on. HYPE did it with derivatives on Hyperliquid, turning early adoption into one of the cycle’s strongest narratives. Now $ZX is positioned to do the same for gamified options trading — a brand-new category that combines the growth of prediction markets with the simplicity of one-click plays. Early buyers secure the lowest entry point, while long-term holders stand to benefit from fee burns, buybacks, staking rewards, and platform perks that tighten supply and reward participation. Buy $ZX, the Next Breakout Token Conclusion Market watchers point to XRP as a proven tool for fast, low-cost transfers. Its long track record gives it weight in talks about the next phase of global payments. Yet attention is now shifting to Zexpire, billed as the first DeFi venue that flips volatility into gain. The contrast has set off lively debate about which model will guide the coming wave of digital finance. Zexpire lets users make a single click guess on whether Bitcoin will stay in range or break out each day. Losses are capped, with no liquidations or margin calls, turning sharp price moves into a clear earning path. Every play uses $ZX, whose fee cuts, buybacks, and fixed demand create early-buyer appeal. XRP represents a promising opportunity too, but the spotlight now rests on Zexpire’s push to turn the market’s biggest headache into its main reward.

XRP price rose 7% after large whale cohorts (100M–1B holders) added roughly 300 million XRP inside the $2.80–$2.82 band, creating a dense supply cluster. On-chain accumulation at that band triggered a short-lived supply squeeze that pushed price toward near-term resistance at $3.50–$3.60. How strong is the $2.80 support band? On-chain heatmaps show nearly 2 billion XRP concentrated in the $2.80–$2.82 range, making this the densest cost-basis zone. That concentration acts as a structural support level and a logical dip-buy region for institutional and retail HODLers. Data source mentions: Santiment (on-chain heatmaps), TradingView (price levels). Table: Q3 ROI comparison (top altcoins) Asset Q3 ROI XRP 27% DOGE 41% ETH Data shows larger swings; key support tested Why are whales stacking XRP now? Whales appear to be positioning ahead of potential Q4 momentum. Strategic accumulation at $2.80 reduces average cost and increases the probability of a supply-controlled breakout. On-chain signals show the biggest cohort’s holdings rose to ~9.48 billion XRP after the October buys, indicating conviction among smart-money participants. What resistance levels matter next? Key resistance sits at $3.50–$3.60. A clean break above that band, confirmed on higher timeframes, would validate the bullish setup and likely attract momentum traders. If price fails there, consolidation between $2.80 and $3.50 is the most probable near-term outcome. Source: Santiment Meanwhile, XRP’s price action on daily charts demonstrates repeated validation of $2.80 as support, which historically preceded breakout runs in risk-on markets. September’s volatility left XRP with the lowest Q3 ROI among top altcoins (27%), but large-cohort accumulation suggests participants are positioning for a potential comeback. Source: TradingView (XRP/USDT) Frequently Asked Questions Is the XRP rally driven by retail or whales? On-chain cohort data points to whale-led accumulation in the 100M–1B cohort, which added ~300M XRP at $2.80–$2.82. This smart-money move created a dense support band that likely amplified the 7% rally. When will XRP retest resistance at $3.50? Short-term price action suggests the $3.50–$3.60 band is the next major test. If buying volume sustains above $3.50 on daily closes, the market is more likely to pursue higher targets in Q4. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why is XRP up today?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""XRP rose after whale cohorts added ~300 million XRP at $2.80–$2.82, creating dense support and triggering a short-term supply squeeze that produced a 7% move toward $3.50 resistance."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the key support level for XRP?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""$2.80–$2.82 is the densest cost-basis band on-chain and currently serves as the primary support and dip-buy zone for XRP."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to read XRP whale accumulation"", ""description"": ""Three-step process to interpret on-chain whale stacking and potential price implications for XRP."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Identify cohort buys"", ""text"": ""Check on-chain cohort data to see which whale classes increased holdings and the buy price bands."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Map supply clusters"", ""text"": ""Use cost-basis heatmaps to find dense supply bands that act as support or resistance."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Monitor breakouts"", ""text"": ""Watch for daily-close confirmation above resistance with volume to validate rally continuation."" } ]} Key Takeaways Whale accumulation : ~300M added at $2.80–$2.82, strengthening support.

Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to recurring market behavior tied to halving events that historically reduce miner issuance and often precede multi-year expansions. The pattern typically includes an accumulation phase, a sharp expansion toward a peak, and a correction — though recent cycles show greater variability. How does institutional involvement affect Bitcoin cycles? Increased institutional participation can moderate extreme swings by providing sustained demand through custody and long-term funds. Industry leaders note that while volatility will persist, institutional flows may reduce peak-to-trough amplitudes and extend the expansion phase. Saad Ahmed, head of APAC at Gemini, said cycles stem from human emotion: excitement leads to extensions and corrections. Analysts at analytics firms such as Glassnode have published data suggesting recent price action still aligns with long-term patterns. When might the current cycle peak? Some market commentators, including crypto analyst Rekt Capital, indicated a possible peak in October if the market follows a similar timeline to the 2020–2021 expansion. Historical seasonality shows Q4 has been strong for Bitcoin, with past data pointing to outsized returns in that quarter. Frequently Asked Questions Will the Bitcoin four-year cycle always predict price tops? The cycle is a heuristic, not a guaranteed predictor. It highlights recurring phases but cannot account for new macro shocks or structural market shifts; use it with on-chain and macro indicators for better context. How should investors factor cycles into strategy? Use the cycle framework for timing and risk management: scale positions during accumulation, reassess on sharp rallies, and employ stop-losses or hedges near historically late-stage expansion signs. What role do halving events play? Halving events reduce new Bitcoin supply and often precede extended bull phases by shifting supply dynamics. Historical patterns show halving-to-peak timelines can span several hundred days, but past performance is not a guarantee. Key Takeaways Cycle relevance : The Bitcoin four-year cycle remains a valuable framework for market phases. Institutional impact : Growing institutional flows may temper volatility and shift cycle timing. Watch October : Analysts cite October as a plausible peak if historical timelines repeat; monitor breadth and macro data. Conclusion The Bitcoin four-year cycle continues to offer a useful lens for market behavior, though its predictiveness can be altered by institutional participation and macro forces. Investors should combine cycle analysis with on-chain metrics, macro assessment, and risk controls — and track developments through Q4 as markets evolve.

Analysts Back This New ETH L2 Token For 160x Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-ada-in-2021-analysts-back-this-new-eth-l2-token-for-160x-gains/,"The last bull cycle minted fortunes for early ADA holders but a fresh Cardano price prediction suggests the next wave of big returns may not come from ADA itself. Instead, analysts are pointing toward a new Ethereum Layer 2 project, Layer Brett (LBRETT) , as the meme-fuelled contender with serious upside potential. With ADA trading under pressure, many investors are asking whether rotating into LBRETT could be the smarter play. ADA struggles to reclaim old highs The latest Cardano price prediction has split opinion. ADA is trading close to $0.60, a level many view as critical. Some bulls argue that strong development activity and ecosystem upgrades could lift ADA back above $0.70 in the coming months. However, bearish analysts warn that if the $0.55 support zone fails, ADA might drift into the low 40-cent range. For long-term holders, Cardano’s methodical, research-driven approach remains appealing but critics highlight its slower pace compared to rivals. In 2021, ADA surged from under $0.20 to over $3 — an incredible run. Yet repeating that feat may be harder this time around, with ADA now competing against faster, cheaper and more flexible blockchains. That’s why many Cardano price prediction reports now suggest muted returns compared to more speculative newcomers. Why ADA investors are looking elsewhere Despite ADA’s loyal community, capital tends to chase projects with momentum. Ethereum Layer 2s, Solana-based dApps and new meme coins have been grabbing headlines. ADA’s measured progress means it can sometimes look stale next to the breakneck pace of rivals. With ADA still struggling to break higher, some traders are choosing to rotate into emerging tokens where the potential upside looks far greater. Layer Brett (LBRETT) gaining traction This is where Layer Brett enters the conversation. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, LBRETT blends the viral appeal of memes with tangible utility. Its presale, priced at just $0.0058 , has already raised over $4.2 million. At the time of writing, staking rewards stand at around 616% APY — though they decline quickly as more buyers join, making early entry especially attractive. The roadmap goes far beyond memes. Planned features include NFT integrations, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging, all supported by a growing community. A teased $1 million giveaway has also added to the buzz, drawing thousands into its Telegram, TikTok and X groups. Unlike many meme tokens that lack substance, Layer Brett positions itself as a hybrid: Meme energy on the surface, but with Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure beneath it. Accessibility is another strength. Buying LBRETT only requires connecting a wallet and paying with ETH or USDT, a process designed to appeal to both first-time investors and seasoned traders. Analysts argue that this combination of low entry cost, utility and community hype is why LBRETT could be the token that rivals ADA’s early days in terms of life-changing returns. The takeaway Every Cardano price prediction highlights ADA’s resilience and long-term potential but also its slower growth profile. In contrast, Layer Brett is being pitched as the fast-moving alternative, with some analysts projecting a run from under one cent to over $1 within two years — equivalent to more than 160x gains. For investors who regret missing ADA’s run in 2021, LBRETT could be the second chance they’ve been waiting for. With staking yields still in the hundreds of percent, millions already raised and community momentum accelerating, it may be the project that defines the next wave of meme coin mania. Secure your Layer Brett allocation today — the presale won’t stay at $0.0058 for long.

Primary driver: regulatory clarity (CLARITY Act) Institutional adoption via digital asset treasuries (DATs) could materially increase demand for BTC. Market conditions: liquidity, corporate balance‑sheet allocation, and macro stability support higher targets. Charles Hoskinson predicts $250K Bitcoin by 2026 — analysis of regulatory catalysts, institutional demand, and market mechanics. Read the full breakdown and implications for investors. What does Charles Hoskinson predict about Bitcoin’s price? Charles Hoskinson predicts $250K Bitcoin by mid‑2026 , arguing that passage of the CLARITY Act will remove regulatory uncertainty and unlock institutional and corporate demand. He expects clearer rules to trigger corporate digital asset treasuries and broader liquidity, potentially more than doubling current price levels within a year. How could the CLARITY Act drive Bitcoin toward $250,000? Regulatory ambiguity has been a primary restraint on large institutional allocations. The proposed CLARITY Act aims to define agency roles across crypto markets. If it passes, corporations and financial institutions could confidently add Bitcoin to balance sheets. Clear rules reduce compliance costs and legal risk. That encourages: More corporate digital asset treasuries (DATs). Increased institutional custody and ETF-like vehicles. Higher market liquidity and tighter bid-ask spreads. Historic analogues show that institutional entry points can drive prolonged price appreciation. Hoskinson points to these mechanisms as the likely path to a $250K level by mid‑2026. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Charles Hoskinson Predicts $250K Bitcoin by 2026 – Here’s Why"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T09:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/charles-hoskinson-predicts-250k-bitcoin-2026"" }, ""description"": ""Charles Hoskinson predicts $250K Bitcoin by mid-2026, citing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption as key drivers for higher demand and liquidity."", ""keywords"": ""Charles Hoskinson, Bitcoin $250K, CLARITY Act, digital asset treasuries, institutional adoption""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How regulatory clarity could lead Bitcoin to $250K"", ""description"": ""Stepwise explanation of how the CLARITY Act and institutional adoption could push BTC toward a $250,000 valuation."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Passage of the CLARITY Act"", ""text"": ""Legislation defines agency jurisdiction and reduces legal ambiguity for market participants."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Institutional onboarding"", ""text"": ""Banks, asset managers, and corporations create custody, ETF-like offerings, and digital asset treasuries."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Corporate treasury allocation"", ""text"": ""Firms allocate a portion of cash reserves to BTC as a store of value, increasing sustained demand."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Liquidity expansion"", ""text"": ""Higher market participation tightens spreads and supports larger price moves with less slippage."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Price appreciation"", ""text"": ""Sustained demand and improved liquidity drive medium-term price discovery toward elevated targets."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why does Charles Hoskinson believe Bitcoin can reach $250K?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""He believes regulatory clarity from the CLARITY Act will unlock institutional and corporate demand, leading to digital asset treasuries and increased liquidity that could push Bitcoin toward $250,000 by mid‑2026."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is the CLARITY Act and why does it matter?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The CLARITY Act is proposed legislation to define which agencies regulate different crypto market segments.

Hoskinson sets a timeline of June–July 2026 for his $250K target. This assumes passage or clear momentum behind regulatory measures and a steady ramp in institutional balance‑sheet allocations. The timeline ties directly to expected legislative and institutional adoption windows. Frequently Asked Questions Will institutional adoption alone push Bitcoin to $250K? Institutional adoption is necessary but not always sufficient. It must combine with regulatory clarity, sufficient liquidity, and macro stability. When these factors align, institutional flows can have outsized price impact over 12–24 months. How realistic is a mid‑2026 target given current market structure? Realism depends on legislative outcomes and corporate behavior. If the CLARITY Act or similar measures pass and corporations move toward DATs, the scenario is plausible. Absent that, incremental institutional adoption could still lift prices but likely on a longer timeframe. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity matters : The CLARITY Act is central to Hoskinson’s thesis and to easing institutional risk. Institutional and corporate demand : Digital asset treasuries and custody solutions amplify sustained buying pressure. Timing and catalysts : Legislative progress and improved market infrastructure are the primary catalysts for a mid‑2026 move. Conclusion Charles Hoskinson’s $250K Bitcoin forecast centers on regulatory clarity unlocking institutional and corporate demand. While the prediction hinges on legislative outcomes such as the CLARITY Act, the mechanisms — DATs, custody expansion, and increased liquidity — are well understood and could plausibly drive large upside if realized. Monitor regulatory developments and institutional balance‑sheet activity as the key indicators.

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Risen Alongside Price Rally As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Open Interest has seen a sharp surge recently. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of BTC-related positions that are currently on all derivatives exchanges. When the value of the metric rises, it means the investors are opening fresh positions related to the asset. Generally, more positions come up with more leverage for the sector, so the cryptocurrency’s price can become more volatile following an Open Interest jump. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies traders are either closing positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. This kind of trend can clear out leverage, which can naturally make the asset more stable. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a strong increase alongside the asset’s run toward the all-time high (ATH) during the last few days. This suggests speculative interest in the coin has gone up. The trend isn’t anything unusual, as rallies tend to attract a lot of attention, and with attention naturally comes repositioning on the derivatives market. The scale of the rise this time, however, is definitely something worth taking note of. Rapid increases in the indicator alongside a rally can sometimes destabilize it. Following the latest jump, the Bitcoin Open Interest has touched $45.3 billion, which is a new ATH. “That’s the highest level of leverage the market has EVER seen,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether the bullish momentum will continue regardless of the intense speculation, or if it will prove to be a warning sign. In some other news, the BTC rally has also been accompanied by growth in the Coinbase Premium Gap , an indicator that measures the difference between the BTC prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). As the below chart shared by Maartunn in another X post shows, the metric’s value is floating around a positive value of $108 right now. This notable positive value implies Coinbase traders are currently participating in a higher amount of buying than Binance users, which is why Bitcoin is going for a higher rate there. BTC Price Bitcoin has pushed back toward its ATH as the latest continuation to its recovery run has taken its price to $122,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin open interest|Bitcoin Speculation|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-04 07:00:31

This performance positions XRP just 15% shy of its all-time high, making it one of the standout performers in the crypto space, trailing only Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), which saw price increases of 16%, 23%, and 21%, respectively over the same time frame. XRP Price Analysis Back in July of this year, the XRP price reached its peak of $3.66, but subsequent market corrections saw the token drop to as low as $2.70. Since then, attempts to recover have faced challenges, particularly with a key resistance level at $3.10 that has thwarted upward movements since August. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forecast: Expert Predicts Final Impulse Wave Targeting $18,000 This struggle has led to the formation of a falling wedge pattern on XRP’s daily chart, signaling a potential shift as selling pressure wanes and buying interest rises. Market expert Lark Davis recently shared his insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that if the XRP price can maintain momentum, it could target around $4, indicating a potential rally of approximately 33%. However, this bullish outlook hinges on XRP’s ability to consolidate above the $3 threshold, which would serve as confirmation of a breakout from the bullish pattern and pave the way for further price recoveries. Will ETF Approvals Propel Prices Higher? Contrasting Davis’ optimistic view, market analyst Ali Martinez expressed skepticism, arguing that while a breakout may occur, it might only lead to a price target of $3.60, essentially retesting previous highs rather than achieving new records. Despite differing opinions, the general sentiment leans towards potential upside, bolstered by the anticipation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that may soon gain approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for investing in XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Levels, Predictions Point To $140,000 By Early 2026 Leading analyst Crypto King highlighted the involvement of prominent names in the industry, with fund sizes ranging from $200 million to $1.5 trillion. He posited that the approval of even a single ETF could usher in a wave of institutional investment into XRP, significantly affecting its price trajectory. While the prospect of institutional money entering the XRP market is enticing, it remains to be seen whether these funds will have a substantial impact on the XRP price, particularly given the precedent set by similar investments in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum in 2024 following their own regulatory approvals.

The digital asset crossed $3 for the first time since 2018, and hit a new all-time high of $3.65 in July. Despite this remarkable performance, many XRP investors are convinced that the asset has not fulfilled its true potential and have even higher expectations. In a recent post, PharaohX33, an experienced market participant, stated that buying XRP below $3 “may likely be gone forever.” He added that prices under $2.00 and $1.00 are already “GONE.” He anticipates XRP to start rising within the next few weeks. Buying $XRP below $3.00 may likely be gone forever. We'll know within the next couple of weeks for sure. Below $2.00 – GONE Below $1.00 – GONE Prepare for higher prices. I wish you all the best of luck. — 𓂀 (@PharaohX33) October 2, 2025 Reasons for Confidence in XRP The timing of these comments coincides with recent actions by the Federal Reserve. The Fed recently cut interest rates , and expectations remain that more cuts could follow before the end of 2025. Lower borrowing costs tend to increase market liquidity and risk appetite, providing favorable conditions for assets like XRP. Market participants see this monetary environment as a potential catalyst that could drive stronger flows into digital assets. XRP, already recognized for its speed and efficiency in settlement, may attract renewed attention in such an environment. As institutions seek digital assets capable of serving large-scale financial functions, the combination of easier monetary policy and structural strengths could significantly lift demand . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation of Institutional Entry A key point of focus for investors is the potential approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , as the SEC has multiple decision deadlines this month. Approval of such products would represent a milestone for institutional adoption, as it would provide large investors with regulated access to XRP. This possibility has strengthened expectations of fresh capital inflows, with market observers noting that ETFs often mark turning points in liquidity and price dynamics for digital assets. PharaohX33 emphasized the urgency of positioning before such developments happen. He concluded his remarks with a simple message, writing, “Prepare for higher prices. I wish you all the best of luck.” For many retail and institutional investors, the prospect of missing an entry below $3 is becoming an important consideration. In early January, a prominent community member predicted that XRP would cross the $2 mark and not return , and the asset has spent much of 2025 well above this level. XRP is trading at $3.02, and if PharaohX33 is right, the next breakout in a few weeks might be the last time XRP trades around $3.

After breaking decisively above $3, XRP has reignited enthusiasm among traders who had grown weary of its long consolidation. For some, this is proof that the project still has life beyond the courtroom drama and years of stagnation. For others, it raises the question of whether this rally is sustainable, or if smarter money should be chasing newer tokens like Layer Brett with far higher potential multiples. XRP bulls in control Momentum has shifted firmly in favour of the bulls. The most recent rally saw XRP surge past $3 with strong volume, leading analysts to speculate about a move toward $4–$5 if current sentiment holds. Some more ambitious forecasts even point to $6 in early 2026, provided the regulatory picture continues to improve and Ripple’s cross-border settlement technology gains wider adoption. That said, XRP’s past cycles serve as a warning. Each rally has often been followed by sharp corrections, particularly once hype begins to fade. While a move toward $5 looks possible in the near term, traders remain divided on whether XRP can deliver the kind of outsized returns it once promised. Ripple’s long-term outlook Ripple still maintains an edge in payments technology, with partnerships across multiple financial institutions. This underpins the more optimistic XRP price prediction cases. Yet the token’s supply dynamics and regulatory baggage remain hurdles. Even if utility adoption accelerates, the pace of XRP’s price growth may not match faster-moving rivals. For holders who endured years of stagnation, the current breakout is welcome but it’s also prompting comparisons to new projects that appear to offer greater multiples. That’s where alternative tokens — particularly in the Ethereum Layer 2 space — are stealing attention. Where Layer Brett fits in One standout is Layer Brett (LBRETT) , an ETH L2 token that has combined meme culture with real technical underpinnings. Still priced at $0.0058 in presale, it has already raised over $4.2 million. At the time of writing, staking yields sit above 600% APY , though they drop quickly as more wallets join, giving early adopters a strong incentive to move fast. The project isn’t just about hype. Its roadmap includes NFTs, gamified staking and cross-chain bridging, all layered on Ethereum’s infrastructure. A $1 million giveaway is also in the cards, helping to fuel surging community growth across Telegram, TikTok and X. Many traders argue that this mix of meme-driven branding and genuine Layer 2 utility is exactly what makes LBRETT more dynamic than slower-moving tokens like XRP. Accessibility is another selling point: Buying LBRETT only requires connecting a wallet and paying with ETH or USDT. This simplicity has made it attractive to both newcomers and experienced investors and analysts now suggest it could climb from under one cent to over $1 in the next two years — a potential 160x move. The bottom line Every fresh XRP price prediction highlights the token’s resilience and renewed strength above $3. But when it comes to raw upside, XRP is unlikely to deliver the exponential multiples that newcomers like Layer Brett are targeting. For many traders, the choice is between stability and outsized opportunity. XRP may march toward $5 or even $6 if momentum continues but the bigger excitement seems to be shifting toward projects like LBRETT — where staking, community hype and Layer 2 technology intersect. Analysts note that the presale’s rapid fundraising and high APY structure put it in a different league compared to traditional meme tokens. With excitement mounting, LBRETT could end up defining the next wave of gains while XRP works to defend its hard-won territory above $3. Secure your share of Layer Brett today before the presale price moves higher.

Traders should use clear stops and consider percentage-based dip buys or weekly-close confirmations. Weekly close above $260 could target $520. Mechanical 25% dip buys with 50–60% profit exits showed three recent winning cycles. Support levels: $160 (near-term), $120 (deep buffer), $40 (long-term accumulation zone). Solana resistance analysis: SOL near $240–$260; learn breakout and dip strategies to trade responsibly — read actionable levels and next steps. Analysts outline Solana’s path as it nears key resistance, with breakout and dip based strategies guiding traders. Ali projects a weekly close above $260 could send Solana toward a $520 cycle peak. ZYN notes three straight gains using a 25% dip buy and 50%-60% rally exit method. Support sits at $160, with deeper buffers near $120 and $40 if rejection occurs. What is Solana’s current resistance outlook? Solana resistance sits in a cluster from $240 to $260, acting as the primary decision zone for the next directional move. A confirmed weekly close above $260 would signal stronger conviction and could open targets up to $520, while failed tests increase the probability of retests down to $160 or lower. How could a weekly close above $260 affect SOL? A weekly close above $260 would validate bullish order flow and technical structure, making subsequent targets at $280, $320, $360, $400, $440 and $520 plausible. These levels align with historical congestion and measured-extension methods; traders should expect phased advances with intermittent redistribution rather than uninterrupted rallies. Source: Ali on X Analyst Ali maps a stepwise progression through targeted checkpoints that reflect prior congestion. Each checkpoint—$280, $320, $360, $400, $440—serves as both profit-taking and re-accumulation zones ahead of a potential $520 cycle peak. This measured path suggests an orderly structure rather than erratic parabolic moves. How should traders approach SOL at current resistance? Traders can adopt one of two discipline-focused frameworks: confirmation-based entries or mechanical percentage entries. Each preserves capital while aligning risk to defined support and resistance. Weekly-close confirmation : Wait for a weekly close above $260 before scaling long; place stops below the breakout candle low. Mechanical dip strategy : Buy increments on 25% pullbacks from local highs and take partial profits at 50–60% rallies, as noted by analyst ZYN. Risk management : Use predefined stop zones at $160, $120, and $40 depending on time horizon and position size. Both approaches emphasize discipline: confirmation reduces false-break risk; mechanical entries capitalize on recurring range behavior. Position size and stop placement should reflect individual risk tolerance and time frame.

Yes. ZYN’s observation of three straight favorable cycles using a 25% dip buy and 50–60% exit suggests recurring range dynamics. That said, traders must pair mechanical rules with stop discipline to mitigate regime changes or unexpected market shocks. Key Takeaways Decision zone : $240–$260 is the critical resistance range determining next phase. Two valid approaches : Weekly confirmation vs. mechanical dip buys — both require clear stops. Defined supports : $160, $120, and $40 offer staged defensive levels for different time horizons. Conclusion Solana faces a pivotal moment as price tests the $240–$260 resistance cluster. Traders can prioritize a weekly close above $260 for breakout conviction or use disciplined percentage pullback buys with set exits. Monitor support zones and use strict risk management; this structured approach preserves capital while capturing potential upside. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana Resistance: Weekly Close Could Signal Move Toward $520"", ""description"": ""Solana resistance sits near $240–$260; analysts outline breakout and dip strategies with key supports at $160, $120 and $40."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2QO7I4WIAAsXt0-1-1024x716.jpg""], ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-05T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-05T12:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/solana-resistance-analysis"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to trade Solana at the $240–$260 resistance"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step disciplined approaches for trading SOL at critical resistance using confirmation and mechanical dip buys."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2QO7I4WIAAsXt0-1-1024x716.jpg"", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Set your framework"", ""text"": ""Choose either weekly-close confirmation or mechanical dip-buy rules before entering any trade."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Define entry and exit rules"", ""text"": ""For confirmation, enter after a weekly close above $260.

This step is part of the foundation's public treasury policy, which mandates regular Ethereum sales when there are deviations from its fiat-based operating expense reserve target. The Ethereum Foundation shared the following statement: “Today, we are converting 1,000 ETH into a stablecoin. This transaction is important not only to fund our work, but also to demonstrate the power of DeFi.” Related News: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Releases Update Regarding Recent Hack Attack Meanwhile, the Fusaka upgrade, a crucial step for the Ethereum network, has also been added to the calendar. Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, is preparing for two separate testnet phases this month. The mainnet upgrade is expected to be live by the end of November. Dankrad Feist, co-leader of the Ethereum Foundation's protocol architecture team, said that blockchain technology will become increasingly integrated into everyday financial services in the coming years. “In the next 10 years,” Feist said, “the majority of blockchain users will be ordinary people. They will look for easy solutions like a fintech app, rather than dealing with crypto wallets or complex blockchain interfaces.” *This is not investment advice.

52647112,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=827169,1759563000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52647112.jpeg,Top 3 Cryptos That Could Mirror Ethereum’s (ETH) Success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-3-cryptos-that-could-mirror-ethereums-eth-success/,"When Ethereum (ETH) launched in 2015 at under $1, few could have imagined that it would later blow up over $4,000, with early adopters getting life-changing returns. Investors are now searching for the next gems with the same volatile upside, and Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and newcomer Mutuum Finance are at the forefront. Cardano (ADA) continues to develop with updates targeting scalability and interoperability, setting itself up for strong long-term growth. Solana (SOL), despite being volatile in recent times, remains a workhorse for high-speed blockchain applications and institutional adoption. Yet the project that is making all the buzz is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a utility-driven DeFi platform currently priced at just $0.035. Its presale is currently in Phase 6, now over 55% sold out, reflecting robust demand and growing investor confidence. With over 16,750 holders, over $16.8 million raised, and a design aimed at dual lending infrastructure, Mutuum Finance has the best chance to offer ETH-like returns, and perhaps be the next sub-$1 altcoin to explode by 2026. Cardano (ADA) Builds Momentum With Key Targets Ahead Cardano (ADA) is rebuilding momentum as it restarts the upward trend in parallel with bullish predictions, now nearing $0.85 after registering more than 11% gains in the recent sessions. Traders are eyeing short-term targets of $0.95 and $1.00, while mid-term targets stretch as far as $1.05, $1.17, and even $1.33 as network upgrades and ecosystem development spark optimism. This sustained upward push solidifies ADA’s position as one of the most promising sub-$1 cryptos that has the potential to replicate Ethereum’s early growth trajectory. That being said, while ADA’s price outlook remains strong, many investors are also keeping a close eye on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is rapidly building momentum. Solana’s Momentum Gains Strength as $2B Treasury Strategy Induces Rally Solana (SOL) surged 5% to $220 this week after Nasdaq-listed VisionSys revealed a staggering $2 billion treasury plan with Marinade Finance, in a big leap forward for institutional participation in the Solana ecosystem. The first $500 million phase of the project will involve staking SOL for the next six months, a move that is widely seen as a milestone in onboarding AI infrastructure on blockchain technology and accelerating enterprise-level adoption. This shot in the arm of institutional confidence not only confirms Solana’s position as a high-performance Layer-1 network but also foretells potential large-scale price appreciation as demand for its ecosystem scales. Yet, as Solana’s growth narrative gathers momentum, the majority of investors who seek early-stage, high-upside potential are looking beyond blue-chip names, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now entering the picture. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is leading the decentralized finance charge with its presale, securing over 16,750 investors and raising a total of over $16.8 million to date. Already 55% filled in Phase 6, MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.035 per token. Committed to expanding the frontiers of DeFi, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles for enabling secure settlement, exchange, and lending of USD-backed tokens against popular assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The company makes use of robust and dependable price information with fallback oracle protections, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages for ensuring accuracy under all circumstances even in the event of severe market volatility. Mutuum Finance Announces Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has officially made public the development of its innovative lending and borrowing protocol , a massive achievement toward its vision to bring decentralized finance solutions to the next level. The V1 version will be live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, with the core features being a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. The launch will initially feature ETH and USDT as lendable, borrowable, and collateralizable assets, setting the foundation for a scalable and heterogeneous DeFi ecosystem. What to Choose Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are hopeful, but the clear winner is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Valued at just $0.035 currently and already over 55% sold out, MUTM’s strong dual lending ecosystem, high demand, and early-stage position give it the most potential to deliver Ethereum-like returns. For those investors searching for the next breakthrough under $1, MUTM is the top option.

Zhimin Qian, 47, a Chinese national, was convicted at Southwark Crown Court on Monday, 29th September, after pleading guilty to acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of cryptocurrency under the Proceeds of Crime Act (2002). Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a large-scale fraud in China between 2014 and 2017. During this period, the Metropolitan Police said that Qian defrauded over 128,000 victims before converting the proceeds into Bitcoin. Multi-Year Fraud Operation The investigation was first launched in 2018 following intelligence on the transfer of criminal assets, and led to the seizure of 61,000 Bitcoin from Qian. After fleeing China using false documents, she entered the UK and attempted to launder the illicit funds by purchasing property, allegedly with the assistance of an accomplice, Jian Wen. Following the conviction, Will Lyne, The Met’s Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command, said , “Today’s guilty plea marks the culmination of years of dedicated investigation by the Met’s Economic Crime teams and our partners. This is one of the largest money laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally. I am extremely proud of the team. Through a meticulous investigation and unprecedented cooperation with Chinese law enforcement, we were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK.” Qian has been taken into custody and will be sentenced at a later date. Accomplice Jailed Too As part of the broader investigation into international crypto-related fraud, Wen received a jail sentence last year for her participation in the scheme. Evidence presented by the Met’s economic crime team revealed that she assisted in moving a cryptocurrency wallet holding 150 Bitcoin, worth £1.7 million at the time, about $2.3 million. Southwark Crown Court sentenced her on 22 May 2024 to six years and eight months in prison.

Funding for crypto startups declined sharply in Q2 2025 as investors demand proven adoption and clear monetization paths. VCs favor projects with real adoption and predictable revenue. Q2 2025 saw a 59% decline in crypto startup funding and a 15% drop in deal count. 18 projects raised $312 million in a single week; valuations often rely on future cash flows. Crypto venture capital: VCs are more selective in 2025—learn why funding fell in Q2 and how projects must prove adoption to attract capital. Read actionable guidance now. Crypto venture capitalists are a “lot more careful” and not just jumping on every hot narrative, says Bullish Capital Management director Sylvia To as investors shift toward projects with real adoption and predictable revenue in 2025. Crypto venture capitalists are dialing back their risk appetite, avoiding the hot flavor of the month and applying a more critical lens to investments, according to Bullish Capital Management director Sylvia To. Investors are increasingly requiring evidence of usage and revenue before committing capital. “VCs are a lot more careful now. It’s not just a narrative play,” To said during a sit-down interview at Token2049 in Singapore. She noted that prior cycles allowed quick checks for new layer 1 projects without proven demand. That approach has changed as market fragmentation exposed weak adoption across many chains. What is driving the shift in crypto venture capital behavior? The shift is driven by weak user adoption, inflated valuations and a demand for predictable revenue models. Funds now question whether infrastructure has real traction—transaction volume and developer activity are the most scrutinized metrics. Who has been using the new infrastructure? “You really have to start thinking: there’s all this infrastructure being built, but who has been using it?” To said. VCs are looking for active wallets, transaction volume and third-party integrations as proof points before investing. 18 crypto projects collectively raised $312 million during the week ending Sept. 29. Source: Messari (plain text) To observed that many projects raised funds at inflated valuations in 2025, often relying on projected future cash flows rather than demonstrated pipelines. As a result, fundraising has slowed and investor scrutiny has increased. How much did crypto startup funding change in Q2 2025? Crypto startup funding declined significantly in Q2 2025, with a 59% drop in funding compared to the prior quarter , alongside a 15% decline in deal count, according to Galaxy Research (plain text). Galaxy Research’s VC report showed that crypto and blockchain startups raised $1.97 billion across 378 deals in Q2 2025. Overall venture investment into crypto amounted to $10.03 billion over the three months ending June, but the quarter-on-quarter drop signals heightened selectivity among investors. Which trends stand out in recent VC activity? Notable developments include large institutional allocations to Bitcoin-related strategies—Strive Funds secured $750 million in May to pursue such strategies—and concentrated raises by early-stage teams focused on monetizable infra and revenue models. How can crypto startups attract VC in 2025? Startups must prove adoption, demonstrate predictable revenue, and show institutional interest. Clear unit economics, strong on-chain metrics and partnerships that lead to measurable transactions are essential. Demonstrate active users : show daily active wallets, transaction volume and retention metrics. Show revenue pathways : detail current or near-term revenue streams with conservative forecasts. Prove product-market fit : list integrations, pilot customers or institutional commitments. Maintain transparent governance : clear token economics and on-chain controls reduce perceived risk. Frequently Asked Questions Why are VCs avoiding narrative-driven crypto projects? VCs avoid narrative-driven projects because past cycles produced many layer 1s and infra plays without user adoption. Investors now require on-chain evidence and predictable revenue to justify valuations. How steep was the funding decline in Q2 2025? Funding declined by 59% to $1.97 billion across 378 deals in Q2 2025, with an overall $10.03 billion invested over the three months ending June, indicating a pullback from earlier, more aggressive deployment. What metrics do investors prioritize today? Investors prioritize transaction volume, active users, revenue run rate, institutional partnerships and sustainable token economics when evaluating opportunities. Key Takeaways Selective capital: VCs now prioritize adoption and revenue over narratives. Funding down: Q2 2025 saw a 59% decline in funding and fewer deals. Action for founders: Focus on measurable usage, conservative financials and institutional traction to attract VC interest. Conclusion Crypto venture capital in 2025 has moved from narrative-driven bets to disciplined underwriting centered on adoption and revenue. Projects that can demonstrate clear user activity and monetization are best positioned to secure funding. For startups, the imperative is simple: prove your metrics and tighten your revenue model to align with investor expectations. Author: COINOTAG — Published 2025-10-04.

BNB's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview BNB Breaks $1,100 as Uptober Momentum Builds BNB’s latest rally saw prices climb to $1,111 before consolidating near $1,096, posting a 6% gain in 24 hours and more than 17% in the last week. Analysts note that the breakout above $1,050 resistance unlocked renewed momentum, with traders now targeting $1,200 as the next psychological barrier. Market data from CoinGlass shows that nearly $400 million in leveraged positions were liquidated during the move, including $268 million in short positions. This suggests that institutional buyers and momentum traders seized the opportunity to accumulate BNB as retail traders were forced out of the market. Network Growth and Lower Gas Fees Drive Demand Beyond price action, fundamentals on the BNB Chain continue to strengthen. Recent upgrades reduced gas fees from 0.1 Gwei to 0.05 Gwei, positioning BNB Chain as one of the cheapest and most efficient blockchains for decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading applications. On-chain activity supports the bullish case. Active addresses spiked to over 73 million in September, while transaction volumes climbed to 4.34 million monthly, the second-highest on record. The chain’s total value locked (TVL) has also risen to $8.23 billion, showing steady adoption across DeFi protocols. Institutional participation is increasing too. Kazakhstan’s state-backed Alem Crypto Fund recently designated BNB as its first official investment, indicating that sovereign entities are starting to diversify into exchange-linked tokens. Can BNB Sustain Its Push Toward $1,200? With BNB’s market cap now surpassing $160 billion, experts believe the token is strengthening its position as a key asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Technical signals indicate potential further gains: the token remains strong above all major moving averages, and RSI is near but not yet in overbought levels. Nevertheless, volatility remains a significant risk. A decline towards the $1,000–$1,030 support zone could occur if profit-taking speeds up. However, as long as BNB stays above $1,050, analysts consider $1,150–$1,200 as achievable short-term targets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-xrp-is-gearing-up-for-parabolic-advance-heres-why/,"XRP has held a firm position within its current trading range, showing a consolidation that many traders monitor. The recent price action highlights a period of compression just above a significant support level. Crypto trader and analyst Scient (@Crypto_Scient) recently revealed that XRP is preparing for a “parabolic advance.” This technical behavior often precedes larger moves, and analysts are evaluating whether the asset could soon establish a major shift in market direction. The analyst added that he does not see “any other major printing a cleaner or more bullish structure right now.” This assessment aligns with what can be seen on the chart, where the asset has formed a descending triangle , a recognizable bullish continuation pattern. $XRP , gearing up for parabolic advance. Honestly, I don’t see any other major printing a cleaner or more bullish structure right now. #XRP #XRPUSDT pic.twitter.com/AKyh0G6RP8 — Scient (@Crypto_Scient) October 1, 2025 The Bullish Formation The chart provided by Scient shows XRP trading at $2.9471, sitting above the $2.8 zone, which has acted as a strong area of support following the large breakout earlier in 2025. Since reaching a new all-time high in July , the price has entered into a descending triangle consolidation. While descending structures sometimes carry bearish risk, in this case, it appears to be forming as a bullish continuation setup due to its positioning above the breakout level. The highlighted support zone reinforces this view. XRP has continued to maintain that level despite repeated declines and support tests, showing buyers remain in control. The compression within the pattern suggests a potential expansion in volatility, with the bias tilted upward given the preceding trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Levels to Monitor A crucial point in the analysis is that XRP remains firmly above the multi-month accumulation range it broke out from earlier in the year. By holding above $2.8, which previously acted as a resistance zone, the market has effectively confirmed it as new support. The significance of this setup lies in the clean market structure that has developed over time. XRP’s consolidation phase is occurring in alignment with bullish continuation principles. Scient’s assessment that the structure is among the strongest in the market highlights the potential for significant price expansion once the consolidation resolves . If buyers continue to defend the resistance level, XRP could build the necessary momentum for another surge. A breakout above the descending resistance trendline would provide technical confirmation of renewed strength. Market watchers would then look for a push toward the higher levels established during the previous rally. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Altcoin Season Index at 65 Bitcoin dominance holds at 58.21% while selective altcoins outperform, indicating measured repositioning. Ethereum +12.46% and BNB +21.21% weekly gains; meme coins show high volatility (up to +136.81% and down -40.97%). Altcoin dominance nears breakout as Layer 1s lead rotation; track Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin dominance for timing. What is altcoin dominance and why does it matter now? Altcoin dominance measures the share of total crypto market cap held by altcoins versus Bitcoin. It now trades near a long-term support channel (~0.13) and, combined with an Altcoin Season Index reading of 65, suggests growing rotation into altcoins while Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at 58.21%. How is the current capital rotation into Layer 1 networks unfolding? Layer 1s are leading this rotation: Ethereum gained 12.46% and BNB 21.21% in seven days. Infrastructure upgrades and integrations are cited as drivers. Institutional flows into Bitcoin ETFs ($627 million in 24 hours reported) are supporting Bitcoin’s stability, so capital appears to favor structured ecosystems before moving into smaller caps. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/altcoin-dominance-breakout-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Altcoin dominance nears breakout zone as Layer 1s lead capital rotation"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2VXgF1WUAApa-W-1-1024x664.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Altcoin dominance nears a breakout as Layer 1 networks lead rotation and Altcoin Season Index hits 65; measured repositioning noted while Bitcoin dominance holds.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor an altcoin dominance breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks to confirm a genuine altcoin breakout and manage risk."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch Bitcoin dominance"", ""text"": ""Monitor Bitcoin dominance for a decisive break below 57% which historically signals broader altcoin expansion."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track Altcoin Season Index"", ""text"": ""Use the Altcoin Season Index; a sustained move above 66 often confirms rotation pressure into altcoins."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Follow Layer 1 performance and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Prioritize Layer 1 network strength (ETH, BNB) and institutional flows before allocating to high-volatility meme or micro-cap tokens."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What level of Bitcoin dominance signals altcoin expansion?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Historically, a sustained Bitcoin dominance below ~57% has often coincided with broader altcoin cycles and increased altcoin market share."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does an Altcoin Season Index of 65 mean?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""An Altcoin Season Index reading of 65 signals rising rotation pressure but is just below the common 66 threshold used to denote an official altcoin season."" } } ]} Altcoin dominance nears key breakout zone as Bitcoin strength persists and Layer 1s lead capital rotation. Altcoin Season Index hit 65, signaling rising rotation pressure despite Bitcoin’s 58.21% dominance hold. Ethereum and BNB led gains with 12% and 21% weekly advances, driven by infrastructure upgrades. Meme coins like FLOKI and JELLYJELLY surged, but Plasma’s 40% drop shows ongoing liquidity risk. Altcoin dominance is approaching a possible inflection zone as market structure data and sentiment indicators align for what analyst Merlijn The Trader describes as “Strike 3.” His observation points to an emerging shift in capital rotation, with altcoins slowly reclaiming ground against Bitcoin. Historical trendlines support that pattern. Previous dominance peaks in 2018 and 2021 both coincided with sharp altcoin rallies before deep corrections. The current ratio trades near 0.13 , sitting on long-term channel support that has defined every recovery phase across the past two cycles. What do long-term structure signals indicate about rebound potential? According to Merlijn The Trader, the dominance chart shows three projected cycle tops: 2018, 2021, and a projected top in 2025. Each touched an upper resistance band. Price action continues to respect that formation, suggesting upside room remains while the lower boundary holds. Source: Merlijn The Trader (social commentary) Near-term positioning shows caution. Bitcoin dominance increased to 58.21% , gaining 0.25 points in 24 hours. The Altcoin Season Index climbed to 65 out of 100, nearing the commonly referenced 66 threshold used to denote official rotation. That divergence points to selective repositioning rather than indiscriminate risk-taking. How are Layer 1 networks shaping the current rotation? Ethereum gained 12.46% in seven days, with BNB advancing 21.21% over the same stretch. Upgrades and integrations on these networks have driven institutional and retail interest, while broader market indices show flows into regulated products that support Bitcoin’s case as a core allocation. The Binance market index rose 11.09% across the week. XRP tracked an 8.53% rise amid compliance developments. These moves suggest capital preferentially rotates into robust, liquid ecosystems before pursuing high-risk micro-cap opportunities. Why are meme coins and micro-caps still risky? Speculative appetite is evident: FLOKI rallied 36.83% after a European ETP listing (reported in market notices). Micro-cap JELLYJELLY surged 136.81% on listing momentum. Conversely, Plasma (XPL) plunged 40.97% , highlighting thin liquidity and rapid drawdowns in smaller markets. That contrast underscores a layered advance: stable gains in Layer 1s, selective retail speculation in meme assets, and heightened liquidity risk for micro-caps. Further confirmation of broad altcoin expansion would likely arrive if Bitcoin dominance breaks below 57% . Comparison table: key metrics this week Metric Value Implication Bitcoin dominance 58.21% Maintains BTC stability; limits immediate altcoin breadth Altcoin Season Index 65/100 Rising rotation pressure; just below official threshold Ethereum (7d) +12.46% Layer 1 strength BNB (7d) +21.21% Strong exchange-led ecosystem gains Frequently Asked Questions What BTC dominance level historically triggers altcoin season? Historically, a sustained Bitcoin dominance drop below ~57% has often signaled that capital is rotating into altcoins more broadly, enabling wider altcoin advances. How should traders manage risk during early rotation? Prioritize liquid Layer 1 tokens, use position sizing, set stop-losses, and monitor institutional flows and the Altcoin Season Index for confirmation before increasing exposure to high-volatility micro-caps. Key Takeaways Measured rotation: Altcoin dominance nears a key zone but Bitcoin dominance remains a constraining factor. Layer 1 leadership: Ethereum and BNB gains indicate infrastructure-driven capital flows. High-risk micro-caps: Meme token rallies coexist with sharp liquidity-driven drawdowns; manage risk accordingly. Conclusion Altcoin dominance is approaching a pivotal area as Layer 1 networks lead capital rotation while Bitcoin retains significant market share. Short-term gains in Ethereum and BNB point to structured strength, but liquidity risks in smaller tokens remain.

Aggressive taker buy volume pushed BTC above $120K. Active receiving addresses jumped to ~548K, indicating renewed demand. Derivatives flows show larger average order sizes and stronger institutional participation. Bitcoin price surges above $120K; aggressive buying and rising on‑chain demand signal short‑term bullish momentum — read analysis and key takeaways. What is driving Bitcoin’s recent surge above $120K? Bitcoin price moved above $120,000 primarily because aggressive taker buy volume outpaced sell pressure, and on‑chain metrics show a rapid rise in active receiving addresses. Strong derivatives order flow and coordinated retail-institutional accumulation front‑load bullish momentum for BTC in the near term. How does aggressive long positioning affect BTC momentum? Market order‑flow data indicates that taker buy volume — traders paying the offer to open or add longs — has meaningfully risen. When taker buys exceed taker sells, price discovery tends upward because buyers accept higher prices immediately. This behavior suggests traders expect continuation rather than short‑term mean reversion. Source: X Why does rising on‑chain activity support a bullish outlook? The Number of Active Receiving Addresses climbed sharply, indicating larger participation in incoming transfers. Higher receiving addresses typically reflect either accumulation or increased transactional use. The recent jump from approximately 400K to 548K addresses in three days signals heightened demand and network engagement. CryptoQuant and other on‑chain analytics providers reported the spike in receiving addresses and a concurrent rise in futures average order size, reinforcing the link between on‑chain demand and derivatives positioning. Source: CryptoQuant How are retail and institutional flows aligning? Derivatives metrics show larger average futures order sizes, consistent with institutional participation. At the same time, on‑chain indicators point to rising retail accumulation at current prices. This alignment — institutions providing directional pressure via futures and retail adding spot demand — amplifies momentum when both cohorts accumulate simultaneously. Source: CryptoQuant What is ahead for BTC? Near term, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on whether buyers can sustain a close above $120K. A confirmed daily close above that level increases the probability of an extension to the next resistance near $125K. Conversely, failure to hold $120K could trigger profit‑taking and a pullback to recent support bands. Source: TradingView Frequently Asked Questions How quickly did active receiving addresses rise? Active receiving addresses rose from ~400K to ~548K in roughly three days, a ~37% increase that signals a rapid uptick in network inflows and participation. Does higher taker buy volume guarantee a sustained rally? No. While higher taker buy volume indicates buying conviction, sustained rallies require continued demand, healthy liquidity, and confirmation on daily closes above key levels like $120K. Key Takeaways Aggressive buying : Taker buy volume drove the initial push above $120K, showing traders are paying higher prices to enter longs. On‑chain demand : Active receiving addresses jumped to ~548K, reflecting stronger network participation and accumulation. Watch $120K : A decisive close above $120K favors a run to $125K; failure to hold could prompt short‑term retracement. Conclusion The current Bitcoin surge is backed by measurable market action: aggressive taker buy orders in derivatives and a clear rise in on‑chain receiving addresses. These signals improve BTC’s short‑term probability of continuation, but traders should monitor $120K as the decisive pivot.

Despite whale accumulation driving PEPE futures open interest beyond $600 million, the reality for traders is declining network activity. Could Layer Brett ’s jump from Base limitations to dedicated Ethereum Layer 2 architecture represent a possible infrastructure breakthrough? Read on. Why PEPE ‘s Whale Momentum Hits Network Activity Decline Walls Whale accumulation patterns around PEPE reveal sophisticated positioning, with futures open interest climbing to unprecedented levels between $560-600 million while trading volumes surge past $1.2 billion daily. It’s a display of confidence, particularly as PEPE shows 10% weekly gains that outpace Bitcoin’s modest 1.4% movement. However, beneath this momentum lies a troubling disconnect that technical analysts cannot ignore. On-chain metrics expose the critical weakness undermining ambitious Pepe Coin price prediction models calling for massive multipliers. Daily active addresses have plummeted below 3,000 users, representing a sharp decline in network engagement that typically precedes major corrections in memecoin markets. This pattern repeats across previous cycles where whale accumulation creates temporary price support while fundamental user adoption erodes and with the current support level around $0.00000900, there’s mounting pressure as resistance at $0.000009681 becomes increasingly difficult to break through declining volumes. The Derivatives Success Trap That Memecoin Infrastructure Cannot Handle PEPE’s derivatives market success masks a dangerous infrastructure trap threatening its sustainability. The fundamental problem lies in PEPE’s inability to scale beyond speculative trading patterns. Unlike traditional financial instruments that derive value from underlying assets, memecoin derivatives depend entirely on sustained community engagement and network activity. As daily active addresses continue declining, derivatives positions face increasing pressure from traders who recognize that engagement metrics predict price sustainability better than whale accumulation patterns. This creates what institutional analysts call the “derivatives success trap” – where impressive trading volumes and open interest numbers mask deteriorating fundamentals. Projects caught in this trap face rapid deleveraging events when market sentiment shifts. Brett’s Layer 2 Evolution From Viral Potential to Sustainable Utility Layer Brett’s strategic transformation addresses these core infrastructure limitations that trap projects like PEPE in unsustainable speculative cycles. By evolving to a dedicated Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett combines memecoin viral energy with genuine blockchain utility that survives beyond derivatives trading patterns. The project’s presale has already raised over $4.2 million, showing solid recognition of its potential. The key difference lies in Layer Brett’s approach to solving Ethereum’s fundamental scalability problems through high-speed transactions and low gas fees. While PEPE struggles with declining network activity despite whale accumulation, LBRETT offers staking rewards exceeding 610% APY that create genuine utility for token holders. As such, Layer Brett’s ecosystem development extends beyond simple token trading to include NFT integrations, gamified staking and cross-chain interoperability features. These utilities create multiple engagement touchpoints that sustain network activity even during market downturns, preventing the derivatives trap that catches projects relying solely on whale momentum. From Speculative Price Cycles to Infrastructure That Outlasts Hype The contrast between PEPE’s current trajectory and Layer Brett’s infrastructure-first approach illustrates why traditional memecoins face sustainability challenges that dedicated Layer 2 solutions avoid. PEPE’s reliance on derivatives momentum and whale accumulation creates temporary price support without addressing fundamental scalability limitations that cause network activity to decline. While Pepe Coin price prediction models chase ambitious multipliers based on historical patterns, market reality shows that infrastructure limitations ultimately determine which projects survive long-term. Layer Brett’s presale represents meme culture appeal and serious blockchain utility and the project looks well positioned to capture massive sustainable growth this year.

According to authorities, its promoters are based in Russia, while technical support is based in Georgia. Meanwhile, its Indian operations are handled from Dubai, with the servers located in Barcelona. The illegal online trading platform, OctaFX, is being investigated by Indian authorities for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens over the past few years. According to the Enforcement Directorate ( ED ), the platform has become a part of a study into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into digital assets and use the services of international payment gateways. Indian authorities allege OctaFX made $96 million from crime proceeds Indian authorities claimed that a multi-agency investigation has revealed that OctaFX made more than $96 million of alleged crime proceeds in nine months. According to authorities, some of the funds were layered, with the platform allegedly using fake import services from Singapore to launder criminal proceeds from India. In a particular case, the ED was able to connect Rs. 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa located in Spain, Rs. 36 crore in banks, 39,000 USDT, land, and Demat holdings of about Rs. 80 crore. Meanwhile, authorities have claimed that OctaFX is not the only platform being investigated by the ED office in the Mumbai zonal unit. Other alleged illegal online platforms carrying out investment frauds include Power Bank, which is under investigation at the Bengaluru zonal unit. Angel One, TM Traders, and Vivan Li are also being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit, while Zara FX is being investigated by the ED office at the Kochi unit. The ED’s cases across its offices are based on the FIRs registered by the police in different cities. “Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,” the ED revealed in its study. Indian authorities also discovered that in the Birfa IT case, the scammers were able to send more than Rs. 4818 crore to Hong Kong and Canadian entities under their control. Authorities say operators are usually foreigners Authorities claimed that most of the payments sent abroad are done under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, while others are escrow services on fake invoices. The ED document revealed that Indians have lost more than Rs. 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024, a jump of about 206% in estimated losses from Rs. 7,465 crore recorded in 2023. Notably, the ED recorded a 50% rise in the number of cases from 2023 to 2024. Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud also discovered that the masterminds were operating the operation from Laos, Hong Kong, and Thailand. They created and maintained shell entities using forged documents. The operations were maintained by Indians hired to carry out other types of alleged crimes, including issuing fake IPO allotments, stock market investments, and fake digital arrests. Proceeds of crimes are collected from several shell companies and converted into digital assets before they are remitted overseas as payments for fake import services. While international payment gateways act as intermediaries for many of these illicit transactions, a part of the funds is laundered using hwala channels, the ED notes. In its reports, the Enforcement Directorate claimed that it discovered that some illegal funds were returned into the country under the premise of legitimate investments into stock markets.

Key Takeaways: Tether and Antalpha are raising $200 million to build a tokenized gold treasury centered on XAUt. The initiative deepens their partnership as gold demand climbs and tokenized commodities gain traction. Tether continues expanding beyond stablecoins with strategic bets in mining, AI, and tokenized assets. The effort aims to stockpile XAUt, Tether’s blockchain-based gold token, backed by physical bars stored in a Swiss vault. If successful, the capital raise would strengthen ties between two of the digital asset industry’s most prominent players. Tether, Antalpha Join Forces Amid Crypto-Mining and Stablecoin Dominance Tether is the issuer of USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap, while Antalpha is closely tied to Chinese mining giant Bitmain, which produces over 80% of global Bitcoin mining hardware. XAUt, launched by a Tether subsidiary in 2020, has grown to a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion. The planned vehicle would act as a publicly visible treasury focused solely on accumulating this asset. It follows an expanded partnership between Tether and Antalpha announced last week, which introduced new services such as XAUt-backed lending, custody, and token redemption. Antalpha said it plans to open vaults in global financial hubs, allowing token holders to redeem their digital assets for physical gold. We are proud to announce the expansion of our collaboration with @Tether_to , further integrating Tether Gold ($XAU₮) @tethergold into our RWA Hub. Through this partnership, we will now offer $XAU₮-backed lending and full-stack infrastructure solutions, making digital gold more… pic.twitter.com/eXaGQpoY0N — Antalpha Global (@AntalphaGlobal) September 29, 2025 Tether has been pushing far beyond stablecoins in recent years, with investments in Bitcoin mining, AI, payments infrastructure, and tokenized assets. Its CEO, Paolo Ardoino, is a strong advocate of gold as a store of value, and the company held $8.7 billion worth of gold on its balance sheet as of June. At the same time, Tether is reportedly seeking to raise $20 billion in a separate effort to scale its core USDT operations, a deal that would value the company near $500 billion. The gold-backed initiative arrives as demand for gold surges. Global gold investment is up 46% this year amid geopolitical tension and inflation fears, according to Bloomberg. XAUt’s market cap has doubled in that time, per CoinGecko data. More than 80 digital asset treasury firms have been formed in 2025, many using reverse mergers or SPAC structures to mimic Strategy Inc.’s public Bitcoin bet. Tether Rejects IPO Route Even as Circle’s Stock Soars Tether’s focus on gold comes as competition heats up. Circle, which went public in June , has seen its stock surge over 500% since its debut. Tether, however, has no plans to follow suit. “In general we are not interested in becoming a public company,” Ardoino said in July . The new legislation appears to be opening doors that were previously shut. Ardoino, along with other crypto executives, attended the White House bill signing. The law could, for the first time, help normalize stablecoin usage, both in crypto trading and across mainstream financial infrastructure. Tether has long been under fire for a lack of transparency, particularly regarding its reserves. Audits, promised for years, have yet to materialize. However, Ardoino said the company has been in contact with auditing firms in recent weeks.

Short-term volatility and CME session gaps suggest consolidation is likely before any sustained breakout. BTC near record highs with resistance at $124,200 — watch consolidation. Volume spiked on retracement; sellers capped gains leading to a pullback below $121,630. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades warns of October strength but advises avoiding heavy leverage; CME Open/Close gaps are key markers. Bitcoin near all-time highs: watch $124,200 resistance and consolidation. Read key signals and trade guidance — COINOTAG. What is driving Bitcoin close to its all-time highs? Bitcoin near all-time highs is being driven by renewed Q4 optimism, short-term buying pressure and visible CME Open/Close gaps that attract follow-through flows. These catalysts pushed BTC toward $124,200 but immediate resistance and heavier volume on retracements suggest consolidation rather than a clean breakout. How did price action unfold during the latest session? Bitcoin opened near $121,360 and rallied toward $124,200 before encountering significant seller interest. The move produced a retracement back below $121,630, demonstrating how momentum can reverse quickly at major resistance zones. Traders noted a horizontal guide near $122,448 that framed the session’s range. As of the latest read, BTC traded at $122,676.01, a minor decline of $11.12 (0.01%). Bitcoin edges close to all-time highs with volatile moves, showing resistance near $124,200 as traders balance Q4 optimism and caution. Bitcoin nears record highs with sharp swings as traders prepare for Q4 momentum while remaining cautious of sudden pullbacks. BTC price action highlights strong resistance near $124,200 as sellers push retracements, keeping consolidation in focus for traders. Daan Crypto Trades notes October strength yet warns traders to avoid heavy leverage during potential flushes and sharp corrections. Bitcoin showed sharp volatility heading into the weekend, sparking both excitement and prudence among market participants. The cryptocurrency nearly touched its all-time highs late Friday before closing slightly lower. Why are CME Open/Close levels important now? CME Close and CME Open levels act as institutional reference points that can concentrate liquidity and attract price fills. The chart shared by analyst Daan Crypto Trades highlighted these levels and a shaded red zone that visualized the recent correction. Traders often monitor these gaps because later sessions can gravitate toward them, producing measurable short-term moves. Source: Daan Crypto Trades How should traders manage risk during a near-record rally? Short-term traders should prioritize position sizing and avoid heavy leverage, as recommended by Daan Crypto Trades. Use stop placement below recent structure (e.g., below $121,360 session lows) and watch for volume divergences on attempts to retake $124,200. Maintain discipline: a failed breakout often leads to quick flushes that penalize overleveraged positions. Comparison: Key session levels and market readings Metric Level / Reading Implication Immediate resistance $124,200 Requires conviction to clear; sellers active Intraday guide $122,448 Defines current trading range Recent trade $122,676.01 Small decline; consolidation bias Frequently Asked Questions Is Bitcoin breaking its all-time high now? Not yet. Bitcoin approached the record but met resistance near $124,200 and pulled back, indicating that a sustained breakout requires stronger follow-through volume and conviction from institutional flows. How can traders spot a real breakout versus a false breakout? Look for rising volume on the breakout, confirmed closes above resistance on multiple timeframes, and alignment with institutional markers such as CME gap fills. Avoid entering solely on price spikes without confirmation. Key Takeaways Resistance matters : $124,200 is the primary level to watch for a breakout or rejection. Volume confirms : Higher volume on a breakout is necessary to validate a sustained move. Risk management : Avoid heavy leverage; use stops and monitor CME Open/Close gaps.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a new price discovery rally, which could start sooner than expected. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Uptober’ Begins With $220 Retest – Is It Ready For Second ‘Expansion Wave’? Bitcoin Eyes Third Price Discovery Uptrend On Friday, Bitcoin jumped nearly 3% to hit a two-month high of $123,894. The flagship crypto has seen a massive recovery from last week’s correction, surging 14% from the local lows. Earlier this week, BTC reclaimed the $115,000-$117,000 area, which served as a key support zone during the early Q3 rally, before surging to the crucial $120,000 barrier on Thursday. Amid its bullish performance, analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that Bitcoin was able to secure a daily close above this level, skipping a retest of the recently reclaimed $117,000 mark. He explained that a daily close above $120,000, followed by a successful post-breakout retest, has historically preceded a move to the $123,00 resistance, with a nearly identical daily performance leading to the mid-August all-time high (ATH) of $124,474. Meanwhile, market watcher Ted Pillows noted that if BTC successfully holds the $120,000-$121,000 zone, it will reach highs soon. On the contrary, he warned that losing this area could lead to a retest of the $117,000 as support. Nonetheless, he considers that Bitcoin’s price might not see another massive correction in the short term, as history suggests the cryptocurrency might have bottomed during the late-September pullback. “BTC historically bottoms in September. Since 2016, Bitcoin has bottomed 7 times in September. (…) Historically, this means BTC bottom is most likely in and it won’t go lower than $107K,” he asserted. Analyst Crypto Jelle forecasted that price discovery could resume as early as next week, pointing out that holding the $120,000 level as support over the weekend and closing above it in the weekly timeframe would set a strong base for the long-awaited Q4 rally. Is BTC’s Top A Few Weeks Away? As the flagship cryptocurrency is on the “cusp of entering Price Discovery Uptrend 3,” Rekt Capital also shared a potential timeline for Bitcoin’s cycle top based on its previous post-halving performances. The analyst previously shared his 2025 roadmap for BTC’s rally, suggesting that it could see an extended cycle or potentially enjoy a third Price Discovery Uptrend before the bear market, which would push the cycle peak into deeper stages of 2025. In a video analysis, he suggested that BTC’s top could arrive in the next two weeks to two months. As he explained, Bitcoin peaked around 520 days after the 2016 Halving event, while it topped nearly 550 days after the 2020 event. If it had repeated its 2017 timeline, BTC would have had to peak around September, meaning that the August ATH was the cycle top. The analyst dismissed this possibility, suggesting that a repeat of its 2021 price action was more likely. In this case, BTC would need to peak in the next two weeks. Related Reading: Analyst Forecast Ethereum (ETH) Breakout To $6,900 As Price Retests Crucial Resistance However, Rekt Capital laid a third scenario in which Bitcoin tops around mid-November. This timeline would follow the theory that the cycle peak timeline is increasing by 30 days at a time, signaling that this cycle’s peak would happen around the 580-day mark post-halving. “If we are looking at the four-year cycle, the most important thing is to just wrap everything up in candle one. That’s historically what’s been the case,” he explained. “So, at least two weeks and maybe still a month and a half to a maximum of two months. But beyond that, I don’t think we’ll be lengthening.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|btc|BTC ATH|BTC breakout|BTC price discovery|BTCUSDT|crypto analyst|Crypto Bull Run 2025|crypto market correction|Crypto Market Recovery|Crypto trader,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-10-04 09:00:59

Ayo Akinyele is spearheading efforts to position the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as the top choice for institutions by prioritizing privacy-first innovations. In a recent blog post published on October 2, Akinyele emphasized that the key to meeting institutional demands lies in combining the transparency of public blockchains with confidentiality. Akinyele pointed out that privacy on-chain should be a baseline protection for the encryption that secures online banking. He cited zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a type of cryptography that establishes the veracity of a statement without disclosing the underlying information, as a means of facilitating private but law-abiding transactions. Akinyele suggested Know Your Customer (KYC) as an example of completing the process without disclosing identities to the entire network. According to Akinyele, organizations will not transfer essential processes to public ledgers unless confidentiality is built into them. He added that regulators will not approve public ledgers if accountability is not present. Akinyele emphasized that wallet infrastructure, selective disclosure, and ZKPs are designed to close that gap. Akinyele drives XRPL’s privacy-first push for institutional DeFi “Without privacy, financial institutions cannot safely use public ledgers. Without accountability, regulators cannot sign off. With programmable privacy, we can have both.” https://t.co/fo83mCmhCW Meet J. Ayo Akinyele @ja_akinyele , cryptographer and RippleX Senior Director of… — RippleX (@RippleXDev) October 2, 2025 Akinyele stated that he is committed to making XRPL the go-to option for organizations seeking trust and innovation throughout the upcoming year 2026. According to Akinyele, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will be essential for enhancing scalability and facilitating private, legal transactions. He stated that the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, activated on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) mainnet on October 1, 2025, will represent a significant advancement in the on-chain representation of complex financial products. The Ripple Engineer confirmed that Confidential MPTs will introduce privacy-preserving tokenized collateral to the market in 2026. Akinyele confirmed that confidential MPTs will be a necessary step for institutional adoption of DeFi and tokenized RWAs. “The future of blockchains belongs to builders who remove unnecessary trust. If we can prove correctness, prevent misuse, and give users confidence that their assets and data are safe, then blockchain tech won’t just scale, it will transform finance.” ~ Ayo Akinyele, Senior Director of Engineering at Ripple Institutional DeFi has reached a transaction volume of $1 billion, marking a significant milestone in its transition from pilot initiatives, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), stablecoin transactions, and lending protocols. In the past year, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has established itself as a settlement layer that both regulated financial institutions and crypto-native businesses trust, and broken into the Top 10 chains for real-world assets (RWAs). According to Akinyele, the introduction of XRPL Version 3.0, a protocol-level lending system that permits pooled lending and underwritten credit, is a key component of this approach. Ripple’s team claimed that XRPL version 3.0 aims to establish its position in the upcoming stage of institutional finance by utilizing XRP as a utility token for collateral management and settlement. The Ripple engineer confirmed that the capacity of XRPL to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) and expedite cross-border payments is driving its institutional adoption. Akinyele champions XRPL’s bridge for institutional assets Akinyele thinks that scalability must not come at the expense of security or decentralization. To mitigate market-structure risks without reverting to intermediaries, Akinyele emphasized the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs). The (TEEs) will help in equitable transaction sequencing to prevent front-running and confidential computing for executing sensitive functionality off-chain, while producing verifiable outputs. The Ripple engineer also positioned XRPL as “uniquely positioned to bridge” what he described as “many trillions of dollars in assets set to move on-chain over the coming decade,” citing the ledger’s decade-long operating history, built-in decentralized exchange, escrow, and payment channels as finance-oriented primitives already at the protocol layer.

The XRP community is now in that stage. Ripple’s longtime Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, has announced his decision to step back from his daily role , marking a significant milestone for both Ripple and XRP. Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle), a prominent crypto expert and researcher on X, released a video offering his perspective on the news. He remarked that “every revolution has a moment when the builder steps aside,” comparing Schwartz’s decision with Satoshi leaving Bitcoin and leadership transitions in Ethereum. He framed Schwartz’s move as XRP reaching that same stage, where its growth no longer depends on one figure but on the strength of the network and adoption surrounding it. The JOB COMPLETE Signal Is Here #XRP ’s Endgame Next!!! pic.twitter.com/icfKsr8WQv — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 2, 2025 The Next Phase for XRP Schwartz has not departed from Ripple entirely; he will transition into an emeritus role and maintain involvement on the company’s board. This adjustment means Ripple retains Schwartz’s expertise while allowing new leadership to guide the next phase of growth. Bull Winkle framed Schwartz’s decision as a signal of strength rather than weakness, remarking that “he didn’t leave here because of weakness. He left because XRP is strong enough to run without him.” The timing of his step back is central to the narrative. Ripple has built relationships with over 300 banking and financial institutions worldwide, a foundation that continues to support the case for XRP’s long-term utility in cross-border payments and settlement. As partnerships expand, the role of an individual executive becomes less central to XRP’s path forward, reinforcing the argument that the digital asset is now positioned for institutional-scale growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Anticipation for ETFs and Institutional Demand A key factor shaping the current anticipation is the prospect of U.S.-based spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Several pending applications have October deadlines , creating heightened expectations. This window could mark a turning point for XRP and bring a new wave of institutional investment into the ecosystem. Ripple Bull Winkle linked Schwartz’s step back to this development, saying it comes “right when ETFs, banks, and institutional adoption are all lined up for XRP.” He sees the transition as timely and aligned with broader momentum. Schwartz will remain involved as a strategic voice in the community. Ripple’s partnerships worldwide and upcoming ETF decisions position XRP for one of its most significant periods yet.

Expert Comments,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-rally-continue-after-bitcoins-recent-surge-expert-comments/,"Bitcoin has been showing a strong rise since the beginning of October, confirming the phrase “Uptober” frequently used by cryptocurrency investors. As of today, the Bitcoin price has climbed above $123,000, just a few hundred dollars shy of its all-time high recorded in mid-August. BTC has been trending upwards for the past five days. Bitcoin's steady appreciation despite market volatility caused by the US government shutdown was driven by a report published by JPMorgan analysts. The report predicted that Bitcoin could reach $165,000 by the end of the year. Analysts argued that Bitcoin stands out as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Related News: Two Top Officials at the Federal Reserve, Jefferson and Logan, Discussed Interest Rate Cuts and the U.S. Economy Crypto advocates have long argued that Bitcoin's decentralized nature can provide a safe haven during times of government-driven uncertainty. Investors' recent interest in Bitcoin, particularly in the face of threats of new tariffs, supports this argument. JPMorgan has stated that Bitcoin is still “undervalued” compared to traditional hedges like gold. Bitcoin's rally is being accompanied by other cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum rising nearly 9% in the past week, reaching $4,500. However, not everyone is as optimistic as JPMorgan. Alex Blume, CEO of investment advisory firm Two Prime, described this rise as a “fragile rally.” Blume said the rise could be due to expected market movements in the final quarter of the year, adding that the increased money supply coupled with the Fed's interest rate cuts provides a clear advantage for Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

BTC near $124k with strong institutional spot demand Open Interest hit a fresh $90B ATH and short-term holders moved significant supply to exchanges. Bitcoin Dominance holds ~59% and long-term holding rates have increased, limiting alt rotation. Bitcoin retest $124k: BTC nears ATH on heavy spot inflows and rising LTH conviction — read analysis and next steps. What is driving Bitcoin’s retest of $124k? Bitcoin retest $124k is being driven by large institutional spot inflows, rising long-term holder accumulation, and elevated derivatives open interest. These dynamics have boosted bid-side liquidity and reduced the altcoin rotation that previously amplified leverage flushes. How significant are derivatives and open interest for BTC price action? Open Interest (OI) recently set a new $90 billion all-time high, a 7% rise from the prior peak. High OI increases liquidation risk but paired with strong spot flows, it signals greater participation rather than purely speculative excess. Source: CryptoQuant (data reported as on-chain and derivatives metrics). BTC is trading roughly 1.3% below the prior $124k ATH as the market evaluates whether available bids can absorb potential long liquidation events. Historically, similar OI peaks preceded short-term volatility when leveraged positions were overexposed. Why are short-term holder flows important for the current setup? Short-term holder (STH) activity is a key liquidity signal. In the current window, 46k BTC flowed from STHs to exchanges, representing the largest 24-hour STH-to-exchange spike on record. That movement shows weak hands are being shaken out as prices approach resistance, reducing the pool of immediately liquid supply. At the same time, STH on-chain cost bases flipped above $111k and realized profit rates rose, indicating many recent participants are now in profit and may be less motivated to sell on minor pullbacks. Image of STH dynamics: Source: CryptoQuant How do ETF flows and Bitcoin Dominance affect breakout odds? ETF spot inflows continue to underpin BTC bids. On October 3rd, ETFs recorded an inflow of $985 million, reinforcing a structural bid beneath price. Simultaneously, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is holding near 59%, which limits capital rotation into altcoins and concentrates demand back into BTC. When BTC.D remains elevated, altcoin performance underperforms and speculative rotation is restricted, lowering the probability of a broad market derisking that previously triggered deeper corrections. When could a leverage flush still occur? A leverage flush becomes more likely if open interest collapses rapidly while spot flows dry up and BTC.D falls sharply as capital rotates into alts. Monitoring OI trends, ETF net flows, and exchange inflows from STHs provides the earliest warning signs of renewed downside pressure.

The lawsuit, filed in 2022, alleged that Yuga Labs misled buyers into expecting profits from their NFT purchases. In his decision, Olguin said the NFTs were marketed as digital collectibles offering exclusive membership benefits, not as profit-seeking investments. “The fact that defendants promised that NFTs would confer future, as opposed to immediate, consumptive benefits does not alone transmute those benefits from consumptive to investment-like in nature,” he wrote. The court found that there was no “common enterprise” between buyers and Yuga Labs—an essential component under the Howey Test. The NFTs were tradable on public blockchains and lacked any ongoing financial arrangement between purchasers and the company. NEWS: A California judge ruled Bored Ape NFTs are not securities, tossing the class-action suit against Yuga Labs Unlike Top Shot & DraftKings, BAYC was sold on 3rd-party marketplaces, and royalties weakened the “common enterprise” link Major precedent for NFT securities law pic.twitter.com/yBhyZjw08L — Now Media (@nowmedia) October 3, 2025 Legal experts noted the significance of the ruling. “Statements about NFT prices and trade volumes are a somewhat closer call, but even then, these statements by themselves fail to establish an expectation of profit,” Olguin added. Consensys attorney Bill Hughes pointed out that fees collected by Yuga were independent of NFT pricing, further weakening the plaintiffs’ case. The court also said that general statements about value or future plans did not equate to promises of profit. The ruling strengthens the argument that most NFTs, particularly those designed as digital collectibles with access features, do not fall under existing US securities regulations, setting precedent for other ongoing cases in the space. Nike and StockX Settle NFT Trademark Dispute Ahead of Trial As reported, Nike and StockX have settled their nearly three-year legal battle over sneaker-linked NFTs, bringing an abrupt end to a closely watched case that could have set new precedent for digital asset and intellectual property law. The agreement, filed last Friday in New York federal court, cancels a jury trial scheduled for October and dismisses all claims with prejudice. The lawsuit began in 2022 when Nike accused StockX of trademark infringement over its “Vault” NFTs, which used Nike-branded sneakers. The conflict intensified when Nike alleged that StockX had sold counterfeit shoes, claims partially upheld in March, when a judge ruled StockX had sold fake Nikes to both investigators and a customer. The settlement spares both parties from further reputational and legal risk. This development follows Nike’s broader retreat from digital collectibles. The company’s web3 arm, RTFKT, announced it would shut down operations by early 2025, citing a shift to legacy preservation. The closure has drawn investor backlash, with some alleging they were left holding worthless digital assets after the sudden pivot.

Dogecoin price prediction models are celebrating technical patterns, and Shiba Inu builds ambitious Layer 2 infrastructure, but both legacy tokens struggle against utility limitations. Layer Brett ‘s over $4.2 million presale momentum and 610% staking rewards represent a key shift from traditional memecoin limitations toward dedicated Layer 2 infrastructure that moves beyond these barriers constraining DOGE and SHIB. What is behind this driving force? Why DOGE Golden Cross Patterns Hit Utility Walls at Key Resistance DOGE’s recent golden cross formation has generated significant bullish sentiment, yet price action remains trapped in the $0.21-$0.22 range with stubborn resistance at $0.225. This technical pattern historically signals momentum shifts, but Dogecoin’s fundamental architecture limits its ability to capitalize on institutional interest flowing into the space. Institutional ETF speculation has driven DOGE trading volumes to approximately 808.9 million, yet this increased activity has exposed the network’s scalability constraints. When institutional money seeks efficient execution and retail traders pile in simultaneously, Dogecoin’s infrastructure becomes a limiting factor. The gap between technical optimism and fundamental capacity creates sideways trading patterns despite bullish chart formations. Newer architecture is needed to address these limitations while maintaining memecoin appeal. DOGE’s reliance on outdated blockchain technology isn’t going to cut it much longer. SHIB Bridge Hacks Expose Infrastructure Limits Legacy Memecoins Face Shiba Inu’s massive Shibarium bridge hack involving BONE tokens highlights security vulnerabilities that emerge when legacy memecoins attempt ecosystem expansion through retrofitted solutions. While SHIB developers work on LEASH v2 migration to rebuild confidence, these incidents reveal how adding utility layers to existing memecoin frameworks creates new attack vectors rather than solving fundamental limitations. The SHIB-DOGE trading pair hitting record lows since November 2021 demonstrates how ecosystem complications can harm relative performance. Despite trading volumes exceeding 1 trillion tokens, Shiba Inu struggles to break above its 200-day moving average while dealing with security concerns that undermine investor confidence. These challenges illustrate why building utility on top of memecoin foundations creates more problems than solutions. Brett’s Layer 2 Evolution Transcends Traditional Memecoin Ceilings Layer Brett represents a fundamental evolution beyond the limitations constraining both DOGE and SHIB by combining meme energy with purpose-built Layer 2 technology. While traditional memecoins hit utility ceilings due to foundational blockchain constraints, $LBRETT operates on infrastructure designed for scalability, security, and genuine utility from inception. The project’s rapid progression to $4.2 million in presale funding shows off the recognition that next-generation memecoins require next-generation blockchain architecture. The 610% staking rewards offered by Layer Brett aren’t promotional gimmicks but sustainable features enabled by efficient Layer 2 economics that legacy memecoins cannot match. Unlike DOGE’s limited utility or SHIB’s bridge-dependent ecosystem additions, Layer Brett’s staking operates natively within its blockchain environment, eliminating security risks and efficiency bottlenecks that constrain traditional memecoin growth. From Technical Patterns to Dedicated Blockchain Infrastructure Revolution The transition from analyzing technical patterns on constrained networks to evaluating purpose-built blockchain infrastructure represents a maturation in memecoin investment strategy that traditional Dogecoin price prediction models cannot adequately capture. While DOGE golden crosses and SHIB ecosystem developments generate headlines, Layer Brett’s infrastructure-first approach addresses the fundamental scalability and utility challenges that create resistance levels and security vulnerabilities in legacy memecoins. Layer Brett’s presale success and sustainable staking rewards prove that investors increasingly recognize the limitations of retrofitting utility onto outdated blockchain foundations.

Filings are marked “subject to completion” after the SEC updated streamlined spot-ETF rules. Proposals include ADA + Staking, AVAX + Staking, DOT + Staking and dedicated funds for LINK, LTC, XLM. crypto ETFs: REXShares & Osprey filed 21 altcoin ETF proposals including staking-enabled funds — read concise coverage and key takeaways. What did REXShares and Osprey file on October 4, 2025? REXShares and Osprey Funds jointly submitted applications for 21 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , covering established altcoins and newer tokens. The filings, labeled “subject to completion,” list assets from Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) to Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Sei (SEI). Which assets and structures are included in the filings? The proposals include staking-capable products such as ADA + Staking , AVAX + Staking and DOT + Staking , plus dedicated funds for Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and emerging projects TAO, HYPE and SUI. Filings explicitly note that some funds are structured to incorporate on-chain staking rewards into fund returns. Asset Proposed Fund Staking Included Cardano (ADA) ADA + Staking ETF Yes Avalanche (AVAX) AVAX + Staking ETF Yes Polkadot (DOT) DOT + Staking ETF Yes How do staking-enabled ETFs differ from standard crypto ETFs? Staking-enabled ETFs are designed to capture on-chain staking rewards and reflect them in NAV calculations. That structure requires custodial and operational arrangements to stake holdings securely while maintaining liquidity for fund redemptions. Regulators will evaluate how staking yields are earned, reported and distributed within a regulated ETF wrapper. Why does SEC rule change matter for these filings? The Securities and Exchange Commission’s finalized general rules for cryptocurrency spot ETFs simplified listing procedures, reducing the need for bespoke reviews. This procedural change enabled REXShares and Osprey to submit a broad slate of proposals simultaneously, increasing the likelihood of faster processing compared with prior case-by-case approaches. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot — and 18 More ETFs Just Filed"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""REXShares and Osprey filed 21 crypto ETF applications on Oct 4, 2025, spanning major altcoins and staking-enabled funds; filings are 'subject to completion.'"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/2025/10/04/21-altcoin-etfs-filed"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor the progress of these ETF filings"", ""description"": ""Steps to track regulatory progress and fund launch indicators for the 21 ETF proposals."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review official filing notices"", ""text"": ""Read the filings listed as 'subject to completion' to confirm fund scope and staking mechanics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track SEC calendar and statements"", ""text"": ""Watch for SEC orders, comment periods and approval notices related to spot and staking ETF rules."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor custody and staking disclosures"", ""text"": ""Assess custodian arrangements and how staking rewards are collected, allocated and reported."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which assets are included in the 21 ETF filings?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The filings cover Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and newer projects such as Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Sei (SEI)."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are the filings final?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The proposals are listed as 'subject to completion' and will proceed through SEC review under new generalized spot-ETF rules."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will staking ETFs pay out rewards to investors?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Proposals indicate staking rewards are incorporated into fund returns, but distribution mechanics depend on fund documents and custodian arrangements."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Which tokens are in the filings beyond ADA, AVAX and DOT?

The company’s monthly production rose 27% from September 2024, mining 629 BTC and selling 445 BTC for approximately $48.7 million at an average price of $109,568. In its Friday update, CleanSpark reported that its fleet efficiency improved 26% year over year, while its average operating hashrate for the month reached 45.6 EH/s. Push for Financial Independence CleanSpark has been selling a portion of its monthly Bitcoin production since April as part of its strategy to become financially self-sufficient. It also opened an institutional Bitcoin trading desk to facilitate these sales. In August, the company generated $60.7 million from the sale of 533.5 BTC, demonstrating the scale of its operations. The miner’s shares on Nasdaq rose 5.28% following the report and gained more than 23% over the week, according to Yahoo Finance. The broader market has also been buoyant. The market capitalization of 15 major publicly traded Bitcoin miners reached a record $58.1 billion in September, up from $41.6 billion in August and more than double the $19.9 billion recorded in March, according to The Miner Mag. Challenges Ahead for Bitcoin Miners Despite investor enthusiasm for mining stocks, the industry faces increasing headwinds. Higher energy costs and the risk of tariffs on imported mining equipment could weigh on profitability. In August, The Miner Mag reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection alleged some of CleanSpark’s 2024 mining rigs were manufactured in China. This could leave the company with potential tariff liabilities of up to $185 million. Iris Energy (IREN), the largest Bitcoin miner by market capitalization, is also contesting a separate $100 million tariff dispute with the agency. According to Cointelegraph, the effective duty on China-made mining rigs stands at 57.6%, while machines imported from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand face tariffs of 21.6%. Rising Mining Difficulty Bitcoin mining difficulty reached record highs in September and October. This means miners now expend more computing power and energy to produce the same amount of Bitcoin, putting further pressure on operational costs. CleanSpark’s push for efficiency and its growing BTC reserves highlight its determination to navigate these challenges while maintaining financial independence.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-04 09:15:33

He remarked, “Instead of hiring one more person on your team, you could just use Comet to supplement all the work that you’re doing,” noting that the AI browser lets people handle more tasks faster, the time saved could translate into $10,000 in value per year per individual. He added that human digital knowledge work represents about $25 trillion of GDP, so raising efficiency by 20% could inject about $5 trillion. Austan Goolsbee, President of the Chicago Fed, also noted that AI has the potential to drive GDP growth by increasing productivity and enhancing service quality. However, he stressed the significant costs associated with AI infrastructure. Goolsbee cautioned that AI growth could fall short According to Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, businesses are increasingly using AI to reduce hiring and streamline operations, but the overall labour impact remains small for now. Goolsbee, however, cautioned that firms should also consider the chance that AI may not scale as much as expected. He stated, “Might we get over our skis a bit with over-investment and have to clean up if there were a bubble? I think we do want to think about that topic.” Barbara Corcoran, a longtime investor, also said in an interview with CNBC Make It that AI isn’t an “act now or lose out” opportunity. She noted that many entrepreneurs are diving in without a clear sense of its benefits. She also warned that when business owners lack a clear strategy for utilizing AI, they risk wasting both time and money. Nonetheless, corporations like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are planning to pour up to $320 billion into AI and data centers in 2025. Perplexity’s Comet browser is now available free globally Perplexity made its Comet browser available to users globally at no charge on Thursday. The startup has also introduced a new “background assistant” in Comet, available to select paying subscribers, to manage multiple tasks. Comet debuted three months ago for Perplexity’s $200-per-month Max plan members, sparking millions to join its waitlist. The browser centers around a sidecar assistant that helps answer questions, summarize information, manage content, and guide your browsing. The decision to offer Comet at no cost comes as Perplexity takes on big names like Chrome and fresh entrants like Dia. For instance, OpenAI rolled out its web agent, Operator, in January, while Google added Gemini AI to Chrome in September. Anthropic also announced a browser-based AI agent in August. At its core, Perplexity is recognized for its AI search engine that delivers clear responses and directs users to original sources. Last year, after plagiarism claims, the startup established a revenue-sharing program with media outlets. In August, the company launched Comet Plus, a paid subscription offering content from “trusted publishers and journalists.” Perplexity recently announced its first partners: CNN, Condé Nast, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Fortune, Le Monde, and Le Figaro. Perplexity also teased upcoming additions, like a mobile version of Comet and a Background Assistant designed to work on multiple tasks asynchronously.

The delay stems from a combination of procedural changes at the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. In the days leading up to the shutdown, the SEC approved generic listing standards that eliminate the need for case-by-case 19b-4 filings. In this case, exchanges were instructed to withdraw their pending applications under the old system, paving the way for a more streamlined framework that would speed up approvals once operations resumed. Stalled ETF momentum For now, however, cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that the shutdown has stalled that momentum. With large portions of the SEC’s workforce furloughed, the agency is limited to handling fraud cases and emergencies, leaving routine but essential processes, such as sign-offs from the Division of Corporation Finance, on hold. Without that clearance, trading for proposed spot ETFs tied to XRP, Solana , and Litecoin cannot begin, regardless of the new rules. The delay is excruciating for investors who saw October as a breakthrough month, with altcoin ETFs expected to fuel demand and legitimize digital assets. Crypto ETF approval season has officially arrived! https://t.co/85h74ZZ7LS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 30, 2025 Notably, U.S. investors already have access to an XRP ETF through REX-Osprey, which received expedited approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940, cutting its review period to about 75 days compared to the 240-day process under the Securities Act of 1933. Overall, this setback comes as the broader cryptocurrency market regains bullish momentum led by Bitcoin, with many investors shrugging off the effects of the Washington shutdown.

This $0.035 Altcoin Will Leave Them Behind,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-vs-cardano-ada-which-crypto-will-hit-a-new-ath-first-this-0-035-altcoin-will-leave-them-behind/,"While the next bull cycle for crypto is in the cards, investors are keeping a watchful eye on Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), to see which will break its previous all-time high first. But despite their strengths, both may be outdone by a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s receiving much more attention. Now worth just $0.035, MUTM’s presale is already over 55% sold out in Stage 6, drawing in 16,750+ holders and over $16.8 million in capital. Its lending dual infrastructure, real-utility tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contracts have made it a utility-first DeFi project with blowout upside potential. While SOL and ADA may continue to offer steady growth, the early momentum of Mutuum Finance could propel it past the two and offer much larger gains by the time the next top in the market is attained. Cardano (ADA) Breaks Out of Correction Channel With Bullish Momentum Building Cardano (ADA) is flashing fresh strength after months of consolidation, having respected its long-term support line and broken out of multiple triangle and downward channel charts. The breakout shifted overall sentiment to bullish, and price action is currently consolidating at the $0.80 level, which makes a good base for the next possible leg higher. Experts note that the buying momentum can continue to sustain itself and make ADA test the $0.90 level of resistance, which is a high-recovery point, and even set the stage for a fresh bullish trend in 2025. However, while investors follow ADA’s movement, others are in the meantime studying newer projects with greater upside potential and that is where focus is increasingly gravitating towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Solana Bulls Extend Rally After $190 Demand Bounce Solana made a strong bounce from the $190 demand level and has risen to around $220, confirming that the buyers are still in the driving seat. The bull case is valid as long as SOL is maintaining the $173–$186 demand region; keeping that base strong leaves a clear way to the next higher targets at $230, $242, $254 and $262. Price action is trending in a narrow, step-by-step progression, and every retest is converting old resistance into support, so watch the $220 region for momentum to continue or a broken breakout that would induce a re-test of the demand zone. For investors who are interested in looking further than Layer-1 exposure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surfaced on multiple watchlists unheralded as an alternative. Investor Confidence Surges in Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set another presale record by collecting more than $16.8 million in current phase 6. Tokens are at $0.035, higher from a 16.17% uptick from Phase 5. Investor enthusiasm remains high, with more than 16,750 backers having faith in the long-term vision of the project. Mutuum Finance is accompanied by adaptive LTV and liquidation rates that adjust automatically relative to real-time market conditions in such a manner that the protocol becomes very highly sensitive to volatility. Reserve multipliers would range from 10% for risky assets to 35% for risk-averse assets to ensure a second layer of systemic security. Lending & Borrowing Protocol Development Mutuum Finance recently announced the development of its novel lending and borrowing protocol , with V1 going live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will feature liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateral support Security comes first for Mutuum Finance. It has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, inviting security researchers and developers to hunt bugs and report them and be rewarded for doing so. The bugs are ranked on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low, providing end-to-end security and giving a boost to the security roadmap of the platform. Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are both well-positioned for the next bull run, but both of them don’t carry the same kind of early-stage upside as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With tokens currently $0.035 and over 55% sold out, MUTM’s adaptive risk management, lending platform, and true DeFi utility make it stand out as the undisputed winner. Backed by $16.8 million raised and 16,750+ backers, it’s quickly becoming the project most poised to overtake both SOL and ADA, and potentially even offer exponential returns before they even reach new all-time highs.

According to reports, the country’s central bank foresees a credit growth of about 20% before the end of 2025. Pham Thanh Ha, deputy governor of the central bank, mentioned on Friday that there needs to be more interest rate cuts to encourage economic growth and steer the country out of the uncertainty from the US-imposed tariffs, according to a report by Reuters. United States President Donald Trump introduced an array of tariffs on April 2, which affected the markets and divided observers. While the effect on the market has been limited, Vietnam wants to limit the effect of the uncertainty on its economy. Vietnam makes shift towards digital assets In June, the Vietnamese government announced the legalization of digital assets as part of a broader technology regulation. The National Assembly announced the legalization of the assets, approving it under the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14. The law, which is expected to take effect on January 1, 2026, will see Vietnam categorize digital assets as either virtual assets representing real-world tokenized products or crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The law also mandates cybersecurity and anti-money laundering regulations aligned with international standards, an effort likely aimed at addressing concerns brought up by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on the FATF gray list since 2023, and under the new regulation, the country will be tasked with outlining specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for the different classes of assets. In addition, the country launched a 5-year crypto market pilot that would bring stricter controls to the crypto industry. Under the pilot program, the government has also announced a prohibition on issuing on-chain fiat-backed assets, including stablecoins and securities. The program, which has been effected after the announcement, will require crypto transactions, including issuance, trading, and payments, to be carried out in its native currency, the dong. APAC region sees big jump in crypto transaction volumes Vietnam has been predicted to become a regional hub for crypto in Southeast Asia due to the focus of its government on emerging technology. Other factors that have helped the country include its youthful population, robust crypto adoption, pushing it into the fourth position on the Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region remains the fastest-growing in terms of crypto adoption. According to Chainalysis, nine out of the top 20 countries on its Global Crypto Adoption Index are located in the region. The APAC region experienced 69% year-over-year growth in crypto value received as transaction volumes rose from $1.4 trillion to over $2.3 trillion in 2025. The adoption was led by India, Vietnam, and Pakistan, according to data from Chainalysis. Pakistan has been doubling its efforts in the crypto industry at the beginning of the year. Some weeks ago, the country called for exchanges to pick up licenses and begin operations locally. Meanwhile, Vietnam also deployed a national blockchain database for identification and public records in July. The blockchain was designed to serve as the regulated foundation for interacting with the digital economy, on-chain platforms, and internet applications. The blockchain, NDAChain , is a layer 1 network with 49 nodes governed by private-public partnerships. NDAChain is expected to make private data stored on centralized servers secure against cyberattacks by distributing data across a partially decentralized system. Get seen where it counts.

BTC Pushes Higher October (often referred to as “Uptober” within the crypto community) has so far proven its legacy as a highly successful period for the primary digital asset. The price has been gradually increasing since the first day of the month, and it reached $123,850 several hours ago. This means that BTC was just inches away from reaching its all-time high of $124,130, which was witnessed in mid-August. In the following hours, the asset lost some steam, and as of this writing, it trades at roughly $122,400.

52651784,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85271,1759572025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"MUTM’s Path From $0.035 to $2 Looks More Likely Than SHIB Ever Reaching $1, Say Experts",https://timestabloid.com/mutms-path-from-0-035-to-2-looks-more-likely-than-shib/,"This year, the cryptocurrency market has gone through big changes, which has made many buyers look for safe ways to add to their holdings. Meme coins like SHIB get a lot of attention, but their volatility has made more traders and institutional investors look for structured decentralized finance options that offer real returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the best options for investors looking for steady growth, real use, and good long-term prospects. Analysts say that MUTM is much better than hype-driven tokens because of its strong foundations, long-term plan, and strong pre-sale demand. SHIB Ever Reaching $1 The idea of Shiba Inu (SHIB) reaching $1 has long fascinated its community, but in realistic terms, it faces enormous hurdles. SHIB currently trades in the fractions of a cent, with a circulating supply of around 589 trillion tokens. For SHIB to hit $1, its market capitalization would need to surpass $589 trillion — a figure that is more than five times the total global GDP and nearly 600x larger than Bitcoin’s current market cap. This makes a $1 price target virtually impossible under existing supply conditions. However, SHIB does have mechanisms like token burns aimed at reducing supply, alongside growing utility through the Shibarium Layer-2 network and its ecosystem of decentralized apps. These factors could help SHIB climb in value over time, but even aggressive burns and adoption would likely only push SHIB toward modest fractions of a cent rather than the mythical $1 milestone. Dual Lending, Collateral Protection, and Treasury Mechanics At the moment, Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale costs $0.035, and about $16.8 million has been raised so far. Of the 170 million tokens that were available, 55 million have been sold. With over 16,750 users and a total supply of 4 billion MUTM, investors are keeping a close eye on the next Phase 7 price rise to $0.040, which will be a 15% rise. Now is a very important time for buyers to buy MUTM tokens at a lower price before the price goes up. The successful presale shows that more and more people want a token that can be used for more than just trading in a decentralized lending and borrowing environment. With Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending choices, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out for its dual lending models. In P2C, users can earn mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio with competitive APYs when they invest well-known tokens like ETH. For example, a $18,000 ETH deposit that earns 15% APY would bring in $2,700 a year in idle income. Overcollateralized lending is good for borrowers; for example, a $1,500 ADA at 70% LTV frees up $1,050 in cash. The P2P function separates more volatile tokens like SHIB and FLOKI, so lending can happen without putting the main liquidity pool at risk. This design makes it easy for a lot of people to participate while keeping the system stable. The security of the whole platform is improved by collateral and liquidation methods. All loans need to be backed up by more collateral than the loan itself. The protocol’s Stability Factor actively watches positions and initiates liquidations when collateral falls below safe levels. Liquidators buy discounted collateral to restore protocol health, creating a fair incentive structure. With an 80% liquidation threshold, assets with lower volatility can keep their higher LTVs, while tokens with higher volatility can keep their 35–55% LTVs with a ~65% barrier. This well-balanced approach lowers the risk and builds investor trust, especially during market changes that make people wonder why crypto is down today. Dynamic liquidity tactics are another way that market volatility is controlled. When there is enough on-chain liquidity, liquidations can happen quickly and with little slippage. Reserve factors take a small amount of borrower interest to build an on-chain safety buffer. All of these steps protect the protocol and make MUTM more valuable as a utility token, which opens up long-term investment possibilities for people interested in cryptocurrencies. Giveaways and Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also offers a robust user interface with a comprehensive dashboard and a Top 50 leaderboard. Investors can track their holdings, calculate projected ROI, and earn bonus MUTM tokens based on their ranking. Security has been validated with a CertiK audit scoring 90.00 on Token Scan and 79.00 on Skynet, supplemented by a $50,000 bug bounty with tiered rewards and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway for ten winners. The project’s strong social footprint includes 12K+ Twitter followers, demonstrating an active and engaged community. Early buyers show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a lot of value potential. A Phase 2 buyer who bought 150,000 MUTM for $0.015 now has assets worth $0.035, which is a return of 2.3X. With the planned beta launch, the integration of Layer-2, which will lower transaction costs and speed up the process, and the expected listings on top exchanges like Kraken and MEXC, these investors are set to make even more money. These changes let users try out the lending and borrowing process for themselves. This will likely lead to more adoption and higher demand, which could support the $2 goal that was set for the next 12 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has real use, predictable mechanisms, and structured returns, unlike meme coins like SHIB that depend on market opinion and hype. Institutional investors are turning their attention to crypto ETF trends that show projects with measurable yield possibilities. Individual investors are doing the same. Cryptocurrency prices change all the time right now, but MUTM’s presale structure, functional community, and roadmap milestones make it a better choice for long-term crypto investing. The limited supply in Phase 6 is making people move quickly, and investors will be rewarded for doing so when the next price in Phase 7 is set at $0.040. In the DeFi space, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a unique situation to gain both attention and value. It provides structured, clear, and profitable investment opportunities for people who want to move beyond speculative meme tokens.

XRP has often been positioned as a candidate for this role, given its focus on speed and efficiency in value transfer. Adding to this conversation, Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and recognized voice in the XRP community, recently shared his views on how liquidity defines XRP’s future. His perspective came in response to a video where Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within the next five years. I keep telling everyone, the problem crypto solves is liquidity. You can't print more money to create liquidity, that will just collapse fiat. But you can have limitless (almost unlimited) liquidity simply by having say a token like XRP reaches $10k, that will create over $800T… https://t.co/YpLUe6Sgal — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 2, 2025 Liquidity as a Core Function Van Code argued that the central issue digital assets solve is liquidity itself. According to him, increasing fiat supply cannot create sustainable liquidity because it risks weakening traditional currencies. In contrast, he suggested that digital assets such as XRP offer a different dynamic, pointing to the possibility of “limitless” liquidity. He explained that if XRP were to reach a valuation of $10,000 per token , it would generate over $800 trillion in liquidity. He clarified that this would not function in the same way as fiat markets, because an attempt to withdraw the full amount into fiat would immediately affect price levels in a manner resembling a logarithmic decline. By this reasoning, liquidity in digital assets is not limited to fiat comparisons but instead operates through depth of markets and valuation scaling. His statement, “limitless liquidity is what you will be hearing over the next few years,” reflects his view that digital tokens provide a framework for scaling transactions without the constraints that limit traditional currencies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Relevance to the XRP Ledger Van Code’s view on liquidity is based on the XRP Ledger, built to handle high transaction volumes with speed, low costs, and finality. If liquidity scales as he suggests, the XRPL could serve as the foundation for global settlement . His remarks complement Ripple’s vision for XRP in financial infrastructure. While Garlinghouse pointed to XRP capturing 14% of SWIFT’s traffic, Van Code emphasized liquidity mechanics, framing XRP as more than just a bridge asset. Outlook for Growth If adoption and valuation increase, the XRPL could emerge as a leading network for liquidity across markets. This also positions XRP as a potential solution to institutional demand for scalable financial settlement. Though Van Code’s projection depends on a sharp rise in XRP’s price , his point remains that the ledger’s architecture supports sustainable liquidity.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase has applied for a National Trust Charter to expand financial services under clearer regulation. The move would reduce reliance on third-party banks for fiat transactions while avoiding traditional banking status. Circle and Ripple have filed similar applications. The filing positions Coinbase among a growing list of digital asset companies pursuing the same license, including Circle and Ripple. Coinbase Says Trust Charter Will Bridge Crypto and Traditional Finance In a statement on Friday , Coinbase said the charter would support its long-term objective of aligning more closely with traditional finance while continuing to build on its digital asset foundation. “We’re expanding our business capabilities and regulatory oversight beyond the existing framework, paving the way for innovation and growth in building a modern financial system powered by digital assets,” the company said. Despite the move, Coinbase was clear that it has no plans to become a traditional bank. “Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. It is our firm belief that clear rules and the trust of our regulators and customers enable Coinbase to confidently innovate while ensuring proper oversight and security,” the statement read. The license, if granted, would allow Coinbase to offer payments and other financial services without depending on third-party banks for on- and off-ramps. The crypto market is global, and we need uniform national rules to protect every consumer as the market continues to evolve. That’s why we’ve applied for a @USOCC national trust charter and the federal regulatory oversight and clarity that it provides. — Coinbase (@coinbase) October 3, 2025 Luke Youngblood, a former Coinbase engineer behind the exchange’s staking program, explained on a recent podcast that a trust charter would give Coinbase the flexibility to directly manage fiat inflows and outflows. “No more relying on partner banks,” he said. Youngblood also noted how much Coinbase’s retail platform has improved since he left in 2022. “When I worked there, the debit card didn’t work very well and the app was clunky. Now, you can really tell they’ve hired some top engineering talent.” The filing comes at a time when other major crypto players are also seeking trust licenses. Stablecoin issuer Circle submitted its application on July 1, followed closely by Ripple Labs. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse described the license as a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.” TIME Names Coinbase a 2025 ‘Disruptor’ Among Most Influential Companies As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator. Notably, Coinbase also continued its corporate Bitcoin accumulation. In Q2, the company purchased 2,509 BTC for approximately $222 million, lifting its total holdings to 11,776 BTC and placing it back among the top 10 public holders of the asset, just ahead of Tesla by coin count.

Shiba Inu’s Chart Shows The Spark, PayDax (PDP) Carries The Fire Recently, Shiba Inu traders circulated a chart (see below) showing a breakout from a long downtrend, marked with rocket icons signaling a potential parabolic rally. It’s the classic setup: prices coil, sentiment shifts, and then volume explodes upward. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) gaining over 6% in the past week, traders expect that this move could snowball into a parabolic rally. But Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) problem has always been volatility. The chart above shows just how volatile meme-driven assets like Shiba Inu can be. However, PDP, priced at $0.015 in presale, flips that script. Its structured approach builds steady momentum while still targeting explosive potential upside, positioning it as a stronger contender for the next parabolic rally. With bonuses, referrals, and utilities layered in, PayDax (PDP) sets investors up for a parabolic rally designed for lasting potential gains. The Shiba Inu Trap Or The PayDax (PDP) Advantage? Imagine two investors: Investor A (Shiba Inu) Investor B (PayDax) Buys into SHIB after seeing the breakout chart. The token pumps fast, but within days, it faces sharp corrections. Portfolio swings between +200% and -60% in weeks. Buys into PDP presale at $0.015 with an 80% bonus. As presale demand grows, price appreciation is steady, and bonuses lock in larger allocations before exchange listing. Relies heavily on hype cycles, community sentiment, and viral tweets. Relies on structured tokenomics, adoption-fueling use-cases, Assure DeFi audit , and growing presale momentum. Markets move fast, and while experts agree that both Shiba Inu and PayDax (PDP) are positioned for a potential parabolic rally, the paths look very different. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A chart breakout signals a short-term parabolic rally setup, but extreme volatility makes it hard to sustain gains. Paydax (PDP): As a presale project , much of the upside is already built in. With bonuses and referral incentives layered on, PayDax reduces downside risk while still positioning investors for a powerful parabolic rally once it launches. Shared Momentum: Shiba Inu’s meme-driven surge attracts retail attention, and PayDax is primed to capture that capital rotation as traders search for the next exponential play. In simple terms: if Shiba Inu sparks the flame, PayDax (PDP) is ready to carry it forward into the next parabolic rally. Parabolic Rally In 2 Weeks? The Window For PayDax (PDP) Is Now The next two weeks could define portfolios. Experts are united in predicting a parabolic rally to $1, but while Shiba Inu sparks interest on charts, PayDax (PDP) offers a realistic pathway to sustained profits. A $500 allocation into PayDax (PDP) at the presale price of $0.015, if the projected $1 target is achieved, grows to $33,333 — a +6,566% return. With the presale’s 80% bonus code PD80BONUS, that outcome pushes to $60,000 from the same $500. Referral rewards add another layer of upside. An investor introducing a participant who commits $1,000 secures over 3,300 PDP tokens. Alongside this, PayDax enables yield farming, where staked tokens earn passive returns that accumulate over time. Even modest yields of 20% annually could add thousands of tokens, further amplifying portfolio value. Beyond farming, the PayDax ecosystem includes a lending platform that allows tokens to generate interest while appreciating. This mix of presale bonuses, referral programs, farming, and lending creates a layered profit model with greater upside potential than traditional single-revenue cryptocurrencies. Knowing this, the question remains: will you chase Shiba Inu’s $1 hype and risk another volatile ride, or will you secure PayDax now and stand at the front of a more stable potential parabolic rally to $1?

Market experts, analyzing various indicators and momentum, anticipate a substantial price surge that could potentially reach the $1 mark soon. Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu's recent market behavior is illustrated vividly with the chart below, displaying a breakout from a prolonged downward trend, hinting at an upcoming substantial price increase. Here's a glimpse of the chart that has many traders talking: Linking to the chart's details, traders highlighted this development on social platforms here . Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen over 6% growth in the past week, and given its track record, this uptick could potentially evolve into a much larger gain. However, it's worth noting the inherent volatility in meme-driven assets like SHIB, as shown in the following volatility chart: On the other hand, PayDax takes a more structured approach, beginning its financial journey at $0.015 during its presale phase, and aiming for a robust rally backed by well-thought-out strategies and mechanisms like bonuses and referrals. Investment Strategies and Potential Returns The contrasting investment outcomes between Shiba Inu and PayDax can be best understood by comparing two hypothetical investors: Investor A (Shiba Inu) Investor B (PayDax) Invests based on the breakout chart, experiences significant portfolio fluctuations due to SHIB's high volatility. Enters the market buying PDP at a low $0.015 presale price, enjoying more stability and potential upside from structured growth. Depends on market hype and viral social media activity. Leverages a strategy that includes a sound audit and methodical tokenomics. Conclusion: A New Era in Crypto Investments? Both cryptocurrencies, driven by distinct strategies and market perceptions, are poised for a potential significant rally. Shiba Inu offers the allure of quick gains due to its popularity and media presence. Conversely, PayDax positions itself as a sustainable investment with a solid foundation and lower volatility, illustrated by its strategic pre-sale offerings and bonus structures. The critical question for investors remains: will the allure of rapid gains with high risk in Shiba Inu appeal more, or will the structured and potentially steady growth of PayDax present a more attractive investment?

DGXX's growth relies on capital-intensive projects and frequent share issuance, creating significant dilution risk for shareholders despite being debt-free. The company shows early progress with initiatives like Nvidia Blackwell orders for its NeoCloud AI platform, but scale and competition remain major hurdles. Given high dilution risk, volatile crypto exposure, and unproven financials, I rate DGXX as a hold until tangible results materialize. Digi Power X ( DGXX ) is positioning itself as hybrid company, working in energy, technology and cryptocurrency sector. The company's model is based on three directions: modular Tier III certified ARMS 200 platform development, energy portfolio (~100 MW across three sites, with expansion to >200MW) and crypto mining infrastructure. From first look, this is a good diversification strategy, but then it raises the question if these segments create synergy and aren’t they chosen only as popular topics. Main DGXX narrative is growing AI and Cloud demand, which will need more data centers. They are also talking about potential of their own energy supply to centers, what in theory should lower costs and dependence on others, but these plans require a lot of capital. Their third direction – cryptocurrency mining infrastructure can generate additional revenues in cycle tops, but at the same time it is increasing risk due to crypto volatility. Even though currently DGXX declaring, that they don’t have long-term debt, but they are financing with share issuance, and this is also increasing dilution risk. Currently, they live from “future story” not from stable business, although we see first steps towards stability as in H1 2025 colocation is already generating revenues and AI DC delivery is planned on Q4 2025. AI and Cloud Recently the company has been trying to show that their talks about AI are not just empty promises. One of the moves is an order from Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) for Nvidia Blackwell systems, which will be used on their AI platform NeoCloud. It immediately caught markets attention and shares even though for short time, jumped. This was a good signal that the company is starting to move from theories to real actions. However, we should understand that order of few systems is not the same as becoming AI or Cloud market player. Bigger data centers operators are managing hundreds or thousands of server servers, while DGXX is just starting. Even though the order was a positive step and shows that the company has ambitions, this project does not prove that they are able to compete with bigger market players. Corporate Overview January2025 Tier III One of the main plans – modular Tier III colocation data center development. This decision seems logical, because worldwide AI and Cloud services demand is increasingly growing. And growing demand for calculation power and storage infrastructure, many companies choose to rent a place in certified data centers without needing to build their own. This makes other companies save on costs, and at the same time gives business for players like DGXX. Tier III standard means that data centers will be very reliable, even with technical difficulties they will be able to continue their operations. And this is very important for DGXX clients, because businesses want reliability and stability but are not ready to pay for Tier IV. This position is very attractive, DGXX is aiming for growing mid class segment, and I see a lot of potential there. Currently, the market is very competitive. For example, Equinix or Digital Realty are already in the market, and they have scale advantages. Plus, data center development is a capital heavy venture: infrastructure, licensing, maintenance and so on. And currently, DGXX is financing this through share issuance. Corporate Overview January2025 Energy Integration Narrative The company is not only creating data centers, but they are building their own energy source. From first impression, to me this was a good idea, but then I thought, doesn’t this make them jack of all trades? Yes, having their own energy solution could decrease costs and increase margins, additionally that would cut dependency on external providers and could help with energy spot price volatility, which in recent years became common problem in Europe and US. Again, these types of projects require a lot of investment. Energy projects cost a lot of money, and their ROI is very long, and for micro-caps like DGXX that could become a burden. Again, I believe that this type of project is good but also increases risk of dilution. Corporate Overview January2025 Crypto The fourth DGXX activities direction is crypto mining infrastructure. The management is trying to show that they can make additional revenues from crypto cycles. But this is where I see a lot of issues. It looks good on paper as a diversifying tool – when market experiences a bull run, mining activities could give revenue some boos and increase liquidity. This is an option that gives DGXX additional growth potential if Bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies start to rise. But crypto has negative aspects as well. They are highly volatile, and mining infrastructure is capital heavy, rapidly going out of date technology. Equipment today could be effective, and after few years it could generate losses due to competition or technological advances. Another risky part with crypto currencies is narrative. As I mentioned, the company looks like jack of all trades, and having exposure as investor to crypto, when you wanted AI and data centers is quite dangerous. Seeking Alpha Financial Health DGXX is saying that they do not have a debt (long-term) and it gives them flexibility. But further growth and capital-intensive projects are making them regularly go to investors and do a share issuance. For example, in July 2025. DGXX attracted $15 million through direct offering, selling 4,807, 693 shares for $3.12 each. After this issuance DGXX says they have more than $30 million cash and equivalents and still don’t have debt. In Q2 2025 they additionally attracted $6.6 million through private issuance and $4.5 million through warrants. Even more through ATM program which already has issued 806291 shares with average price of $2.13. We can take a look at smaller example, agreement with NANO Nuclear Energy, they will issue 109677 (subordinated voting shares) as compensation for $250000 debts. Even though this emission is smaller, still it adds up to dilution and shows that they are not afraid to dilute existing shareholders. What does it say about them? The company is announcing debt free, but financing operations through investors, which indeed lowers financial risk due to interest rates for the company, but the risk for investors increases. Seeking Alpha Valuation To evaluate DGXX is very hard task, because they are working in three different segments – data centers, energy projects and crypto infrastructure. Most of the time, companies like these are evaluated by their business stability, cash flow prognosis and peer comparison, but sadly, I can valuate only looking at peer comparison and speculate on potential fair price. If we look at the peer comparison table, we can see that based on multiples the market is fragmented, and investors are mostly investing into “future story” Seeking Alpha DGXX currently is traded at P/S (TTM) 2.51 and EV/Sales 3.33, P/B 3.59, we can compare it to: IDN has P/S ~4.72 and EV/Sales ~4.48 – so DGXX looking cheaper based on these. ZENV with EV/Sales ~2.01 or P/S ~0.34 valued lower, because market has less trust in it’s growth story. NVNI stands near ZENV – EV/Sales ~2.51, P/S ~0.72. We can see that DGXX is somewhere in the middle, it’s more expensive than burnt names (ZENV, NVNI), but cheaper than those that already showed results ((IDN)). This company is in many segments so, as I said, it’s hard to tie it to one sector average. If investors started valuation DGXX as IDN, share price from current $2.62 could go up to around $4.90-5.00 and that would be ~90% upside. And if they could create a stronger data center proof of concept, the market could give it EV/Sales of around 6x, then fair price would be $6.00-6.50 (130-150% upside potential). P/S Implied Price Upside/Downside % Bear (ZENV/NVNI levels) 0.7 0.73 -72.1 Base (Current DGXX) 2.51 2.62 0 Upside (IDN levels) 4.7 4.91 87.3 Bull (Higher premium) 6 6.26 139 Yet, the numbers of upside always look good. Downside is big as well. If we compare it to ZENV or NVNI, which are currently traded at 0.3-0.7 P/S, the fair value could dip to $0.8-1.20, and that would be -55-70% downside. DGXX current valuation is based on trust, not financials. And currently it is expensive, I would be willing to buy when they start showing financial results, not only promises. Summary In short, the risks I see are: Regular share issuance and big dilution risk. Big capital needs (Tier III centers, energy, crypto) Crypto segment is very volatile and could wash the capital away Big competition from other market giants Catalysts: First Tier III colocation center start. New AI/Could orders Energetic integration which would lower costs. Hopefully, crypto rally which would increase revenue in short term. Today DGXX is typical ""future story"" stock, they have three different directions that I feel could stretch their resources. In recent months, they showed us some good moves, like order of Nvidia Blackwell for AI platform ""NeoCloud"", but current scale is not enough. Colocation market is growing, but it is capital heavy and in theory those energy projects we talked could help with the costs. Crypto part of the business is risky and makes me look at the company sceptically, maybe it's my bias against crypto. Financing is mostly done by share issuance, which dilutes shareholders and that is risky too. Due to risk to reward ratio, I am rating this stock as hold.",DGXX|DGX:CA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-04 10:30:08

However, it remains speculative as to whether the premier cryptocurrency will maintain this early October momentum to put in a new all-time-high price, or experience a major correction into deeper liquidity zones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Trap Over? Pundit Reveals Where The Market Is At Right Now Bitcoin Key Levels To Watch: Rally’s Challenge Lies At $125k Resistance In an X post on October 3, key opinion leader (KOL) Ted Pillows shared that Bitcoin is once again approaching critical price levels, backed by data showing trader activity. Pillows based this analysis on the Order Book Heatmap metric, which shows the amount or quantity of pending buy and sell orders at specific price levels on different exchanges. The indicator shows horizontal coloured bands at those price levels, with the colors representing clusters of orders resting around those zones. According to the KOL, Bitcoin has a high amount of sell orders packed around the $125,000 price level. Usually, a zone such as this with clusters of sell orders could act as strong resistance for the price. Interestingly, Ted also cited the presence of a significant amount of buy orders to the downside of the price, specifically around $119,500 and $117,500. As is intuitively obvious, these orders could act as solid support if the flagship cryptocurrency were to experience a correction to this level. Related Reading: BNB Cup-And-Handle Breakout Powers Past $1,050, A Move To $1,100 Next? Cautionary Market Outlook For Bitcoin In a separate X post, Pillows also shares more insights concerning Bitcoin’s price action and what to watch out for in a potential downswing. Notably, the analyst expected Bitcoin to see an accumulation around the $120,000 price level before surging to around $124,000, a prediction that has since played out, leading to a minor retracement. In analyzing the important immediate support levels, the crypto pundit highlighted the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA20), which is currently near $118,447 as a vital threshold. According to Pillows, if Bitcoin holds above this level, the broader trend (which is currently bullish) will most likely be retained. On the other hand, a break below the 30-day Moving Average (MA30), currently around $116,415, may be ominous for the cryptocurrency. The KOL explained that this situation could open the door to “a larger correction toward $112k-$113k,” as more liquidity will be sought after. Therefore, the market remains in a state of anticipation to see if Bitcoin tests its higher resistance at $125,000 or slips back into lower zones to test its support zones. If Bitcoin were to break out of its current resistance zone, the market could see the continuation of its already impressive upward rally into previously uncharted territory. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $122,100, with a fair growth of about 1.6% in the past day.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the parties are in talks to raise at least $200 million. This funding will be used to stock Tether's tokenized gold product, XAUt. Tether issues USDT, the world's largest stablecoin, while Beijing-based Bitmain supplies about 82% of global cryptocurrency mining hardware. Antalpha is a financial services company that works closely with Bitmain. Cohen & Co. is advising on the deal.

Olguin, has reportedly dismissed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs, the blockchain technology company that created the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs collection. The dismissal followed the judge’s ruling that these digital collectibles did not qualify as securities. According to him, the Bored Ape NFTs did not meet several requirements to determine whether financial transactions involving them are considered securities. Judge Olguin was appointed by former US President Barack Obama in 2013. Judge Olguin ruled that Bored Ape NFTs are not securities In his Thursday, October 2 ruling, Olguin pointed out that Bored Ape NFTs differed from other NFT collections previously recognized as securities. Examples of these NFTs include Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot NFTs and DraftKings NFTs. He highlighted this difference mainly because investors prefer to purchase Bored Apes from third-party marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Coinbase, rather than acquiring them directly from the NFT issuer’s marketplace. The federal judge had also discovered that Bored Ape NFTs did not meet the necessary “common enterprise” aspect of the test used to establish an asset as a security. He explained that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate any important relationship between the alleged securities and the proprietary ‘ecosystem’ that supported the case of Dapper Labs and DraftKings. This, therefore, led him to conclude that they had not clearly illustrated a horizontal connection. Another thing that the judge uncovered was that Yuga Labs charges a royalty fee to creators on every sale of Bored Apes. This indicated a difference between the fortunes of the plaintiffs and those of the defendants. This meant that the defendants could still gain profit even if the plaintiffs sold their own NFTs at a loss. These royalties are one of the primary sources of income for NFT creators. To break this down, they earn a built-in fee, mostly over 10%, each time their collectible tokens are sold or traded. Notably, these arguments raised by the judge differ significantly from those employed by the SEC during the Biden administration. Based on those from the SEC, the creator royalties suggested that an asset is a security, as it was designed to be resold by its creators. The SEC ends their lengthy investigation into the NFTs space amid Trump’s pro-crypto stance Yuga Labs has been fighting the federal government for several years about whether NFTs are securities, largely because it is one of the biggest players in this space. While Bored Ape NFTs have cooled off and depreciated in value and cultural significance, they have still racked up a remarkable $7.2 billion in trading volume since their launch in 2021. Concerning the situation, the company mentioned earlier this year that the SEC had concluded its long investigation into its operations as part of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance. The SEC also ended a similar investigation into NFT marketplace OpenSea . It is one thing for the commission to opt not to pursue enforcement against certain NFT projects, but it is a different situation when a federal court issues a clear ruling, as it did in Yuga’s case this week. Despite this significant ruling, Bored Ape NFTs look largely the same.

With Coinbase, Coin Center, and other influential voices providing testimony, the hearing is joining mounting momentum for tax reforms like exemptions for small transactions and fairer treatment of staking rewards. When the game's rules loosen, history shows liquidity finds its way to projects with the most compelling mix of adoption, speculation, and infrastructure. Right now, four tokens stand out as the ones to watch. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Early-Stage Asymmetric Play If XRP, ETH, and SOL are institutional favorites, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is where retail traders rush for life-changing upside. At just $0.0022 in Stage 13 of presale, it sold over 93% of the token allocated for the current stage, leaving only about 1.2 billion tokens. The presale listing price is $0.003, providing early buyers with a guaranteed upside before it even reaches exchanges. Here’s why easing U.S. rules matters: presale tokens like LILPEPE often struggle with exchange access and compliance barriers. If regulators clear the runway, listings on the top U.S. platforms become realistic. Easier listings could spark viral momentum for a meme coin boasting a CertiK audit, 40,000+ investors, and giveaways worth $777K plus 15 ETH . Buying into LILPEPE is straightforward: it’s available directly on the project’s presale portal using ETH or USDT. Once listings hit major CEXs in late 2025, liquidity will broaden, but so will entry prices. Ripple (XRP) Predictions: Analysts Eye $10 by Year-End XRP has always been the bridge between old finance and new rails, and 2025 may be its most pivotal year yet. At its current range of nearly $3.10, a run to $10 by Halloween, as projected by Elon Musk’s Grok AI and shared by Uphold exchange, would mean more than a 3x move. The potential drivers are straightforward but powerful. Rulings on spot XRP ETF applications are expected by October, and Ripple’s pending U.S. banking charter application could legitimize the project in ways few cryptos can match. Grok’s alternate timelines — Christmas or New Year’s Eve for the $10 target- highlight how seriously analysts take this setup. Ethereum (ETH): Solid but Tempered Growth Ethereum (ETH) fluctuates between $4,170 and $4,200, lower by around 7–8% for the week but still firmly entrenched as the foundation of DeFi and smart contracts. The $4,070 level is the one to hold on to; if it breaks, ETH can slide towards $3,800 support. The bullish side expects ETH to regain $5,000 or more if DeFi and scaling demand increase. But here’s the caveat: Ethereum’s size and maturity make 5x or 10x moves far less likely in the short term. For investors, ETH offers stability and institutional confidence — an anchor play rather than a moonshot. Solana Treasury Growth Brings Institutional Spotlight Some heavyweight names have been building their Solana stacks quietly but aggressively in the past few months. Brera Holdings (rebranded as Solmate) kicked things off with a $300 million Solana fund, backed by ARK Invest, Pulsar Group, and the Solana Foundation. Not long after, DeFi Development Corp. disclosed holdings of more than 2 million SOL, worth nearly half a billion dollars, and pledged to keep raising its SOL-per-share ratio. The biggest splash came from Forward Industries, which outlined plans to allocate $4 billion to Solana. Price action is tracking this story: SOL touched $250 recently, with analysts targeting $260–$300 near term and $460 longer term. At a $133B market cap, Solana is no longer a speculative side project; it’s a treasury asset. Final Word The U.S. softening its stance on crypto companies could reshape 2025. Institutional flows will chase stability, but retail money often drives the wildest multipliers. If history repeats, LILPEPE could be the meme engine that turns relaxed regulations into the next 100x story. The presale is still live, but stages are moving fast. This might be the last time to buy under $0.003 for those chasing the next Solana-like breakout.

This session aims to explore adjustments in taxation rules, potentially impacting how cryptocurrencies are treated under U.S. laws. Influential entities like Coinbase and Coin Center will be among those giving testimonies, emphasizing the need for clearer tax guidelines and fairer treatment for various crypto transactions. The prospect of eased regulations is creating a buzz around several cryptocurrencies, suggesting a reevaluation of investment potentials. Here’s an exploration into four crypto tokens that might benefit substantially from these regulatory adjustments. Ripple (XRP): A Bridge to Traditional Finance Ripple’s XRP has long been viewed as a conduit between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology. With a U.S. banking charter potentially on the horizon and the anticipation of favorable rulings on XRP ETFs, the token is expected to see significant movements. If predictions hold, XRP could reach as high as $10 by the end of the year, influenced by its integration into conventional finance and potential new applications. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth Amidst Volatility Though Ethereum has seen a slight dip in its price, it remains a cornerstone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Holding at prices around $4,170 to $4,200, the stability of Ethereum may attract more conservative investors who prefer less volatile assets. The future growth of Ethereum could be stimulated by increased demand for DeFi applications and scaling solutions, maintaining its position as a foundational asset in the crypto space. Solana (SOL): Institutional Interest and Financial Commitments Solana’s recent price movements and the heavy investments into its ecosystem highlight its growing acceptance among institutional investors. With major commitments from entities like Brera Holdings and Forward Industries, Solana is steadily becoming a popular choice for large-scale investment portfolios, further cementing its role as a significant player in the blockchain arena. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Potential for Explosive Growth Among the newer entrants, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as a high-potential token, especially in the presale phase. With a significant portion of its tokens already sold in the ongoing presale, LILPEPE offers an attractive pre-market buy at $0.0022 per token, an appealing prospect for those looking to get in early before it lists on exchanges at a higher price. The anticipated relaxation in U.S. crypto regulations could facilitate easier listings on prominent exchanges, potentially enabling LILPEPE to capture viral growth. For those interested in the dynamics of meme-driven cryptocurrencies, LILPEPE also features promotional giveaways, including a $777K giveaway and 15 ETH giveaway , enhancing its appeal. Final Thoughts and Further Information The potential easing of U.S. crypto regulations could mark a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency sector. While institutional investors may lean towards more stable assets, the retail sector could drive significant growth in newer or less conventional tokens such as LILPEPE. As the scene evolves, these tokens could present unique opportunities for savvy investors.

Gemini AI recently projected that Dogecoin (DOGE) might reach $1 by Christmas 2025. That would be a remarkable climb from where it is now. Yet many early investors are looking elsewhere. A newcomer, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is showing momentum that could deliver gains of 10,372%, potentially taking the token from its current presale price of $0.0022 to $0.22 in the coming cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE) — The Veteran Meme Coin Eyes $1 Dogecoin remains the original meme coin that continues to move the market whenever Elon Musk tweets or the internet buzzes. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.23 according to data on CoinMarketCap . Gemini’s optimistic forecast of $1 by Christmas 2025 implies a more than 400% increase from today’s level. While DOGE has brand recognition and a loyal community, it has been slow to add fresh utility beyond tipping and payments. Analysts note that the push to $1 depends heavily on broader adoption by merchants and favorable market sentiment. The potential is there, but the path is far from certain. DOGE price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — A Newcomer Built for Scale Unlike Dogecoin, Little Pepe has positioned itself as more than just a meme play. The project is creating a Layer 2 network dedicated to meme tokens, featuring ultra-low fees and faster transactions, which appeal to both traders and developers. At the time of writing, the LILPEPE presale is in Stage 13 with tokens selling for $0.0022. The presale has raised $26,348,854 out of a $28,775,000 target and has already sold more than 16.1 billion tokens out of the planned 17.25 billion for this stage, which means it is 93.61% filled. The price recently climbed about 10% from $0.0021 to $0.0022, rewarding early buyers. Those who entered at Stage 1 have already seen gains of roughly 120% while new investors at Stage 13 could still benefit from a projected 36.36% upside by the time the token launches at $0.0030. Little Pepe has also passed a Certik audit and is now listed on CoinMarketCap, key steps that add transparency and trust. The Team is running a $777,000 giveaway and a Mega Giveaway offering more than 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. Comparing the Two Meme Coins Dogecoin’s $1 forecast sounds exciting, but it represents a 4 to 5x increase at best from its current price. In contrast, LILPEPE starts at a much lower base and could see significantly higher percentage gains if it meets its projected goals. A move from $0.0022 to $0.22 would represent an eye-catching 10,372% jump, although it remains speculative and subject to market risks. What sets Little Pepe apart is not just its presale buzz but also its focus on building a utility-driven ecosystem for meme projects, featuring zero transaction tax and anti-bot protections. These structural elements suggest that it is thinking about long-term growth rather than a short-lived meme rally. The Bottom Line Gemini AI’s view that DOGE could reach $1 by the end of 2025 highlights the enduring influence of established meme coins. Still, the higher percentage growth potential seems to lie with Little Pepe , which, at the time of writing, is priced at $0.0022 in its Stage 13 presale. With early buyers already up by 120% and room for another 36.36% rise before launch, the project has drawn significant investor attention. If its Layer 2 network takes off and the community continues to expand, LILPEPE could be the meme coin story to watch, one that has a speculative path to a 10,372% surge from its current level. Investors intrigued by its momentum can learn more or join the presale through the Little Pepe website or its active Telegram group.

Gemini AI's recent forecast that Dogecoin could hit $1 by Christmas 2025 has sparked discussions about its potential and limitations. Dogecoin's Journey Towards $1 Dogecoin remains a flagship meme coin, often influenced by social media and celebrity endorsements. Currently trading at around $0.23, as indicated by CoinMarketCap , it faces a challenging path to reach the $1 mark, needing broader merchant adoption and favorable market conditions to achieve over a 400% increase. Despite its challenges, Dogecoin's strong community and brand recognition make it a significant player in the meme coin market. Rise of Little Pepe: The New Contender Contrasting with Dogecoin's established brand, Little Pepe is a new entrant poised for potential exponential growth. Starting from a presale price of just $0.0022, forecasts suggest a possible surge up to $0.22, marking an impressive 10,372% increase. The coin aims to create a Layer 2 network catering specifically to meme tokens, which could help it achieve rapid growth due to lower transaction fees and faster processing times. Investment Insights: Weighing Potential against Risk When comparing Dogecoin and Little Pepe, investors should consider both the potential returns and the risks. While Dogecoin offers a more stable, albeit slower growth trajectory, Little Pepe could either skyrocket, thanks to its novel infrastructure, or face hurdles typical of new cryptocurrencies. Both coins feature distinct dynamics that can appeal to different types of investors depending on their risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the best choice for traders and early users who want to invest in a DeFi project with structured growth and measurable token demand. MUTM is being built with real-world use cases, clear protocol mechanics, and predictable revenue pathways that make it stand out as a presale chance. Beta launch and Layer-2 scaling to drive adoption Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 presale at $0.035, with over 55% of the 170 million token allocation already claimed. The phase has raised approximately $16.8 million and counts more than 16,750 holders. Phase 7 will step the price up 15% to $0.040, making this one of the last discounted entry points for early participants. The team has announced that the lending and borrowing protocol is under development, with V1 targeting Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and supporting initial assets such as ETH and USDT. This structured rollout ensures investors will have early access to functioning protocol mechanics, not just speculative promise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that is meant to make lending and borrowing easier and more flexible. The project gives users many ways to manage their crypto assets, get liquidity, and make yield by combining Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with a Peer-to-Peer marketplace. Early users will be able to actively test the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending and borrowing model, as well as the mtToken staking and automated liquidation functions, when the beta start comes around. This hands-on proof-of-concept will show that MUTM is a real product that can be used. It will appeal to both individual users and investors looking for a steady return. Unlike many altcoins that come out without working systems, MUTM will have real use from the start, which will increase demand. By making transactions faster and cheaper compared to standard Layer-1 protocols, Layer-2 integration will speed up adoption even more. Because MUTM is cheaper and more efficient, more people will be able to give and borrow money through it, from small investors to treasury-level participants. Protocol income will come from daily activity and loan use. This revenue will then pay for staking rewards and open-market buybacks, creating a demand cycle that feeds on itself. The addition of a native stablecoin will provide an extra source of value by providing a safe way to give and borrow money. MUTM will be linked to active economic flows in the ecosystem. This way, protocol use will determine token demand instead of gambling alone. Exchange listings, community engagement, and ROI potential MUTM’s liquidity and visibility will increase as a result of upcoming Tier-1 exchange listings, which will make it easier for both retail and institutional users to join the market and facilitate smoother price discovery. As more platforms make MUTM available, more trades will happen. This will make it easier for the protocol to make a lot of money and raise demand for the token. Community-focused tools like the dashboard ROI calculator and Top 50 leaderboard will encourage participation by giving extra MUTM tokens to people who use them a lot. These parts make users want to keep interacting with the protocol, which strengthens the feedback loop. More activity leads to more staking benefits and price support based on demand. Early investors are positioned to capture significant upside. For example, purchasing 20,000 MUTM tokens at $0.035 with a $700 investment could reach $20,000 value if the token hits the projected $1 target. With Phase 6 nearly 60% sold and Phase 7 scheduled to step the price 15% higher to $0.040, early participants will secure maximum leverage before wider market entry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few projects that has affordable presale prices, useful DeFi mechanics, Layer-2 efficiency, and a roadmap for real adoption. When traders look at the prices of cryptocurrencies right now, they will see that this is a great time to get into both a new altcoin and a protocol whose use will keep demand high. If investors act now, they will get instant gains from the Phase 7 price change as well as long-term gains from token utility and staking rewards. This makes MUTM the best alt-season opportunity before the price goes up because more people know about it.

People say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best choice because it combines presale momentum, DeFi lending mechanics, and Layer-2 efficiency to provide returns that are measured and go beyond speculative trends. Cardano (ADA) In the past, ADA was thought to be a trustworthy platform for smart contracts, but its roadmap growth has been slower than expected. Many of its more advanced features have delayed release processes, which makes them less useful for lenders and borrowers who want to know what the yields will be. Even though ADA still has network value and market trust, investors who want to see a real return on their investment from active DeFi participation may not be interested in it because it has limited on-chain yield mechanics. Ripple (XRP) XRP is still being looked at closely by regulators, which affects how the market feels and how many people use it. Even though it has a strong cross-border payment infrastructure, XRP isn’t very useful for loans, borrowing, or staking compared to new DeFi platforms. The token’s limits are less appealing to investors who want consistent, protocol-generated income, especially when compared to platforms that offer structured yield, staking, and token buyback loops. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. Approximately $16.8 million has been raised in this phase, with 55% of the 170 million token allocation sold. The project has over 16,750 holders, and the total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens. Phase 7 will increase the price to $0.040 (+15%), representing the last discounted entry. The team has confirmed development of its lending and borrowing protocol , with Sepolia Testnet V1 scheduled for Q4 2025. Core components include a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. A dual lending approach is used by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Blue-chip coins like ETH and BNB are accepted by Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools. Stablecoins like USDC and DAI are also accepted. People who deposit money get mtTokens that reflect their shares, and the interest rates change based on how much of the pool is being used. In peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, loans for riskier assets can be discussed. This keeps core pools stable by separating volatile assets from them. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a utility-first loan system with many demand drivers. Speculative interest will turn into active platform users when the beta launch happens. This will increase the total value locked and prove that the real yield processes work. Scaling up to Layer-2 will lower friction, letting businesses, funds, and regular users borrow and give money more than once, while also lowering costs compared to Layer-1 protocols. Additionally, issuing stablecoins tied to overcollateralized debt will create a steady demand for borrowing, with fees used to pay for buybacks and staking payouts, creating a demand cycle that feeds on itself. Security and community engagement further bolster confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a CertiK audit (Manual Review + Static Analysis; Token Scan 90.00; Skynet 79.00). A $50,000 USDT bug bounty incentivizes reporting across critical, major, medium, and low severity issues. The project also runs a $100,000 ongoing giveaway and engages holders via a dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard to monitor ROI and leaderboard rewards. Those who bought early already see a big gain. They now have 500,000 MUTM tokens after buying $5,000 worth of MUTM at $0.01. Given the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, that investment is now worth $17,500, a 3.5x increase. The holding would be worth $105,000, which is 21x what it was in Phase 6 and 210x what it was when it was first bought if the goal price is 500%, which is about $0.21. It looks like MUTM is on the right track with beta usage, Layer-2 efficiency, and listing on a Tier-1 exchange. Most of the time, Phase 6 has been sold. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15%, to $0.040. To find out their return on investment (ROI), investors should connect their wallets to the dashboard. This way, they can see where they stand in the rankings and move up before the next price increase. Early users should look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead of ADA, which is stuck, and XRP, which is limited by rules. It’s useful and has a measured chance of making money.

IPOX boss Joseph Schuster said the decision was more of a strategic, company-specific move, adding that it was no surprise after raising $ 1.1 billion. The AI chipmaker respectfully requested to withdraw its Company Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the U.S. SEC in September last year. Cerebras asked the Commission to grant the withdrawal order immediately, pursuant to Rules 418, 457 (p), and 477 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Nvidia competitor raised $1.1 billion on September 30, doubling its valuation to $8.1 billion, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Cerebras Systems CEO Andrew Feldman claimed it was the largest raise in the category and the highest valuation backed by “the best investors.” Feldman insists the company will still go public The Cerebras top executive said the company was still set on going public, rather than continuing with venture capital raises. He added that the IPO withdrawal did not indicate the company’s long-term preference. However, Feldman believes the initial prospectus from last September is outdated, considering the significant advancements the company has made in AI. One of Cerebras’ spokespersons also pointed out that the recent government shutdown did not influence the company’s decision to withdraw its IPO. “I think we have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and I think it’s good practice, when you have enormous opportunities, not to let them fall by the wayside for lack of capital.” ~ Andrew Feldman , CEO at Cerebras The AI chipmaker has reportedly shifted focus from selling systems since its original filing requesting to go public on the Nasdaq. The company leans more toward cloud service provision and accepting incoming queries to models using its chips. Cerebras’ 2025 IPO probability drops by 1% According to Kalshi data, the market for “Who will IPO in 2025” implied a 17% chance of a Cerebras 2025 IPO, a drop from the previous 18% probability. Kalshi reported over 60K in volume over the past 24 hours for this market. The market currently has a volume of over 283,000, with over 77,000 open positions, and overall liquidity stands at over 3.2 million contracts. The company’s IPO prospects began to encounter obstacles shortly after it filed for a Nasdaq listing in the previous year. Cerebras initially faced criticism from the public, who were concerned that it would be overly reliant on a single Middle Eastern firm, G42. The AI chipmaker encountered a setback when it sought clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Department of the Treasury. However, private market investors have continued to hold bullish sentiments about the company despite the prolonged IPO delay. Feldman said the backing from private market investors was strong enough to double the company’s valuation from $4 billion in 2021 to over $8 billion in 2025. The CEO also pointed out the benefits of having investors “who everybody would be proud of” as the cornerstone to any company’s IPO. He asserted that the “new money” will allow for an expansion in U.S. AI chip manufacturing. The company reportedly plans to hire more workers to focus on production as demand increases. Feldman said the company has increased its manufacturing capacity eight times over the past 18 months and is seeking another four times increase in the next six to eight months. According to Cryptopolitan, Cerebras’ recent funding will expand its Inference Service and continue innovation in AI supercomputers and AI chip design. The company has vowed to expand its manufacturing footprint and data center capacity in the U.S. ahead of its IPO. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The reason is easy to understand: Ethereum (ETH) is fully developed, but MUTM is still in pre-sale and has a lot of room to grow. Its model of lending, borrowing, and staking includes features that are meant to appeal to both individual and business users. Lending, borrowing, and real yield mechanics MUTM is in Phase 6 of its presale at the time of writing. Each coin is worth $0.035, and more than 16,750 people have already bought them. The project has already raised $16.8 million. More than half of the 170 million tokens that were set aside for this part have already been bought. Time is running out because the next stage will raise the price by 15% to $0.040. This is your last chance to buy MUTM tokens for less than four cents. The estimated listing price is $0.06. This means that early investors who bought at $0.01 in Phase 1 already have a 3.5x paper gain, which will grow to 6x when the company goes public. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has confirmed that its core lending and borrowing protocol will roll out first on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, with ETH and USDT enabled for lending, borrowing, and collateralization. The platform will operate under two models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) is a system where lenders put assets like stablecoins and well-known tokens like ETH and XRP into smart contracts that have been checked. Interest rates will change based on usage, which will make sure that cash is used efficiently. People who give money will get mtTokens in return. These tokens increase in value over time and can also be used as collateral. For instance, an ETH owner who deposits 10 ETH, which is about $30,000, will make an estimated 14% APY, which is $4,200 a year in passive income. Ethereum (ETH) has a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which means that a person can put up $1,500 worth of ETH as collateral and borrow $1,125 right away. Traders will be able to get liquidity without selling their long-term stocks thanks to this structure. This flexibility has generated a lot of interest during times of market volatility. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans for more volatile tokens like PEPE and DOGE will also be possible through Mutuum Finance (MUTM). In this model, lenders and borrowers discuss terms one-on-one, so there is no shared risk. Lenders take on more risk, but they could make more money, and the way the system is set up keeps instability away from the major liquidity pools. Collateralization is an important part of the platform. Stable assets, such as ETH and the most popular stablecoins, will be able to handle up to 75% LTV and liquidation levels close to 80%. On the other hand, dangerous tokens will only be able to handle 35–55% LTV and liquidation levels closer to 65%. This protects against sudden drops in price and makes sure that the system will still work even if there is a coin crash today. Discounts will be given to liquidators who help settle positions that are in trouble, and reserve factors that range from 10% for safer assets to as high as 55% for volatile tokens will make the pools even healthier. Building trust while presale momentum accelerates The presale momentum is being matched with strong infrastructure planning. Investors are being given the ability to track holdings and calculate ROI through a user dashboard that connects directly to wallets. A Top 50 leaderboard is also being introduced, rewarding the largest investors with bonus MUTM tokens. Security is being prioritized with a CertiK audit already underway, boasting a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. To reinforce community confidence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced a $50,000 bug bounty program with rewards ranging from $200 for low-level discoveries to $2,000 for critical findings. In parallel, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway will reward ten early believers with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Many traders are excited not only about how loans and borrowing work, but also about the way prices are going up, which seems to be similar to how Ethereum (ETH) was growing in its early stages. If a buyer joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 1 at $0.01, they are already up 250% by Phase 6’s $0.035. It goes up in value by 500% when it goes public at $0.06, which is an impressive result that would stand out in any crypto investor’s portfolio. Ethereum (ETH) will almost double in value if it hits $10,000 next year, while analysts have already started to imagine how MUTM could reach $1 with the help of exchange listings and user usage. As work speeds up on it, the beta launch and integrations on big exchanges like Kraken and MEXC will make it available to more people. More liquidity and visibility will bring in more borrowers, lenders, and stakers to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which will increase demand for MUTM coins. Phase 6 is now more than half sold out, so buyers have one last chance to buy MUTM tokens for less than $0.04. The 15% rise into Phase 7 is set in stone, and exchange triggers are still to come. Traders now see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best Ethereum (ETH) option on the market right now because of its strong pre-sale support, well-thought-out protocol design, and clear growth drivers.

Ethereum price near $4,515 with key support at $3,876 and resistance at $4,955 Analyst Donald Dean cites volume shelves and Fibonacci retracements pointing to $5,766 and $6,658 upside targets. Trading volume and a recent double-bottom pattern shape near-term bias; a drop below $3,876 risks bearish continuation. Ethereum price outlook: $4,515 now, watch $4,955 breakout for targets to $5,766 and $6,658 — read the technical roadmap and trading implications. Ethereum trades at $4,515 as analysts highlight $5,766 targets, with support at $3,876 and resistance at $4,955 shaping its next move. Ethereum holds momentum above $4,500 as traders eye $5,766, with strong support near $3,876 and resistance around $4,955. Donald Dean highlights Ethereum’s recovery, pointing to volume shelves and Fibonacci levels that frame its bullish path ahead. Ethereum’s breakout potential rests on $4,955 resistance, with upside targets at $5,766 and $6,658 shaping trader sentiment. Ethereum’s price action has drawn close attention this week as traders watch key technical levels. On October 3, Ethereum traded at $4,515.89 against the US dollar on Coinbase. The token slipped by $32.79, marking a 0.73% decline. However, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s next leg higher. Donald Dean, an analyst on X, stated, “Ethereum has made good upward progress once support was confirmed at the $3800 level. Currently ETH is at the volume shelf launch area near $4500 and ready to move higher. Next target is $5766 for an ETH to BTC 50% retracement.” His outlook highlights a clear technical roadmap that many traders are monitoring. What is the current Ethereum price outlook? Ethereum price is trading around $4,515 with a short-term range defined by support at $3,876 and resistance at $4,955. A confirmed breakout above $4,955 would target the 50% Fibonacci level at $5,766 and the 61.8% level at $6,658, while a drop below $3,876 would signal renewed downside risk. How are price levels and volume shelves shaping ETH’s next moves? Volume shelves at $3,876.53 and the current range indicate concentrated liquidity and institutional interest. The market formed a double-bottom near support, which added buying pressure. Volume-assisted rallies from those shelves historically validate breakouts; traders use these zones to set stop-loss and take-profit orders. Price Action and Key Levels Ethereum has displayed a strong recovery since July, climbing along a teal ascending trendline. Prices rallied sharply and peaked near $4,955.90 in early August. That high remains a critical resistance zone. However, after reaching this peak, Ethereum slipped into a consolidation phase with increased volatility. The chart also shows a descending channel that defined price movements through September and early October. The lower boundary provided support, while the upper boundary capped upward momentum. Recently, Ethereum broke below this channel before rebounding through a double bottom pattern near support. Volume analysis further adds context. Two major volume shelves emerged — one at $3,876.53 and another near the current range. These areas show heavy trading activity and act as liquidity zones. Moreover, Ethereum’s trading range between $3,876.53 support and $4,955.90 resistance will decide near-term market direction. How do Fibonacci levels inform ETH/BTC and USD targets? Fibonacci retracement levels place the 50% retracement at $5,766, the 61.8% at $6,658, and the 100% retracement at $9,547. These levels act as logical targets if momentum resumes. For ETH/BTC, the 50% retracement noted by analysts serves as a cross-pair gauge for relative strength versus Bitcoin. Breaking above $4,955.90 resistance could trigger renewed momentum toward these retracement zones. Conversely, a drop below $3,876.53 would weaken bullish conviction and could open lower support tests. Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate support and resistance levels for Ethereum? Immediate support is at $3,876.53 and immediate resistance is at $4,955.90. These levels will likely guide short-term trading decisions and determine whether the market resumes an uptrend or returns to consolidation. How likely is an ETH breakout to $5,766? If Ethereum breaks and sustains above $4,955.90 with above-average volume, a run toward the 50% Fib at $5,766 becomes probable. Traders will look for confirmation via volume shelves and follow-through buying to validate the move. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the immediate support and resistance levels for Ethereum?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Immediate support is at $3,876.53 and immediate resistance is at $4,955.90.

While buyers are excited about this prediction, the biggest wallets in the market are quietly changing how they invest in crypto. Instead of putting all of their money into Bitcoin, they are buying tokens that are worth less than four cents. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the top targets. Whales know that assets in the pre-sale stage can bring huge gains, and the growth potential for MUTM is getting their attention. Will BTC go past 120K? Bitcoin (BTC) is now moving toward $125,000, which many traders and experts see as an important next goal. Based on past price cycles and movement, the Bitcoin Cycle Model thinks that BTC could rise to between $125K and $131K later in 2025. A new piece from CoinCentral also says that $125K will be the next big resistance level, especially if BTC keeps getting stronger above $116K. Options traders are betting on a rise toward $125K because of upcoming decisions by the US Federal Reserve. This shows that the market is very optimistic about a rally. Of course, getting to that level will rely on steady flows into ETFs, demand from institutions, and good macroeconomic conditions. The move could be stopped if it fails to break through resistance levels or if sentiment changes. Why big wallets choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At present, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale. Each token is valued at $0.035, with approximately $16.8 million raised and 55% of the 170 million tokens allocated in this stage already claimed. The next phase will lift the price to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. This has created urgency among larger investors, who recognize the difference in entry points today will matter significantly once the token lists at $0.06 and scales toward $1 in the medium term. What attracts whales to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the protocol design that blends yield generation with strong risk management. The team has already announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , which will debut on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. ETH and USDT will be the first assets supported, laying the foundation for the liquidity pools and collateral mechanisms that drive the system. It works like this: lenders put assets like BTC, ETH, and stablecoins into smart contracts that have been checked. In return, they get mtTokens, which are equal to their share of the pool and earn interest over time. As an example, a loan that gives out 0.5 BTC, which is worth about $30,000, will earn about 12% APY, which is $3,600 a year without having to sell their Bitcoin. Borrowers also benefit because they can get cash without having to sell long-term assets. A person might put up $5,000 in Bitcoin as collateral to borrow $3,750 at a 75% Loan-to-Value ratio. Overcollateralization is something that can’t be changed on the platform. Up to 75% LTV is set for stable assets like ETH and BTC, and liquidation limits are close to 80%. Riskier tokens, on the other hand, can only have LTVs between 35% and 55%, and they can only be liquidated at close to 65%. This design makes sure that the system will still work even if there is a crypto crash today. A Stability Factor is used to figure out how healthy the collateral is, and discounts are given to liquidators when stocks drop below certain levels. Because of this, the disposal process is smooth and easy to understand, which is exactly what whales want when they invest money. Another important thing is the liquidity depth. It’s important for big players to be sure that their loans and borrowing won’t be affected by slippage or low liquidity. Reserve factors help Mutuum Finance (MUTM) deal with this problem. For example, assets that are safer are set to 10%, and assets that are riskier can be set to 55%. This careful tuning makes the system more stable during market stress and builds trust among people with bigger wallets. The ROI math that attracts whales The whale plan is easy to understand: buy early, before regular investors do the same. This is already clear from Mutuum Finance (MUTM). In Phase 1, someone bought coins for $0.01. In Phase 6, the entry price went up to $0.035, which is a 250% increase in value. By the time it goes up to $0.06, that buyer will have locked in a 500% cash return. When you look at crypto charts, these numbers really stick out, especially when you compare them to Bitcoin (BTC)’s expected rise to $125K, which is less than a 10% increase from where it is now. The vision is much bigger for whales who join at $0.035. With the token’s goal of $1 by the middle of 2026, this is about a 28x gain. An important step toward that valuation is the beta launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the adoption of its lending system by institutions, and the expected listing on major exchanges like Binance or Kraken. These events will make things easier to get, make the market more open, and raise demand all over. This long-term view is strengthened by trust bonds. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going through a CertiK audit, and their Token Scan and Skynet scores of 90 and 79, respectively, show that they meet security standards. The project has started a $50,000 bug prize program to encourage people to be open about bugs. Important discoveries can earn up to $2,000, and smaller discoveries can still get paid for. Ten people will each get $10,000 in MUTM tokens as part of a $100,000 giveaway at the community level. With more than 12,000 Twitter followers, the group is growing and making progress at the same time.

A recent $2 billion USDT mint has boosted on-chain liquidity. Ethereum now holds $78.5 billion in Tether, surpassing competitors like Tron. This strengthens its role in DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and exchange liquidity. Analysts expect fresh capital inflows may support an “Uptober” rally. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) emerges as a leading PayFi altcoin. With CertiK verification, wallet beta, and crypto-to-bank features, RTX gains traction. Ethereum Price Outlook: USDT Mints Signal Uptober Momentum Ethereum price is currently $4,469. The cryptocurrency is drawing attention from institutional investors as another large USDT mint strengthens its position as the leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Ethereum now holds $78.5 billion in Tether on-chain, far surpassing competitors like Tron. Analysts say this highlights Ethereum’s key role in DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and exchange liquidity, making it the network of choice despite higher transaction costs. The new USDT mint has sparked hopes for a strong “Uptober” rally, with fresh liquidity possibly flowing into Ethereum and other significant assets. Stablecoin growth often signals upcoming market activity. Historical trends indicate that significant minting events, such as the recent $2 billion USDT creation on Ethereum, usually precede price moves as institutions and traders deploy fresh liquidity. This strengthens confidence in Ethereum’s ability to attract capital and remain central to global crypto operations, including derivative markets and institutional DeFi programs. Remittix: The Trending PayFi Altcoin Investors Are Watching While Ethereum attracts institutional attention, Remittix (RTX) continues to emerge as a top PayFi altcoin for retail and new investors. Remittix has raised over $27 million, sold more than 674 million tokens, and is currently priced at $0.1130. Its growing adoption and utility make it a strong competitor to Ethereum and other primary tokens in Q4 2025. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum #1 on CertiK: The project is fully verified, providing top-tier blockchain security. Wallet beta live: Community testers are actively engaging with the platform. Crypto-to-bank payments: Users can send crypto to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. Multi-asset support: The wallet supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and more than 30 fiat currencies. 15% USDT referral program: Early users can earn rewards, claimable daily via the dashboard. Conclusion: Why Ethereum And Remittix Could Lead Q4 Growth Ethereum’s large USDT mints and institutional flows signal strong fundamentals and potential price momentum for Uptober. Meanwhile, Remittix offers utility-focused adoption and security that could drive investor interest and real-world use. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in, combining Ethereum’s market dominance with Remittix’s PayFi capabilities offers a balanced approach to growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency space.

While XRP price movements remain steady, much attention has shifted toward Remittix , and the PayFi project is quickly climbing the charts. With close to $27 million raised and more than 674 million tokens sold, this altcoin is positioning itself as the one analysts expect could deliver gains of over 2,000% in October. XRP Price Holds Key Levels Ahead of Breakout Source: AltcoinGordon XRP news today reveals the token is building on stronger fundamentals, even as it consolidates slightly above $3. Ripple has rolled out the RLUSD stablecoin in Africa through partnerships with Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card, greatly expanding its on-demand liquidity services. The XRP Ledger has also activated the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) Standard, simplifying asset issuance and strengthening compliance, a move praised by Uphold’s Head of Research. Technically, XRP price action is nearing a decisive moment. Technical analyst Ali Martinez believes that $3.13 is the critical resistance, and a breakout could move XRP to $3.40 or even $3.60. Wider patterns indicate targets as high as $4.80 if momentum continues. As traders await confirmation of a breakout, failure to hold $2.85 could push XRP back towards $2.70. Remittix Set To Steal The Spotlight As October’s Top Altcoin While XRP price is being closely watched, investors are also eyeing Remittix , which has quickly become one of the most discussed altcoins in the PayFi space. Its growing adoption is not just speculation — it’s backed by real development milestones and a rapidly expanding community. With XRP holders diversifying into this project, experts argue that Remittix could be the altcoin that delivers the 2,000% surge traders are waiting for. Over 40,000 holders have already joined, cementing Remittix as one of the fastest-growing crypto projects live now Development of the Remittix Web App is almost complete, with crypto-to-fiat beta testing scheduled for mid-Q4 Two new CEX listings are on the horizon, adding to confirmed BitMart and LBank partnerships for greater liquidity Designed for global use, Remittix enables instant transfers to bank accounts in 30+ countries with real-time FX conversion The project has a deflationary token model, increasing scarcity and long-term investor value Why XRP and Remittix Could Dominate Q4 XRP news today highlights Ripple’s push into global banking, while Remittix is quickly becoming the PayFi project retail investors are calling the next breakout star. Both assets are shaping Q4 momentum, but for those looking at high-growth potential, Remittix’s mix of utility, exchange expansion, and strong fundraising could set it apart.

Filings indicate that on July 10, 2025, Fields purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 worth of IREN shares. The transaction, disclosed in early August, has coincided with a 196% surge in IREN’s stock over roughly three months. IREN one-week stock price chart.

For instance, among his most recent congress trades, in the days leading up to Oracle’s (NYSE: ORCL ) emergence as a key partner in the U.S. acquisition of TikTok, Fields purchased between $80,000 and $200,000 worth of Oracle stock across three trades on September 17, 18, and 23.

However, Fields has denied any wrongdoing in his stock trades. IREN’s bullish fundamentals Meanwhile, several fundamental factors have contributed to the stocks’ recent rally. Notably, IREN, formerly known as Iris Energy, has rapidly expanded its Bitcoin mining capacity, reaching 50 exahashes per second earlier this year. The company has emphasized efficiency, claiming one of the lowest production costs in the industry by leveraging renewable energy for its data centers. As Bitcoin’s price has strengthened throughout 2025, IREN’s mining margins have widened significantly. What truly ignited investor enthusiasm, however, was IREN’s pivot into artificial intelligence. Building on its data center footprint, the company has begun deploying high-end Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs, including the latest H100 and Blackwell series chips, to power cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. In August, IREN secured “preferred partner” status with the American chipmaker, a designation that provided both credibility and priority access to scarce hardware. This news, combined with strong quarterly earnings showing a 228% jump in revenue and a return to profitability, has made IREN one of the market’s hottest dual plays in crypto and AI.

In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens.

Hyperliquid is powering headlines with billion-dollar unlock debates, while Bitcoin Cash is holding firm above $560 amid a 7% rally. Yet, the true electricity in the market is radiating from BullZilla, the meme coin with a cinematic presale that is moving stages faster than whales can refresh their wallets. BullZilla is not just another meme coin; it’s a living saga among viral cryptos. With over 30 billion tokens already sold, more than $770,000 raised, and 2,500+ holders locked in, the presale is reaching fever pitch. Stages advance every 48 hours or with each $100,000 milestone hit, creating a rapid fire growth engine. Early investors are staring at a listing price of $0.00527, with current buyers in Stage 5 standing before a roaring 4327.15% ROI potential. If there was ever a moment to secure a place in the tribe, it is now. BullZilla’s Mutation Engine Turns Every Dollar Into Firepower for Viral Cryptos What separates BullZilla from every other meme coin graveyard story? The Mutation Engine. Unlike static presales, BullZilla’s progressive pricing system forces urgency: the price climbs either after $100,000 is raised or after 48 hours tick by. There’s no pause, no waiting. It’s motion engineered to punish hesitation. BullZilla Presale Snapshot Stage Price per $BZIL Raised Tokens Sold ROI at Listing $0.00527 5B $0.00011907 $770k+ 30B+ 4327.15% Consider this: at today’s Stage 5B price of $0.00011907, a $6,000 investment bags approximately 50,430,000 $BZIL tokens. By the time BullZilla lists at $0.00527, that same stash turns into $265,768. That’s the kind of portfolio-reshaping return meme coin whales dream of, and it’s happening in real time. The Mutation Engine is already speeding toward Stage 5B, where the price ticks up by another 5.60%. This stage will vanish the moment a few more big buys land. This isn’t just about presale mechanics; it’s a narrative device that makes every participant feel like they’re fueling the viral cryptos, as if they’re part of the beast. It’s why whales are entering fast and why smaller investors are scrambling to secure positions before the window slams shut. How to Buy $BZIL Before the Next Roar Set up your wallet through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with ETH from Coinbase or Binance. Connect directly to the official BullZilla ($BZIL) presale portal and swap ETH for $BZIL. Once confirmed, your allocation is secured and claimable after launch. This highly affordable stage won’t last. Claim your viral crypto tokens today and prepare for the listing roar. Act before the next $100,000 surge pushes the price higher; this is where fortunes are minted. Hyperliquid Consolidates Above $47 While Facing Unlock Tensions Hyperliquid’s October story has been a tale of power and pressure. On the bullish side, the perp DEX is clocking more than $3 million in daily fees, with analysts eyeing a push toward $55–$60 as long as the token holds above $47. At the same time, institutional staking products and treasury strategies are adding legitimacy to its ecosystem. Yet, looming in November is the elephant in the room: a massive $500 million monthly token unlock schedule that threatens to dwarf the project’s buyback absorption capacity. Analysts warn only ~17% may be offset by revenue-driven buybacks, sparking concerns of oversupply. Still, with 62% of perp DEX open interest and a developing HyperEVM ecosystem of 100+ protocols, Hyperliquid remains one of the top viral cryptos trending in 2025. Investors are watching closely, but momentum is still alive. Bitcoin Cash Holds Strong at $560 With Eyes on $650 Bitcoin Cash is proving its resilience this October, jumping 7% to nearly $594 before consolidating above the $560 level. Analysts view this as a key support zone, with upside projections toward $650 if buying pressure persists. BCH’s technicals remain bullish, trading above its MA-20, MA-50, and MA-200. A shadow still lingers over BCH after the October 1 SBI Crypto hack, which saw $21 million stolen across multiple chains, including BCH. Yet, despite this security breach, institutional chatter around potential ETF products and strong community conviction are helping the coin hold momentum. Among upcoming viral cryptos with high ROI potential, BCH continues to show it has staying power while newer players like BullZilla steal the spotlight. Conclusion Every crypto season produces its legends, but October 2025 belongs to viral cryptos . Hyperliquid is balancing billion-dollar unlock concerns with fee momentum. Bitcoin Cash is holding key support and eyeing fresh rallies. And then there’s BullZilla, the only presale roaring with 4327.15% upside baked into its DNA. This presale is not waiting for anyone. With stages flipping every 48 hours or $100,000 raised, the next price surge is only moments away. For those who missed Bitcoin Cash rallies or hesitated on Hyperliquid’s run, BullZilla offers a clear invitation: join the roar now or watch from the sidelines when it lists at $0.00527. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Viral Cryptos What makes BullZilla different from other meme coin presales? BullZilla uses a Mutation Engine where the presale price rises every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours, ensuring rapid progression and rewarding early investors. How much can a $6,000 investment in $BZIL return at listing? At the current Stage 5B price of $0.00011907, $6,000 buys 50.43M tokens, which will be worth about $265,768 at the $0.00527 listing price. Why is Hyperliquid facing concerns despite strong revenues? Starting November, massive monthly unlocks of ~$500 million threaten to dilute supply faster than buybacks can absorb, even though revenues and institutional products remain strong. Is Bitcoin Cash still bullish after the October hack? Yes, BCH is holding $560 as support and could rally to $650 if momentum continues, though security risks remind investors to exercise caution. Should investors prioritize BullZilla over established coins like BCH or HYPE? BCH and HYPE have proven markets, but BullZilla’s presale ROI of 4327.15% and fast-moving stages make it the best new viral cryptos making headlines. Summary BullZilla’s presale is exploding with early-stage frenzy, offering a rare 4327% ROI projection for those joining before the next stage surge. Hyperliquid continues to deliver daily revenue strength while battling unlock fears, and Bitcoin Cash maintains technical support despite recent challenges. Among top viral crypto projects to invest now, BullZilla stands apart with its Mutation Engine, roaring burns, and unmatched presale narrative. Time is running out—the next stage change could be the difference between good gains and life-changing ones.

Investigators opened 17 criminal cases during the same period, the country’s Financial Monitoring Agency (AFM) announced on Thursday. Most of the illegal Bitcoin farms have been found in and around the capital Astana (5), the city of Shymkent in Southern Kazakhstan and in Kostanay in the North (3 each), the agency detailed. “As part of these cases, $642,000 in digital assets were seized and confiscated,” the AFM pointed out in a press release, also highlighting: “It should be noted that some illegal mining farms operated by stealing electricity, in a volume comparable to the consumption of a large city. There have also been cases of violations of the rights of residents living near noisy farms.” The watchdog emphasized that the illegal electricity usage for coin minting has deprived other businesses and industrial projects, development initiatives and social infrastructure of needed energy resources. The crypto mining boom in Kazakhstan , which followed China’s decision to ban the activity a few years ago, initially resulted in significant power deficits across the Central Asian nation. The government addressed the issue through regulation and pricing, largely solving the problem, at least as far as licensed cryptocurrency miners are concerned. However, unregistered mining operations, often running on illegally sourced electrical energy, have remained a major challenge for the authorities. Kazakhstan collects over $30 million in tax from the mining sector Aside from that, Kazakhstan has largely benefitted from the influx of miners, after adopting rules for the growing industry, including for the sale of the minted digital currency on domestic authorized exchanges and the taxation of its profits by the state. In a post on its Telegram channel, the AFM admitted that crypto mining has generated more than 17 billion tenge (over $31 million) in budget receipts for the country, quoting data from the State Revenue Committee. The agency also reminded that mining enterprises are allowed to operate in Kazakhstan only after obtaining the respective licenses. It further emphasized: “Legal mining activity requires equipment verification, an energy supply contract, and tax compliance.” The AFM also stressed that the opposite “entails criminal liability, harms the country’s economic security, and leads to power outages.” The regulatory body urged entrepreneurs and Kazakhstani citizens to refrain from participating in illegal mining and to support the development of a transparent digital assets market in the country. Kazakhstan aspires to become a regional cryptocurrency hub. The nation was recently visited by crypto exchange Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the owner of the popular Telegram messenger, Pavel Durov. Both met with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and attended a major tech forum. The Financial Monitoring Agency has been active on other fronts as well. Earlier this week, it announced the dismantling of arguably the largest crypto laundering service in the post-Soviet space, a platform known as the RAKS exchange. Last month, Kazakhstan busted a large crypto Ponzi scheme, seizing $10 million in digital assets collected from defrauded investors in Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

Apple and Google both bowed to federal pressures, removing the application and another, Red Dot, from their stores. The applications allow users to crowdsource reports of United States ICE activity, with the platforms citing personnel safety after a deadly sniper attack at a field office in Texas. Google and Apple initially removed the Red Dot app from their store before Apple removed the iOS-based ICEBlock app after demands from the United States Department of Justice under Attorney Pam Bondi. In a statement to Fox News, Bondi claimed that the app was designed to put federal agents at risk for doing their jobs. The DOJ statement also vowed to protect federal law enforcement agents. ICE tracking app developer disappointed with Apple’s decision In a recent statement, the creator, Joshua Aaron, mentioned that Apple’s decision to remove his application from their store blindsided him. “The app was thoroughly vetted for three weeks by Apple’s legal and senior officials before approval,” he said. “It’s been fine all this time. For them to do it now, that’s why I say I’m so disappointed.” Aaron, a software developer who also doubles as a lead singer for the rock band Stealing Heather, released the application back in April. In July, after ICE operations ticked up across the United States, the application went viral after Bondi called out the activities it was being used for. She claimed that they were using it to signal to criminals where federal officers are, a movement that helps illegals evade capture. However, Aaron claimed that Apple has yet to reach out to him or give him a chance to appeal the decision. “Apple has not called me, even though we were number one in the App Store for weeks and had 1.14 million users that counted on this every single minute of their day,” he said. “They just gave me a letter that said we received information from law enforcement that your app is targeting or harming law enforcement officials.” Aaron plans to fight the removal Aaron compared his application to mainstream navigation applications like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze. “To somehow say that ICEBlock is doing anything different than that is ridiculous,” he said. The removal of the application came after Bondi and the DOJ formally asked for the application to be removed, citing officer safety. Meanwhile, Apple has released a statement to Fox News, in which it spoke about the removal. “We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,” Apple told Fox News. Google also echoed the same sentiment with its decision to remove Red Dot, noting to the media that the agents are a “vulnerable group.” “ICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies,” a Google spokesperson said. The spokesperson claimed that the federal government did not reach out in respect to the app, noting that Red Dot was removed due to the high risk of abuse and rules surrounding user-generated content. Meanwhile, Aaron has claimed that the removal is a First Amendment violation, and he prepares to fight it in court and in the media. “This is not some app taken down from the App Store; this is a tech company removing something that is clearly a First Amendment-protected app,” he said. “There’s nothing illegal about developing it. There’s nothing illegal about using it. They are now deciding what you can and cannot use on a device that you own.” Get seen where it counts.

This new excitement has investors searching for the next altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to outperform ETH’s gains in the next few months. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance is one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, with its dual lending protocol bypassing massive inefficiencies in decentralized lending. Its Stage 6 presale is already over 55% sold out. Attracting more than 16,750 owners and raising more than $16.8 million, reflecting growing market sentiment. With its 50x potential for growth, Mutuum Finance is increasingly considered a special early-stage investment opportunity that can do even better than Ethereum’s next bull cycle as the bull market continues to gain traction. Ethereum Breaks Out of 3-Year Range, Analysts Now Eye Five-Digit Targets Ethereum (ETH) has officially shattered three years of horizontal price action, drawing what analysts call the “holy grail” breakout, a technical move that eliminates prolonged consolidation and allows the foundation for a powerful vertical rally. As momentum gains pace and on-chain indicators flash green, it is widely expected ETH’s future destination could be in the five-digit realm, a level previously thought to be years in the making. The breakout is the moment of truth for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, cementing its place as the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts. With institutional funds pouring in and optimism in the air, increasingly large chunks of investors are also exploring emerging altcoins with greater growth prospects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also starting to draw that forward-thinking capital. Mutuum Finance Presale and Big Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its sixth all-time presale round. The project has already broken 16,750 registered members and more than $16.8 million, all-time high milestones, and continues to show growing trust in the market for its long-term project. Investors who are seeking sustainable yield and long-term value will find Mutuum Finance’s growing ecosystem at a quick rate as an investment prospect to consider. The platform also has a very robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation mechanism that adjusts in real-time to shock collateral price. This is supported by another impediment of protection through management of a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier on riskier classes of collateral. Open architecture and security by design enable Mutuum Finance to be a long-term, stable, and secure DeFi platform designed for the long term and to put the times to the test. The project classifies vulnerabilities into four categories, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and provides a rational model for discovery and prevention of such pitfalls before impacting users. Mutuum Finance New Lending & Borrowing Platform Mutuum Finance has announced a new lending and borrowing protocol for its decentralized finance ecosystem. Version 1 (V1) is set to go live on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will include major pieces such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. On the launch day, lending, borrowing, and collateralization support for ETH and USDT is set to go live, ushering in the stage for a simple and open-ended DeFi experience. The Ethereum breakout above $4,400 is a sure sign that the next big bull rally is imminent, but the biggest profits might not come from ETH itself. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at the moment is trading at just $0.035 and significantly more than 55% presale sold out, is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting early-stage DeFi plays of 2025. With more than 16,750 investors, who have raised $16.8 million, a double lending infrastructure, and robust security architecture, MUTM represents a rare chance at 50× potential gain. For investors betting on the next altcoin to surge and drive even Ethereum’s rally, MUTM is the obvious choice.

In a post on X, he noted that “XRP quietly built what others are still pitching,” highlighting its compliance-ready architecture and institutional-grade features already live on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). His comments were accompanied by a detailed graphic that outlined how XRP is evolving from a fast payments network into a foundation for institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi) . $XRP quietly built what others are still pitching Read this! KYC at the protocol layer. Tokenized bonds. Compliant stablecoins. Institutional lending standards baked in. This is not a narrative. It's already in motion. Institutions see it. Do you? pic.twitter.com/72brm1pEIy — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 2, 2025 From Payments to Full Institutional Utility For years, XRP has been associated primarily with cross-border payments. That reputation is changing as the XRPL now incorporates compliance features such as KYC and AML directly at the protocol layer. According to the shared graphic, the ledger integrates regulatory tools, including decentralized identity and the clawback mechanism for security assurance. This allows banks and financial institutions to operate with confidence on infrastructure that aligns with regulatory standards. The development of institutional features does not stop at compliance. XRP has native order book decentralized exchanges combined with automated market makers under XLS-30. This provides optimal trade execution by merging liquidity pools with order books. These additions position XRP as more than a retail settlement token, giving institutions a platform capable of handling regulated activity. Tokenization of Real-World Assets The report in the graphic emphasized XRP’s potential role as the backbone for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Tokenized bonds, treasuries, and structured financial products are identified as key use cases. These instruments would be issued using a new multi-purpose token standard while maintaining security and compliance. Built-in pricing oracles and automated swaps provide further support for institutional integration. BlackRock and similar firms are projected to push more than $10 trillion worth of assets into tokenized markets by 2030 . XRP’s positioning as a compliance-ready solution makes it a candidate to host such tokenization efforts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By offering on-chain identity, liquidity management, and lending standards, the XRPL aligns with institutional investors’ demand before committing large-scale capital to blockchain networks. Institutional Lending and Credit Markets Institutional lending is set to expand in 2025 with XLS-65d and XLS-66d, which will bring risk-managed credit issuance, on-chain lending, liquidity vaults, and collateralized real-world assets. AMM-based FX and lending strategies are also planned. These tools target banks, asset managers, and institutions that require more than transaction speed, offering a foundation for regulated credit markets on blockchain. As X Finance Bull noted, “this is not a narrative. It’s already in motion.” With compliant stablecoins, tokenized bonds, and institutional lending, the XRPL is shifting from concept to live infrastructure, positioning XRP as a core liquidity layer for DeFi .

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $1.98. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $3.22 and an average forecast price of $3.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers a multitude of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The EOS ecosystem has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, with the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) being its best feat. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 in the near future? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.403 (-1.43%) Market Cap $641.2M Trading Volume $965.34K Circulating Supply 1.59B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4027 (Nov 04, 2024) 24-hour High $0.4228 24-hour Low $0.4016 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.407962 (0.07%) Price Volatility 6.78% 50-Day SMA $0.47332 14-Day RSI 39.98 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.567429 EOS price analysis: Negative market sentiment pushes EOS price toward $0.403 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward market trend toward $0.403. The altcoin lost 1.43% of its value. The EOS coin looks for support around $0.389. On October 4, the EOS price analysis revealed a bearish daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced significant losses, reaching $0.403 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin lost up to 1.43% of its value today, as sellers continue to rule the market, causing further price depreciation. The altcoin has now been losing value for a second consecutive day, targeting the next support at $0.389. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirms a decreasing trend as the price moves downward. The EOS/USD value dipped to $0.403 today. The appearance of red candlesticks on the price chart signifies a bearish trend. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.495. The indicator’s lower limit, which serves as the support, has shifted to $0.369. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 37.38 and is nearing the oversold region. The downward curve on the RSI graph signifies a dominance of sellers. If selling activities continue to intensify, further instability in the market can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also shows selling pressure building up at the current price level. The altcoin’s value has decreased to $0.403 as bears are trying to dominate the price action. Low levels of volatility mark a lesser chance of a reversal in market trends or further price depreciation on the 4-hour chart. The Bollinger Bands have converged, hinting at a low volatility level. This low level of volatility signifies increased market predictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.425, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.398, indicating support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 43.40, the RSI curve is pointing downwards, confirming the selling activities. The downward curve on the indicator’s graph indicates significant pressure from the selling side of the market. We can expect further depreciation if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

The EOS price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has decreased to $0.403 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further decrease in price levels to retest the support of $0.389. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS down? Following the recent resistance around the $0.416 level on the EOS price chart, sellers gained control and took the price to $0.403. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is striving to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the price trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2029 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031, which makes it a good option to buy EOS, though accurate predictions are nearly impossible in the crypto market. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $3.22 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition, and it also experienced strong bullish sentiment in November last year, when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $3.22 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinions on EOS Vaulta (formerly EOS) announced a major milestone as its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to a new all-time high of over $412 million. This figure surpasses its previous high of $397 million, set on September 26, 2025. The network had specifically highlighted that past achievement as significant because it occurred despite a broader market downturn. For the current all-time high, Vaulta attributed the growth primarily to the surge in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. $BTC is surging. Vaulta TVL is surging too — now over $412M.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. In mid-July 2025, EOS recovered to $0.625. However, at the start of September, EOS fell to $0.47 after a price drop. At the start of October, EOS is trending near $0.41 as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-04 11:45:00

Altcoin ETF filings from REX Shares and Osprey Funds propose 21 spot crypto funds, many structured as staking ETF products that pay validator rewards to holders. These filings expand ETF exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ether, introducing yield mechanics and cross-listed ETP allocation via Cayman subsidiaries. How do staking ETFs work within these filings? Staking ETFs would combine market exposure with validator income by delegating on-chain staking rights to service providers. The filings specify operational mechanics, custody models and anticipated reward distribution, while referencing industry participants such as 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour as benchmark providers in plain text. What assets are targeted in the 21 filings? Reported assets include Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Near (NEAR), Sui (SUI), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), Stellar (XLM) and Hype (HYPE). Many proposals allow portions of portfolios to hold European and Canadian exchange-traded products to satisfy tax and listing considerations via Cayman structures. Why do generic listing standards matter for ETF timelines? The SEC’s new generic listing standards for commodity-linked funds eliminate certain case-by-case waivers, shortening the timeline between approval and listing. Funds that qualify under the new standards can move faster to market once the SEC resumes normal operations. How does the U.S. government shutdown impact approvals? Regulatory pauses tied to the government shutdown have frozen SEC staffing and delayed decisions, including impending October deadlines. The agency missed decisions such as the October 2 Canary Litecoin ETF ruling, creating a backlog that affects the 16 crypto ETF proposals with October 2025 statutory deadlines. What should investors and market participants watch next? SEC resumption date : Approval timelines hinge on government operations restarting. Operational details : Custody, staking custody providers, and reward distribution mechanics will influence product suitability. Benchmark selection : Plain-text references to market providers (21Shares, CoinShares, Valour) indicate potential indexing and pricing sources. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to evaluate staking ETF proposals"", ""description"": ""Steps to assess staking ETF filings for investment suitability and regulatory readiness."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review custody and staking mechanics"", ""text"": ""Confirm who holds private keys, the delegation process, and reward calculation methods."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check allocation and foreign ETP exposure"", ""text"": ""Identify any allocations to European or Canadian ETPs and Cayman subsidiary structures that affect tax and liquidity."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor SEC timelines and regulatory notices"", ""text"": ""Track SEC publications and government operations for changes to listing deadlines and approvals."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are the REX-Osprey filings spot or leveraged ETFs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The filings are spot crypto ETFs, many designed to pass through staking rewards to investors rather than using leverage."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will staking rewards increase ETF yield materially?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Staking rewards can add income, but net yield depends on validator fees, slashing risk and operational costs disclosed in fund prospectuses."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will the SEC decide on these proposals?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Decisions are pending and subject to SEC scheduling; current progress is paused by the U.S. government shutdown and could resume once operations restart."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions What are the tax and custody implications of Cayman subsidiaries in ETF filings? Cayman subsidiaries are commonly used to address U.S. tax constraints and to enable exposure to certain foreign-listed ETPs. Investors should review prospectus disclosures for tax treatment and the fund’s custody arrangements before investing. How should investors interpret references to industry providers like 21Shares or CoinShares? Plain-text references to firms such as 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour indicate potential benchmark or operational partners; these mentions are informational and require verification within each fund’s documentation. Key Takeaways REX-Osprey push : 21 altcoin ETF filings signal a major move to expand product types beyond Bitcoin and Ether. Staking introduces yield : Many filings propose passing validator rewards to ETF holders, changing the risk-return profile. Regulatory timing is critical : Generic listing standards shorten potential timelines, but the U.S. government shutdown has stalled SEC action and tightened October 2025 deadlines. Conclusion The wave of REX and Osprey altcoin ETF filings could reshape crypto ETF offerings by introducing staking ETF mechanics and broader asset coverage. Investors should monitor SEC status, read prospectuses for custody and reward details, and prepare for timelines tied to government operations.

Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee are among the Fed officials who raised concerns about economic and inflation conditions. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also noted that large rate cuts lack support, emphasizing a policy consensus that balances the central bank’s monetary policy approach. He claimed that making significant policy moves at this time is unnecessary. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed doubt about future rate cuts unless inflation drops. Alberto Musalem, President of the Bank of St. Louis, also warned that the Fed is edging closer to its rate cut limits. Miran says policy is out of whack Miran said that the Fed’s monetary policy is out of whack, and reasonable adjustments should be made briskly. However, he remains skeptical about the central bank’s current interest rate policy, pointing out that the Fed might not have reached that point yet. Miran believes that the Fed is at a point where, if it keeps the current interest rate steady for another day, it will be in crisis. However, he foresees a bigger problem in the Fed’s hands if the current rate is held for an extra year. “If you sort of keep it there another day, it’s a crisis, but if you keep it there for an extra year, yeah, I think you have…problems on your hands.” – Stephen Miran , Governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve Miran said on September 22 that leaving the policy restrictive to the current extent risks significantly compromising the Fed’s mandate. He and other FOMC members also believe the neutral rate is not where it ought to be due to President Trump’s policy changes. Miran further explained how deregulation, tax, immigration, and trade policy changes are either increasing nominal savings or boosting productivity in ways that lower the neutral rate. He added that these changes make monetary policy that was not as tight at the beginning of the year, now too restrictive. Bowman predicts three rate cuts in 2025 Michelle Bowman, a member of the Fed board of Governors, predicted on October 3 that the Fed would make three rate cuts before the end of the year. Bowman, who also serves as the current Vice Chair of Supervision, pointed out that these cuts would counter labor market risks and support the economy’s stability as inflation neared the 2% target. However, Miran’s preference for bolder rate cuts places him at odds with most policymakers. Most regional Fed presidents still worry about lowering rates at the current inflation rate, which has remained well above the 2% target. Policymakers also believe that Trump’s tariffs will accelerate inflation as their effects surge through the economy. Miran advocated for a 0.50% rate cut in the next rate-setting meeting, but most officials called for a moderate trim to the 4% to 4.25% range. Fed officials seek to strike a balance between lowering high inflation and supporting the weakening jobs market. The officials further predicted an interest rate target between 3.5% and 3.75% by the end of 2025, with a likelihood of moving to the 3.25% to 3.5% range in 2026. However, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee believes the central bank is now in a sticky spot. He remains a little wary about front-loading too many rates and hoping that inflation will subside. Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Logan remains hawkish and claims that the Fed needs to be cautious about further rate cuts. She previously pointed out that the worrisome environment suggests high inflation is driven by more than just tariff-related issues. Bowman also believes that the Fed policy is at risk of falling behind the curve, especially in offsetting labor market risks. However, Miran stresses that his approach is similar to that of other policymakers, only that he wants to reach the goal faster. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

With that ceiling nearly cleared, a quick move to $135,000 could be in the cards, according to Standard Chartered head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick. In a note published on Friday, Kendrick argued that the U.S. government shutdown is playing a bigger role in markets than in past episodes supporting bitcoin's rally. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, BTC traded in a different context. Now, the largest crypto has been closely correlated with U.S. government risk, measured by the U.S. Treasury term premiums, a relationship that suggests the uncertainty around the shutdown acts as a bullish driver this time. Traders on prediction marketplace Polymarket currently give more than a 60% chance that the shutdown lasts 10–29 days. Kendrick forecasted BTC will continue to rise throughout that period. Kendrick also highlighted a coming shift in ETF investor behavior. While gold ETFs have recently outperformed their BTC counterparts with gold pushing to record prices, spot bitcoin ETF flows are poised to catch up providing tailwind for the asset, the report said. Of the $58 billion in net BTC ETF inflows so far, $23 billion has come in 2025, he said. This week alone, they attracted over $2.25 billion without the Friday session. Kendrick projected that the vehicles could pull in another $20 billion investor capital by year-end – enough to keep his $200,000 year-end BTC price target in play.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Standard Chartered Bank|US Government|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-04 12:00:00

Solana (SOL) is holding steady near $232, while Chainlink (LINK) recently broke through $22, signaling momentum for the next market rally. In this environment, one emerging altcoin is gaining traction with strong fundamentals: MAGACOIN FINANCE . These three projects are positioned for significant growth, supported by both technical developments and institutional involvement. Solana’s Institutional Push Solana continues to display a strong growth pattern as the digital asset currently trades at a price point close to $232. This price has held despite last week’s $6 million liquidation surge. As their ETFs SOLT and SOLZ continue to experience inflows, institutional interest growing has secured this stability. analysts think solana will reach $300 as the network keeps scaling the rest of the year. The development of Firedancer to be introduced by Solana is expected to facilitate validator throughput. Further, it will upgrade capabilities and remove fixed compute unit limit. Solana is committed to enhancing its transaction throughput and security amid growing competition in the decentralized application and DeFi space. Solana’s ecosystem is growing despite some short-term bearish pressure Recent actions include listings on Nasdaq companies which will accept SOL as payment and alliances that cement Solana’s place in blockchain. As we head into Q4 2025, technical upgrades, institutional demand and ecosystem growth make Solana a strong contender. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Growth Chainlink has also seen significant developments, and is currently trading at $22, overcoming important resistance levels. The recent 2025 Swift Hackathon win of the project highlights its ability to fit into institutional networks as a finance workflow keyblock. Chainlink is gaining reputation by leaps and bounds in the DeFi and regulatory spaces, as seen here. Chainlink has significantly expanded its ecosystem with 12 integrations across 10 blockchains including Solana. The integrations improve the use of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and decentralized price feeds on these chains. More and more institutions, including UBS, have summered Chainlink’s Digital Transfer Agent (DTA) standard for tokenized assets, shaping Chainlink as an important infrastructure provider for the future of digital finance. Chainlink is displaying bullish patterns technically while whales are also accumulating it for the long haul. LINK has crucial resistance at $30. If LINK breaks above $22.50 and continues gaining institutional traction, the price could push higher according to some analysts. Investors Highlight Early Stage Play for Longterm Accumulation While Solana and Chainlink are established leaders in their respective ecosystems, another emerging altcoin is drawing significant attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE runs on a Hashex-audited smart contract, ensuring transparency and security for all investors. It also features a top-tier ecosystem, creating built-in scarcity and positioning it for long-term appreciation. Community engagement continues to grow, with wallet activity signaling early adoption. Investors are increasingly paying attention to the scarcity-driven investment potential of the project, particularly given its transparent foundation and limited supply model. Analysts have highlighted it as one of the best crypto to buy now as capital rotates into promising new opportunities. Conclusion Solana’s strong technical position near $232, Chainlink’s recent breakout above $22, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-driven model make these three altcoins some of the best opportunities heading into the final months of 2025. For investors looking to position ahead of the next rally, these coins offer compelling setups, with Solana and Chainlink leading the way for institutional adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE emerging as a top contender for future growth.

Analyst Says It Could Be The Next Amazon,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-to-100-analyst-says-it-could-be-the-next-amazon/,"According to new analysis and community discussion, XRP’s recent price action has rekindled a long-running comparison to Amazon’s slow climb before a major breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rockets Past $119K, Analysts Now Eye $130K Target Some analysts say the pattern looks familiar: a long consolidation, then a steep rally. Amazon’s stock took 3,800 days — more than a decade — to clear its old highs and later rose from about $5 to over $200, a timeline that is being used as a benchmark by bullish XRP voices. Regulatory Battles Do Not End Growth Based on reports, the regulatory history has nuances. Brad Kimes revived the comparison and pointed to regulatory pressure on Amazon as similar to what Ripple faced. Amazon vs XRP. Reminder, Amazon was sued by the SEC, too. 👇 https://t.co/ZXqtWhancp — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) October 3, 2025 That point needed fact-checking. The SEC opened an inquiry into Amazon in 2022 over its testimony on third-party seller data; that probe closed with no fines or charges. The case that led to legal action, however, came from the FTC. The FTC sued Amazon in June 2023 over checkout practices, and the matter was resolved last month with a $2.5 billion settlement — $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds earmarked for roughly 35 million users by December 2025. The broader claim — that major firms can face heavy government scrutiny and still grow — still holds weight in the debate. XRP’s Pattern And Long-Term Claim According to Nick Anderson of Bullrunners, XRP is building a “cup and handle” formation near prior peaks. At the time of his write-up, XRP was changing hands around $2.71. Anderson argued that if XRP follows a similar multi-year path as Amazon, it could eventually trade near $100. He added that someone holding 10,000 XRP would become a millionaire at that level, and that 10,000 holders were among the top 4% on the XRP rich list during his analysis. He warned, however, that such an outcome would likely take years, not months. Technical Signals And Price Targets Meanwhile, based on a technical note from Cryptoinsightuk, XRP has seen a three-day RSI bullish crossover — a signal that has preceded big gains in the past. The analyst pointed out that in each of the three previous times the three-day RSI crossed up, XRP recorded strong rallies. XRP was trading near $3.02 and holding above local support around $2.72. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI.

With recent regulatory hints, institutional flows, and ETF momentum fueling optimism, the stage feels set for a possible run toward $200,000 if three key conditions fall into place. Miss one, and you might miss the move of the decade. At the same time, the stage is set for a new DeFi project to revolutionise payments. It has recently announced CEX listings and its beta wallet is testing live. Bitcoin: The King’s Path to $200,000 Bitcoin already has momentum. It recently broke above $120,000 amid ETF inflows and macro uncertainty. But to vault to $200,000 in 2025, BTC must not only hold gains but soar on fresh catalysts. Analysts are whispering comparisons to past cycles: “if every bank holds BTC,” one strategist suggests, “$200,000 is conservative.” Early buyers who picked up BTC below $100,000 are already showing double-digit gains. But those gains pale if Bitcoin becomes the next multi­-hundred thousand mover. If institutions flood in, they can push demand into scarcity territory. If Washington gives clear rules (Bitcoin seen as digital gold, friendly tax policy), more capital will arrive with confidence. And if the Fed pivots, investors seeking higher yield may flood into risk assets again. Combine those, and $200,000 becomes more than a dream. Remittix: A Next-Gen DeFi Powerhouse Remittix is built as a cross-chain DeFi project focused not on speculation, but real-world payments: crypto to bank, borderless transfers, bank rails in 30+ countries. The architecture is built so regular users benefit. What you need to know: Remittix’s wallet beta is going live soon, with real-time FX conversion baked in. The team is fully CertiK verified and the presale has already raised over $27 million. Over 40,000 holders are reported, and listing plans on BitMart and LBank are in motion. Whales are quietly accumulating: some insiders call RTX “XRP 2.0 in payments gear.” Compared to others, Remittix stands out because it blends utility, community, and momentum. While many tokens promise “metaverse” or “AI,” RTX is pitched as a payments rails solution. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Global Reach: crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Real-World Utility: built for real payments, not hype Security First: fully verified by CertiK, ranked #1 prelaunch Raised Over $27 Million: robust early funding + strong demand Deflationary Tokenomics: designed to reward long-term holders If Remittix nails execution, it could become a foundational layer in cross-border DeFi payments. Many early buyers believe it’s among the fastest growing crypto 2025 stories. $250,000 Giveaway & Referral Blitz: Why Time Matters Remittix is delivering urgency. The team just launched a $250,000 giveaway to its community, amplifying buzz. On top of that, a new referral program pays 15% back in USDT whenever you refer someone — claimable daily from your dashboard. Early testers are already reporting thousands in rewards just by sharing their links. Look: more holders means more liquidity, more listings, more media.

For XRP, traders are closely watching a defining resistance zone that has contained the price in recent sessions. If this barrier gives way, the move to $3.30 may not just be probable — it could unfold with speed. As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.00–$3.05, with strong liquidity across major exchanges. Daily trading volumes remain elevated in the billions, underscoring the intensity of activity at these levels. The token’s price structure has become increasingly compressed, setting the stage for a breakout that could redraw the short-term chart. Xoom’s Key Analysis Crypto analyst Xoom has drawn attention to a clear “point of interest” on XRP’s chart — a descending trendline that has repeatedly rejected bullish advances. XRP’s repeated tests of this line, including a brief breach, underscore its significance as a key technical level. According to Xoom, a decisive break above this barrier could propel XRP to $3.30 without significant resistance. XRP rejected from point of interest twice, once broken… a move to $3.30 zone would likely be a quick one. https://t.co/GRgGQ6QxKZ pic.twitter.com/4D51eeqPhr — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 3, 2025 Why $3.30 is the Target The $3.30 zone represents a visible resistance level where liquidity clusters are concentrated. Beyond this point, stop orders from short positions are likely stacked, creating a cascading effect once triggered. This makes the $3.30 level not only a technical target but also a psychological one , where traders anticipate immediate reactions in volume and order flow. Mid-range chart structures support this projection, marking $3.30 as the next logical destination if the trendline break is confirmed. Market Momentum and Whale Participation Recent activity reinforces the potential for speed once the breakout occurs. Each approach to resistance has been met with surging volume, suggesting large participants are closely engaged. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Whale wallets and on-chain data indicate renewed accumulation, and rising daily active addresses suggest growing market interest. Historically, when accumulation and breakouts align, XRP’s price has surged rapidly. Confirmation and Risk Management Despite the bullish setup, caution remains essential. A genuine breakout requires a firm close above the trendline supported by elevated trading volume. A successful retest of the broken resistance should transform it into a support level. Without these confirmations, traders risk being caught in a false move. Disciplined investors will focus on tight risk management and strategic stop-loss placements to navigate upcoming market fluctuations. In conclusion, Xoom’s analysis underscores the significance of the current technical setup. XRP’s proximity to a critical resistance line, combined with strong market activity and whale participation, suggests that once this barrier is cleared, the sprint to $3.30 could be swift and decisive. Traders who understand both the opportunity and the risks will be best positioned to capture what may be one of XRP’s fastest near-term moves.

Key point 1: SBF attributes the FTX collapse to relinquishing leadership to John J. Ray III on Nov. 11, 2022. Key point 2: FTX’s bankruptcy revealed an $8.9 billion shortfall tied to Alameda Research fund transfers. Key point 3: The FTX estate has repaid $7.8 billion so far and estimates up to $16.5 billion in recoverable assets. Sam Bankman-Fried biggest mistake: SBF says handing FTX to new management cost a rescue chance — read creditor repayment updates and legal aftermath. Sam Bankman‑Fried claimed that handing over FTX to its current CEO was the “single biggest mistake” that prevented him from saving the exchange. What was Sam Bankman‑Fried’s biggest mistake that led to the FTX collapse? Sam Bankman‑Fried’s biggest mistake was signing over control of FTX to new management on Nov. 11, 2022, a decision he says removed his ability to accept a possible external investment minutes later. This transfer preceded the Chapter 11 filing and accelerated the exchange’s bankruptcy process. How did the leadership handover affect the bankruptcy process? The leadership handover on Nov. 11, 2022, allowed John J. Ray III to assume control and quickly pursue Chapter 11 protections. Under new direction, the estate engaged Sullivan & Cromwell for restructuring and legal representation. Plain‑text reporting by Reuters and coverage in Mother Jones document timelines and legal filings surrounding these decisions. Why did FTX collapse and how large was the investor shortfall? FTX collapsed after internal transfers of customer funds to Alameda Research produced trading losses now described as the “Alameda gap.” Criminal convictions established that unauthorized transfers created an estimated $8.9 billion shortfall and triggered mass withdrawals, liquidity failure, and bankruptcy. Who was appointed and what legal actions followed? John J. Ray III was appointed chief executive and filed Chapter 11 the same day. Sullivan & Cromwell subsequently provided legal services and, according to legal filings reviewed by Reuters, earned over $171.8 million in fees by mid‑2024. A creditors’ suit naming the law firm was filed and later voluntarily dismissed in October 2024. Source: Documentcloud.org How much have FTX creditors been repaid and what remains outstanding? The FTX estate began distributions in February and, through September, has returned a cumulative $7.8 billion to creditors. Recovery efforts estimate up to $16.5 billion in assets available, leaving roughly $8.7 billion outstanding. The estate projects repaying most customers at or above 98% of their account values as of November 2022. When were the latest repayments delivered and who reports them? On Sept. 30 the estate executed a $1.6 billion distribution, reported by a creditor committee member known as Sunil via social posts. Official repayment schedules and totals are documented in court filings and estate communications; independent reporting has tracked these milestones since the first $1.2 billion payout in February.

The Alameda gap resulted from unauthorized transfers of customer funds to Alameda Research to cover trading losses, creating a multibillion‑dollar deficit between customer balances and available assets. How can creditors track future FTX repayments? Creditors should monitor official court filings, trustee notices, and estate distributions published by the FTX estate. Independent coverage and creditor committee posts provide supplementary updates. Key Takeaways SBF’s assessment : Handing FTX to new management on Nov. 11, 2022, is described by SBF as his biggest mistake. Scale of loss : The collapse revealed an $8.9 billion shortfall tied to Alameda Research transfers and triggered Chapter 11 proceedings. Repayments ongoing : The estate has returned $7.8 billion so far and estimates up to $16.5 billion in recoverable assets, aiming for near‑full customer recovery. Conclusion Sam Bankman‑Fried’s public statement that relinquishing control of FTX was his “single biggest mistake” frames the legal and financial aftermath of the exchange’s failure. Ongoing estate recoveries and creditor distributions continue to unfold, while regulators, litigants, and industry participants evaluate reforms to prevent similar collapses.

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to nearly $124,000, thanks to surging institutional demand, shifting Federal Reserve policy, and investor optimism about a bullish Q4. BTC faced volatility on Friday as it rose to an intraday high of $123,996 before settling at $122,318. Analysts believe the rally will continue and the price will hit a new all-time high. Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle May Continue In Some Form Gemini’s head of the APAC region, Saad Ahmed, believes Bitcoin’s four-year cycle could continue in some form. Ahmed added that while the cycle may not play out as it has in the past, it doesn’t mean the concept is dead. “I think when it comes to the four-year cycle, the reality is that it’s very likely that we’ll continue to see some form of a cycle. It ultimately stems from people getting really excited and overextending themselves, and then you kind of see a crash, and then it kind of corrects to an equilibrium.” However, Ahmed stated that growing institutional involvement in crypto could help the market absorb some volatility. “You’ll see some of the volatility, kind of a flag off, but you’ll still see some sort of a cycle, because ultimately, it’s driven by human emotion.” However, analyst Rekt Capital believes October marks Bitcoin’s cycle peak if previous patterns hold. Rekt Capital had stated in July that if BTC’s current cycle mirrors 2020, the market will peak in October. “We have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left.” Analyst Predicts Massive Bitcoin Rally Analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic about Bitcoin’s (BTC) prospects in October. According to one team of analysts, Bitcoin could reach $143,000 this month, a 20% rally. While such a prediction may seem almost outlandish, historical data shows that October is one of the most bullish months for the flagship cryptocurrency. Over the past 12 years, BTC has closed in positive territory 10 times. After a positive end to September, Bitcoin is poised for a fruitful October. In four out of four instances when BTC closed September and October positively, the trend continued in November. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is eying the $124,000 level after reaching an intraday high of $123,996 on Friday. Bullish sentiment around the asset has surged thanks to surging institutional interest, shifting Federal Reserve Policy, and rising open interest. Analysts believe BTC could go into price discovery if bullish sentiment persists, potentially rising towards $130,000. One of the most prominent drivers of the latest rally is the US government shutdown and the market’s indifferent reaction. Federal agencies have started to furlough staff, and key economic data and report releases are facing delays. Bitcoin has directly benefited from the shutdown as traders position themselves to deal with the lack of clear policy direction. The shutdown has also complicated matters for the Federal Reserve, as inflation and jobs data could be delayed, leading to speculative inflows into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitfinex analysts stated, “Bitcoin’s movement toward a new all-time high appears genuinely organic. We suspect that Trump’s announcement of potentially considering a stimulus cheque for every citizen, funded by tariffs, could also contribute to a further rise in Bitcoin’s price. This could mirror what we witnessed following the COVID stimulus cheques. Meanwhile, steady ETF inflows provide a clear tailwind.” On-chain data has confirmed the recent surge is driven by demand, with analysts highlighting a taker buy volume spike of over $1.6 billion in one hour across exchanges. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. BTC recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Bullish sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,659. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.65% to reclaim $120,000 and settle at $120,621. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday despite volatility and selling pressure. As a result, BTC reached an intraday high of $123,996 before settling at $122,318. The price is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $122,349.

The partnership will provide easier access to cryptocurrency for 75 million Galaxy users in the US, with a global rollout also in the works. Coinbase Expands Coinbase Integration Electronics giant Samsung has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to allow its Galaxy smartphone users to buy crypto directly from its native Samsung Wallet. The first phase of the partnership will see 75 million Galaxy smartphone users in the US gain access to Coinbase One, a subscription service that offers zero staking fees, high staking rewards, and account protection to secure funds and accounts from unauthorized access. Shan Aggarwal, chief business officer at Coinbase, stated, “Together with Samsung, we’re pairing their global scale with Coinbase’s trusted platform to deliver the best value for people to access crypto — starting with more than 75 million Galaxy users across the U.S., and soon around the world.” While the initial rollout is in the US, the partnership will be expanded to Galaxy smartphone users worldwide, potentially bringing a substantial influx of new investors into the cryptocurrency market. There are over one billion Galaxy smartphone users globally. Making Crypto More Accessible The partnership will allow Galaxy smartphone users in the US to buy crypto using Samsung Wallet. Users will also get free access to Coinbase One, which costs $4.99 per month for the basic version and $29.99 for the premium version. Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong believes the partnership will make crypto even more accessible to the general public. “Excited to be partnering with Samsung to make crypto even more accessible. We’re offering 75M+ Samsung Galaxy users in the U.S. free access to Coinbase One to bring them on board. And we’ve fully integrated Samsung Pay, so every Coinbase user in the U.S. can use that to buy crypto.” Samsung And Crypto Samsung Wallet is an evolution of Samsung Pay, which was initially introduced in 2015. The offering integrated several crypto wallet features and rebranded itself as the Samsung Wallet mobile application in June 2022. The application was first rolled out as a payment method and deposit option for cryptocurrency traders at the end of July. The partnership with Coinbase highlights Samsung’s commitment to allowing its users to explore and engage with crypto on a secure, trusted platform from the convenience of their mobiles. Users can use the Samsung Wallet to execute mobile transactions, make payments, complete peer-to-peer transactions, and access digital identity services.

Bitcoin surged from $120,000 to $123,855, but failed to break past its all-time high of $124,128. Bitcoin is trading around $122,604, having retreated somewhat from a brief peak, according to CoinGecko data. It's up 1.3% on the day and over 11% on a weekly basis. Related News: New Development in the US Government Shutdown Crisis - Next Critical Date Set This is the first time Bitcoin has come this close since reaching a record high of $124,128 in mid-August. BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale said in a statement, “Bitcoin briefly tested record highs but retreated due to profit-taking. The overall outlook remains positive; Bitcoin demand is expected to increase as the prolonged government shutdown drives investors into alternative assets.” Strah Savinja, Head of Data and Analytics at FRNT Financial, argued that Bitcoin's safe haven perception is strengthening: “BTC's appeal is not only more visible, but also more deeply ingrained. This is increasingly evident at a time when trust in traditional institutions is eroding.” *This is not investment advice.
