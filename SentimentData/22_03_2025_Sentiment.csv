42120304,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61195,1742594446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CEO Makes End of 2025 Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-makes-end-of-2025-prediction/,"Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a popular crypto influencer on X, recently shared an interview featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. During the interview, he outlined an ambitious target for the company‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple aims to position RLUSD among the top stablecoins by the end of 2025, reflecting confidence in both the asset and the broader market‚Äôs expansion. BREAKING: RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: ‚ÄûTHE GOAL IS BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR RLUSD, RIPPLE STABLECOIN, TO BE ONE OF THE TOP FIVE IN THE MARKET BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I THINK THE WHOLE MARKET IS GONNA GROW DRAMATICALLY THIS YEAR!‚Äú #XRP pic.twitter.com/NliNtSZYy4 ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) March 20, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Goal for 2025 In the interview, Garlinghouse highlighted that RLUSD, which was launched at the end of last year , is already exceeding Ripple‚Äôs internal forecasts. While acknowledging that Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin is still in its early stages, he emphasized its strong trajectory. Interestingly, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple‚Äôs goal for 2025 is to make RLUSD one of the top five stablecoins in the market by the end of the year. He also noted that the stablecoin sector, currently valued at around $230 billion, could grow tenfold over the next five years, and the company plans to dominate that market with its stablecoin. Market Growth and Competition Stablecoins remain a critical component of the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. The dominant players, USDT and USDC, continue to lead, but Garlinghouse believes the RLUSD will do well in the market. RLUSD is currently ranked #9 by 24-hour trading volume, and Ripple‚Äôs deep integration into global payment systems and established relationships with financial institutions may provide it with a competitive edge as the market grows. Expanding RLUSD‚Äôs Reach Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple is actively working to increase RLUSD‚Äôs market presence. The company recently took a significant step forward by integrating its systems with RWA.xyz , allowing aggregation of the stablecoin‚Äôs data alongside other tokenized assets. Garlinghouse mentioned that new exchange listings for RLUSD continue to go live, helping drive adoption. ‚ÄúAnytime you do something new, it takes a minute for the ripple effect to play out,‚Äù he said, referring to the stablecoin‚Äôs growing impact. If the company leverages its partnerships and connections on its existing network, it may have a strong chance of reaching its goal by year-end and making RLUSD a household name. A Bullish Outlook for Stablecoins Garlinghouse‚Äôs bullish stance on stablecoins shows the growing importance of this sector within the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory clarity improves in the U.S. and global adoption increases, stablecoins will play an even larger role in digital finance. Whether RLUSD can break into the top five remains to be seen, but its early success suggests that Ripple is making significant strides in the competitive stablecoin market.

The analysis report highlights technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which failed to reach past extremes, raising concerns about Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Bitcoin Indicators Fall Short Of Historical Peaks Bitcoin has historically exhibited strong indicator readings during major cycle tops, reflecting extreme market engagement and enthusiasm. However, in this bull cycle, the pioneer cryptocurrency‚Äôs RSI reading has failed to reach historical peaks despite Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days Tony Severino, a crypto market technician on X (formerly Twitter), has Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days a detailed analysis of Bitcoin, challenging the assumption that the cryptocurrency must reach the same overbought RSI levels as in previous cycles to confirm its market peak. The key argument here is that lower highs on oscillators like the RSI, combined with higher highs in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, can be a bearish signal, suggesting waning strength in the market. Severino shared an example comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs current bull cycle to past cycles. In the previous bull market, Bitcoin‚Äôs monthly RSI reached above 90, but its current cycle has not. The analyst posed a question about whether this inability to reach past extremes means that Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt reached a market top or simply lacked the same momentum to push its RSI to the highest level. The analyst has warned that believing that Bitcoin must reach past extremes on indicators before hitting a price peak is a dangerous way of thinking. Historical patterns do not always repeat in the same way, and relying too much on past indicator peaks could cause traders to miss warning signs of a top or underestimate the possibility of a bear market. Severino also pointed to historical data from the S&P 500 in the 1950s and 1960s, where similar RSI failure preceded a long market meltdown. During these times, cyclical peaks hit RSI readings of 77 or higher, but in 1969, the RSI failed to reach those highs, signaling underlying weakness. This market downturn ultimately led to the first lower low in over 20 years. While this historical behavior of the S&P 500 does not mean that Bitcoin is destined for a lower high, it does suggest that the cryptocurrency does not need to reach extreme RSI levels to confirm a cycle top and a subsequent bear market. Analyst Says BTC Has Hit Its Market Top In his analysis Severino confirmed that Bitcoin has already hit its market top for this bull cycle. Following his detailed analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI levels, a community member asked if Severino believes that Bitcoin reached a market top when its price surged above $109,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash From $91,000, Why It‚Äôs Far From Over The analyst responded positively, stating that current market data indicates that the cryptocurrency hit its highest price point for this bull cycle after Donald Trump‚Äôs US Inauguration Day. At the time, Bitcoin soared past $109,000, setting a new ATH and surpassing previous records.

42118601,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142350,1742594450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breaking: Fidelity‚Äôs Groundbreaking Solana ETF Filing Ignites Crypto Investment Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fidelity-solana-etf-registration/,"Get ready for a potential shake-up in the crypto investment world! News just dropped that Fidelity Investments, a financial behemoth, has officially registered a ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù as a statutory trust in Delaware. This exciting development, first highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has sent ripples of anticipation through the cryptocurrency community. Could this be the precursor to a spot Solana ETF ? Let‚Äôs dive into what this registration means and why it could be a game-changer for both Solana and the broader crypto market. Fidelity Solana Fund Registration: What‚Äôs the Buzz About? So, what exactly happened? Fidelity, a name synonymous with traditional finance and now increasingly embracing the digital asset space, has taken a significant step by registering a fund specifically tied to Solana. According to public records in Delaware, the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is now officially on the books. This isn‚Äôt just another registration; it‚Äôs a clear signal of intent. But what kind of intent? Let‚Äôs break it down: Registration as a Statutory Trust: This legal structure is often used for ETFs. Think about it ‚Äì ETFs need a trust to hold the underlying assets. Registering as a statutory trust is a common and crucial step in the ETF creation process. ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù Name: The name itself is incredibly telling. It‚Äôs not just a generic crypto fund; it‚Äôs explicitly linked to Solana. This specificity suggests a focused approach on providing investment exposure to SOL. Timing and Market Context: This news comes at a time when the crypto market is showing signs of renewed vigor, and there‚Äôs increasing demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and demonstrated the appetite for such offerings. While registration doesn‚Äôt guarantee the launch of a spot Solana ETF , it‚Äôs a very strong indication that Fidelity is seriously considering this move. It‚Äôs like laying the foundation for a house ‚Äì you wouldn‚Äôt go through the trouble unless you planned to build something significant. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Monumental Leap for Crypto ETFs Let‚Äôs zoom out and understand why a potential spot Solana ETF is such a big deal, especially in the context of the evolving Crypto ETF landscape. We‚Äôve already seen the groundbreaking approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was a monumental victory, opening the doors for billions of dollars of institutional and retail investment to flow into Bitcoin through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. Now, Solana could be next in line, and here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs significant: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, the market is increasingly recognizing the potential of other cryptocurrencies like Solana. A spot Solana ETF would offer investors diversification within their crypto portfolio, moving beyond just Bitcoin exposure. Legitimizing Altcoins: The approval of a spot Solana ETF would further legitimize altcoins as a viable asset class. It signals to traditional investors that cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin are gaining institutional acceptance and regulatory consideration. Broader Market Access to Solana: Currently, investing directly in Solana requires navigating crypto exchanges, wallets, and understanding blockchain technology. A spot ETF removes these barriers, making Solana accessible to anyone with a brokerage account. This includes a vast pool of retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to directly engage with crypto. Institutional Interest in Solana: Fidelity‚Äôs move underscores growing institutional interest in Solana. Large financial players are recognizing Solana‚Äôs technology, ecosystem, and potential for future growth. An ETF would be a way for institutions to gain exposure to Solana in a regulated and compliant manner. The difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF is crucial here. A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset ‚Äì in this case, Solana. This is generally preferred by investors as it more accurately reflects the price movements of the cryptocurrency. Futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts, which can introduce complexities and tracking errors. The demand is clearly for spot crypto ETFs, and Fidelity seems to be listening. Unlocking Solana Investment: The Compelling Benefits of a Fidelity Solana ETF Imagine the doors that a Fidelity Solana Fund , potentially structured as a spot ETF, could open for investors. The benefits are numerous and compelling, spanning accessibility, legitimacy, and investment potential: Benefit Description Simplified Investment Access Investing in Solana becomes as easy as buying shares of a stock through a brokerage account. No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Increased Liquidity ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity. This makes it easier for investors to buy and sell Solana exposure at market prices. Enhanced Security and Custody Fidelity, a regulated financial institution, would handle the custody and security of the underlying Solana, mitigating risks associated with self-custody or exchange custody. Tax Advantages (Potentially) Depending on jurisdiction, investing through an ETF might offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption Catalyst A Solana ETF from a reputable firm like Fidelity could further encourage institutional adoption of Solana and other cryptocurrencies. Price Appreciation Potential Increased demand for Solana through an ETF could potentially drive up its price, benefiting early investors and the Solana ecosystem as a whole. For retail investors who have been curious about Solana but intimidated by the technicalities of crypto, a Solana ETF could be the perfect on-ramp. For institutional investors, it provides a regulated and compliant way to allocate capital to a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Considerations for a Spot Solana ETF While the registration of the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is undeniably exciting, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the path to a spot Solana ETF isn‚Äôt without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles, market volatility, and competition are all factors that need to be considered: SEC Approval: The biggest hurdle is, of course, obtaining approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, their stance on other cryptocurrencies remains to be fully seen. The SEC will need to be convinced that the Solana market is mature enough and resistant to manipulation for a spot ETF to be approved. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. This volatility could make a spot Crypto ETF a riskier investment compared to traditional ETFs. However, it also presents opportunities for high returns. Regulatory Landscape Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and viability of crypto ETFs. Competition: If Fidelity launches a Solana ETF, it‚Äôs likely to face competition from other asset managers who may also be eyeing the Solana ETF space. This competition could be beneficial for investors in the long run, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative products. Solana Network Risks: While Solana is a technologically advanced blockchain, it has faced challenges in the past, including network outages. Potential investors need to be aware of these risks associated with the underlying technology. Despite these challenges, the fact that Fidelity is moving forward with registration suggests a degree of optimism that these hurdles can be overcome. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has undoubtedly provided a blueprint and increased confidence in the possibility of spot altcoin ETFs. Solana‚Äôs Bright Future and the Expanding Horizons of Crypto Investment Why Solana? Why is Fidelity potentially betting on a Solana ETF ? The answer lies in Solana‚Äôs compelling technology and vibrant ecosystem. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs. It has attracted a thriving community of developers and users, building a diverse range of applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more. Here‚Äôs a quick look at Solana‚Äôs strengths: High Speed and Scalability: Solana is designed to handle a high volume of transactions at incredibly fast speeds, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time processing. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some other blockchains, Solana‚Äôs transaction fees are remarkably low, making it attractive for users and developers. Growing Ecosystem: Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with a growing number of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other innovative projects being built on the network. Strong Community Support: Solana has a passionate and active community that is constantly contributing to its growth and development. A spot Solana ETF could be a significant catalyst for further growth and adoption of Solana. It would bring increased capital into the Solana ecosystem, potentially fueling innovation and development. More broadly, it signals the continued maturation of the crypto investment landscape. We are moving beyond the early days of crypto being a niche asset class to a point where mainstream financial institutions are offering regulated investment products linked to a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Solana and Crypto ETFs? Fidelity‚Äôs registration of the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is more than just a procedural step; it‚Äôs a powerful statement about the future of Solana and the evolution of Crypto ETFs . While the launch of a spot Solana ETF is not yet guaranteed, this move significantly increases the likelihood and signals a growing confidence in Solana‚Äôs potential. For investors, it presents an exciting prospect ‚Äì the potential to access Solana investment through a familiar, regulated, and convenient ETF structure. Keep your eyes peeled ‚Äì this story is just beginning, and it could mark the start of a new chapter in crypto investment history.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase says its listing decentralized roll-up protocol AltLayer ( ALT ), decentralized finance network Pendle ( PENDLE ), and gamified learning platform Layer3 ( L3 ) to its listing roadmap. The crypto exchange‚Äôs listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to it means Coinbase is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the additions sprung the trio of assets to life as AltLayer ‚Äì a protocol that uses restaked rollups to enhance scalability ‚Äì went from a low of $0.0354 on March 20th to a peak of $0.0395 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.0376 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Pendle, a project that enables the trading and tokenization of yields, went from a price of $2.41 to a peak of $2.59 during the same time frame. However, the digital asset also retraced and is trading for $2.47 at time of writing, a gain of 1.2% on the day. Layer3, a web3 education program that teaches users through interaction and games, saw the biggest gains as it went from a low of $0.0577 on March 20th to a peak of $0.103 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is moving for $0.0820, a gain of 38.6% during the last day.

CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the company is ‚Äúengaging with a Big Four accounting firm,‚Äù though he didn‚Äôt say which one or when the audit would happen. He said it‚Äôs now ‚Äúfeasible‚Äù thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly policies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our top priority,‚Äù Ardoino said. He claims the regulatory environment has changed completely, and that Trump‚Äôs crypto push makes it easier. Tether has been promising transparency forever, but so far, it only puts out quarterly attestations, not full audits. Tether seeks Trump-era support to push audit forward Ardoino didn‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs PwC, EY, KPMG, or Deloitte‚Äîbut said they‚Äôre talking to one of them. He pointed to Trump‚Äôs stance as a green light. ‚ÄúIf the President of the United States says this is top priority for the U.S., Big Four auditing firms will have to listen,‚Äù he said. This is all part of Tether‚Äôs latest push to prove it actually backs the $140 billion worth of stablecoins it has issued. It says every coin is supported by dollar-denominated assets. The goal now is to finally show the math. The firm recently hired Simon McWilliams as CFO to lead the audit effort. This isn‚Äôt coming out of nowhere. Trump has signed an executive order for a strategic crypto reserve and is promising new rules for digital assets. Ardoino took a shot at U.S. regulators under Biden, calling their actions ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù a phrase the crypto crowd uses to describe the government‚Äôs campaign to cut off crypto from the banking system. Meanwhile, Tether keeps stacking U.S. debt. In 2024, it bought more than $33.1 billion in Treasury bills, making it the seventh biggest buyer of U.S. government debt. As of December 31, it held over $94 billion in Treasurys and more than $108 million in bank deposits, based on numbers from BDO Italia. According to Ardoino, 99% of those Treasury bills are held with Cantor Fitzgerald. And now that former Cantor CEO Howard Lutnick is Trump‚Äôs commerce secretary, it all sounds like one big reunion. Tether gets bigger than BlackRock, keeps dodging rules Tether has $120 billion in assets. Most of it is in U.S. Treasurys. The rest is a mix of bitcoin and gold. It made $6.2 billion in profit last year, beating BlackRock by $700 million. Ardoino bragged that with less than 100 employees, the company makes more money per person than anyone. But it‚Äôs not all glory. According to a Wall Street Journal report , this unregulated coin is getting used to get around U.S. sanctions. Russian oligarchs, Venezuelan oil firms, and even terror groups like Hamas have used Tether to move money. ‚ÄúWe need a regulatory framework that doesn‚Äôt allow offshore dollar-backed stablecoin providers to play by a different set of rules,‚Äù said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo in his testimony to Congress. He called out Tether by name. The Journal dug through blockchain data, court records, and private messages. They found Venezuelan oil payments made in Tether, sanctioned groups laundering money, and a huge black market. Tether says it freezes wallets tied to criminals. Ardoino claimed, ‚ÄúWe have a proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities.‚Äù That sounds nice, but ChainArgos says that from 2018 to June 2024, Tether blacklisted 2,713 wallets holding $153 billion. Only $1.4 billion was frozen. The rest moved too fast to catch. The company says it can track everything on public blockchains and even destroy tokens held in wallets if needed. But it‚Äôs like a never-ending Whac-A-Mole game. Tether turns up everywhere‚Äîwar zones, scams, economies in collapse Back in 2014, Tether started with a weird founding team. One of them, Giancarlo Devasini, was a plastic surgeon. Another was William Quigley, who called the idea of profiting from billions in backing ‚Äúa fantasy.‚Äù Quigley and the others left early. Devasini stayed and still runs the company today. He lives in a luxury villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Ardoino has become the face of it all. Tether really took off during the 2020‚Äì2021 bull run. Its market cap went from $4 billion to $80 billion fast. Traders loved it for moving in and out of bets without touching banks. Now, it‚Äôs used in all kinds of places regular dollars can‚Äôt go. In Iran, a platform called TetherLand lets people swap their rials for Tether. In Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is out of control, people use Tether to save money and make everyday purchases. Over 300 million people use Tether, according to Ardoino. But criminals use it too. Southeast Asian money launderers love Tether, according to a 2024 UN report. The tokens bounce from one wallet to another so fast it‚Äôs hard to trace them. That same report said Tether is a ‚Äúpreferred choice‚Äù for bad actors in the region. The structure is simple. Direct customers wire dollars to Tether Holdings, and the company issues tokens backed by U.S. Treasurys. But once those tokens hit the open market, anything can happen. Exchanges and brokerages all over the world move the coins, and nobody watches the secondary market. In Venezuela, PdVSA, the state oil company, started demanding oil payments in Tether in 2020. Buyers were told to send coins to specific wallets. Others just swapped suitcases of cash for Tether, then spent it on prepaid crypto cards. That setup didn‚Äôt just help Maduro‚Äôs government dodge sanctions‚Äîit fueled corruption. Middlemen kept the money. The scandal blew up so badly that it forced the oil minister to step down. ‚ÄúThis cryptocurrency‚Äôs use only has served to perpetuate gigantic levels of corruption,‚Äù said former oil minister Rafael Ram√≠rez. Even so, for regular Venezuelans, Tether became survival. Inflation hit 2 million percent. Currency controls blocked overseas payments. A guy named Guillermo Goncalvez started a platform called El Dorado that connects users for peer-to-peer Tether trading. The platform has over 150,000 users. ‚ÄúUSDT is the digital dollar for all Venezuelans,‚Äù he said. In Russia, Tether is everywhere. A report from a Russian research group found that importers use it to swap rubles for foreign currencies. Rosbank, a major lender, helps clients send Tether to suppliers. A fixer named Ekaterina Zhdanova arranged deals worth hundreds of millions in Tether, according to Telegram chats and blockchain data. She‚Äôs from a Siberian town but built a luxury business helping rich Russians dodge sanctions. She handled so much cash they needed planes to move it. One client wanted to buy $10 million in Tether per month for a total of $300 million. The money was going to be handed over in Turkey or the UAE. ‚ÄúThey will use planes to pick up the cash,‚Äù she said. Zhdanova was later sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. French cops arrested her at an airport as part of a separate money laundering case. She‚Äôs still in custody. Now, Tether is investing in businesses that use its token for daily payments. More usage means more token issuance. More issuance means more dollars to manage. In Tbilisi, Georgia, shops show the Tether logo outside. ATMs let people buy the coin with cash. It‚Äôs become the go-to currency when real dollars are blocked. Tether has become the shadow dollar‚Äîmoving money anywhere, fast, without much oversight. And now it wants a Big Four audit. Maybe. Eventually. If the vibes are right. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Korea: Here‚Äôs Why",https://cryptopotato.com/bitmex-kucoin-among-exchanges-reportedly-facing-sanctions-in-s-korea-heres-why/,"South Korean financial authorities are considering imposing sanctions on several crypto exchanges that have failed to comply with local regulations. According to a report from local media Korea Economic Daily, the crypto exchanges include BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX. S. Korea to Sanction Crypto Exchanges The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission said these overseas crypto trading platforms are operating illegally in the country because they have failed to report as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act. The Special Financial Transactions Act states that entities engaging in crypto trading, storage, and management in South Korea must formally report their activities to the FIU. Failure to do so could attract criminal punishment and administrative sanctions because the firms will be considered illegal businesses. In addition, these exchanges have been operating Korean-language websites without providing marketing and customer support for South Korean investors. As a result, the FIU is now investigating their activities, evaluating appropriate procedures with relevant organizations, and strongly considering measures like blocking site access. ‚ÄúWe are currently reviewing blocking access to unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year,‚Äù stated an FIU official. A Continuous Crackdown on Crypto Platforms This is not the first time financial authorities in South Korea have made moves to sanction or block investor access to non-compliant crypto exchanges. In September 2021, the FIU asked more than 60 exchanges that could not meet up with the local anti-money laundering (AML) rules and registration requirements to shut down their services and exit the country. At the time, only four trading platforms, including Upbit, Bithumb , Coinone, and Korbit, were fully operational, while about 28 others, which obtained security certificates, could offer certain services without won settlements. Furthermore, in 2022, the FIU asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission to block access to 16 overseas exchanges that failed to report their operations as VASPs. The regulatory agency also joined forces with local card companies to block crypto purchases and payment services made from these platforms. Earlier this year, the FIU revealed there are only 31 registered crypto firms in South Korea, down 26% from 42 in 2024. With the latest crackdown, that number is bound to shrink even further.

This prediction aligns with growing industry speculation, including comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has suggested that XRP ETFs could launch in the second half of 2025 . The prediction market‚Äôs surge in confidence follows multiple ETF filings, and the possibility of approval has generated significant anticipation within the crypto community, with many seeing it as a pivotal moment for XRP‚Äôs institutional adoption.

Institutional interest in digital assets has grown substantially, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in 2024. This momentum has led investors to speculate that regulators may soon greenlight additional crypto ETFs, including those tied to XRP. 11 notable firms including Bitwise and Franklin Templeton , have applied for XRP ETFs, and if approved, they would provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible vehicle to gain exposure to the digital asset. This could result in increased liquidity, heightened mainstream adoption, and further legitimization of XRP within the financial sector. One observer noted that an ETF approval could ‚Äúbring massive institutional inflows and solidify XRP‚Äôs place in the market.‚Äù We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Predictions The crypto community has reacted enthusiastically to the Polymarket prediction, with many believing approval is inevitable. One commenter expressed excitement for the ETFs, predicting that these could be approved by June or July. The growing number of filings suggests asset managers see potential in an XRP-based fund. Now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple, we could see more applications shortly. Outlook for 2025 The current sentiment surrounding an XRP ETF reflects broader expectations for regulatory advancements in the crypto space. As the year progresses, attention will be on the SEC‚Äôs approach to approving additional crypto-based financial products. The regulator has already acknowledged most of these filings. While this does not guarantee approval, it is a positive step that shows the SEC‚Äôs willingness to engage with the crypto industry and its offerings to consumers. With institutional demand rising and multiple filings already submitted, the approval of XRP ETF in 2025 appears increasingly likely. Polymarket‚Äôs prediction shows that the community is eager to see these products approved. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Calls for stablecoin regulation seek to establish uniform standards, easing compliance and reducing market uncertainty. These shifts may foster a clearer environment that encourages institutional participation and deeper market engagement. The evolving U.S. framework could set international benchmarks, prompting a broader rethinking of digital asset rules. Regulatory developments in cryptocurrency intensified this week, marked by two major U.S. events: the SEC ending its prominent legal dispute with Ripple over XRP, and President Donald Trump calling for clear stablecoin regulation . Additionally, the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash. Meanwhile, on the international stage, Germany‚Äôs BaFin intensified enforcement by cracking down on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token, while Pakistan actively considers legalizing cryptocurrency to stimulate economic growth. These events highlight the evolving global approach as nations seek clearer crypto regulation news, balancing innovation with oversight. SEC Ends Ripple Case, Shaping Crypto Regulation News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended its extended legal proceedings against Ripple, concluding the contentious debate over whether XRP qualifies as a security. Ripple‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the resolution on X, emphasizing that XRP was ultimately not classified as a security. This is it ‚Äì the moment we‚Äôve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal ‚Äì a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright. Let's build. pic.twitter.com/7WsD0C92Cm ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 19, 2025 Ripple maintained that XRP should not be regulated as a security, consistently challenging the SEC‚Äôs aggressive enforcement actions, which it claimed negatively impacted XRP investors. Legal experts view the case‚Äôs resolution as influential, potentially changing regulatory attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Legal expert Seth Goertz, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP and former federal prosecutor, indicated that the case‚Äôs outcome is key in establishing legal clarity for the crypto industry, particularly in defining when digital assets fall under securities regulations. Following the announcement, XRP experienced a sharp price increase, moving up to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and surpassing major stablecoins like Tether. This resolution is expected to encourage regulatory clarity and bolster investor confidence, especially among digital asset exchanges that previously operated under uncertain legal conditions. Daniel Stabile, from Winston & Strawn LLP, noted that the SEC‚Äôs decision to end the case may signal a broader shift toward allowing legislative and regulatory processes, rather than litigation, to set clear guidelines for crypto markets. As Ripple celebrates its legal win, another major political figure is stepping into the debate over cryptocurrency regulation . Trump Pushes for Stablecoin Regulation and U.S. Crypto Dominance In a virtual speech at the Digital Assets Summit in New York, Donald Trump urged Congress to pass stablecoin regulations with ‚Äúsimple, common-sense rules.‚Äù Today President Trump spoke at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit ‚Äî becoming the first sitting president in history to address a crypto conference. @blockworksDAS @POTUS pic.twitter.com/8aijMb1VcG ‚Äî David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 21, 2025 He also vowed to position the U.S. as a leading player in global cryptocurrency markets. This push for stablecoin regulation matches industry demands for clearer rules, balancing innovation and financial stability. If implemented, such legislation could clarify how stablecoins operate within the U.S. financial system, potentially attracting more institutional investors to the sector. Treasury Lifts Tornado Cash Sanctions, but Cautions Remain In a major reversal, the U.S. Treasury removed sanctions on Tornado Cash , the Ethereum-based mixer previously blacklisted for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions. You might also like US Treasury Removes Sanctions on Ethereum Mixer Tornado Cash This decision follows a reassessment of how financial sanctions apply to decentralized platforms, particularly as the crypto industry evolves. While the move marks a shift in the Treasury‚Äôs approach, officials stressed that they remain committed to combating financial crime. The agency highlights ongoing concerns over cyber threats, particularly state-sponsored hacking and money laundering linked to North Korea. U.S. residents and businesses were advised to be cautious when engaging with digital asset services that could be exploited for illicit purposes. The decision to lift sanctions suggests regulators may be moving toward a more nuanced approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) , recognizing both its risks and its potential. While the U.S. eases some crypto sanctions, European regulators are tightening oversight. Germany‚Äôs BaFin Cracks Down on Ethena‚Äôs USDe Token In Europe, Germany‚Äôs financial regulator BaFin took action against Ethena GmbH, freezing its asset reserves over concerns about the approval process for its USDe token. BaFin suspects that Ethena GmbH is offering unapproved securities, including USDe and sUSDe tokens, without proper authorization under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This move shows the increasing regulatory pressure in the European Union as authorities enforce the recently implemented MiCA framework. BaFin‚Äôs crackdown on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token highlights compliance challenges. Other crypto firms may also need to reassess their strategies to comply with MiCA. Not all countries share Europe‚Äôs caution‚ÄîPakistan is exploring crypto adoption as a growth strategy. Pakistan Considers Legalizing Crypto to Boost Economic Growth While some countries tighten restrictions, others are moving toward crypto adoption. Pakistan is exploring the legalization of cryptocurrency trading in an effort to attract international investment and stimulate economic growth. JUST IN: Pakistan to legalize cryptocurrency. ‚Äî Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 20, 2025 Bilal bin Saqib, chief advisor to Pakistan‚Äôs finance minister for digital assets, emphasized that the country wants to leverage its young, tech-savvy workforce to become a Web3 hub. With 60% of its population under the age of 30, Pakistan sees crypto as an opportunity for financial inclusion and technological advancement. If Pakistan successfully establishes a regulatory framework for crypto, it could position itself as a key player in the digital asset space, particularly in South Asia. However, uncertainty persists about how the government will balance oversight and innovation. The Future of Crypto Regulation: A Global Balancing Act This week‚Äôs developments highlight the complex and often contradictory nature of global crypto regulation news. The U.S. is showing signs of a more structured regulatory framework, while Europe is tightening enforcement. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Pakistan are looking to embrace crypto as a means of economic growth. As regulatory approaches evolve, governments worldwide recognize crypto‚Äôs lasting role in the financial sector. The challenge now is finding the right balance between oversight, innovation, and financial security. Whether through stablecoin regulations, sanctions revisions, or new frameworks for token approvals, the next few months could shape the future of crypto for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will the SEC‚Äôs withdrawal affect crypto enforcement? The SEC‚Äôs retreat signals a shift from heavy litigation to clear, consistent rules. This move aims to lower enforcement burdens and create a stable regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty for crypto operators. What benefits can clear stablecoin regulations offer? Defining stablecoin rules can standardize market practices and lower compliance costs. Clear guidelines boost investor confidence and spur innovation by cutting legal ambiguities that hinder institutional investment. How might these changes influence global crypto standards? U.S. policy shifts may set international benchmarks, encouraging other nations to streamline their frameworks. A unified approach can boost cross-border investments and harmonize digital asset practices globally. What impact could clearer crypto rules have on institutional investment? Clearer rules reduce legal risks and operational uncertainty, making the market more attractive to institutions. Predictable oversight can spur long-term investments and deepen overall market engagement. What further changes can we expect in the crypto regulatory landscape? We can expect incremental updates as regulators refine their approach through ongoing industry dialogue. Future measures will likely target major market players and clarify compliance standards for digital assets.

In the comment section of TON‚Äôs clarification post, many users praised the team for ending the confusion, while others reaffirmed their bullish sentiments, making it clear the little misunderstanding has not changed how they feel about Toncoin. Of course, there were also some who wanted to know who planted the rumor in the first place and also those who suspected foul play, as the clarification came about a day after the news had spread and caused a brief price surge for the TON token. One user implied the rumor was planted to ‚Äúhype‚Äù things up, while another implied that they waited for some time to retract the rumor so the token could pump. Whether this is true or not is up for speculation, but it is true that the TON token pumped almost 8% as a result of the VC investment rumors. At the time of this writing, the confusion has cleared up, and TON‚Äôs price is now worth $3.61, having fallen by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The fundraising confusion came days after Pavel Durov left France The confusion regarding TON receiving millions in funding from VCs comes days after Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the social messaging app Telegram, was allowed to fly home to Dubai. Telegram‚Äôs founder Pavel Durov shared a picture he claims is the new photo on his passport. Source: Pavel Durov (X/Twitter) The privilege does not mean he is free of all charges as the French authorities continue their unprecedented case against him. Durov was arrested in August after he was accused of not doing enough to properly moderate his app to curb criminality, even though Telegram has previously denied having insufficient moderation. The tech billionaire has denied not cooperating with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual abuse content and fraud. The case has attracted a lot of attention as it marks the first time a tech leader has been arrested for the lawlessness taking place on their platform. In a post on his Telegram channel, Durov expressed happiness to finally be home, but clarified that the ‚Äúprocess is ongoing.‚Äù He also thanked the French judges for letting him go home and praised his lawyers for their ‚Äúrelentless efforts in demonstrating that, when it comes to moderation, cooperation, and fighting crime, for years Telegram not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.‚Äù His arrest happened in August 2024 as he arrived in Paris on his private jet, and French judges initially banned him from leaving France. As for the conditions of his release, all we have to go on is what the office of the Paris prosecutor told the BBC on Monday, which is that ‚Äúthe obligations of judicial supervision‚Äù had been suspended between 15 March and 7 April. Durov, who was born in Russia, resides in Dubai. He also has residences in France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis. Since his arrest, Telegram has significantly altered the way it operates to deal with allegations that have dubbed it a portable version of the dark web. It has joined the Internet Watch Foundation program, which aims to help find, remove and report child sexual abuse material being shared online. According to an announcement from the app, it will also disclose the IP addresses/phone numbers of those who violate its rules and hand them over to police in response to valid legal requests. Telegram has also published transparency reports about how much content is taken down ‚Äì a standard industry practice it previously refused to comply with. A Telegram spokesperson has said the company now actively moderates its platform to get rid of harmful content each day. However, despite their best efforts, criminal activity persists and will probably continue until harsher measures are considered.

The regulator‚Äôs intervention is seen not merely as a punitive measure but as a wake-up call to reassess operational resilience in the evolving digital asset landscape. Market observers believe that such rigorous enforcement might restore investor confidence and encourage clearer standards across synthetic token markets. BaFin, Germany‚Äôs financial regulator, banned all public sales of Ethena GmbH‚Äôs USDe token this week, citing flaws in the approval process and violations of the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR). The regulator outlined several immediate actions against Ethena GmbH to enforce the ban. According to BaFin, the synthetic dollar token had been offered as an unregistered security in Germany, prompting the authority to restrict its operations without delay. BaFin Orders Asset Freeze and Website Shutdown for USDe Token In its announcement , BaFin instructed Ethena GmbH to freeze the reserve assets backing the USDe token and halt all new customer registrations. The company must also shut down its website, and a special representative has been appointed to oversee compliance with these directives. ‚ÄúThe BaFin also has reasonable grounds to suspect that Ethena GmbH in Germany sells securities in the form of sUSDe tokens from Ethena OpCo. Ltd. without the required prospectus,‚Äù the regulator said. Breaking: The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority announced that it had found serious flaws in Ethena GmbH's approval process for USDe tokens and ordered immediate enforcement measures to prohibit Ethena GmbH from further offering its USDe tokens to the public and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 21, 2025 ‚ÄúThe USDe and sUSDe tokens are interconnected in such a way that investors can receive a sUSDe token in exchange for a USDe token,‚Äù it added. Despite the prohibition on primary sales and issuance, secondary market trading of USDe remains unaffected by the ban. BaFin identified ‚Äúserious deficiencies‚Äù in Ethena GmbH‚Äôs approval process, including noncompliance with MiCAR‚Äôs capital and asset reserve requirements. Ethena GmbH had been operating under a transitional provision that allows issuers of asset-referenced tokens to continue business while awaiting regulatory approval. The company applied for authorization on July 29, 2024, a day before the deadline, and has been issuing USDe in Germany since June 28, 2024. Currently, approximately 5.4 billion USDe tokens are in circulation, with a substantial portion issued outside Germany before MiCAR took effect. To safeguard customer interests, BaFin has ordered the company‚Äôs asset reserves to block and restrict the authority of its managing directors over those funds. Holders of USDe tokens cannot redeem them directly with Ethena GmbH, though trading on secondary markets continues as normal. BaFin‚Äôs statement also raised concerns about the company issuing sUSDe tokens, suggesting they could constitute unregistered securities. The tokens are linked to USDe, allowing investors to exchange them while receiving additional returns. The regulator is now considering further enforcement actions, which could include a complete ban on the public offering of these securities. BaFin is overseeing the authorization process in collaboration with the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Further details will be provided upon completion of the licensing process. Ethena Defends USDe Token Amid BaFin Ban Following BaFin‚Äôs ban on USDe in Germany, Ethena Labs reassured users that redemptions remain unaffected through its British Virgin Islands-based entity, Ethena BVI Limited. The company, addressing the situation on X, stated that while its German subsidiary‚Äôs MiCAR application was denied, USDe remains fully backed. ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by this decision but will continue evaluating alternative regulatory frameworks,‚Äù Ethena wrote. Since its inception, Ethena has been exploring various options and jurisdictions when it comes to regulatory frameworks globally that would be conducive to our business, and as a result we have multiple entities within our structure facilitating minting and redemption. A MiCAR‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) March 21, 2025 The firm also dismissed claims that its assets were frozen, clarifying that all funds remain accessible. It plans to update its terms in the coming week to reflect the regulatory developments. Ethena‚Äôs regulatory challenges come as institutional interest grows. Recent investments include a $20 million backing from MEXC and a 500,000 ENA token purchase by World Liberty Financial. BaFin Tightens Oversight on Synthetic Assets Across Europe BaFin‚Äôs decision reflects the regulator‚Äôs cautious approach towards crypto assets operating within Germany‚Äôs jurisdiction. Its ban on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token highlights the tightening regulatory grip on stablecoins and synthetic dollar tokens in Germany and across Europe. With MiCAR enforcement ramping up, stablecoin and synthetic asset issuers will face increased scrutiny over compliance with capital, reserve, and disclosure requirements. The outcome of BaFin‚Äôs assessment of Ethena GmbH could set a precedent for how synthetic dollar tokens are regulated under MiCAR across the EU. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is BaFin‚Äôs ban of USDe actually protecting German innovation rather than hindering it? Counterintuitively, yes. By enforcing strict compliance standards early, BaFin creates a more predictable environment where legitimate crypto projects can thrive without unfair competition from operators who bypass proper authorization channels. Does this ban reflect MiCAR‚Äôs flexibility or its rigidity? Neither‚Äîit demonstrates MiCAR‚Äôs intentional interpretative space. Germany‚Äôs interpretation reveals how the regulation creates room for national authorities to calibrate enforcement based on local market conditions and risk appetites. Is this primarily about USDe‚Äôs technology or about EU regulatory sovereignty? The latter. This action positions Europe as asserting regulatory independence from both American permissiveness and Chinese restriction, establishing a distinct ‚Äúthird way‚Äù in global crypto governance.

Key Metrics Show $200,000 Prediction Is Likely",https://coingape.com/is-bitcoin-price-bottom-in-key-metrics-show-rally-is-likely/,"Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility is slowing down as the coin‚Äôs capitulation continues. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs price was changing hands for $84,278.83 as it pared off the losses accrued in earlier trading. At this pace, the question now hinges on whether BTC can form sustainable support at the $84,000 price mark or whether further drawdown lies ahead. Core Bitcoin Price Metric to Watch According to Glassnode data , BTC Short-Term Holders (STH) are under increasing pressure. This group‚Äôs unrealized losses have surged, pushing many STH coins into losses. As revealed, their holdings are now nearing the two-standard deviation threshold. Despite this outlook, the data platform hinted that losses remain within historical bull market bounds. Specifically, it noted that these losses are less severe than the May 2021 sell-off from the all-time high. Glassnode said the rolling 30-day losses for STH have topped $7 billion. It confirmed that ‚Äúthis remains well below prior capitulation events, such as the $19.8B and $20.7B losses in 2021-22.‚Äù BTC price jumped to an ATH above $109,000 in January but has since dropped by 22.79%. While experts predicted a drop of over 35%, the limited loss from holders can form a good rebound basis. BTC Price Bottom In, Here Are Triggers for Rally Over the past week, Bitcoin has rallied within very tight price ranges, from a low of $81,300 to a high of $87,320. Some market observers believe the coin has attained its floor price and might be set for a rebound. While firms like Strategy have kept Bitcoin purchase plans alive with Strife‚Äôs perpetual stock offering , the Global Money Supply M2 also lays a positive basis for growth. With the current outlook, the projection that the $83,00 level is the BTC price floor is resounding among analysts. The shift in regulation and the backing of Bitcoin by President Donald Trump creates a tailwind for the coin‚Äôs proponents. At the Digital Asset Summit earlier this week, President Trump reiterated the plan to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Several government agencies have shifted their policies in this regard, which might attract investors in the long term. How High Can Bitcoin Valuation Rise? Despite the slowdown in growth in recent weeks, many market leaders are still confident in the coin‚Äôs prospects. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan maintained the price target of $1 million by 2029. He cited a longer-term reaction to macroeconomic uncertainties as the basis for his prediction. While this Bitcoin price prediction appears lofty, others believe Bitcoin may cross $200,000 once the bull rally returns. With spot Bitcoin ETF hype and other growing institutional adoption, BTC price has an arguably bright future. The post Is Bitcoin Price Bottom In?

His analysis also revealed the major support and resistance levels to watch out for as the foremost meme coin continues to trade sideways. Dogecoin Price Trading In A No Trade Zone In an X post , Crypto VIP stated that the Dogecoin price is currently in a no-trade zone. He noted that after a downtrend, DOGE is now trading within a range . The analyst added that a break out of this range will determine the next movement. As such, he believes that it is better to wait for a break above the resistance area or a retest of the support area before making any new entries. Crypto VIP mentioned $0.143 to $0.149 as the support area to watch out for and $0.176 to $0.187 as the resistance areas to watch out for. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could face another major resistance between $0.23 and $0.24 if it breaks out from the $0.187 resistance. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez seems more confident that the Dogecoin price will break out to the upside. In an X post, he asserted that DOGE will break out. Martinez remarked that a close outside $0.16 to $0.18 could trigger a 16% price move. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reclaim the psychological $0.20 price level in the process. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi stated that these days might be the last time that market participants see the Dogecoin price under $0.18, suggesting that a bullish reversal was on the horizon. His accompanying chart showed that the foremost meme coin would still rally to as high as $0.8, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for DOGE. The analyst also recently predicted that Dogecoin could hit $1 by June. DOGE Could First Retest $0.143 Support Level In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted that the Dogecoin price could first retest the $0.14 support level before any bullish reversal. Alluding to the daily chart, he noted that DOGE is giving out a bearish candlestick pattern, the Bearish Tweezer, with a false breakout at the $0.176 resistance level. In line with this, he remarked that it is more likely to move downward to test the previous support level of $0.143 again, potentially forming a sideways range between $0.143 and $0.176. For the Dogecoin price to break $0.176, the analyst remarked that it needs to build momentum with higher lows just below $0.176. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.164, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoins|Dogecoin|Ali Maartinez|Coinmarketcap|Crypto VIP|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Master Kenobi|No-Trade Zone|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-21 23:00:23

The Financial Services panel will then review the bill on April 2. So far, the Trump administration has been very vocal about its crypto support and the need for a stablecoin bill. However, bipartisan support for crypto is growing significantly, increasing the likelihood that the stablecoin bill will be fully approved. The stablecoin bill has received support from both Republicans and Democrats A key House Committee is likely to vote in favour of the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) first proposed the bill, which has quickly earned the support of both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Genius Act, and five of the committee‚Äôs 11 Democrats joined the Republican majority to support the bill. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers will have the choice of both federal and state charters based on market capitalisation. Moreover, foreign issuers will be obligated to follow The nation‚Äôs protocols on reserves, anti-money laundering measures, sanctions compliance, and liquidity. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan, even commented, ‚ÄúThe reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.‚Äù Maxine Walters and Elizabeth Warren believe the bill fails to protect consumers adequately Like many other analysts and crypto enthusiasts, Chairman French Hill believes the stablecoin market should be regulated. Hill claimed that a regulated stablecoin environment would yield a stronger dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms that have presented their legislative agenda in the Capitol before have also consistently promoted stablecoins as a means to improving financial inclusion and a much cheaper and faster transaction option. However, Maxine Walters, the top Democrat on the House committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts believe the bill will not protect consumers adequately. They also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk‚Äôs X or Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins. Other critics have also raised concerns about the lack of stablecoin FDIC insurance, fearing huge losses for users if the token collapses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Deribit leads crypto options trading, a market segment that has expanded rapidly in recent years as institutional investors seek exposure to digital assets through derivatives. Its acquisition would allow Coinbase to strengthen its footprint in this fast-growing segment. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, has been growing its presence in the derivatives space as part of its broader strategy. If completed, the acquisition would bolster Coinbase‚Äôs position in the crypto derivatives market as demand for regulated platforms increases. Coinbase Derivatives Expansion Includes ADA, Natural Gas Futures Amid Deribit Talks As Coinbase explores acquiring crypto options exchange Deribit, the company is also advancing its derivatives strategy, seeking regulatory approval for new futures contracts. On March 15, Coinbase Derivatives filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to self-certify futures for Cardano (ADA) and Natural Gas (NGS), signaling a broader push into both crypto and traditional commodities. If the CFTC raises no objections, trading could begin as early as March 31. This move follows the recent launch of Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR) futures. We're excited to announce that Coinbase Derivatives has filed with the CFTC to self-certify Natural Gas (NGS) futures and Cardano ( $ADA ) futures‚Äîexpanding our offerings in both energy and crypto derivatives markets.

Cardano, known for its scalable and energy-efficient blockchain, has seen growing adoption in DeFi and enterprise use cases. Following the announcement, ADA rose 2%, hitting $0.75, according to CoinGecko. Beyond crypto assets, Coinbase is also diversifying its offerings. The introduction of Natural Gas futures marks Coinbase‚Äôs first venture into the energy sector, positioning it as a competitor to traditional futures exchanges. Natural gas‚Äôs importance in global markets could attract institutional traders beyond crypto. Beyond its latest futures filings, Coinbase is set to launch 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures in the U.S., aligning domestic markets with global trading standards. Crypto derivatives account for 75% of global trading volumes, and Coinbase‚Äôs expansion seeks to attract more of this activity to U.S. markets while staying compliant with CFTC regulations. Coinbase ranks as the largest Ethereum staking operator , holding 11.42% of staked ETH. With 3.84 million ETH staked and near-perfect validator uptime, the exchange continues strengthening its influence across trading and staking sectors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What could this deal indicate about evolving trends in crypto derivatives? This potential acquisition hints at an industry shift. Exchanges are broadening their toolset to offer comprehensive trading options, reflecting rising investor interest and evolving regulatory norms in digital assets. How might a unified license structure impact crypto market compliance? Uniting licenses under a single operator may simplify compliance checks and encourage uniform oversight. This consolidation could ease regulatory processes and offer a steadier framework for digital asset trades. What long-term impacts could arise from integrating options trading with existing platforms? Merging options trading into established platforms may boost market engagement and broaden revenue streams. This integration supports legacy exchanges in adapting offerings to meet evolving investor demand and digital market shifts.

Based on recent data, around 8.97 million ETH are in their possession now. This shortage comes as the price of Ethereum has taken a precipitous decline. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin In New Whale Hands‚ÄîA Mega BTC Rally On The Horizon? Supply Tightens On Exchanges The declining volume of Ether on exchanges is an indication that the holders are taking their money elsewhere in growing numbers. One of the main reasons behind this is the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, according to a recent examination by Santiment. People are interacting with several DeFi protocols with their Ethereum to lend liquidity or earn rewards. Another principal element is the expansion of staking, whereby ETH owners ‚Äúlock up‚Äù their coins to help secure the network and be rewarded while doing so. Therefore, there is fewer Ethereum to sell on the exchanges. üëã Thanks to the many DeFi and staking options, Ethereum‚Äôs holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015). There is 16.4% less $ETH on exchanges compared to just 7 weeks ago. üòÆ pic.twitter.com/r5957wPhLi ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 20, 2025 Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Despite the lower supply of Ethereum on exchanges, which some would expect to drive prices up because of scarcity, the opposite has occurred. Based on latest figures, the price of Ethereum has dropped by about 45% from its December high. On March 21, the price was about $1,899. Ethereum has been among the worst-performing major cryptocurrencies over the past few years. The cause for such a decline in price is varied and can involve overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and increased competition from other blockchain systems. Experts Share Their Thoughts Financial analysts are giving their opinions regarding what this means for the future value of Ethereum. Standard Chartered, a well-known financial institution, has recently reduced its year-end price target for Ethereum. They now predict a price of $4,000 at the end of the year, a significant drop from their previous estimate of $10,000. The primary purpose of this revision is the rising competition from Ethereum‚Äôs competitor layer-2 networks, which aim to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum foundation blockchain. Users and traffic on such networks can be different from the central Ethereum network. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It‚Äôs Lift-Off Time Upsides On The Horizon? Despite the current price hiccups, there are potential explanations why a recovery could be realized. One possibility is staking exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

In 2020, this so-called ‚ÄúDogecoin killer‚Äù launched with barely any fanfare. The entry price was so microscopic that even a hundred bucks could‚Äôve fetched millions of tokens. Fast forward to today, and those same early investors are sitting on insane profits‚Äîsome turning a few hundred dollars into millions. But let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîShiba Inu‚Äôs explosive moment has passed. The days of getting in at a rock-bottom price and riding a rocket to the moon are over. It‚Äôs already mainstream, and massive gains aren‚Äôt as easy. But here‚Äôs the thing about meme coins: there‚Äôs always a next big play. Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a brand-new meme coin that isn‚Äôt just another Shiba Inu wannabe‚Äîit‚Äôs rewriting the script. Arctic Pablo isn‚Äôt riding on the past success of other tokens. It‚Äôs carving out its own legacy with an immersive story, a lucrative staking system, and an insanely limited-time presale where early adopters can get in at a fraction of its potential worth. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Frontier in Meme Coins Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors on an adventurous journey alongside its eponymous explorer, Arctic Pablo. Set against the backdrop of icy terrains and mystical ice-covered islands, Pablo‚Äôs quest is not just about exploration but also about uncovering the enigmatic $APC coins. These tokens symbolize more than mere currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity, imbued with the magic of forgotten lands. This storytelling approach transforms the investment experience, making participants feel like integral parts of an unfolding legend. Departing from traditional presale models, Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is structured around Pablo‚Äôs journey through various mythical locations. Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is in the Nippy Nook location, the 15th phase of its journey. The token is priced at $0.000079, with over $1.96 million raised so far. The launch price is $0.008, offering early investors a potential return on investment (ROI) of over 10,027.85% from the current presale price to the listing price. An investment of $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 12,656,860 APC tokens, which could be worth $101,254.88 upon reaching the listing price. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance token scarcity and value through weekly token burns. At the end of each presale phase, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens over time. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Its one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now . The Shiba Inu Phenomenon: A Missed Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene as a decentralized meme token, positioning itself as an experiment in community-driven cryptocurrency. Launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly gained traction, riding on the coattails of Dogecoin‚Äôs popularity. Its initial price was minuscule, allowing early investors to acquire large quantities with minimal capital. As the coin gained popularity, its value soared, creating substantial returns for those who got in early. However, as with many rapidly appreciating assets, the window for maximum gains was narrow. Many potential investors were on the sidelines, watching SHIB‚Äôs value escalate beyond their reach. This scenario underscores the importance of identifying and acting on emerging opportunities before they become mainstream. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities for investors. While the Shiba Inu moment may have passed, Arctic Pablo Coin is a compelling contender among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Its unique narrative, innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanisms, and attractive staking rewards position it as a project with significant potential. Investors seeking to capitalize on low entry points and participate in a community-driven adventure should join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now, before this opportunity, too, becomes a tale of missed chances. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)?

Two established coins, Dogecoin and Cardano, are currently struggling, creating room for a new project like RCO Finance to shine. Investors are rapidly taking notice, shifting toward projects that can deliver real value alongside massive profits. Dogecoin Struggles as Miners Dump Millions of Tokens Dogecoin (DOGE), once touted as one of the top altcoins to watch, has been going through a rough patch lately. An analyst recently shared data revealing Dogecoin miners sold off over 65 million tokens in just 48 hours. Such significant selling pressure from miners usually signals trouble, potentially pushing the meme coin even lower. At the current price of $0.17, Dogecoin sits far below its peak of $0.431 from January. Analysts warn if this selling continues, DOGE could slip under $0.15 soon. However, some traders remain hopeful, believing past patterns could bring a major comeback. Notably, large-scale investors bought over 1.4 billion DOGE in a single day last week, hinting that ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù may expect a bullish turn. This mixed sentiment makes Dogecoin one of the key altcoins to watch closely. Source: Coinmarketcap Cardano Losing Investor Interest Amid Declining Volume Cardano (ADA), another top altcoin, isn‚Äôt faring much better. ADA is currently priced at $0.7086, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Even more concerning is that its trading volume dropped significantly by over 20% , hinting that investors might be losing interest in Cardano‚Äôs previously compelling story. With ADA down 1.58% this week and a declining volume, analysts see signs of a potential trend reversal. Cardano‚Äôs slow pace in delivering promised upgrades, coupled with current macroeconomic conditions, has investors reconsidering their holdings and seeking alternative altcoins with stronger growth potential. This cautious sentiment toward Cardano might encourage traders to explore other altcoins to watch‚Äîespecially those showing increased market excitement and rapid growth potential, like RCO Finance. Source: Coinmarketcap RCO Finance Emerges as the Most Promising Altcoin of 2025 While established coins like Dogecoin and Cardano struggle, investors are swiftly turning toward RCO Finance , recognizing it as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Currently priced at only $0.1 and boasting a modest market cap of $591,220, investors see a huge growth runway ahead. RCO Finance isn‚Äôt just another crypto platform; it‚Äôs a revolutionary decentralized financial ecosystem. Users can buy crypto, stocks, real estate, and numerous tokenized assets‚Äîall seamlessly from a single account, without cumbersome KYC processes. This simplicity makes investing hassle-free, attracting new users in droves. But what really sets RCO Finance apart from other altcoins is its advanced AI Robo Advisor. This innovative tool continuously monitors the crypto market, analyzing live data from reliable sources like Reuters and Bloomberg, along with comprehensive on-chain analytics. Imagine spotting opportunities early, like the recent surge in Immutable X (IMX), which exploded from $0.4 to $1.2‚Äîa +200% gain within just months. RCO Finance‚Äôs Robo Advisor could have caught such price moves well before mainstream traders noticed, helping investors get in early and maximize profits. Additionally, RCO Finance offers an extensive range of 120,000 assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, and tokenized real estate. Investors can conveniently diversify their portfolios without converting crypto into fiat first, all within one simple platform. Investor enthusiasm is evident, as RCO Finance has raised over $13 million already, showcasing robust community backing. Analysts expect a massive rally post-launch, with predictions suggesting gains of up to 20,000%. To put this into perspective, a modest $500 investment today could potentially grow to $100,000. It has also been audited by SolidProof , a popular auditor in the field, verifying its security, trustworthiness, and reliability. In addition to that, investors already get to experiment with its functionalities with the newly released Beta Platform . Why RCO Finance is a Must-Have Altcoin Before the Bull Market Returns Given the current crypto landscape, RCO Finance is perfectly positioned to become one of the most profitable altcoins this year. With features like its AI-powered Robo Advisor, no-KYC simplicity, and robust staking options, the platform offers unmatched potential. As the crypto market prepares for its next bullish phase, this might be the last chance to enter RCO Finance at its current presale price. The extraordinary profit potential and real-world functionality mean it‚Äôs a strong contender to outperform traditional favorites like Dogecoin and Cardano. When the market turns, you want to be holding the best-performing altcoins‚Äîthose with strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. RCO Finance is clearly leading the way, offering investors the tools to succeed in the next crypto boom.

Freysa AI‚Äôs native asset, FAI , is trading at $0.0226 at time of writing, up from around $0.0183 a day ago. The 298th-ranked crypto asset by market cap launched in late November.

Being added to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering adding trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was created in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company‚Äôs standards. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it‚Äôs probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it.

America‚Äôs budget-neutral means of financing its SBR Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins‚Äô Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. He said, ‚ÄúIf we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.‚Äù How does revaluing the gold certificates work? Lummins‚Äô push and, therefore, Hines‚Äô stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037 , which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold‚Äôs current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M) , bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B ‚Äì $11B). As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold‚Äôs prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers‚Äô funds. Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates‚Äô scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the‚ÄÇTreasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations. Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue. Revaluing gold certificates‚ÄÇis a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed‚ÄÇbonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve. Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR‚ÄÇvia decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

Here‚Äôs how Coinbase latest $5 bilion acquisition deal could impact Bitcoin prices in the long-term . Bitcoin holds $84K as Coinbase moves to Acquire Deribit Bitcoin (BTC) closed trading around the $84,200 mark on Friday, March 22, as markets retreated from upwards volatility triggered by Trump‚Äôs appearance at Blockwork‚Äôs Digital Asset Summit. Following Trump‚Äôs speech advocating for Stablecoin regulations , and long-term BTC holding, BTC price raced to a weekly timeframe peak of $85,900 before returning 4% to close trading on Friday around $84,228. The impact of Trump‚Äôs BTC price was short-lived since his major talking points during speech had been relatively priced in during the previous market really. However, a recent media report surrounding Coinbase acquisition of derivatives-based crypto exchange could have far reaching longer-term impacts on Bitcoin price. Bitcoin price action | March 22, 2025 According to Bloomberg reports, Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange has entered advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the world‚Äôs leading bitcoin and ether options trading platform. Notably Bloomberg cited anonymous sources in the report , showing that the deal has not yet being made official. ‚ÄúThe companies have notified regulators in Dubai about the discussions as Deribit holds a license there, which would be taken over by any acquirer.‚Äù ‚Äì Bloomberg, March 21, 2025. Coinbase representatives were also coy on the rumours, declining to confirm any ongoing deal discussions. , ‚ÄúWe have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner and invest to accelerate our roadmap.‚Äù ‚Äì Coinbase. While official sources from Deribit and Coinbase keep mum, Bloomberg‚Äôs latest report suggests negotiations are progressing with the options trading platform reportedly valued between $4 billion and $5 billion. Coinbase (COIN) Traders See Mild Gains as Deribit acquisition hints Dubia Expansion Considering that Deribit holds an active license to operate in Dubai, Coinbase‚Äôs decision to pursue this acquisition appears to be a strategic move to expand into the Middle Eastern market. With increasing regulatory pressure from the U.S. and EU, regions such as the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore have emerged as key global hubs for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses. Coinbase (Coin) price surges 4.4% to hit $190 as Bloomberg reveals Deribit acquisition talks | March 21, 2025 The softening stance on crypto regulation in the U.S. could influence the trajectory of this deal. With growing institutional support and strategic reserve announcements expected, the industry could witness a shift in policy under former President Trump‚Äôs potential return. Trump recently reiterated his support for cryptocurrency at Blockworks‚Äô industry event this week. If finalized, Coinbase‚Äôs acquisition of Deribit could enhance its global footprint, broaden its derivatives offerings, and position the exchange to benefit from increasing institutional and sovereign adoption of cryptocurrencies‚Äîparticularly in the Middle East and Asia. Will Coinbase Acquisition of Deribit Impact Bitcoin Price? According to Bloomberg Deribit it‚Äôs the largest Options trading platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Options trading is an institution-dominated space. By acquiring Deribit, Coinbase can deploy options trading offerings, not only to US-based customers but also institutions with corporate headquarters in crypto hotbeds like Dubia, Singapore and Hong kong. Hence, the Coinbase acquisition deal for Deribit, could be yet another major catalyst that could spark increased institutional adoption of BTC in the months ahead. Notably, Donald Trump crypto strategic reserve heading for congressional approval could be a key determinant in Bitcoin global appeal as 2025 unfolds. Bitcoin price forecast: Double-bottom pattern hints at $114,000 rebound target Bitcoin price forecast signals on the BTCUSD daily chart shows a confirmed double-bottom reversal pattern, a historically bullish structure suggesting a potential move toward a long-term target of $114,000. The pattern formed with two distinct lows, at $78,000 and $76,000 followed by a breakout above the neckline resistance. At press time BTC Price is currently consolidating around $84,053, hovering near the middle Keltner Channel (KC) level of $85,392, indicating a neutral market trend as traders await the next major directional move. A bullish scenario could unfold if Bitcoin price can decisively reclaim the upper KC boundary at $93,252, especially if accompanied by increased trading volumes. More so, the BBP (Balanced Bull and Bear Power) indicator, while still negative at -859.38, has begun a reversal with green bars emerging‚Äîan early signal of bullish divergence. Conversely, failure to hold support at $77,533‚Äîthe lower KC band‚Äîcould invalidate the breakout structure, triggering renewed selling pressure. If bears regain control in the secenraio, BTC price risks retesting liquidity zones around $75,000, delaying the bullish trajectory. The next few sessions could be pivotal; as sustained price action above $85,000 strengthens could case for a continued uptrend toward the $114,00o target.

The Tron ecosystem is pushing a new proposal to implement a Bitcoin-like halving for TRX. In his post on X, Justin Sun revealed how the move will not disadvantage current validators in the ecosystem. Justin Sun and Advocacy for TRX Halving As explained on X by the Tron founder, Bitcoin developers had to evolve to limit their reward to users involved in crypto mining at the time. Going back memory lane, he noted that Bitcoin had to create an attractive 50 BTC per block reward to bootstrap the network. However, as the protocol grew, halving helped reduce the incentives to a sustainable level. Liking it to the Tron ecosystem, Justin Sun recounted that TRX is a deflationary asset that drops 1% per year. This made it the only deflationary asset among the top assets. As revealed, the massive rally in the price of TRX has pushed up the reward considerably. This, he believes, might make sense if a moderate slash is approved by the community. Per the analogy, he noted that the Tron ecosystem can achieve a 1.5% per year deflation by paying out about 1 million TRX in validator rewards daily. Notably, increasing this daily payout to 2 million TRX will increase deflation by 2% per year. To Sun, even if the community approved the halving reduction, Tron will remain an attractive chain for miners. The Tron Ecosystem Updates Beyond the TRX halving clarification, Justin Sun has been front-running many positive ecosystem updates. Over the past week, the Tron Founder has revealed the push for Tron integration on Solana . This partnership is poised to increase the transfer of native tokens across both chains. In addition, the ecosystem is also being increasingly embraced by top industry stakeholders. CoinGape reported that Justin Sun was appointed an advisor to President Trump-linked World Liberty Financial International (WLFi). Since then, TRX has remained a favorite for the coin in WLFi‚Äôs portfolio. Reports also show that TRX may bag an inclusion in the crypto reserve that the US government is putting together. TRX Price and Performance Outlook The price of TRX remains under the radar amid the growing shift in network supply and related trends. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.2366, up by 0.13% in 24 hours. Amid the week-long fluctuations, the coin‚Äôs price rose from a low of $0.2305 to a high of $0.2373, showing a relatively mild volatility. However, earlier TRX price predictions from Sun teased the coin as hitting an all-time high soon. Analysts remain speculative about how the Tron halving proposal will shape out and its impact on price.

In response to an inquiry on professional orientation for all Gen Z high school graduates this year, Altman responded that studying AI tools is essential to succeed at work now. He argued that AI rapidly transforms work, and studying those skills makes sense. Altman drew an analogy by stating that during his high school days, when he studied how to program, it was the most stable route to decent-paying jobs. AI is already having‚ÄÇa huge influence in the tech world. According to Sam Altman, AI currently handles about half the coding at‚ÄÇmost companies. Some experts, like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, reckon AI will be capable of‚ÄÇ90% of coding in three to 6 months. That shift is leading companies to rethink‚ÄÇtheir hiring practices. Software engineers will not be extinct. However, businesses now need individuals who can work with and utilize AI‚ÄÇcapabilities. This is evident in job postings‚ÄÇat big employers like Apple, Amazon, and Meta, which recently offered seven-figure salaries for the best AI scientists. AI literacy has become the most sought-after skill According to a recent report by LinkedIn , AI literacy is the fastest emerging‚ÄÇskill for 2025. Companies‚ÄÇin all sectors want someone who understands AI and can wield it for problem-solving and innovation. The report describes AI literacy as a general skill covering knowledge and using tools like ChatGPT and other generative technologies. No one can deny it‚Äîit‚Äôs not just an inevitable part of the life of a‚ÄÇtech whiz anymore. Business, marketing, media, and communication professionals also use AI to enhance their work. Programmer engaged in coding: Source: Pixabay AI literacy allows people to leverage AI-powered tools, which can be applied without advanced‚ÄÇtechnical know-how for model building or data analysis. With artificial intelligence emerging as a powerful component in personal and professional workflows, engineers and tech professionals are adopting AI to automate processes, increase efficiency, and drive innovation. But getting one‚ÄÇof these lucrative AI jobs is no easy feat. As LinkedIn‚Äôs editor-in-chief, Dan Roth, reported today, while the fingertips attached to the dwindling hiring rate are at 3.4%,‚ÄÇpeople are applying in droves. He said companies are hiring less. It‚Äôs not a catastrophe, but it‚Äôs not good out there. AI skills are important, of course, but they are‚ÄÇnot the only way to future-proof yourself at work. Soft skills are‚ÄÇmore important than ever. Indeed‚Äôs chief executive, Chris Hyams, told Fortune that employers should focus on candidates with ‚Äúcuriosity and an openness‚Äù to learn. Adapting and bouncing‚ÄÇback will be crucial in navigating a shifting labour market. Soft skills remain important even with AI expertise While AI capabilities are an asset, technical skills alone will not be enough. Altman recommends Gen Z consider soft skills such as adaptability and resilience. As the employment landscape continues to shift, employees who can easily learn new technology will be sought after. Indeed chief executive Chris Hyams agrees. He recommends hiring managers seek out inquisitive applicants who will be adaptable. As AI automates more things, businesses still need people who can analyze, innovate and adapt. Despite formal education initiatives or self-instructing using AI tools‚ÄÇlike Google‚Äôs NotebookLM, younger professionals must stay ahead of the curve. According to Altman, as AI advances and the career sector is primed for disruption, Gen Z should use‚ÄÇsuch tools in their favour to stay at the forefront.

Rival Token Poised for Bigger Returns in the Next 3 Months,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ada-breakout-to-1-50-rival-token-poised-for-bigger-returns-in-the-next-3-months/,"As bullish momentum gathers steam behind a‚ÄÇpotential breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, Cardano (ADA) retires above $0.72. Analysts are forecasting a rally to $1.00 as buying pressure persists, though‚ÄÇwhale activity potentially undermines this trend. In the last few days, over 100 million ADA tokens have‚ÄÇbeen splashed on markets, and short-term stability is doubtful. As Cardano‚Äôs technical indicators suggest it may have hit‚ÄÇthe bottom, another project is stealing the limelight‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM), a recently launched presale that‚Äôs already blitzed past $4.1 million and is forecasting 10x+ gains after its token launch. Cardano‚Äôs Shaky Ascent The 4-hour chart of Cardano glooming a triple white soldier pattern with‚ÄÇthree consecutive green candles in the tug-of-war game between the bulls and bears. This usually indicates upward momentum, but ADA‚Äôs 2.82% intraday increase to $0.7246‚ÄÇis facing resistance. The MACD indicator approaches a bullish crossover, which‚ÄÇis complemented by RSI readings approaching neutrality. But according to data from Santiment, a grim truth is being unearthed:‚ÄÇwhales have dumped 100 million ADA in a week, cutting big holders balances to only 5.89 billion tokens. Such sell-offs could put a lid on gains at‚ÄÇ$1.00, well below the $1.50 that some optimists see. Key support comes in at $0.65; a break there threatens a drop to‚ÄÇ$0.60. Presale Momentum‚ÄÇof Mutuum Finance Builds As Cardano faces volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to forge ahead into phase 3 of its presale at‚ÄÇ$0.02 per token. More than 6,300‚ÄÇinvestors have already joined, driving a $4.1 million raise. Phase‚ÄÇ3 is nearly sold out before Phase 4, where prices will increase 25% to $0.025. Early investors securing their tokens now can already make 200% when the launch comes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will‚ÄÇhit the market at $0.06. After the initial jump, analysts predict $3.00 within months of exchanges (14,900%‚ÄÇabove current prices). Mutuum Finance‚Äôs tokenomics include a buy-and-distribute model with platform‚ÄÇrevenue redirected to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from open markets. These tokens go back to stakers, driving repeated buying pressure while‚ÄÇpreventing sell-offs. At the same time, the protocol‚Äôs lending infrastructure ‚Äî with overcollateralized loans and mtTokens that accrue interest‚ÄÇ‚Äî ensures utility. A Certik audit of its smart contracts is being finalized by developers ‚Äî an‚ÄÇachievement likely to lend credibility to the project once officially announced. The Window‚ÄÇfor Strategic Choice Reshapes Unlike whale pump and dump actions that mask any path to success, Mutuum Finance represents a‚ÄÇquantifiable opportunity. Its presale system offers early investors a 200% launch return and targets on post-listing price action dwarf‚ÄÇADA‚Äôs vague estimates. With Phase‚ÄÇ3 almost full, the time left to acquire token at $0.02 is narrowing down. Adventurous‚ÄÇinvestors have begun to lend an ear and stop shuffling deck chairs; through a systemic approach to demand generation and real-world DeFi utility, this prototype asset has proved itself to be valuable in its own right, and with it, those who prioritize measurable gains can find respite in the lovely new world of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This will soon be topped by the completion of its Certik audit, which can act as a catalyst for adoption, as confirmed via Mutuum Finance‚ÄÇsocial channel. For individuals looking for asymmetric results within a volatile crypto marketplace,‚ÄÇthe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is a deliberate point of entry‚Äî a convergence of tokenomics and timing. Fewer tokens are‚ÄÇavailable now and you can secure before Phase 3 is over making the tokens more expensive.

Unlike volatile price swings seen in other assets, TON‚Äôs consistent rise signals strong underlying demand and market stability. The cryptocurrency has successfully held key support levels, preventing major pullbacks and allowing buyers to take control of the trend. With momentum building, market participants are closely monitoring resistance levels that could determine the next phase of TON‚Äôs price action. Should buying pressure continue to increase, the cryptocurrency could be poised for further gains, potentially testing higher resistance zones. Can Toncoin Sustain Its Renewed Upswing? Toncoin recent price resurgence has strengthened bullish sentiment, but the sustainability of this uptrend remains a critical focus. The cryptocurrency has managed to establish solid footing above the $2.36 key support level. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on several technical and market factors. Related Reading: TON Price Jumps 20% Following Positive News On Telegram Founder The cryptocurrency is currently maintaining its upward momentum as it approaches the $4.34 resistance level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This steady climb indicates growing bullish strength, with buyers continuing to push the price higher despite potential resistance. A decisive breakout above the $4.34 resistance level could strengthen the ongoing uptrend, setting the stage for Toncoin toward the $6.13 resistance mark. If buying momentum remains strong and the price clears this key level, it could open the door for a potential test of its all-time high of $7.29. Technical indicators such as the MACD suggest that momentum remains in favor of the bulls, but increasing resistance pressure might lead to volatility. Sustained buying pressure will confirm the uptrend and push the price beyond these critical technical barriers. Volume analysis further reinforces Toncoin‚Äôs upward momentum, with trading volume increasing by over 10%, indicating strong market participation. Should volume continue to rise alongside price movement, it could validate the strength of the uptrend and enhance the likelihood of further gains. Potential Downside Risk If Toncoin faces rejection at a key resistance level, monitoring critical support zones will be essential to assess the strength of its uptrend. The first major support level to watch is around $2.36, where buyers previously showed interest. A dip to this level is likely to attract fresh demand and stabilize the price. Related Reading: Toncoin Gears Up For A Fresh Rally With Bullish Momentum Building A breakdown below this level could indicate a shift in momentum, accelerating selling pressure and leading to a deeper decline. If buyers fail to defend critical support zones, the price may struggle to recover, increasing the risk of establishing new lows.

After a descending triangle trend from mid 2021 through early 2025, the ETH/BTC pair has now reached a level where it showed a buying range in late 2020. Such a technical development combined with increased open interest in the futures is fueling the debate on trend reversal. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery: Key Support Level Could Spark Reversal According to a recent post on X , analyst AndrewCryptoHQ noted that ETH/BTC is now trading at a crucial technical level. This level previously acted as a launchpad for gains during Q4 2020. Since its peak in mid-2021, the pair has remained in a downtrend, posting consistent lower highs and lower lows. As of late March 2025, ETH/BTC is resting near a multi-year support zone. Market participants are watching closely to see whether this zone can hold and initiate an altcoin rebound. If supported, it could mark a key turning point in Ethereum price performance compared to Bitcoin. Source: X However, downside risks remain. A decline in Bitcoin could put pressure on Ethereum price action. ETH has shown sensitivity to Bitcoin‚Äôs market direction in previous cycles. Without a confirmed breakout or higher low formation, traders remain cautious about calling a full reversal. ETH Futures Open Interest Hits Record as Caution Lingers On March 21, Ether futures open interest reached a record high of 10.23 million ETH, according to data from CoinGlass . This figure represents a 15% increase over two weeks, signaling growing participation in derivative markets. Despite the rise in open interest, the futures premium dropped below 4%, down from 5% two weeks prior. This lower premium suggests subdued bullish sentiment, as traders are not aggressively pursuing leveraged long positions. Binance, Gate.io, and Bitget accounted for over half of the futures market, while CME captured 9%. The increased leverage does not automatically indicate upward price movement. Open interest simply reflects matched positions between buyers and sellers. The absence of a strong premium points to a neutral stance from investors regarding the altcoin price trajectory. Ethereum Network Fees Fall as On-Chain Activity Slows However, Ethereum network fees fell by 50% over the past seven days, according to IntoTheBlock . The reduction signals a decline in user activity and overall demand on the Ethereum mainnet. Total revenue for Ethereum‚Äôs base layer dropped to $605,000 as of March 17, compared to $2.5 million just two weeks earlier. Lower fees are partly due to the growing use of Layer 2 solutions, which move transactions off the mainnet to improve scalability. However, the shift has also reduced transaction volume on the core network. Users and protocols are increasingly exploring alternative chains such as Solana and Avalanche. This slowdown in network usage presents challenges for Ethereum price support. The downturn in activity may contribute to hesitancy around the altcoin‚Äôs near-term outlook. However, Ethereum whales have started to accumulate again as one of them bought nearly $270 million worth of ETH. This goes hand in hand with the increase in the daily active addresses by 26%, which may signal a reversal of the Ethereum price chart.
