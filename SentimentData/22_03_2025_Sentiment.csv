42120304,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61195,1742594446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CEO Makes End of 2025 Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-makes-end-of-2025-prediction/,"Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a popular crypto influencer on X, recently shared an interview featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. During the interview, he outlined an ambitious target for the company‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple aims to position RLUSD among the top stablecoins by the end of 2025, reflecting confidence in both the asset and the broader market‚Äôs expansion. BREAKING: RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: ‚ÄûTHE GOAL IS BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR RLUSD, RIPPLE STABLECOIN, TO BE ONE OF THE TOP FIVE IN THE MARKET BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I THINK THE WHOLE MARKET IS GONNA GROW DRAMATICALLY THIS YEAR!‚Äú #XRP pic.twitter.com/NliNtSZYy4 ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) March 20, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Goal for 2025 In the interview, Garlinghouse highlighted that RLUSD, which was launched at the end of last year , is already exceeding Ripple‚Äôs internal forecasts. While acknowledging that Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin is still in its early stages, he emphasized its strong trajectory. Interestingly, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple‚Äôs goal for 2025 is to make RLUSD one of the top five stablecoins in the market by the end of the year. He also noted that the stablecoin sector, currently valued at around $230 billion, could grow tenfold over the next five years, and the company plans to dominate that market with its stablecoin. Market Growth and Competition Stablecoins remain a critical component of the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. The dominant players, USDT and USDC, continue to lead, but Garlinghouse believes the RLUSD will do well in the market. RLUSD is currently ranked #9 by 24-hour trading volume, and Ripple‚Äôs deep integration into global payment systems and established relationships with financial institutions may provide it with a competitive edge as the market grows. Expanding RLUSD‚Äôs Reach Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple is actively working to increase RLUSD‚Äôs market presence. The company recently took a significant step forward by integrating its systems with RWA.xyz , allowing aggregation of the stablecoin‚Äôs data alongside other tokenized assets. Garlinghouse mentioned that new exchange listings for RLUSD continue to go live, helping drive adoption. ‚ÄúAnytime you do something new, it takes a minute for the ripple effect to play out,‚Äù he said, referring to the stablecoin‚Äôs growing impact. If the company leverages its partnerships and connections on its existing network, it may have a strong chance of reaching its goal by year-end and making RLUSD a household name. A Bullish Outlook for Stablecoins Garlinghouse‚Äôs bullish stance on stablecoins shows the growing importance of this sector within the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory clarity improves in the U.S. and global adoption increases, stablecoins will play an even larger role in digital finance. Whether RLUSD can break into the top five remains to be seen, but its early success suggests that Ripple is making significant strides in the competitive stablecoin market.

The analysis report highlights technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which failed to reach past extremes, raising concerns about Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Bitcoin Indicators Fall Short Of Historical Peaks Bitcoin has historically exhibited strong indicator readings during major cycle tops, reflecting extreme market engagement and enthusiasm. However, in this bull cycle, the pioneer cryptocurrency‚Äôs RSI reading has failed to reach historical peaks despite Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days Tony Severino, a crypto market technician on X (formerly Twitter), has Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days a detailed analysis of Bitcoin, challenging the assumption that the cryptocurrency must reach the same overbought RSI levels as in previous cycles to confirm its market peak. The key argument here is that lower highs on oscillators like the RSI, combined with higher highs in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, can be a bearish signal, suggesting waning strength in the market. Severino shared an example comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs current bull cycle to past cycles. In the previous bull market, Bitcoin‚Äôs monthly RSI reached above 90, but its current cycle has not. The analyst posed a question about whether this inability to reach past extremes means that Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt reached a market top or simply lacked the same momentum to push its RSI to the highest level. The analyst has warned that believing that Bitcoin must reach past extremes on indicators before hitting a price peak is a dangerous way of thinking. Historical patterns do not always repeat in the same way, and relying too much on past indicator peaks could cause traders to miss warning signs of a top or underestimate the possibility of a bear market. Severino also pointed to historical data from the S&P 500 in the 1950s and 1960s, where similar RSI failure preceded a long market meltdown. During these times, cyclical peaks hit RSI readings of 77 or higher, but in 1969, the RSI failed to reach those highs, signaling underlying weakness. This market downturn ultimately led to the first lower low in over 20 years. While this historical behavior of the S&P 500 does not mean that Bitcoin is destined for a lower high, it does suggest that the cryptocurrency does not need to reach extreme RSI levels to confirm a cycle top and a subsequent bear market. Analyst Says BTC Has Hit Its Market Top In his analysis Severino confirmed that Bitcoin has already hit its market top for this bull cycle. Following his detailed analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI levels, a community member asked if Severino believes that Bitcoin reached a market top when its price surged above $109,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash From $91,000, Why It‚Äôs Far From Over The analyst responded positively, stating that current market data indicates that the cryptocurrency hit its highest price point for this bull cycle after Donald Trump‚Äôs US Inauguration Day. At the time, Bitcoin soared past $109,000, setting a new ATH and surpassing previous records.

42118601,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142350,1742594450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breaking: Fidelity‚Äôs Groundbreaking Solana ETF Filing Ignites Crypto Investment Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fidelity-solana-etf-registration/,"Get ready for a potential shake-up in the crypto investment world! News just dropped that Fidelity Investments, a financial behemoth, has officially registered a ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù as a statutory trust in Delaware. This exciting development, first highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has sent ripples of anticipation through the cryptocurrency community. Could this be the precursor to a spot Solana ETF ? Let‚Äôs dive into what this registration means and why it could be a game-changer for both Solana and the broader crypto market. Fidelity Solana Fund Registration: What‚Äôs the Buzz About? So, what exactly happened? Fidelity, a name synonymous with traditional finance and now increasingly embracing the digital asset space, has taken a significant step by registering a fund specifically tied to Solana. According to public records in Delaware, the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is now officially on the books. This isn‚Äôt just another registration; it‚Äôs a clear signal of intent. But what kind of intent? Let‚Äôs break it down: Registration as a Statutory Trust: This legal structure is often used for ETFs. Think about it ‚Äì ETFs need a trust to hold the underlying assets. Registering as a statutory trust is a common and crucial step in the ETF creation process. ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù Name: The name itself is incredibly telling. It‚Äôs not just a generic crypto fund; it‚Äôs explicitly linked to Solana. This specificity suggests a focused approach on providing investment exposure to SOL. Timing and Market Context: This news comes at a time when the crypto market is showing signs of renewed vigor, and there‚Äôs increasing demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and demonstrated the appetite for such offerings. While registration doesn‚Äôt guarantee the launch of a spot Solana ETF , it‚Äôs a very strong indication that Fidelity is seriously considering this move. It‚Äôs like laying the foundation for a house ‚Äì you wouldn‚Äôt go through the trouble unless you planned to build something significant. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Monumental Leap for Crypto ETFs Let‚Äôs zoom out and understand why a potential spot Solana ETF is such a big deal, especially in the context of the evolving Crypto ETF landscape. We‚Äôve already seen the groundbreaking approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was a monumental victory, opening the doors for billions of dollars of institutional and retail investment to flow into Bitcoin through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. Now, Solana could be next in line, and here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs significant: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, the market is increasingly recognizing the potential of other cryptocurrencies like Solana. A spot Solana ETF would offer investors diversification within their crypto portfolio, moving beyond just Bitcoin exposure. Legitimizing Altcoins: The approval of a spot Solana ETF would further legitimize altcoins as a viable asset class. It signals to traditional investors that cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin are gaining institutional acceptance and regulatory consideration. Broader Market Access to Solana: Currently, investing directly in Solana requires navigating crypto exchanges, wallets, and understanding blockchain technology. A spot ETF removes these barriers, making Solana accessible to anyone with a brokerage account. This includes a vast pool of retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to directly engage with crypto. Institutional Interest in Solana: Fidelity‚Äôs move underscores growing institutional interest in Solana. Large financial players are recognizing Solana‚Äôs technology, ecosystem, and potential for future growth. An ETF would be a way for institutions to gain exposure to Solana in a regulated and compliant manner. The difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF is crucial here. A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset ‚Äì in this case, Solana. This is generally preferred by investors as it more accurately reflects the price movements of the cryptocurrency. Futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts, which can introduce complexities and tracking errors. The demand is clearly for spot crypto ETFs, and Fidelity seems to be listening. Unlocking Solana Investment: The Compelling Benefits of a Fidelity Solana ETF Imagine the doors that a Fidelity Solana Fund , potentially structured as a spot ETF, could open for investors. The benefits are numerous and compelling, spanning accessibility, legitimacy, and investment potential: Benefit Description Simplified Investment Access Investing in Solana becomes as easy as buying shares of a stock through a brokerage account. No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Increased Liquidity ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity. This makes it easier for investors to buy and sell Solana exposure at market prices. Enhanced Security and Custody Fidelity, a regulated financial institution, would handle the custody and security of the underlying Solana, mitigating risks associated with self-custody or exchange custody. Tax Advantages (Potentially) Depending on jurisdiction, investing through an ETF might offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption Catalyst A Solana ETF from a reputable firm like Fidelity could further encourage institutional adoption of Solana and other cryptocurrencies. Price Appreciation Potential Increased demand for Solana through an ETF could potentially drive up its price, benefiting early investors and the Solana ecosystem as a whole. For retail investors who have been curious about Solana but intimidated by the technicalities of crypto, a Solana ETF could be the perfect on-ramp. For institutional investors, it provides a regulated and compliant way to allocate capital to a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Considerations for a Spot Solana ETF While the registration of the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is undeniably exciting, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the path to a spot Solana ETF isn‚Äôt without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles, market volatility, and competition are all factors that need to be considered: SEC Approval: The biggest hurdle is, of course, obtaining approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, their stance on other cryptocurrencies remains to be fully seen. The SEC will need to be convinced that the Solana market is mature enough and resistant to manipulation for a spot ETF to be approved. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. This volatility could make a spot Crypto ETF a riskier investment compared to traditional ETFs. However, it also presents opportunities for high returns. Regulatory Landscape Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and viability of crypto ETFs. Competition: If Fidelity launches a Solana ETF, it‚Äôs likely to face competition from other asset managers who may also be eyeing the Solana ETF space. This competition could be beneficial for investors in the long run, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative products. Solana Network Risks: While Solana is a technologically advanced blockchain, it has faced challenges in the past, including network outages. Potential investors need to be aware of these risks associated with the underlying technology. Despite these challenges, the fact that Fidelity is moving forward with registration suggests a degree of optimism that these hurdles can be overcome. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has undoubtedly provided a blueprint and increased confidence in the possibility of spot altcoin ETFs. Solana‚Äôs Bright Future and the Expanding Horizons of Crypto Investment Why Solana? Why is Fidelity potentially betting on a Solana ETF ? The answer lies in Solana‚Äôs compelling technology and vibrant ecosystem. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs. It has attracted a thriving community of developers and users, building a diverse range of applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more. Here‚Äôs a quick look at Solana‚Äôs strengths: High Speed and Scalability: Solana is designed to handle a high volume of transactions at incredibly fast speeds, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time processing. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some other blockchains, Solana‚Äôs transaction fees are remarkably low, making it attractive for users and developers. Growing Ecosystem: Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with a growing number of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other innovative projects being built on the network. Strong Community Support: Solana has a passionate and active community that is constantly contributing to its growth and development. A spot Solana ETF could be a significant catalyst for further growth and adoption of Solana. It would bring increased capital into the Solana ecosystem, potentially fueling innovation and development. More broadly, it signals the continued maturation of the crypto investment landscape. We are moving beyond the early days of crypto being a niche asset class to a point where mainstream financial institutions are offering regulated investment products linked to a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Solana and Crypto ETFs? Fidelity‚Äôs registration of the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is more than just a procedural step; it‚Äôs a powerful statement about the future of Solana and the evolution of Crypto ETFs . While the launch of a spot Solana ETF is not yet guaranteed, this move significantly increases the likelihood and signals a growing confidence in Solana‚Äôs potential. For investors, it presents an exciting prospect ‚Äì the potential to access Solana investment through a familiar, regulated, and convenient ETF structure. Keep your eyes peeled ‚Äì this story is just beginning, and it could mark the start of a new chapter in crypto investment history.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase says its listing decentralized roll-up protocol AltLayer ( ALT ), decentralized finance network Pendle ( PENDLE ), and gamified learning platform Layer3 ( L3 ) to its listing roadmap. The crypto exchange‚Äôs listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to it means Coinbase is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the additions sprung the trio of assets to life as AltLayer ‚Äì a protocol that uses restaked rollups to enhance scalability ‚Äì went from a low of $0.0354 on March 20th to a peak of $0.0395 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.0376 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Pendle, a project that enables the trading and tokenization of yields, went from a price of $2.41 to a peak of $2.59 during the same time frame. However, the digital asset also retraced and is trading for $2.47 at time of writing, a gain of 1.2% on the day. Layer3, a web3 education program that teaches users through interaction and games, saw the biggest gains as it went from a low of $0.0577 on March 20th to a peak of $0.103 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is moving for $0.0820, a gain of 38.6% during the last day.

CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the company is ‚Äúengaging with a Big Four accounting firm,‚Äù though he didn‚Äôt say which one or when the audit would happen. He said it‚Äôs now ‚Äúfeasible‚Äù thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly policies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our top priority,‚Äù Ardoino said. He claims the regulatory environment has changed completely, and that Trump‚Äôs crypto push makes it easier. Tether has been promising transparency forever, but so far, it only puts out quarterly attestations, not full audits. Tether seeks Trump-era support to push audit forward Ardoino didn‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs PwC, EY, KPMG, or Deloitte‚Äîbut said they‚Äôre talking to one of them. He pointed to Trump‚Äôs stance as a green light. ‚ÄúIf the President of the United States says this is top priority for the U.S., Big Four auditing firms will have to listen,‚Äù he said. This is all part of Tether‚Äôs latest push to prove it actually backs the $140 billion worth of stablecoins it has issued. It says every coin is supported by dollar-denominated assets. The goal now is to finally show the math. The firm recently hired Simon McWilliams as CFO to lead the audit effort. This isn‚Äôt coming out of nowhere. Trump has signed an executive order for a strategic crypto reserve and is promising new rules for digital assets. Ardoino took a shot at U.S. regulators under Biden, calling their actions ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù a phrase the crypto crowd uses to describe the government‚Äôs campaign to cut off crypto from the banking system. Meanwhile, Tether keeps stacking U.S. debt. In 2024, it bought more than $33.1 billion in Treasury bills, making it the seventh biggest buyer of U.S. government debt. As of December 31, it held over $94 billion in Treasurys and more than $108 million in bank deposits, based on numbers from BDO Italia. According to Ardoino, 99% of those Treasury bills are held with Cantor Fitzgerald. And now that former Cantor CEO Howard Lutnick is Trump‚Äôs commerce secretary, it all sounds like one big reunion. Tether gets bigger than BlackRock, keeps dodging rules Tether has $120 billion in assets. Most of it is in U.S. Treasurys. The rest is a mix of bitcoin and gold. It made $6.2 billion in profit last year, beating BlackRock by $700 million. Ardoino bragged that with less than 100 employees, the company makes more money per person than anyone. But it‚Äôs not all glory. According to a Wall Street Journal report , this unregulated coin is getting used to get around U.S. sanctions. Russian oligarchs, Venezuelan oil firms, and even terror groups like Hamas have used Tether to move money. ‚ÄúWe need a regulatory framework that doesn‚Äôt allow offshore dollar-backed stablecoin providers to play by a different set of rules,‚Äù said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo in his testimony to Congress. He called out Tether by name. The Journal dug through blockchain data, court records, and private messages. They found Venezuelan oil payments made in Tether, sanctioned groups laundering money, and a huge black market. Tether says it freezes wallets tied to criminals. Ardoino claimed, ‚ÄúWe have a proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities.‚Äù That sounds nice, but ChainArgos says that from 2018 to June 2024, Tether blacklisted 2,713 wallets holding $153 billion. Only $1.4 billion was frozen. The rest moved too fast to catch. The company says it can track everything on public blockchains and even destroy tokens held in wallets if needed. But it‚Äôs like a never-ending Whac-A-Mole game. Tether turns up everywhere‚Äîwar zones, scams, economies in collapse Back in 2014, Tether started with a weird founding team. One of them, Giancarlo Devasini, was a plastic surgeon. Another was William Quigley, who called the idea of profiting from billions in backing ‚Äúa fantasy.‚Äù Quigley and the others left early. Devasini stayed and still runs the company today. He lives in a luxury villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Ardoino has become the face of it all. Tether really took off during the 2020‚Äì2021 bull run. Its market cap went from $4 billion to $80 billion fast. Traders loved it for moving in and out of bets without touching banks. Now, it‚Äôs used in all kinds of places regular dollars can‚Äôt go. In Iran, a platform called TetherLand lets people swap their rials for Tether. In Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is out of control, people use Tether to save money and make everyday purchases. Over 300 million people use Tether, according to Ardoino. But criminals use it too. Southeast Asian money launderers love Tether, according to a 2024 UN report. The tokens bounce from one wallet to another so fast it‚Äôs hard to trace them. That same report said Tether is a ‚Äúpreferred choice‚Äù for bad actors in the region. The structure is simple. Direct customers wire dollars to Tether Holdings, and the company issues tokens backed by U.S. Treasurys. But once those tokens hit the open market, anything can happen. Exchanges and brokerages all over the world move the coins, and nobody watches the secondary market. In Venezuela, PdVSA, the state oil company, started demanding oil payments in Tether in 2020. Buyers were told to send coins to specific wallets. Others just swapped suitcases of cash for Tether, then spent it on prepaid crypto cards. That setup didn‚Äôt just help Maduro‚Äôs government dodge sanctions‚Äîit fueled corruption. Middlemen kept the money. The scandal blew up so badly that it forced the oil minister to step down. ‚ÄúThis cryptocurrency‚Äôs use only has served to perpetuate gigantic levels of corruption,‚Äù said former oil minister Rafael Ram√≠rez. Even so, for regular Venezuelans, Tether became survival. Inflation hit 2 million percent. Currency controls blocked overseas payments. A guy named Guillermo Goncalvez started a platform called El Dorado that connects users for peer-to-peer Tether trading. The platform has over 150,000 users. ‚ÄúUSDT is the digital dollar for all Venezuelans,‚Äù he said. In Russia, Tether is everywhere. A report from a Russian research group found that importers use it to swap rubles for foreign currencies. Rosbank, a major lender, helps clients send Tether to suppliers. A fixer named Ekaterina Zhdanova arranged deals worth hundreds of millions in Tether, according to Telegram chats and blockchain data. She‚Äôs from a Siberian town but built a luxury business helping rich Russians dodge sanctions. She handled so much cash they needed planes to move it. One client wanted to buy $10 million in Tether per month for a total of $300 million. The money was going to be handed over in Turkey or the UAE. ‚ÄúThey will use planes to pick up the cash,‚Äù she said. Zhdanova was later sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. French cops arrested her at an airport as part of a separate money laundering case. She‚Äôs still in custody. Now, Tether is investing in businesses that use its token for daily payments. More usage means more token issuance. More issuance means more dollars to manage. In Tbilisi, Georgia, shops show the Tether logo outside. ATMs let people buy the coin with cash. It‚Äôs become the go-to currency when real dollars are blocked. Tether has become the shadow dollar‚Äîmoving money anywhere, fast, without much oversight. And now it wants a Big Four audit. Maybe. Eventually. If the vibes are right. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Korea: Here‚Äôs Why",https://cryptopotato.com/bitmex-kucoin-among-exchanges-reportedly-facing-sanctions-in-s-korea-heres-why/,"South Korean financial authorities are considering imposing sanctions on several crypto exchanges that have failed to comply with local regulations. According to a report from local media Korea Economic Daily, the crypto exchanges include BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX. S. Korea to Sanction Crypto Exchanges The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission said these overseas crypto trading platforms are operating illegally in the country because they have failed to report as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act. The Special Financial Transactions Act states that entities engaging in crypto trading, storage, and management in South Korea must formally report their activities to the FIU. Failure to do so could attract criminal punishment and administrative sanctions because the firms will be considered illegal businesses. In addition, these exchanges have been operating Korean-language websites without providing marketing and customer support for South Korean investors. As a result, the FIU is now investigating their activities, evaluating appropriate procedures with relevant organizations, and strongly considering measures like blocking site access. ‚ÄúWe are currently reviewing blocking access to unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year,‚Äù stated an FIU official. A Continuous Crackdown on Crypto Platforms This is not the first time financial authorities in South Korea have made moves to sanction or block investor access to non-compliant crypto exchanges. In September 2021, the FIU asked more than 60 exchanges that could not meet up with the local anti-money laundering (AML) rules and registration requirements to shut down their services and exit the country. At the time, only four trading platforms, including Upbit, Bithumb , Coinone, and Korbit, were fully operational, while about 28 others, which obtained security certificates, could offer certain services without won settlements. Furthermore, in 2022, the FIU asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission to block access to 16 overseas exchanges that failed to report their operations as VASPs. The regulatory agency also joined forces with local card companies to block crypto purchases and payment services made from these platforms. Earlier this year, the FIU revealed there are only 31 registered crypto firms in South Korea, down 26% from 42 in 2024. With the latest crackdown, that number is bound to shrink even further.

This prediction aligns with growing industry speculation, including comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has suggested that XRP ETFs could launch in the second half of 2025 . The prediction market‚Äôs surge in confidence follows multiple ETF filings, and the possibility of approval has generated significant anticipation within the crypto community, with many seeing it as a pivotal moment for XRP‚Äôs institutional adoption.

Institutional interest in digital assets has grown substantially, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in 2024. This momentum has led investors to speculate that regulators may soon greenlight additional crypto ETFs, including those tied to XRP. 11 notable firms including Bitwise and Franklin Templeton , have applied for XRP ETFs, and if approved, they would provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible vehicle to gain exposure to the digital asset. This could result in increased liquidity, heightened mainstream adoption, and further legitimization of XRP within the financial sector. One observer noted that an ETF approval could ‚Äúbring massive institutional inflows and solidify XRP‚Äôs place in the market.‚Äù We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Predictions The crypto community has reacted enthusiastically to the Polymarket prediction, with many believing approval is inevitable. One commenter expressed excitement for the ETFs, predicting that these could be approved by June or July. The growing number of filings suggests asset managers see potential in an XRP-based fund. Now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple, we could see more applications shortly. Outlook for 2025 The current sentiment surrounding an XRP ETF reflects broader expectations for regulatory advancements in the crypto space. As the year progresses, attention will be on the SEC‚Äôs approach to approving additional crypto-based financial products. The regulator has already acknowledged most of these filings. While this does not guarantee approval, it is a positive step that shows the SEC‚Äôs willingness to engage with the crypto industry and its offerings to consumers. With institutional demand rising and multiple filings already submitted, the approval of XRP ETF in 2025 appears increasingly likely. Polymarket‚Äôs prediction shows that the community is eager to see these products approved. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Calls for stablecoin regulation seek to establish uniform standards, easing compliance and reducing market uncertainty. These shifts may foster a clearer environment that encourages institutional participation and deeper market engagement. The evolving U.S. framework could set international benchmarks, prompting a broader rethinking of digital asset rules. Regulatory developments in cryptocurrency intensified this week, marked by two major U.S. events: the SEC ending its prominent legal dispute with Ripple over XRP, and President Donald Trump calling for clear stablecoin regulation . Additionally, the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash. Meanwhile, on the international stage, Germany‚Äôs BaFin intensified enforcement by cracking down on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token, while Pakistan actively considers legalizing cryptocurrency to stimulate economic growth. These events highlight the evolving global approach as nations seek clearer crypto regulation news, balancing innovation with oversight. SEC Ends Ripple Case, Shaping Crypto Regulation News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended its extended legal proceedings against Ripple, concluding the contentious debate over whether XRP qualifies as a security. Ripple‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the resolution on X, emphasizing that XRP was ultimately not classified as a security. This is it ‚Äì the moment we‚Äôve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal ‚Äì a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright. Let's build. pic.twitter.com/7WsD0C92Cm ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 19, 2025 Ripple maintained that XRP should not be regulated as a security, consistently challenging the SEC‚Äôs aggressive enforcement actions, which it claimed negatively impacted XRP investors. Legal experts view the case‚Äôs resolution as influential, potentially changing regulatory attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Legal expert Seth Goertz, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP and former federal prosecutor, indicated that the case‚Äôs outcome is key in establishing legal clarity for the crypto industry, particularly in defining when digital assets fall under securities regulations. Following the announcement, XRP experienced a sharp price increase, moving up to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and surpassing major stablecoins like Tether. This resolution is expected to encourage regulatory clarity and bolster investor confidence, especially among digital asset exchanges that previously operated under uncertain legal conditions. Daniel Stabile, from Winston & Strawn LLP, noted that the SEC‚Äôs decision to end the case may signal a broader shift toward allowing legislative and regulatory processes, rather than litigation, to set clear guidelines for crypto markets. As Ripple celebrates its legal win, another major political figure is stepping into the debate over cryptocurrency regulation . Trump Pushes for Stablecoin Regulation and U.S. Crypto Dominance In a virtual speech at the Digital Assets Summit in New York, Donald Trump urged Congress to pass stablecoin regulations with ‚Äúsimple, common-sense rules.‚Äù Today President Trump spoke at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit ‚Äî becoming the first sitting president in history to address a crypto conference. @blockworksDAS @POTUS pic.twitter.com/8aijMb1VcG ‚Äî David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 21, 2025 He also vowed to position the U.S. as a leading player in global cryptocurrency markets. This push for stablecoin regulation matches industry demands for clearer rules, balancing innovation and financial stability. If implemented, such legislation could clarify how stablecoins operate within the U.S. financial system, potentially attracting more institutional investors to the sector. Treasury Lifts Tornado Cash Sanctions, but Cautions Remain In a major reversal, the U.S. Treasury removed sanctions on Tornado Cash , the Ethereum-based mixer previously blacklisted for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions. You might also like US Treasury Removes Sanctions on Ethereum Mixer Tornado Cash This decision follows a reassessment of how financial sanctions apply to decentralized platforms, particularly as the crypto industry evolves. While the move marks a shift in the Treasury‚Äôs approach, officials stressed that they remain committed to combating financial crime. The agency highlights ongoing concerns over cyber threats, particularly state-sponsored hacking and money laundering linked to North Korea. U.S. residents and businesses were advised to be cautious when engaging with digital asset services that could be exploited for illicit purposes. The decision to lift sanctions suggests regulators may be moving toward a more nuanced approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) , recognizing both its risks and its potential. While the U.S. eases some crypto sanctions, European regulators are tightening oversight. Germany‚Äôs BaFin Cracks Down on Ethena‚Äôs USDe Token In Europe, Germany‚Äôs financial regulator BaFin took action against Ethena GmbH, freezing its asset reserves over concerns about the approval process for its USDe token. BaFin suspects that Ethena GmbH is offering unapproved securities, including USDe and sUSDe tokens, without proper authorization under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This move shows the increasing regulatory pressure in the European Union as authorities enforce the recently implemented MiCA framework. BaFin‚Äôs crackdown on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token highlights compliance challenges. Other crypto firms may also need to reassess their strategies to comply with MiCA. Not all countries share Europe‚Äôs caution‚ÄîPakistan is exploring crypto adoption as a growth strategy. Pakistan Considers Legalizing Crypto to Boost Economic Growth While some countries tighten restrictions, others are moving toward crypto adoption. Pakistan is exploring the legalization of cryptocurrency trading in an effort to attract international investment and stimulate economic growth. JUST IN: Pakistan to legalize cryptocurrency. ‚Äî Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 20, 2025 Bilal bin Saqib, chief advisor to Pakistan‚Äôs finance minister for digital assets, emphasized that the country wants to leverage its young, tech-savvy workforce to become a Web3 hub. With 60% of its population under the age of 30, Pakistan sees crypto as an opportunity for financial inclusion and technological advancement. If Pakistan successfully establishes a regulatory framework for crypto, it could position itself as a key player in the digital asset space, particularly in South Asia. However, uncertainty persists about how the government will balance oversight and innovation. The Future of Crypto Regulation: A Global Balancing Act This week‚Äôs developments highlight the complex and often contradictory nature of global crypto regulation news. The U.S. is showing signs of a more structured regulatory framework, while Europe is tightening enforcement. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Pakistan are looking to embrace crypto as a means of economic growth. As regulatory approaches evolve, governments worldwide recognize crypto‚Äôs lasting role in the financial sector. The challenge now is finding the right balance between oversight, innovation, and financial security. Whether through stablecoin regulations, sanctions revisions, or new frameworks for token approvals, the next few months could shape the future of crypto for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will the SEC‚Äôs withdrawal affect crypto enforcement? The SEC‚Äôs retreat signals a shift from heavy litigation to clear, consistent rules. This move aims to lower enforcement burdens and create a stable regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty for crypto operators. What benefits can clear stablecoin regulations offer? Defining stablecoin rules can standardize market practices and lower compliance costs. Clear guidelines boost investor confidence and spur innovation by cutting legal ambiguities that hinder institutional investment. How might these changes influence global crypto standards? U.S. policy shifts may set international benchmarks, encouraging other nations to streamline their frameworks. A unified approach can boost cross-border investments and harmonize digital asset practices globally. What impact could clearer crypto rules have on institutional investment? Clearer rules reduce legal risks and operational uncertainty, making the market more attractive to institutions. Predictable oversight can spur long-term investments and deepen overall market engagement. What further changes can we expect in the crypto regulatory landscape? We can expect incremental updates as regulators refine their approach through ongoing industry dialogue. Future measures will likely target major market players and clarify compliance standards for digital assets.

In the comment section of TON‚Äôs clarification post, many users praised the team for ending the confusion, while others reaffirmed their bullish sentiments, making it clear the little misunderstanding has not changed how they feel about Toncoin. Of course, there were also some who wanted to know who planted the rumor in the first place and also those who suspected foul play, as the clarification came about a day after the news had spread and caused a brief price surge for the TON token. One user implied the rumor was planted to ‚Äúhype‚Äù things up, while another implied that they waited for some time to retract the rumor so the token could pump. Whether this is true or not is up for speculation, but it is true that the TON token pumped almost 8% as a result of the VC investment rumors. At the time of this writing, the confusion has cleared up, and TON‚Äôs price is now worth $3.61, having fallen by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The fundraising confusion came days after Pavel Durov left France The confusion regarding TON receiving millions in funding from VCs comes days after Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the social messaging app Telegram, was allowed to fly home to Dubai. Telegram‚Äôs founder Pavel Durov shared a picture he claims is the new photo on his passport. Source: Pavel Durov (X/Twitter) The privilege does not mean he is free of all charges as the French authorities continue their unprecedented case against him. Durov was arrested in August after he was accused of not doing enough to properly moderate his app to curb criminality, even though Telegram has previously denied having insufficient moderation. The tech billionaire has denied not cooperating with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual abuse content and fraud. The case has attracted a lot of attention as it marks the first time a tech leader has been arrested for the lawlessness taking place on their platform. In a post on his Telegram channel, Durov expressed happiness to finally be home, but clarified that the ‚Äúprocess is ongoing.‚Äù He also thanked the French judges for letting him go home and praised his lawyers for their ‚Äúrelentless efforts in demonstrating that, when it comes to moderation, cooperation, and fighting crime, for years Telegram not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.‚Äù His arrest happened in August 2024 as he arrived in Paris on his private jet, and French judges initially banned him from leaving France. As for the conditions of his release, all we have to go on is what the office of the Paris prosecutor told the BBC on Monday, which is that ‚Äúthe obligations of judicial supervision‚Äù had been suspended between 15 March and 7 April. Durov, who was born in Russia, resides in Dubai. He also has residences in France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis. Since his arrest, Telegram has significantly altered the way it operates to deal with allegations that have dubbed it a portable version of the dark web. It has joined the Internet Watch Foundation program, which aims to help find, remove and report child sexual abuse material being shared online. According to an announcement from the app, it will also disclose the IP addresses/phone numbers of those who violate its rules and hand them over to police in response to valid legal requests. Telegram has also published transparency reports about how much content is taken down ‚Äì a standard industry practice it previously refused to comply with. A Telegram spokesperson has said the company now actively moderates its platform to get rid of harmful content each day. However, despite their best efforts, criminal activity persists and will probably continue until harsher measures are considered. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The regulator‚Äôs intervention is seen not merely as a punitive measure but as a wake-up call to reassess operational resilience in the evolving digital asset landscape. Market observers believe that such rigorous enforcement might restore investor confidence and encourage clearer standards across synthetic token markets. BaFin, Germany‚Äôs financial regulator, banned all public sales of Ethena GmbH‚Äôs USDe token this week, citing flaws in the approval process and violations of the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR). The regulator outlined several immediate actions against Ethena GmbH to enforce the ban. According to BaFin, the synthetic dollar token had been offered as an unregistered security in Germany, prompting the authority to restrict its operations without delay. BaFin Orders Asset Freeze and Website Shutdown for USDe Token In its announcement , BaFin instructed Ethena GmbH to freeze the reserve assets backing the USDe token and halt all new customer registrations. The company must also shut down its website, and a special representative has been appointed to oversee compliance with these directives. ‚ÄúThe BaFin also has reasonable grounds to suspect that Ethena GmbH in Germany sells securities in the form of sUSDe tokens from Ethena OpCo. Ltd. without the required prospectus,‚Äù the regulator said. Breaking: The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority announced that it had found serious flaws in Ethena GmbH's approval process for USDe tokens and ordered immediate enforcement measures to prohibit Ethena GmbH from further offering its USDe tokens to the public and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 21, 2025 ‚ÄúThe USDe and sUSDe tokens are interconnected in such a way that investors can receive a sUSDe token in exchange for a USDe token,‚Äù it added. Despite the prohibition on primary sales and issuance, secondary market trading of USDe remains unaffected by the ban. BaFin identified ‚Äúserious deficiencies‚Äù in Ethena GmbH‚Äôs approval process, including noncompliance with MiCAR‚Äôs capital and asset reserve requirements. Ethena GmbH had been operating under a transitional provision that allows issuers of asset-referenced tokens to continue business while awaiting regulatory approval. The company applied for authorization on July 29, 2024, a day before the deadline, and has been issuing USDe in Germany since June 28, 2024. Currently, approximately 5.4 billion USDe tokens are in circulation, with a substantial portion issued outside Germany before MiCAR took effect. To safeguard customer interests, BaFin has ordered the company‚Äôs asset reserves to block and restrict the authority of its managing directors over those funds. Holders of USDe tokens cannot redeem them directly with Ethena GmbH, though trading on secondary markets continues as normal. BaFin‚Äôs statement also raised concerns about the company issuing sUSDe tokens, suggesting they could constitute unregistered securities. The tokens are linked to USDe, allowing investors to exchange them while receiving additional returns. The regulator is now considering further enforcement actions, which could include a complete ban on the public offering of these securities. BaFin is overseeing the authorization process in collaboration with the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Further details will be provided upon completion of the licensing process. Ethena Defends USDe Token Amid BaFin Ban Following BaFin‚Äôs ban on USDe in Germany, Ethena Labs reassured users that redemptions remain unaffected through its British Virgin Islands-based entity, Ethena BVI Limited. The company, addressing the situation on X, stated that while its German subsidiary‚Äôs MiCAR application was denied, USDe remains fully backed. ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by this decision but will continue evaluating alternative regulatory frameworks,‚Äù Ethena wrote. Since its inception, Ethena has been exploring various options and jurisdictions when it comes to regulatory frameworks globally that would be conducive to our business, and as a result we have multiple entities within our structure facilitating minting and redemption. A MiCAR‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) March 21, 2025 The firm also dismissed claims that its assets were frozen, clarifying that all funds remain accessible. It plans to update its terms in the coming week to reflect the regulatory developments. Ethena‚Äôs regulatory challenges come as institutional interest grows. Recent investments include a $20 million backing from MEXC and a 500,000 ENA token purchase by World Liberty Financial. BaFin Tightens Oversight on Synthetic Assets Across Europe BaFin‚Äôs decision reflects the regulator‚Äôs cautious approach towards crypto assets operating within Germany‚Äôs jurisdiction. Its ban on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token highlights the tightening regulatory grip on stablecoins and synthetic dollar tokens in Germany and across Europe. With MiCAR enforcement ramping up, stablecoin and synthetic asset issuers will face increased scrutiny over compliance with capital, reserve, and disclosure requirements. The outcome of BaFin‚Äôs assessment of Ethena GmbH could set a precedent for how synthetic dollar tokens are regulated under MiCAR across the EU. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is BaFin‚Äôs ban of USDe actually protecting German innovation rather than hindering it? Counterintuitively, yes. By enforcing strict compliance standards early, BaFin creates a more predictable environment where legitimate crypto projects can thrive without unfair competition from operators who bypass proper authorization channels. Does this ban reflect MiCAR‚Äôs flexibility or its rigidity? Neither‚Äîit demonstrates MiCAR‚Äôs intentional interpretative space. Germany‚Äôs interpretation reveals how the regulation creates room for national authorities to calibrate enforcement based on local market conditions and risk appetites. Is this primarily about USDe‚Äôs technology or about EU regulatory sovereignty? The latter. This action positions Europe as asserting regulatory independence from both American permissiveness and Chinese restriction, establishing a distinct ‚Äúthird way‚Äù in global crypto governance.

Key Metrics Show $200,000 Prediction Is Likely",https://coingape.com/is-bitcoin-price-bottom-in-key-metrics-show-rally-is-likely/,"Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility is slowing down as the coin‚Äôs capitulation continues. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs price was changing hands for $84,278.83 as it pared off the losses accrued in earlier trading. At this pace, the question now hinges on whether BTC can form sustainable support at the $84,000 price mark or whether further drawdown lies ahead. Core Bitcoin Price Metric to Watch According to Glassnode data , BTC Short-Term Holders (STH) are under increasing pressure. This group‚Äôs unrealized losses have surged, pushing many STH coins into losses. As revealed, their holdings are now nearing the two-standard deviation threshold. Despite this outlook, the data platform hinted that losses remain within historical bull market bounds. Specifically, it noted that these losses are less severe than the May 2021 sell-off from the all-time high. Glassnode said the rolling 30-day losses for STH have topped $7 billion. It confirmed that ‚Äúthis remains well below prior capitulation events, such as the $19.8B and $20.7B losses in 2021-22.‚Äù BTC price jumped to an ATH above $109,000 in January but has since dropped by 22.79%. While experts predicted a drop of over 35%, the limited loss from holders can form a good rebound basis. BTC Price Bottom In, Here Are Triggers for Rally Over the past week, Bitcoin has rallied within very tight price ranges, from a low of $81,300 to a high of $87,320. Some market observers believe the coin has attained its floor price and might be set for a rebound. While firms like Strategy have kept Bitcoin purchase plans alive with Strife‚Äôs perpetual stock offering , the Global Money Supply M2 also lays a positive basis for growth. With the current outlook, the projection that the $83,00 level is the BTC price floor is resounding among analysts. The shift in regulation and the backing of Bitcoin by President Donald Trump creates a tailwind for the coin‚Äôs proponents. At the Digital Asset Summit earlier this week, President Trump reiterated the plan to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Several government agencies have shifted their policies in this regard, which might attract investors in the long term. How High Can Bitcoin Valuation Rise? Despite the slowdown in growth in recent weeks, many market leaders are still confident in the coin‚Äôs prospects. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan maintained the price target of $1 million by 2029. He cited a longer-term reaction to macroeconomic uncertainties as the basis for his prediction. While this Bitcoin price prediction appears lofty, others believe Bitcoin may cross $200,000 once the bull rally returns. With spot Bitcoin ETF hype and other growing institutional adoption, BTC price has an arguably bright future. The post Is Bitcoin Price Bottom In?

The Financial Services panel will then review the bill on April 2. So far, the Trump administration has been very vocal about its crypto support and the need for a stablecoin bill. However, bipartisan support for crypto is growing significantly, increasing the likelihood that the stablecoin bill will be fully approved. The stablecoin bill has received support from both Republicans and Democrats A key House Committee is likely to vote in favour of the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) first proposed the bill, which has quickly earned the support of both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Genius Act, and five of the committee‚Äôs 11 Democrats joined the Republican majority to support the bill. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers will have the choice of both federal and state charters based on market capitalisation. Moreover, foreign issuers will be obligated to follow The nation‚Äôs protocols on reserves, anti-money laundering measures, sanctions compliance, and liquidity. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan, even commented, ‚ÄúThe reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.‚Äù Maxine Walters and Elizabeth Warren believe the bill fails to protect consumers adequately Like many other analysts and crypto enthusiasts, Chairman French Hill believes the stablecoin market should be regulated. Hill claimed that a regulated stablecoin environment would yield a stronger dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms that have presented their legislative agenda in the Capitol before have also consistently promoted stablecoins as a means to improving financial inclusion and a much cheaper and faster transaction option. However, Maxine Walters, the top Democrat on the House committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts believe the bill will not protect consumers adequately. They also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk‚Äôs X or Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins. Other critics have also raised concerns about the lack of stablecoin FDIC insurance, fearing huge losses for users if the token collapses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Natural gas‚Äôs importance in global markets could attract institutional traders beyond crypto. Beyond its latest futures filings, Coinbase is set to launch 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures in the U.S., aligning domestic markets with global trading standards. Crypto derivatives account for 75% of global trading volumes, and Coinbase‚Äôs expansion seeks to attract more of this activity to U.S. markets while staying compliant with CFTC regulations. Coinbase ranks as the largest Ethereum staking operator , holding 11.42% of staked ETH. With 3.84 million ETH staked and near-perfect validator uptime, the exchange continues strengthening its influence across trading and staking sectors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What could this deal indicate about evolving trends in crypto derivatives? This potential acquisition hints at an industry shift. Exchanges are broadening their toolset to offer comprehensive trading options, reflecting rising investor interest and evolving regulatory norms in digital assets. How might a unified license structure impact crypto market compliance? Uniting licenses under a single operator may simplify compliance checks and encourage uniform oversight. This consolidation could ease regulatory processes and offer a steadier framework for digital asset trades. What long-term impacts could arise from integrating options trading with existing platforms? Merging options trading into established platforms may boost market engagement and broaden revenue streams. This integration supports legacy exchanges in adapting offerings to meet evolving investor demand and digital market shifts.

Based on recent data, around 8.97 million ETH are in their possession now. This shortage comes as the price of Ethereum has taken a precipitous decline. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin In New Whale Hands‚ÄîA Mega BTC Rally On The Horizon? Supply Tightens On Exchanges The declining volume of Ether on exchanges is an indication that the holders are taking their money elsewhere in growing numbers. One of the main reasons behind this is the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, according to a recent examination by Santiment. People are interacting with several DeFi protocols with their Ethereum to lend liquidity or earn rewards. Another principal element is the expansion of staking, whereby ETH owners ‚Äúlock up‚Äù their coins to help secure the network and be rewarded while doing so. Therefore, there is fewer Ethereum to sell on the exchanges. üëã Thanks to the many DeFi and staking options, Ethereum‚Äôs holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015). There is 16.4% less $ETH on exchanges compared to just 7 weeks ago. üòÆ pic.twitter.com/r5957wPhLi ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 20, 2025 Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Despite the lower supply of Ethereum on exchanges, which some would expect to drive prices up because of scarcity, the opposite has occurred. Based on latest figures, the price of Ethereum has dropped by about 45% from its December high. On March 21, the price was about $1,899. Ethereum has been among the worst-performing major cryptocurrencies over the past few years. The cause for such a decline in price is varied and can involve overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and increased competition from other blockchain systems. Experts Share Their Thoughts Financial analysts are giving their opinions regarding what this means for the future value of Ethereum. Standard Chartered, a well-known financial institution, has recently reduced its year-end price target for Ethereum. They now predict a price of $4,000 at the end of the year, a significant drop from their previous estimate of $10,000. The primary purpose of this revision is the rising competition from Ethereum‚Äôs competitor layer-2 networks, which aim to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum foundation blockchain. Users and traffic on such networks can be different from the central Ethereum network. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It‚Äôs Lift-Off Time Upsides On The Horizon? Despite the current price hiccups, there are potential explanations why a recovery could be realized. One possibility is staking exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

In 2020, this so-called ‚ÄúDogecoin killer‚Äù launched with barely any fanfare. The entry price was so microscopic that even a hundred bucks could‚Äôve fetched millions of tokens. Fast forward to today, and those same early investors are sitting on insane profits‚Äîsome turning a few hundred dollars into millions. But let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîShiba Inu‚Äôs explosive moment has passed. The days of getting in at a rock-bottom price and riding a rocket to the moon are over. It‚Äôs already mainstream, and massive gains aren‚Äôt as easy. But here‚Äôs the thing about meme coins: there‚Äôs always a next big play. Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a brand-new meme coin that isn‚Äôt just another Shiba Inu wannabe‚Äîit‚Äôs rewriting the script. Arctic Pablo isn‚Äôt riding on the past success of other tokens. It‚Äôs carving out its own legacy with an immersive story, a lucrative staking system, and an insanely limited-time presale where early adopters can get in at a fraction of its potential worth. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Frontier in Meme Coins Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors on an adventurous journey alongside its eponymous explorer, Arctic Pablo. Set against the backdrop of icy terrains and mystical ice-covered islands, Pablo‚Äôs quest is not just about exploration but also about uncovering the enigmatic $APC coins. These tokens symbolize more than mere currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity, imbued with the magic of forgotten lands. This storytelling approach transforms the investment experience, making participants feel like integral parts of an unfolding legend. Departing from traditional presale models, Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is structured around Pablo‚Äôs journey through various mythical locations. Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is in the Nippy Nook location, the 15th phase of its journey. The token is priced at $0.000079, with over $1.96 million raised so far. The launch price is $0.008, offering early investors a potential return on investment (ROI) of over 10,027.85% from the current presale price to the listing price. An investment of $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 12,656,860 APC tokens, which could be worth $101,254.88 upon reaching the listing price. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance token scarcity and value through weekly token burns. At the end of each presale phase, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens over time. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Its one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now . The Shiba Inu Phenomenon: A Missed Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene as a decentralized meme token, positioning itself as an experiment in community-driven cryptocurrency. Launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly gained traction, riding on the coattails of Dogecoin‚Äôs popularity. Its initial price was minuscule, allowing early investors to acquire large quantities with minimal capital. As the coin gained popularity, its value soared, creating substantial returns for those who got in early. However, as with many rapidly appreciating assets, the window for maximum gains was narrow. Many potential investors were on the sidelines, watching SHIB‚Äôs value escalate beyond their reach. This scenario underscores the importance of identifying and acting on emerging opportunities before they become mainstream. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities for investors. While the Shiba Inu moment may have passed, Arctic Pablo Coin is a compelling contender among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Its unique narrative, innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanisms, and attractive staking rewards position it as a project with significant potential. Investors seeking to capitalize on low entry points and participate in a community-driven adventure should join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now, before this opportunity, too, becomes a tale of missed chances.

Two established coins, Dogecoin and Cardano, are currently struggling, creating room for a new project like RCO Finance to shine. Investors are rapidly taking notice, shifting toward projects that can deliver real value alongside massive profits. Dogecoin Struggles as Miners Dump Millions of Tokens Dogecoin (DOGE), once touted as one of the top altcoins to watch, has been going through a rough patch lately. An analyst recently shared data revealing Dogecoin miners sold off over 65 million tokens in just 48 hours. Such significant selling pressure from miners usually signals trouble, potentially pushing the meme coin even lower. At the current price of $0.17, Dogecoin sits far below its peak of $0.431 from January. Analysts warn if this selling continues, DOGE could slip under $0.15 soon. However, some traders remain hopeful, believing past patterns could bring a major comeback. Notably, large-scale investors bought over 1.4 billion DOGE in a single day last week, hinting that ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù may expect a bullish turn. This mixed sentiment makes Dogecoin one of the key altcoins to watch closely. Source: Coinmarketcap Cardano Losing Investor Interest Amid Declining Volume Cardano (ADA), another top altcoin, isn‚Äôt faring much better. ADA is currently priced at $0.7086, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Even more concerning is that its trading volume dropped significantly by over 20% , hinting that investors might be losing interest in Cardano‚Äôs previously compelling story. With ADA down 1.58% this week and a declining volume, analysts see signs of a potential trend reversal. Cardano‚Äôs slow pace in delivering promised upgrades, coupled with current macroeconomic conditions, has investors reconsidering their holdings and seeking alternative altcoins with stronger growth potential. This cautious sentiment toward Cardano might encourage traders to explore other altcoins to watch‚Äîespecially those showing increased market excitement and rapid growth potential, like RCO Finance. Source: Coinmarketcap RCO Finance Emerges as the Most Promising Altcoin of 2025 While established coins like Dogecoin and Cardano struggle, investors are swiftly turning toward RCO Finance , recognizing it as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Currently priced at only $0.1 and boasting a modest market cap of $591,220, investors see a huge growth runway ahead. RCO Finance isn‚Äôt just another crypto platform; it‚Äôs a revolutionary decentralized financial ecosystem. Users can buy crypto, stocks, real estate, and numerous tokenized assets‚Äîall seamlessly from a single account, without cumbersome KYC processes. This simplicity makes investing hassle-free, attracting new users in droves. But what really sets RCO Finance apart from other altcoins is its advanced AI Robo Advisor. This innovative tool continuously monitors the crypto market, analyzing live data from reliable sources like Reuters and Bloomberg, along with comprehensive on-chain analytics. Imagine spotting opportunities early, like the recent surge in Immutable X (IMX), which exploded from $0.4 to $1.2‚Äîa +200% gain within just months. RCO Finance‚Äôs Robo Advisor could have caught such price moves well before mainstream traders noticed, helping investors get in early and maximize profits. Additionally, RCO Finance offers an extensive range of 120,000 assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, and tokenized real estate. Investors can conveniently diversify their portfolios without converting crypto into fiat first, all within one simple platform. Investor enthusiasm is evident, as RCO Finance has raised over $13 million already, showcasing robust community backing. Analysts expect a massive rally post-launch, with predictions suggesting gains of up to 20,000%. To put this into perspective, a modest $500 investment today could potentially grow to $100,000. It has also been audited by SolidProof , a popular auditor in the field, verifying its security, trustworthiness, and reliability. In addition to that, investors already get to experiment with its functionalities with the newly released Beta Platform . Why RCO Finance is a Must-Have Altcoin Before the Bull Market Returns Given the current crypto landscape, RCO Finance is perfectly positioned to become one of the most profitable altcoins this year. With features like its AI-powered Robo Advisor, no-KYC simplicity, and robust staking options, the platform offers unmatched potential. As the crypto market prepares for its next bullish phase, this might be the last chance to enter RCO Finance at its current presale price. The extraordinary profit potential and real-world functionality mean it‚Äôs a strong contender to outperform traditional favorites like Dogecoin and Cardano. When the market turns, you want to be holding the best-performing altcoins‚Äîthose with strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. RCO Finance is clearly leading the way, offering investors the tools to succeed in the next crypto boom.

Freysa AI‚Äôs native asset, FAI , is trading at $0.0226 at time of writing, up from around $0.0183 a day ago. The 298th-ranked crypto asset by market cap launched in late November. Freysa AI aims to be ‚Äúthe first truly sovereign AI agent.‚Äù The project‚Äôs AI agent has overseen a series of games designed to test human interaction with powerful artificial intelligence systems. For example, in November, entrants used prompts to ‚Äútrick‚Äù the Freysa AI into authorizing a transfer of prize pool funds. Each prompt cost a fee that in turn increased the prize. Being added to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering adding trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was created in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company‚Äôs standards. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it‚Äôs probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it.

Hines suggested that the Trump administration would explore creative ways of funding the SBR without further burdening the American taxpayer. His sentiments seem to be an attempt to pacify Americans, many of whom, according to a recent survey, oppose the SBR. The Data for Progress advocacy group poll showed 51% of American voters disapprove of the idea, placing it last on the list of priority areas for federal funding. America‚Äôs budget-neutral means of financing its SBR Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins‚Äô Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. He said, ‚ÄúIf we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.‚Äù How does revaluing the gold certificates work? Lummins‚Äô push and, therefore, Hines‚Äô stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037 , which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold‚Äôs current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M) , bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B ‚Äì $11B). As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold‚Äôs prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers‚Äô funds. Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates‚Äô scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the‚ÄÇTreasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations. Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue. Revaluing gold certificates‚ÄÇis a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed‚ÄÇbonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve. Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR‚ÄÇvia decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

Here‚Äôs how Coinbase latest $5 bilion acquisition deal could impact Bitcoin prices in the long-term . Bitcoin holds $84K as Coinbase moves to Acquire Deribit Bitcoin (BTC) closed trading around the $84,200 mark on Friday, March 22, as markets retreated from upwards volatility triggered by Trump‚Äôs appearance at Blockwork‚Äôs Digital Asset Summit. Following Trump‚Äôs speech advocating for Stablecoin regulations , and long-term BTC holding, BTC price raced to a weekly timeframe peak of $85,900 before returning 4% to close trading on Friday around $84,228. The impact of Trump‚Äôs BTC price was short-lived since his major talking points during speech had been relatively priced in during the previous market really. However, a recent media report surrounding Coinbase acquisition of derivatives-based crypto exchange could have far reaching longer-term impacts on Bitcoin price. Bitcoin price action | March 22, 2025 According to Bloomberg reports, Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange has entered advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the world‚Äôs leading bitcoin and ether options trading platform. Notably Bloomberg cited anonymous sources in the report , showing that the deal has not yet being made official. ‚ÄúThe companies have notified regulators in Dubai about the discussions as Deribit holds a license there, which would be taken over by any acquirer.‚Äù ‚Äì Bloomberg, March 21, 2025. Coinbase representatives were also coy on the rumours, declining to confirm any ongoing deal discussions. , ‚ÄúWe have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner and invest to accelerate our roadmap.‚Äù ‚Äì Coinbase. While official sources from Deribit and Coinbase keep mum, Bloomberg‚Äôs latest report suggests negotiations are progressing with the options trading platform reportedly valued between $4 billion and $5 billion. Coinbase (COIN) Traders See Mild Gains as Deribit acquisition hints Dubia Expansion Considering that Deribit holds an active license to operate in Dubai, Coinbase‚Äôs decision to pursue this acquisition appears to be a strategic move to expand into the Middle Eastern market. With increasing regulatory pressure from the U.S. and EU, regions such as the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore have emerged as key global hubs for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses. Coinbase (Coin) price surges 4.4% to hit $190 as Bloomberg reveals Deribit acquisition talks | March 21, 2025 The softening stance on crypto regulation in the U.S. could influence the trajectory of this deal. With growing institutional support and strategic reserve announcements expected, the industry could witness a shift in policy under former President Trump‚Äôs potential return. Trump recently reiterated his support for cryptocurrency at Blockworks‚Äô industry event this week. If finalized, Coinbase‚Äôs acquisition of Deribit could enhance its global footprint, broaden its derivatives offerings, and position the exchange to benefit from increasing institutional and sovereign adoption of cryptocurrencies‚Äîparticularly in the Middle East and Asia. Will Coinbase Acquisition of Deribit Impact Bitcoin Price? According to Bloomberg Deribit it‚Äôs the largest Options trading platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Options trading is an institution-dominated space. By acquiring Deribit, Coinbase can deploy options trading offerings, not only to US-based customers but also institutions with corporate headquarters in crypto hotbeds like Dubia, Singapore and Hong kong. Hence, the Coinbase acquisition deal for Deribit, could be yet another major catalyst that could spark increased institutional adoption of BTC in the months ahead. Notably, Donald Trump crypto strategic reserve heading for congressional approval could be a key determinant in Bitcoin global appeal as 2025 unfolds. Bitcoin price forecast: Double-bottom pattern hints at $114,000 rebound target Bitcoin price forecast signals on the BTCUSD daily chart shows a confirmed double-bottom reversal pattern, a historically bullish structure suggesting a potential move toward a long-term target of $114,000. The pattern formed with two distinct lows, at $78,000 and $76,000 followed by a breakout above the neckline resistance. At press time BTC Price is currently consolidating around $84,053, hovering near the middle Keltner Channel (KC) level of $85,392, indicating a neutral market trend as traders await the next major directional move. A bullish scenario could unfold if Bitcoin price can decisively reclaim the upper KC boundary at $93,252, especially if accompanied by increased trading volumes. More so, the BBP (Balanced Bull and Bear Power) indicator, while still negative at -859.38, has begun a reversal with green bars emerging‚Äîan early signal of bullish divergence. Conversely, failure to hold support at $77,533‚Äîthe lower KC band‚Äîcould invalidate the breakout structure, triggering renewed selling pressure. If bears regain control in the secenraio, BTC price risks retesting liquidity zones around $75,000, delaying the bullish trajectory. The next few sessions could be pivotal; as sustained price action above $85,000 strengthens could case for a continued uptrend toward the $114,00o target.

The Tron ecosystem is pushing a new proposal to implement a Bitcoin-like halving for TRX. In his post on X, Justin Sun revealed how the move will not disadvantage current validators in the ecosystem. Justin Sun and Advocacy for TRX Halving As explained on X by the Tron founder, Bitcoin developers had to evolve to limit their reward to users involved in crypto mining at the time. Going back memory lane, he noted that Bitcoin had to create an attractive 50 BTC per block reward to bootstrap the network. However, as the protocol grew, halving helped reduce the incentives to a sustainable level. Liking it to the Tron ecosystem, Justin Sun recounted that TRX is a deflationary asset that drops 1% per year. This made it the only deflationary asset among the top assets. As revealed, the massive rally in the price of TRX has pushed up the reward considerably. This, he believes, might make sense if a moderate slash is approved by the community. Per the analogy, he noted that the Tron ecosystem can achieve a 1.5% per year deflation by paying out about 1 million TRX in validator rewards daily. Notably, increasing this daily payout to 2 million TRX will increase deflation by 2% per year. To Sun, even if the community approved the halving reduction, Tron will remain an attractive chain for miners. The Tron Ecosystem Updates Beyond the TRX halving clarification, Justin Sun has been front-running many positive ecosystem updates. Over the past week, the Tron Founder has revealed the push for Tron integration on Solana . This partnership is poised to increase the transfer of native tokens across both chains. In addition, the ecosystem is also being increasingly embraced by top industry stakeholders. CoinGape reported that Justin Sun was appointed an advisor to President Trump-linked World Liberty Financial International (WLFi). Since then, TRX has remained a favorite for the coin in WLFi‚Äôs portfolio. Reports also show that TRX may bag an inclusion in the crypto reserve that the US government is putting together. TRX Price and Performance Outlook The price of TRX remains under the radar amid the growing shift in network supply and related trends. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.2366, up by 0.13% in 24 hours. Amid the week-long fluctuations, the coin‚Äôs price rose from a low of $0.2305 to a high of $0.2373, showing a relatively mild volatility. However, earlier TRX price predictions from Sun teased the coin as hitting an all-time high soon. Analysts remain speculative about how the Tron halving proposal will shape out and its impact on price.

In response to an inquiry on professional orientation for all Gen Z high school graduates this year, Altman responded that studying AI tools is essential to succeed at work now. He argued that AI rapidly transforms work, and studying those skills makes sense. Altman drew an analogy by stating that during his high school days, when he studied how to program, it was the most stable route to decent-paying jobs. AI is already having‚ÄÇa huge influence in the tech world. According to Sam Altman, AI currently handles about half the coding at‚ÄÇmost companies. Some experts, like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, reckon AI will be capable of‚ÄÇ90% of coding in three to 6 months. That shift is leading companies to rethink‚ÄÇtheir hiring practices. Software engineers will not be extinct. However, businesses now need individuals who can work with and utilize AI‚ÄÇcapabilities. This is evident in job postings‚ÄÇat big employers like Apple, Amazon, and Meta, which recently offered seven-figure salaries for the best AI scientists. AI literacy has become the most sought-after skill According to a recent report by LinkedIn , AI literacy is the fastest emerging‚ÄÇskill for 2025. Companies‚ÄÇin all sectors want someone who understands AI and can wield it for problem-solving and innovation. The report describes AI literacy as a general skill covering knowledge and using tools like ChatGPT and other generative technologies. No one can deny it‚Äîit‚Äôs not just an inevitable part of the life of a‚ÄÇtech whiz anymore. Business, marketing, media, and communication professionals also use AI to enhance their work. Programmer engaged in coding: Source: Pixabay AI literacy allows people to leverage AI-powered tools, which can be applied without advanced‚ÄÇtechnical know-how for model building or data analysis. With artificial intelligence emerging as a powerful component in personal and professional workflows, engineers and tech professionals are adopting AI to automate processes, increase efficiency, and drive innovation. But getting one‚ÄÇof these lucrative AI jobs is no easy feat. As LinkedIn‚Äôs editor-in-chief, Dan Roth, reported today, while the fingertips attached to the dwindling hiring rate are at 3.4%,‚ÄÇpeople are applying in droves. He said companies are hiring less. It‚Äôs not a catastrophe, but it‚Äôs not good out there. AI skills are important, of course, but they are‚ÄÇnot the only way to future-proof yourself at work. Soft skills are‚ÄÇmore important than ever. Indeed‚Äôs chief executive, Chris Hyams, told Fortune that employers should focus on candidates with ‚Äúcuriosity and an openness‚Äù to learn. Adapting and bouncing‚ÄÇback will be crucial in navigating a shifting labour market. Soft skills remain important even with AI expertise While AI capabilities are an asset, technical skills alone will not be enough. Altman recommends Gen Z consider soft skills such as adaptability and resilience. As the employment landscape continues to shift, employees who can easily learn new technology will be sought after. Indeed chief executive Chris Hyams agrees. He recommends hiring managers seek out inquisitive applicants who will be adaptable. As AI automates more things, businesses still need people who can analyze, innovate and adapt. Despite formal education initiatives or self-instructing using AI tools‚ÄÇlike Google‚Äôs NotebookLM, younger professionals must stay ahead of the curve. According to Altman, as AI advances and the career sector is primed for disruption, Gen Z should use‚ÄÇsuch tools in their favour to stay at the forefront.

Rival Token Poised for Bigger Returns in the Next 3 Months,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ada-breakout-to-1-50-rival-token-poised-for-bigger-returns-in-the-next-3-months/,"As bullish momentum gathers steam behind a‚ÄÇpotential breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, Cardano (ADA) retires above $0.72. Analysts are forecasting a rally to $1.00 as buying pressure persists, though‚ÄÇwhale activity potentially undermines this trend. In the last few days, over 100 million ADA tokens have‚ÄÇbeen splashed on markets, and short-term stability is doubtful. As Cardano‚Äôs technical indicators suggest it may have hit‚ÄÇthe bottom, another project is stealing the limelight‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM), a recently launched presale that‚Äôs already blitzed past $4.1 million and is forecasting 10x+ gains after its token launch. Cardano‚Äôs Shaky Ascent The 4-hour chart of Cardano glooming a triple white soldier pattern with‚ÄÇthree consecutive green candles in the tug-of-war game between the bulls and bears. This usually indicates upward momentum, but ADA‚Äôs 2.82% intraday increase to $0.7246‚ÄÇis facing resistance. The MACD indicator approaches a bullish crossover, which‚ÄÇis complemented by RSI readings approaching neutrality. But according to data from Santiment, a grim truth is being unearthed:‚ÄÇwhales have dumped 100 million ADA in a week, cutting big holders balances to only 5.89 billion tokens. Such sell-offs could put a lid on gains at‚ÄÇ$1.00, well below the $1.50 that some optimists see. Key support comes in at $0.65; a break there threatens a drop to‚ÄÇ$0.60. Presale Momentum‚ÄÇof Mutuum Finance Builds As Cardano faces volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to forge ahead into phase 3 of its presale at‚ÄÇ$0.02 per token. More than 6,300‚ÄÇinvestors have already joined, driving a $4.1 million raise. Phase‚ÄÇ3 is nearly sold out before Phase 4, where prices will increase 25% to $0.025. Early investors securing their tokens now can already make 200% when the launch comes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will‚ÄÇhit the market at $0.06. After the initial jump, analysts predict $3.00 within months of exchanges (14,900%‚ÄÇabove current prices). Mutuum Finance‚Äôs tokenomics include a buy-and-distribute model with platform‚ÄÇrevenue redirected to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from open markets. These tokens go back to stakers, driving repeated buying pressure while‚ÄÇpreventing sell-offs. At the same time, the protocol‚Äôs lending infrastructure ‚Äî with overcollateralized loans and mtTokens that accrue interest‚ÄÇ‚Äî ensures utility. A Certik audit of its smart contracts is being finalized by developers ‚Äî an‚ÄÇachievement likely to lend credibility to the project once officially announced. The Window‚ÄÇfor Strategic Choice Reshapes Unlike whale pump and dump actions that mask any path to success, Mutuum Finance represents a‚ÄÇquantifiable opportunity. Its presale system offers early investors a 200% launch return and targets on post-listing price action dwarf‚ÄÇADA‚Äôs vague estimates. With Phase‚ÄÇ3 almost full, the time left to acquire token at $0.02 is narrowing down. Adventurous‚ÄÇinvestors have begun to lend an ear and stop shuffling deck chairs; through a systemic approach to demand generation and real-world DeFi utility, this prototype asset has proved itself to be valuable in its own right, and with it, those who prioritize measurable gains can find respite in the lovely new world of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This will soon be topped by the completion of its Certik audit, which can act as a catalyst for adoption, as confirmed via Mutuum Finance‚ÄÇsocial channel. For individuals looking for asymmetric results within a volatile crypto marketplace,‚ÄÇthe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is a deliberate point of entry‚Äî a convergence of tokenomics and timing. Fewer tokens are‚ÄÇavailable now and you can secure before Phase 3 is over making the tokens more expensive.

Unlike volatile price swings seen in other assets, TON‚Äôs consistent rise signals strong underlying demand and market stability. The cryptocurrency has successfully held key support levels, preventing major pullbacks and allowing buyers to take control of the trend. With momentum building, market participants are closely monitoring resistance levels that could determine the next phase of TON‚Äôs price action. Should buying pressure continue to increase, the cryptocurrency could be poised for further gains, potentially testing higher resistance zones. Can Toncoin Sustain Its Renewed Upswing? Toncoin recent price resurgence has strengthened bullish sentiment, but the sustainability of this uptrend remains a critical focus. The cryptocurrency has managed to establish solid footing above the $2.36 key support level. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on several technical and market factors. Related Reading: TON Price Jumps 20% Following Positive News On Telegram Founder The cryptocurrency is currently maintaining its upward momentum as it approaches the $4.34 resistance level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This steady climb indicates growing bullish strength, with buyers continuing to push the price higher despite potential resistance. A decisive breakout above the $4.34 resistance level could strengthen the ongoing uptrend, setting the stage for Toncoin toward the $6.13 resistance mark. If buying momentum remains strong and the price clears this key level, it could open the door for a potential test of its all-time high of $7.29. Technical indicators such as the MACD suggest that momentum remains in favor of the bulls, but increasing resistance pressure might lead to volatility. Sustained buying pressure will confirm the uptrend and push the price beyond these critical technical barriers. Volume analysis further reinforces Toncoin‚Äôs upward momentum, with trading volume increasing by over 10%, indicating strong market participation. Should volume continue to rise alongside price movement, it could validate the strength of the uptrend and enhance the likelihood of further gains. Potential Downside Risk If Toncoin faces rejection at a key resistance level, monitoring critical support zones will be essential to assess the strength of its uptrend. The first major support level to watch is around $2.36, where buyers previously showed interest. A dip to this level is likely to attract fresh demand and stabilize the price. Related Reading: Toncoin Gears Up For A Fresh Rally With Bullish Momentum Building A breakdown below this level could indicate a shift in momentum, accelerating selling pressure and leading to a deeper decline. If buyers fail to defend critical support zones, the price may struggle to recover, increasing the risk of establishing new lows.

After a descending triangle trend from mid 2021 through early 2025, the ETH/BTC pair has now reached a level where it showed a buying range in late 2020. Such a technical development combined with increased open interest in the futures is fueling the debate on trend reversal. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery: Key Support Level Could Spark Reversal According to a recent post on X , analyst AndrewCryptoHQ noted that ETH/BTC is now trading at a crucial technical level. This level previously acted as a launchpad for gains during Q4 2020. Since its peak in mid-2021, the pair has remained in a downtrend, posting consistent lower highs and lower lows. As of late March 2025, ETH/BTC is resting near a multi-year support zone. Market participants are watching closely to see whether this zone can hold and initiate an altcoin rebound. If supported, it could mark a key turning point in Ethereum price performance compared to Bitcoin. Source: X However, downside risks remain. A decline in Bitcoin could put pressure on Ethereum price action. ETH has shown sensitivity to Bitcoin‚Äôs market direction in previous cycles. Without a confirmed breakout or higher low formation, traders remain cautious about calling a full reversal. ETH Futures Open Interest Hits Record as Caution Lingers On March 21, Ether futures open interest reached a record high of 10.23 million ETH, according to data from CoinGlass . This figure represents a 15% increase over two weeks, signaling growing participation in derivative markets. Despite the rise in open interest, the futures premium dropped below 4%, down from 5% two weeks prior. This lower premium suggests subdued bullish sentiment, as traders are not aggressively pursuing leveraged long positions. Binance, Gate.io, and Bitget accounted for over half of the futures market, while CME captured 9%. The increased leverage does not automatically indicate upward price movement. Open interest simply reflects matched positions between buyers and sellers. The absence of a strong premium points to a neutral stance from investors regarding the altcoin price trajectory. Ethereum Network Fees Fall as On-Chain Activity Slows However, Ethereum network fees fell by 50% over the past seven days, according to IntoTheBlock . The reduction signals a decline in user activity and overall demand on the Ethereum mainnet. Total revenue for Ethereum‚Äôs base layer dropped to $605,000 as of March 17, compared to $2.5 million just two weeks earlier. Lower fees are partly due to the growing use of Layer 2 solutions, which move transactions off the mainnet to improve scalability. However, the shift has also reduced transaction volume on the core network. Users and protocols are increasingly exploring alternative chains such as Solana and Avalanche. This slowdown in network usage presents challenges for Ethereum price support. The downturn in activity may contribute to hesitancy around the altcoin‚Äôs near-term outlook. However, Ethereum whales have started to accumulate again as one of them bought nearly $270 million worth of ETH. This goes hand in hand with the increase in the daily active addresses by 26%, which may signal a reversal of the Ethereum price chart.

Disinterest among short-term traders puts ETH price as risk of another pull back towards $1,850. Ethereum (ETH) fails to hold $2,000 support despite Trump‚Äôs speech Ethereum (ETH) price showed promising price action earlier this week, but latest price action suggests the optimism may have already petered out in less than 24 hours. Ethereum price rallied 10% at the start of the week, rising from $1760, to hit $2,065 riding on positive tailwinds for successful deployment of its Hoodi update. Ethereum (ETH) price action , March 22, 2025 | CoinMarketCap Trump‚Äôs appearance at Blockwork‚Äôs Digital Asset Summit, boosted market momentum on Thursday, driving ETH price above the $2,067 mark on Friday, according CoinmarketCap data. Recent market trends show the majority of ETH bull traders failed to hold the gains for up-to 24 hours. Following Trump‚Äôs speech, Ethereum opened trading on Friday above the $2,000 for the first time in nearly two-weeks dating back to March 9. However, ETH bulls failed to build on the rebound, as ETH price rapidly plunged below the $2,000 mark and closed for the day around $1,965. However, as seen in the chart above, the persistent decline in ETH trading volumes suggests bears could struggle to drive major downward moves in the coming trading session. Ethereum Derivatives Markets Analysis: Open Interest Dips Below $20 Billion but Multiple Upside Signals Remain Ethereum‚Äôs derivatives market reflects mixed sentiment, with open interest holding at $19.94B, barely above the $20B threshold, despite a 26.7% drop in trading volume to $22.80B. Options open interest has also fallen 5.45% to $5.88B, indicating instutional speculators are also scaling down their exposure to Ethereum. Ethereum Derivatives Markets Analysis Beyond that, Conversely, Liquidation data also provides key insights into recent negative tilt in mark sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, total rekt positions reached $24.63M, with $17.18M in long liquidations and $7.45M in short liquidations, suggesting that bullish traders were over-leveraged before recent price correction. Additionally, $3.47M was wiped in the past 4 hours, further reflecting the market‚Äôs vulnerability to sudden price swings. Ethereum price outlook today: Failure to Hold $1,850 Exposes ETH to More Downside Risks ETH price is trading just above the $1,900 mark at press time. However, Ethereum price forecast signals on derivatives trends suggest caution is warranted if ETH stagnates near $2,000. The Coinglass derivatives chart shows ETH/USDT long/short ratios on Binance (3.42) and OKX (3.44) show bullish positioning from traders, with Binance‚Äôs top traders maintaining a 4.16 long/short ratio on accounts. This suggest that traders may be entering fresh bullish positions after the recent profit-taking phase that ensued after Trump‚Äôs speech on Thursday. A prolonged lack of directional momentum could deter speculative traders, and prompt existing holders to close ETH positions in search of more volatile assets. In this scenario, further declines in market participation could drive open interest below $20B, weakening key support levels around $1,850, and exposing ETH to potential downside risks.

Early investors are looking at a staggering 10,027.85% ROI, making it one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week before it surges to the anticipated listing price of $0.008. But the adventure doesn‚Äôt end there. Arctic Pablo Coin offers a generous 66% APY staking program, allowing investors to stake their $APC tokens and watch their holdings grow. With all staked coins vested for two months post-launch, this mechanism fosters a committed and engaged community‚Äîyet another reason why Arctic Pablo is among the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary model by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the coin‚Äôs value over time. The token burns are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. In essence, Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just a meme token‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week, blending a captivating narrative with innovative tokenomics.

A recent 857% spike in token burns indicates SHIB‚Äôs deflationary mechanics are in full swing, fueling speculation of a potential breakout. ‚Äã The community-driven approach, coupled with these developments, positions Shiba Inu as more than just a meme coin; it‚Äôs evolving into a multifaceted digital asset with real-world applications.‚Äã Dog (Bitcoin): Bridging Meme Culture with Bitcoin‚Äôs Robustness Dog (Bitcoin) ($DOG) is a decentralized meme coin built on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Runes Protocol. With a market cap of $193 million and a circulating supply of 100 billion DOG tokens, it has gained traction across centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and Bitcoin Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. Despite a recent dip of 2.02%, DOG has seen a 24-hour trading volume surge to $7.09 million, reflecting strong market activity. Since its launch on April 24, 2024, through a volunteer-led airdrop, DOG has aimed to onboard millions to Bitcoin. While it hit an all-time high of $0.009947 in December 2024, it currently trades at $0.00193‚Äîdown 80.65% but up 28.08% from its all-time low on March 11, 2025. With growing community support and exchange listings, DOG continues to be a notable player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. ‚Äã The community-centric approach, combined with the robust foundation of the Bitcoin blockchain, makes Dog (Bitcoin) a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio.‚Äã Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, these three meme coins‚ÄîArctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Dog (Bitcoin)‚Äîeach bring something unique to the table.

42125340,https://coingape.com/?p=245367,1742606988,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Solana Price Eyes Rally To $200 As Network Adoption Hits New ATH,https://coingape.com/solana-price-eyes-rally-to-200-as-network-adoption-hits-new-ath/,"Solana (SOL) is gaining attention in the crypto market after hitting a new all-time high (ATH) in network adoption. The number of addresses holding SOL has surpassed 11 million, signaling increasing interest in the network. This surge in adoption comes amid recent developments, including the launch of Solana futures ETFs and rising institutional interest. With these factors, analysts are now eyeing a potential rally for Solana‚Äôs price, possibly pushing it towards the $200 mark. New Adoption Milestone for Solana On-chain analytics reveal that more than 11.09 million addresses currently hold the SOL token on the Solana network. This is the new ATH in terms of network adoption of Solana which is a signal in the context of its long-term development. The increase in address activity indicates that more users are participating in the Solana ecosystem, which is further expanding progressively as a decentralized network. From the statistics, this uptick is expected to compliment the Solana price in the coming months especially after the development of Network. Solana‚Äôs increase in the adoption rate can be attributed to the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The introduction of Solana futures ETFs, followed by the possibility of the spot Solana ETF, has attracted corporate investors/traders. Analysts see these as optimisms within the market that could lead to another push up in the price of Solana. The breakout from the current range and continued institutional participation could lead to new highs for Solana price. Solana Futures ETFs Spark New Interest In March 2025, Solana still saw one of the most important events in its existence by launching own futures ETFs. These include the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the leveraged Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT). These are funds that give investors direct access to Solana futures contracts and are present on Nasdaq. The listing of Solana‚Äôs futures ETFs is a sign that Solana is gradually gaining more recognition in mainstream finance, meaning that more investors can invest in Solana token. While the launch has brought Solana into the spotlight, some market analysts have noted mixed reactions. Despite this, the debut of these financial products has led to an increase in Solana‚Äôs price, with the token briefly rising above $136. Analysts believe that these products could provide long-term support for Solana‚Äôs price as they bring more liquidity and market visibility to the SOL price hitting $200 again. Institutional Support and Increased Market Confidence There is growing support by institutions such as Fidelity Investments with the latest accruing to Solana network. This new Fidelity Solana Fund was recently filed with the registry of Delaware shows that Solana might stand on the entity of mainstream finance. Given that Fidelity has a network of $4.9 trillion in assets, its entrance to the Solana ecosystem could be a major boost to the project. With a growing number of institutions seeking to invest in Solana to diversify their portfolio the future appears promising for the network. These institutional backs are encouraging by the increasing growing rate in the cryptocurrency market and for Solana in particular. Polymarket further reveals that the probability of Solana attaining an ETF has risen to 88% this year. With more institutions investing in Solana, it is perhaps only a matter of time before regulators change their stance and approve SOL spot ETFs boosting Solana price rally towards $200.

Open interest , which tracks the total number of outstanding derivative contracts at any time, declined from $57 billion when BTC hit its ATH to $24.5 billion today. This means‚ÄÇthat market movers are closing out uncertainty or unwinding leverage. The digital asset is now attempting to regain momentum after recent selling pressure. Despite hitting an ATH of over $109,000 in January, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $90,000 level. Bitcoin struggles to regain important price levels Bitcoin has been attempting to break above the $90,000 resistance level for the last two weeks. This follows its failure to remain upward after hitting‚ÄÇits all-time high. This put downward pressure on BTC, igniting speculation on whether the most recent bull run was complete‚ÄÇor if a second rally could see it soar higher than ever. According to on-chain data provider Glassnode, this fall in open interest comes amid an overall trend of falling‚ÄÇon-chain liquidity. The unwinding of long-side bias from cash-and-carry trade, where traders make money on the difference between spot and futures prices, has also contributed to downward pressure. Adding to the strain, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also under pressure and recorded outflows, while some CME futures contracts are terminating, which further pressures the price of Bitcoin. Another notable shift is the decline in BTC‚Äôs ‚ÄúHot Supply‚Äù‚Äîcoins held for one week or less. In the last‚ÄÇthree months, the hot supply dropped from 5.9% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply to a mere 2.8%, a decline of more than 50%. This suggests fewer newly acquired Bitcoins are being actively traded, reducing market liquidity. Bitcoin exchange inflows have also dramatically declined, going from 58,600 BTC / day‚ÄÇto 26,900 BTC / day ‚Äî a 54% decrease. While that‚ÄÇmay signal less selling pressure, it also means that demand is weaker, as fewer coins are being sent to exchanges to be traded. Bitcoin prepares to test crucial support levels BTC is currently trading at $84,001, holding above the important support at $85,000. Industry analyst ‚ÄúUnknown‚ÄÇTrader‚Äù stressed that the Bitcoin uptrend is only intact above this level, and BTC only closed recently. Additionally, the asset remains above the 200-day moving average, a historically bullish indicator for long-term price momentum. BTC is back up to the retest of around‚ÄÇ$85,000 again. If it soars, analysts anticipate a move to the resistance‚ÄÇzone of $90,500‚Äì$92,441. Yet, this solid rejection level can keep fine-tuning a swoop back up until another retest at $85,000. CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu, for his part, reported potential‚ÄÇinstitutional accumulation. He pointed out how the 30-day EMA of the Coinbase Premium Index is struggling to cross above‚ÄÇthe one-hundred-day EMA. This crossover‚ÄÇhappened before BTC‚Äôs price rallies typically; therefore, institutional players could be accumulating Bitcoin. As institutional demand continues to pour in, BTC‚Äôs price could still‚ÄÇrise, prolonging this bull market instead of signalling its top. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

More on Dogecoin Market Cap & ADA Price Forecast,https://thecoinrise.com/will-blockdag-reach-1-after-2380-growth-more-on-dogecoin-market-cap-ada-price-forecast/,"The latest market activity has reignited discussions about Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap, with some analysts suggesting DOGE could rise to $2.3 if it ever equaled Elon Musk‚Äôs net worth. Meanwhile, Cardano price prediction remains under scrutiny as ADA struggles to break the $0.80 resistance level, which continues to challenge traders. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is not waiting for the market to dictate its path‚Äîit‚Äôs creating its own momentum. Its presale has already amassed $205 million, and BDAG‚Äôs price has soared 2,380% since batch 1. Forecasts indicate BDAG could reach $1 in 2025 and climb to $30 by 2030, making it a strong contender for the next crypto to explode. Dogecoin Market Cap Needs a 1,083% Jump for $2.3‚ÄîIs It Feasible? Dogecoin‚Äôs price speculation continues, with many questioning whether it can hit $2.3 per coin. Achieving this milestone would require the Dogecoin market cap to jump 1,083% to match Elon Musk‚Äôs estimated $342.4 billion net worth. DOGE is currently trading at $0.1951, struggling to regain traction after falling from its 2021 peak of $0.7376. Unlike other assets with structured development roadmaps, Dogecoin heavily depends on community enthusiasm and external endorsements. Even if another price surge happens, its long-term sustainability remains uncertain. Cardano Price Prediction: Can ADA Surpass the $0.80 Mark? Cardano continues to test the $0.80 resistance level, a price it has struggled to overcome multiple times. If ADA successfully breaks through, it could target $0.95 or even $1.15. However, its future trajectory remains unclear as maintaining an upward trend has proven difficult. Trading at $0.72, ADA has yet to reclaim its former highs after reaching $1.15. Weak buying momentum, coupled with an RSI reading of 42.54, indicates hesitancy among market participants. If ADA fails to stay above $0.70, a dip toward $0.63 or lower could be possible. BlockDAG‚Äôs Rapid Rise‚Äî Early Holders Gained 2,380% Returns! Securing a high-growth cryptocurrency at a low price is an opportunity few want to miss. With an overwhelming number of options available, identifying the right project can be difficult. However, BlockDAG has emerged as a standout in 2025. Raising over $205 million and selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG is gaining recognition as a leading cryptocurrency. Its presale has seen rapid expansion, with BDAG‚Äôs value skyrocketing 2,380% from its initial $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27, showing growing demand. What‚Äôs driving this momentum? Accessibility. BlockDAG is designed for broad adoption, enabling seamless participation in its ecosystem. Over 500,000 individuals are already mining BDAG effortlessly through the X1 Miner App . Additionally, developers benefit from BlockDAG‚Äôs WASM compatibility, allowing for smooth smart contract deployment using widely used programming languages. The growing engagement from miners and developers is not only increasing adoption but also strengthening BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem. Projects with real expansion potential tend to attract sustained interest, and BlockDAG is consistently demonstrating its capacity for long-term growth. With a mainnet launch and 10 major CEX listings approaching, BDAG‚Äôs price trajectory remains strong. Predictions suggest $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and a projected $30 by 2030. For those considering entering this growing project, the timing might be right. BDAG coins are currently priced at $0.0248, but demand is pushing batch sales to sell out quickly. As each batch closes, prices are expected to climb even further. Which Cryptocurrency Will Be the Next to Explode? As speculation intensifies over Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap potentially reaching new heights and Cardano price prediction hovering near critical resistance, market participants are evaluating their choices. While DOGE‚Äôs path to $2.3 remains unclear and ADA continues to struggle at $0.80, BlockDAG is making notable progress through its expanding ecosystem and strong presale performance.

If successful, $500 million will be allocated to early-stage crypto investments, while the remaining $500 million will go toward late-stage crypto investments, people familiar with the matter told Fortune Crypto on March 21. Different market conditions to 2022 led to lowered expectations The VC firm, founded by former Coinbase board member and federal prosecutor Katie Haun in 2022, reportedly did not aim for the $1.5 billion it raised in its highly praised funding round in 2022. It cited different market conditions as the reason for the lower target. However, Haun reportedly expects the two new funds will be ‚Äúoversubscribed.‚Äù In March 2022, Haun secured $1.5 billion in the company‚Äôs first funding round, shortly after its launch. Haun had also recruited former executives from Airbnb, Coinbase and Google tech incubator Jigsaw . The firm‚Äôs latest fundraising round is set to close in June and is expected to be one of the largest in crypto funding in the past two years. Venture capital firm Paradigm and digital asset investment manager Pantera Capital both sought similar amounts in 2024. 137 crypto companies raised a combined $1.11 billion in funding in February 2025.¬†Source: The TIE In June 2024, Paradigm closed an $850 million investment fund , while in April, digital asset investment manager Pantera Capital sought to raise over $1 billion for a new blockchain-focused fund. VCs predict that stablecoins will continue to be a focus in 2025 More recently, Haun Ventures participated in crypto asset management firm Bitwise‚Äôs $70 million funding round alongside investors such as Electric Capital, MassMutual, MIT Investment Management Company, and Highland Capital. While the specific focus of Haun's upcoming crypto funds is not publicly known yet, other venture capitalists have recently predicted that stablecoin interest will continue into 2025. Related: Venture capital firms invest $400M in TON blockchain Deng Chao, CEO of institutional asset manager HashKey Capital , recently told Cointelegraph that stablecoins were the strongest proven use case for crypto in 2024. Meanwhile, market analyst Infinity Hedge predicted that crypto VC investment in 2025 would surpass last year‚Äôs levels but wouldn‚Äôt approach the peak recorded during the 2021 bull market. VC crypto funding in 2021 reached $33.8 billion, while in 2024 it reached $13.6 billion . Cointelegraph reached out to Haun Ventures but did not receive a response by time of publication.

With new developments rolling out daily, staying ahead means knowing where the action is. This week, Sonic and Solana are making serious waves, each shaking up the market in its own way. Sonic‚Äôs recent momentum suggests it could be gearing up for a significant rally, while Solana‚Äôs latest integration with Tron is opening up fresh opportunities in DeFi and NFTs. Both are making headlines, but are they the best opportunities right now? Qubetics ($TICS), a game-changing Web3 aggregator, is taking center stage among the top cryptos to join this week by solving one of crypto‚Äôs biggest headaches‚Äîinteroperability. Unlike the rest, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain; it‚Äôs a bridge uniting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more into one cohesive ecosystem. Plus, its Qubetics presale is turning heads with mind-blowing ROI projections. Could this be the one move that makes all the difference for early adopters? Let‚Äôs break it all down. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Changing the Game Blockchain has a serious communication problem. Most networks operate in silos, making it frustratingly difficult for assets, data, and applications to move across different chains. This is where Qubetics comes in. As the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, it creates a seamless bridge between major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means businesses, developers, and everyday users can finally interact across networks without jumping through hoops. Picture this: A business wants to accept payments from different blockchains, but compatibility issues slow everything down. With Qubetics, transactions happen instantly, no matter which network the customer is using. The same applies to NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, and data-sharing services. No more being locked into a single ecosystem‚ÄîQubetics makes everything flow effortlessly. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not just another blockchain project; it‚Äôs a long-overdue solution to one of crypto‚Äôs biggest bottlenecks. top cryptos to join this week don‚Äôt just promise big gains‚Äîthey solve real problems, and Qubetics is leading the charge. Crypto Presales Are Where Fortunes Are Made‚ÄîQubetics Presale Leads the Top Cryptos to Join This Week Crypto presales are where fortunes are made, and Qubetics presale is shaping up to be one of the most rewarding yet. With each stage lasting only seven days before the price jumps 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, early buyers are locking in before the next increase. Right now, Qubetics is in Stage 26, with a price of $0.1181 per $TICS token. Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: Over $15.3 million already raised. More than 502 million $TICS tokens sold. Over 23,500 holders and counting. Mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025. Now, let‚Äôs talk numbers. If $TICS hits just $1, that‚Äôs a 746.04% ROI from today‚Äôs price. But analysts are eyeing much bigger milestones: $5 per $TICS = 4,130.23% ROI $6 per $TICS = 4,976.27% ROI $10 per $TICS = 8,360.26% ROI $15 per $TICS = 12,590.69% ROI For perspective, a $100 investment today could turn into $8,360 if $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch. That‚Äôs the kind of upside that has the crypto community buzzing. With best crypto presale opportunities dwindling fast, this one is on a serious watchlist. Sonic‚Äôs $S Rally: Could It Hit $0.70? Sonic has been one of the most talked-about projects this week, and for good reason. According to recent reports, $S is showing strong upward momentum and could be primed for a surge towards $0.70. Analysts are closely watching key resistance levels, and if it breaks through the current price barriers, a substantial rally could be on the way. Adding to the hype, on-chain metrics suggest increasing whale accumulation, signaling confidence among major players. The trading volume has seen a sharp uptick, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. However, while Sonic is riding this wave, the big question remains‚Äîwill this momentum hold, or is this just another short-term spike? With speculation running high, Sonic is undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week if the rally continues. But as always, the volatility of the crypto market means timing is everything. Solana‚Äôs Latest Move: Tron Integration Expands DeFi and NFTs Solana has been making major headlines with its new integration with Tron, announced by Justin Sun. This move aims to increase access to TRX across Solana‚Äôs ecosystem, unlocking new possibilities for DeFi and NFT applications. By bridging the two ecosystems, users can now seamlessly interact with Tron-based assets on Solana, boosting liquidity and cross-chain functionality. This isn‚Äôt just a technical update‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic move that could further cement Solana‚Äôs dominance in the DeFi space. Over the past year, Solana has consistently ranked among the most widely adopted blockchains, and this integration only strengthens its position. If this development attracts more developers and protocols to build within its ecosystem, Solana could see another wave of growth. For those looking to capitalize on major network expansions, Solana‚Äôs latest move puts it high on the list of top cryptos to join this week. With DeFi and NFTs continuing to thrive, this update could be a game-changer for the ecosystem. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Stands Out the Most? Sonic and Solana are both making impressive strides‚Äîone riding an anticipated price rally, the other expanding its ecosystem with a major integration. Both are strong contenders in their own right, but neither offers the kind of early-stage opportunity seen in Qubetics presale. With its Web3 aggregation model and mind-blowing ROI projections, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just competing‚Äîit‚Äôs redefining what blockchain networks can do, making it one of the top cryptos to join this week. For those looking at crypto presale opportunities, few match the potential of Qubetics right now. As the best crypto presale, it offers both a practical solution to blockchain‚Äôs interoperability problem and a presale model designed for exponential growth. While Sonic and Solana remain top-tier projects, Qubetics is the one early buyers are watching closely. The countdown to the next price hike is on‚Äîjoin this crypto presale before the next jump.

This move expands TRX‚Äôs access to DeFi and NFT applications on Solana, increasing cross-chain functionality and boosting liquidity. What is Sonic‚Äôs price prediction? Analysts predict $S could rally to $0.70 if it breaks key resistance levels, with increased whale accumulation signaling bullish momentum.

From ecosystems expanding into AI and real-world assets to Layer 1 chains redefining cross-chain communication, 2025 has already begun to separate the trendsetters from the crowd. The market‚Äôs buzz is louder than ever, and if you‚Äôre wondering which names are breaking the mold, you‚Äôre in the right place. Among all the noise, Qubetics is emerging as a serious contender‚Äîand arguably the one making the most headlines right now. With a laser focus on interoperability and a visionary decentralized toolkit, it‚Äôs staking its claim among the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025. If you‚Äôre scouting the space for strong plays, get ready. These are the crypto powerhouses that deserve your full attention right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Interoperable Superchain of Web3 When it comes to the most popular cryptocurrencies redefining the Web3 landscape, Qubetics tops the list‚Äîno questions asked. It‚Äôs not just another Layer 1; it‚Äôs the first Web3 aggregator blockchain designed to unify ecosystems across Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and beyond. Qubetics‚Äô decentralized architecture is all about one thing‚Äîfreedom. And that freedom shines most in its interoperability framework. With the QubeQode IDE at its core, developers now have a no-brainer solution to build cross-chain apps without the usual chaos. Think of QubeQode as a one-stop powerhouse where builders can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts, test AI integrations, and make multichain functionality the default. It‚Äôs not just innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs Web3 without borders. For everyday users and businesses, Qubetics is solving real pain points. Imagine a fintech startup in Canada being able to settle payments, run DeFi protocols, and push NFTs across three different chains‚Äîall from one dashboard. That‚Äôs what Qubetics is doing. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet plugs directly into this system, letting users interact with multiple networks securely and simultaneously. No more chain-switching. No more confusion. It‚Äôs seamless crypto like it always should‚Äôve been. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dominating every ‚Äúmost popular cryptocurrencies‚Äù list in 2025‚Äîand it‚Äôs just getting warmed up. Currently in Stage 26 of its crypto presale with a token price of $0.1181, Qubetics is on fire. With over 502 million $TICS sold, 23,500+ token holders, and $15.3M already raised, the hype isn‚Äôt slowing down. And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîanalysts are buzzing over its ROI potential. At $1, early buyers stand to gain 746.05%. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet launch? That‚Äôs a 8,360.47% return. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, it‚Äôs clear why this is the best time to grab hold. Among the most popular cryptocurrencies, Qubetics is leading the charge‚Äîand making the case for why it‚Äôs the Best Crypto to Watch Now. 2. SUI: Speed-Obsessed and Developer-Friendly SUI continues to make headlines in 2025 as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 chains on the market. Built by Mysten Labs, the SUI blockchain leverages the Move programming language, known for its parallel transaction processing. This setup gives it ultra-low latency and insane throughput. In fact, SUI has routinely achieved over 300,000 transactions per second in controlled environments, making it a darling among developers building dApps for gaming and real-time financial services. SUI isn‚Äôt just fast‚Äîit‚Äôs intuitive for devs. It offers programmable object ownership and easy composability, setting it apart from Ethereum‚Äôs account-based system. More than just a tech upgrade, SUI is enabling Web3 use cases that feel Web2-smooth. In 2025, as dApps prioritize UX as much as decentralization, SUI‚Äôs tech stack is hitting all the right notes. On the adoption front, SUI has also inked partnerships with gaming studios, DeFi projects, and infrastructure providers, positioning itself for long-term relevance. While it‚Äôs not new to the scene, its consistent evolution and performance upgrades have made sure it remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market right now. 3. Cardano: Slow and Steady Is Starting to Win Cardano is one of those projects that people love to underestimate‚Äîuntil it surprises everyone. In 2025, the ADA ecosystem has matured into a bustling platform, housing a robust DeFi sector, growing NFT presence, and smart contract capabilities that are finally seeing wide adoption. Cardano‚Äôs emphasis on academic research and peer-reviewed development has often made it a slow mover‚Äîbut that slow burn is paying off. This year, we‚Äôve seen a major uptick in Cardano‚Äôs on-chain activity, with a 27% increase in active wallets and a 42% boost in DeFi TVL since the start of Q1. Projects like Indigo Protocol and Minswap are thriving, while the Hydra scaling solution is helping the chain push transaction costs lower than most competitors. That‚Äôs helping ADA re-enter top crypto lists‚Äîand rightly so. For participants looking to avoid overhyped meme tokens and bet on long-term value, Cardano offers that patient power play. It‚Äôs not making explosive moves, but it‚Äôs making the right ones. With global partnerships in education, governance, and finance, Cardano continues to prove it belongs on any list of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025. 4. XRP: A Comeback Fueled by Regulation Relief XRP is back‚Äîand it‚Äôs back with a vengeance. After years of legal limbo with the SEC, Ripple Labs recently scored a huge win with the dismissal of key charges. That cleared the fog hanging over XRP and triggered a rally that pushed the token back above the $0.75 mark. Community sentiment is strong again, and global remittance firms are returning to test RippleNet for cross-border payments. Beyond the court wins, Ripple is focused on growing its footprint in CBDC development. Several central banks are currently piloting digital currencies using Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure, further solidifying XRP‚Äôs place in the Web3 finance ecosystem. That makes it more than just a speculative token‚Äîit‚Äôs a serious utility play. As XRP climbs back into the top ten by market cap, it‚Äôs reclaiming its title as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies of this cycle. With regulatory clarity, expanding use cases, and renewed momentum, XRP‚Äôs comeback story might just be one of 2025‚Äôs best narratives. 5. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Finds Its Moment Cosmos is finally getting the recognition it deserves. In 2025, its vision of interoperable blockchains is no longer just theory‚Äîit‚Äôs reality. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is now widely adopted, and dozens of sovereign blockchains are operating within the Cosmos Hub. As DeFi and NFT apps go multichain, Cosmos is the quiet backbone making everything connect. This isn‚Äôt just about tech‚Äîit‚Äôs about experience. For users and devs, Cosmos provides seamless cross-chain transactions without relying on wrapped tokens or sketchy bridges. That‚Äôs a massive deal in a post-bridge-hack world, and it‚Äôs why developers are flocking to the ecosystem. With ATOM now serving as both a governance token and staking asset across several zones, its utility is stronger than ever. As more chains plug into Cosmos, its influence will only grow. For anyone tracking the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2025, Cosmos is one name that deserves serious attention. 6. Polkadot: Cross-Chain Connectivity Done Right Polkadot was built for a future where blockchains talk to each other‚Äîand that future is now. Its relay chain and parachain structure are proving to be incredibly efficient for hosting niche projects with specific needs. In 2025, we‚Äôre seeing an influx of real-world applications launching on Polkadot, from identity verification platforms to supply chain tracking dApps. What‚Äôs most exciting is how flexible the parachain model has become. It allows developers to experiment with different consensus algorithms and fee structures while still enjoying the shared security of the Polkadot network. This makes DOT a serious contender in the cross-chain infrastructure space. Though DOT hasn‚Äôt had the wild pumps of meme coins, its consistency, developer activity, and scalability potential make it a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. That‚Äôs why Polkadot remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies being watched by serious players this year. Conclusion: The Decentralized Wallet That Could Define Your Crypto Future If you‚Äôre tracking the most popular cryptocurrencies with long-term upside, it‚Äôs impossible to overlook the consistent dominance of Qubetics. Its ability to unify chains, streamline decentralized development, and provide unmatched user experience through its non-custodial multi-chain wallet makes it more than just another altcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs a next-gen infrastructure layer. And the fact that it‚Äôs still in presale makes it the best crypto to watch now. Backed by a powerful suite of interoperable tools, Qubetics is rapidly becoming the go-to ecosystem for developers and users alike. Its real-time wallet integration across multiple networks eliminates the friction that‚Äôs plagued DeFi, making it ideal for both retail and enterprise adoption. With over $15.2M already raised and more than 501M $TICS sold, the market‚Äôs confidence is already showing. At $0.1181 per $TICS, the numbers speak for themselves. A $1 price tag brings 746.05% ROI. At $10? Over 8,360.47%. With a mainnet launch coming in Q2 2025, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better. If you‚Äôve been scanning for the most popular cryptocurrencies that still offer ground-floor access, this is your cue to dive in. And if you‚Äôre serious about gains? It‚Äôs time to join the Qubetics presale before this rocket leaves the launchpad. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other altcoins in 2025? Qubetics stands out due to its Web3 aggregator model, which lets it unify multiple leading blockchains under one ecosystem. Its focus on real-world usability‚Äîespecially with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet and QubeQode IDE‚Äîoffers developers and users unmatched flexibility and scalability. Is Qubetics still in presale? Yes, Qubetics is currently in Stage 26 of its presale with a token price of $0.1181. With over 502 million $TICS sold and $15.3 million raised, the project is gaining massive momentum. Each presale stage lasts 7 days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at 12 AM. Why is Qubetics considered one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025? Qubetics is earning that title by solving some of Web3‚Äôs most persistent problems‚Äîfragmented chains, clunky UX, and limited scalability. Its real-time interoperability, wallet simplicity, and presale value have made it a standout among altcoins gaining serious traction in 2025.

He describes the cryptocurrency‚Äôs current price action as a ‚Äú Bermuda Triangle or boredom phase‚Äù ‚Äî a period where the market moves slowly or sideways, fuelling doubt and uncertainty among traders and investors before a price rally. XRP Price Boredom Phase To Trigger $27 Surge Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned that the XRP price is in a Bermuda Triangle, a boredom phase characterized by price stagnation and market uncertainty designed to shake out weak hands before a significant price move. According to his prediction, while traders and investors are growing impatient and questioning why XRP has not experienced any notable price increases, this phase is merely a set-up for a strong rally toward $27. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reignites $100 XRP Price Target, What You Should Know Following a predicted downturn in mid-March, XRP has struggled to recover its bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency was one of the top-performing altcoins in this bull cycle, jumping from a $0.5 low to over $3 for the first time in seven years. Due to the current market decline, Egrag Crypto revealed that many traders are now wondering why ‚ÄúXRP hasn‚Äôt mooned.‚Äù The analyst explained that this price decline was intentional, forcing investors to second-guess themselves and make emotional trading decisions. He also disclosed that the XRP market is now filled with ‚ÄòWhat ifs‚Äô, as Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) cloud traders‚Äô minds. Moreover, concerns over potential dips to $1.60 or $1.30 could push investors to panic-sell or attempt risky trades. The analyst also revealed that the XRP market is currently controlled by sharks and larger players, also called Whales. These large holders tend to influence price movements, triggering stop-losses and shaking out weak hands before a major rally. Egrag Crypto warns that new investors and traders are especially vulnerable, as frustration and boredom can lead to making financial mistakes. He disclosed that the best strategy to implement during this current market phase is to do nothing. He suggested investors stay disciplined and patient, recognizing that boredom phases are normal in crypto market cycles. The analyst also urged investors to remain vigilant and hold their positions while accumulating at ideal prices rather than react impulsively to rapid changes in the market. XRP Breakout Point Hints At New ATH In other analyses, market expert ‚ÄòSteph Is Crypto‚Äô has announced that XRP is currently retesting breakout levels to trigger a surge to a fresh ATH. The analyst‚Äôs price chart shows a Falling Wedge pattern which has been broken above the resistance at the upper trend line. Related Reading: XRP Threatens Death Cross On 4-Hour Chart, Is Another Crash Coming? After breaking out, XRP now retests this level to confirm a larger upward move. The large green arrow on the chart points to the cryptocurrency‚Äôs projected price target, suggesting a bullish continuation if the Falling Wedge breakout holds. XRP‚Äôs upside potential is predicted to be $4 or higher if its bullish momentum is maintained. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $2.4, reflecting a 3.5% decline in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. If its price rises to $4, it would represent a significant 66.7% increase from current levels.

But now, bipartisan support for cryptocurrency is growing, boosting the chances of the stablecoin bill passing. As per a latest Bloomberg report, the Financial Services Committee will review the stablecoin bill on April 2. This development highlights the growing influence of the cryptocurrency industry in Washington, D.C., bolstered by bipartisan support from figures like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and significant campaign contributions that have strengthened industry allies. ‚Äã GENIUS Act Gets Bipartisan Support The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and enhance consumer protections, has garnered support from both Republicans and Democrats. A key House Committee is expected to vote in favor of the bill, signaling strong momentum for its approval. The act aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the bill, which has quickly gained support from both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to move the Genius Act forward , with five Democrats joining the Republican majority in backing it. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers can choose between federal or state charters, depending on their market size. Foreign issuers will also need to follow U.S. rules on reserves, anti-money laundering, and sanctions compliance, and liwuiduty. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan noted, ‚ÄúThe reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.‚Äù .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : IMF Recognizes Cryptocurrencies in Global Economic Data for the First Time , Chairman French Hill, along with many analysts and crypto supporters, believes the stablecoin market needs regulation. He argues that regulating stablecoins would strengthen the dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms have also pushed for stablecoins as a way to boost financial inclusion and offer cheaper, faster transactions. Criticisms Prevail However, Top Democrat Maxine Waters and Senator Elizabeth Warren worry that the bill doesn‚Äôt do enough to protect consumers. Besides, they also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk‚Äôs X or Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins. While other critics are concerned that without FDIC insurance for stablecoins, users could face big losses if a token crashes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Stablecoin Supply Is Displaying A Different Pattern In This Bitcoin Downturn In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has shared about how the latest trend in the stablecoin circulating supply has been looking. ‚ÄúStablecoins‚Äù are cryptocurrencies that track the price of a fiat currency, with USD being by far the most popular choice. These tokens run on multiple networks, but in the context of the current topic, only the Ethereum-based ones are of interest. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7% After Surge In Network Activity & Whale Buying Stablecoins are, by nature, relatively ‚Äòstable‚Äô in value, so the investors generally buy into these coins whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Holders who invest into stables, though, usually plan to eventually go back into the volatile side of the sector. For if they didn‚Äôt, they would have exited into fiat instead. Once these traders feel the time is right, they use their stablecoins to swap into Bitcoin or whatever desired coin. This shift naturally applies a buying pressure to the price of the asset. Due to the potential of the stablecoins to act as dry powder for the volatile cryptocurrencies, these assets are often looked at as the ‚Äòavailable‚Äô buy supply of the sector. As such, an increase in its value may be considered as a bullish sign. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant, which shows the trend in the supply of the ERC-20 stablecoins over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoin supply has been on the rise during the last few months, which suggests capital has been flowing into these fiat-tied tokens. This rise in the metric has come as Bitcoin has been going through a phase of bearish momentum. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted the trend that the indicator followed during BTC‚Äôs bearish period from last year. It would seem that the stablecoin supply was moving sideways back then. This would imply that as BTC corrected in 2024, a net amount of capital flowed out of the sector as if the capital was rotating into the stablecoins instead, their supply would have registered an increase. This time around, however, a rotation of capital has indeed been occurring, with these stablecoin buyers potentially waiting on the sidelines for a profitable entry point. Of course, this current setup isn‚Äôt the most bullish one, either; that would have been the case if both the Bitcoin market cap and the stablecoin supply rose simultaneously. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Where Support & Resistance Lies For Solana, Based On On-Chain Data Nonetheless, the fact that the stablecoins haven‚Äôt been shrinking during this market downturn could still be taken as an optimistic sign for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen yet another failed recovery rally as its price has dropped back to $84,000, after having broken above $87,000 just earlier.

Even amidst a significant $81.5 billion legal face-off with crypto giant Binance, the Nigerian government is keen to project an image of openness to crypto businesses. But what does this apparent contradiction truly mean for the future of Nigeria crypto regulation and the broader digital asset landscape in Africa‚Äôs largest economy? Decoding Nigeria‚Äôs Crypto Regulation Approach Information Minister Mohammed Idris has been vocal in clarifying Nigeria‚Äôs position. It‚Äôs not about slamming the door on crypto innovation, but rather about establishing a robust regulatory framework. This stance emerges even as the country navigates a high-profile dispute with Binance, showcasing a nuanced approach to digital assets. The core message is clear: Nigeria is aiming for controlled growth, not outright prohibition of the burgeoning crypto sector. This balanced approach is critical for fostering trust and attracting legitimate crypto businesses while safeguarding against illicit activities. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of Nigeria‚Äôs regulatory focus: Emphasis on Regulation, Not Restriction: The government aims to create a safe and regulated environment for crypto operations. Recent Regulatory Tightening: New rules and transaction taxes have been introduced, signaling a move towards stricter oversight. Enforcement Challenges: Widespread peer-to-peer (P2P) trading poses a challenge to the effective implementation of these regulations. Despite these hurdles, Nigeria‚Äôs intent is clear ‚Äì to channel the energy of its massive crypto adoption Nigeria rate into a structured and beneficial ecosystem. Why Nigeria Remains a Crypto Hotspot: Unveiling the Adoption Numbers Nigeria‚Äôs position as a global leader in crypto adoption is undeniable. The numbers speak volumes: Global Rank: Nigeria proudly holds the second position worldwide in terms of crypto adoption. Massive Inflows: A staggering $59 billion in cryptocurrency was received by Nigerians within a single year, according to Chainalysis. This phenomenal level of adoption highlights the critical role of crypto in the Nigerian economy. Factors driving this surge include: Factor Description Currency Devaluation Crypto offers a hedge against the fluctuating value of the Naira. Remittance Efficiency Cryptocurrencies provide faster and cheaper channels for international money transfers. Financial Inclusion Crypto offers access to financial services for the unbanked population. Tech-Savvy Population Nigeria boasts a young and digitally adept population readily adopting new technologies. These elements combine to create a fertile ground for cryptocurrency news Nigeria and its widespread integration into daily financial life. The Binance Nigeria Lawsuit: Navigating Troubled Waters The ongoing $81.5 billion lawsuit against Binance injects a layer of complexity into Nigeria‚Äôs crypto narrative. This legal action underscores the government‚Äôs resolve to enforce regulations and hold crypto exchanges accountable. The specifics of the Binance Nigeria lawsuit are still unfolding, but it serves as a potent reminder to all crypto platforms operating in Nigeria ‚Äì compliance is non-negotiable. Key takeaways from the Binance situation: Enforcement Focus: Nigeria is serious about enforcing its crypto regulations. Accountability for Exchanges: Crypto platforms will be held responsible for operating within the legal framework. Precedent Setting: This case could set a precedent for how other nations approach regulatory enforcement with global crypto exchanges. Opportunities for Crypto Business Nigeria: A Path Forward Despite the regulatory tightening and the Binance dispute, Nigeria‚Äôs message of openness to crypto business Nigeria is significant. For legitimate crypto ventures, this signals potential opportunities within a regulated environment. The key lies in understanding and adhering to the evolving regulatory landscape. Businesses that prioritize compliance and transparency are likely to find a welcoming, albeit regulated, market in Nigeria. Actionable insights for crypto businesses considering Nigeria: Stay Informed: Closely monitor regulatory updates and adapt operations accordingly. Prioritize Compliance: Implement robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures. Engage with Regulators: Proactively communicate with Nigerian regulatory bodies to foster understanding and collaboration. Focus on Education: Contribute to user education to promote responsible crypto adoption. Nigeria‚Äôs Crypto Crossroads: Balancing Innovation and Oversight Nigeria stands at a fascinating crossroads in its crypto journey. The nation‚Äôs deep-seated crypto enthusiasm is undeniable, yet the need for responsible regulation is equally pressing. The government‚Äôs current stance ‚Äì signaling openness while enforcing stricter rules ‚Äì reflects this delicate balancing act. Whether Nigeria can successfully navigate this complex terrain and emerge as a model for regulated crypto growth in Africa remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Nigeria‚Äôs crypto story is far from over, and its next chapters will be pivotal for the future of digital finance on the continent and beyond.

42132299,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142383,1742617539,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Meta‚Äôs Lucrative Llama AI Revenue Sharing Agreements Spark Controversy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-llama-ai-revenue-sharing/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Just when you thought you had the tech giants figured out, a new revelation drops. Meta, the behemoth behind Facebook and Instagram, is making headlines again, but this time, it‚Äôs about their seemingly ‚Äòopen-source‚Äô Llama AI model. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg said selling access to Llama wasn‚Äôt their business model? Well, a recent court filing suggests otherwise. Let‚Äôs dive into the juicy details of Meta‚Äôs AI Model Revenue strategy and what it means for the future of open AI. The Shocking Truth: Meta‚Äôs Secret AI Partnerships and Revenue Streams According to an unredacted court filing in the Kadrey v. Meta copyright lawsuit, Meta isn‚Äôt just giving away its Llama AI models for free. They‚Äôre actually engaging in revenue sharing agreements with companies that host these models. This bombshell contradicts Zuckerberg‚Äôs previous statements and raises questions about Meta‚Äôs true intentions with its open-source AI initiative. Here‚Äôs the breakdown of what we know: Revenue Sharing is Real: The court filing explicitly states that Meta ‚Äúshares a percentage of the revenue‚Äù generated by companies hosting Llama models. This is a direct contradiction to the narrative that Llama was purely an open-source, non-profit endeavor for Meta. Hosts Remain Mysterious (For Now): The filing doesn‚Äôt name names, but Meta has previously listed several AI Partnerships in blog posts. These include major players like AWS, Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake. It‚Äôs highly likely some of these are involved in the revenue-sharing agreements. Open Source with a Catch?: Developers can still download and run Llama models independently. However, using host partners offers convenience and additional services, potentially making them the preferred route for many and thus generating revenue for both hosts and, indirectly, Meta. This revelation adds a layer of complexity to the Open Source AI landscape. Is Meta truly committed to open source, or is Llama a strategic play to establish dominance and generate income through less direct means? Zuckerberg AI Strategy : From Open Source Savior to Revenue-Focused Player? Let‚Äôs rewind a bit. Zuckerberg himself hinted at monetization possibilities for Llama in an April earnings call, mentioning licensing, business messaging services, and even ads within ‚ÄúAI interactions.‚Äù However, the emphasis shifted later towards the community benefits and model improvements derived from open sourcing Llama. During Meta‚Äôs Q3 2024 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs good business for us to do this in an open way‚Ä¶ It makes our products better rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was kind of standardizing around in the industry.‚Äù This suggested a long-term, indirect benefit approach, focusing on industry standardization and product improvement, rather than immediate financial gains from Llama itself. But the court filing paints a different picture. It suggests a more direct and immediate monetization strategy through AI Model Revenue sharing. This raises a crucial question: Is Meta‚Äôs Zuckerberg AI Strategy evolving, or was the open-source narrative partially a smokescreen? Key Takeaways on Meta‚Äôs Llama Revenue Sharing: Contradiction of Public Statements: The revenue sharing agreements directly contradict previous public statements suggesting Llama monetization wasn‚Äôt Meta‚Äôs primary goal. Strategic Financial Play: This move indicates a calculated financial strategy behind Llama, potentially to offset massive AI investments. Implications for Open Source: It prompts a re-evaluation of what ‚Äúopen source‚Äù means when major corporations are involved. Is it truly about community and collaboration, or are there always underlying business motives? Fueling the Lawsuit: The revenue sharing revelation adds fuel to the fire of the Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit, which accuses Meta of training Llama on pirated ebooks and facilitating copyright infringement. The Copyright Controversy: Does AI Model Revenue Justify Questionable Training Data? The Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit is central to this unfolding story. Plaintiffs allege that Meta trained Llama on ‚Äúhundreds of terabytes of pirated ebooks,‚Äù obtained through questionable torrenting methods. They argue that Meta not only used pirated works but also facilitated further infringement by ‚Äúseeding‚Äù these works. The fact that Meta is now generating AI Model Revenue from Llama becomes particularly significant in this context. Plaintiffs can argue that Meta is profiting directly from a model allegedly built on illegally obtained copyrighted material. This could strengthen their case and increase the pressure on Meta. Why This Matters for the Crypto and Tech World For those in the crypto and decentralized tech space, this Meta Llama AI revenue sharing story has several layers of relevance: Centralization vs. Decentralization in AI: While Llama is open source, its development and monetization are still controlled by a centralized entity, Meta. This contrasts with the ethos of decentralization often championed in the crypto world. Business Models for Open Source: The Llama case highlights the complex business models emerging around open-source AI. It raises questions about sustainability and ethical considerations when large corporations are involved. Transparency and Accountability: The initial discrepancy between Zuckerberg‚Äôs statements and the revealed revenue sharing agreements underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the tech industry, especially concerning powerful AI technologies. Legal and Ethical Implications of AI Training Data: The copyright lawsuit and the reliance on potentially pirated data bring to the forefront the crucial legal and ethical questions surrounding AI training datasets. This is a critical discussion for the future of AI development. What‚Äôs Next for Meta and Llama? Meta is doubling down on AI, projecting a massive $60 billion-$80 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, primarily for data centers and AI development teams. They are also reportedly considering a subscription service for Meta AI, aiming to offset these costs. The AI Partnerships and revenue sharing agreements for Llama are likely to become even more critical for Meta as they ramp up their AI investments. The company is clearly looking for ways to monetize its AI efforts, even within the framework of open-source initiatives. However, the Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit and the questions surrounding Llama‚Äôs training data remain significant challenges. How Meta navigates these legal and ethical issues will be crucial for its long-term AI strategy and its reputation in the tech community. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Open Source and Big Tech The revelation of Meta‚Äôs Llama AI revenue sharing agreements is a pivotal moment. It forces us to reconsider the narratives surrounding open-source AI and the motivations of big tech companies in this space. While open source can foster innovation and collaboration, it‚Äôs clear that financial considerations and strategic business objectives are still very much in play. As Meta continues to invest heavily in AI and explore various monetization strategies, the tech world will be watching closely. The Llama story is a powerful reminder that in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, the lines between open source, commercial interests, and ethical considerations are becoming increasingly blurred.

The digital currency is now trading at $0.99, marking a gain of more than 5% in the last day. This upward momentum has many wondering if Pi Network can continue to push beyond the $1 level and continue its climb. Next Target: $1.35, but $1.20 Stands as a Major Hurdle Despite recent gains, Pi Coin faces a hurdle at $1.20. Breaking through this resistance could see the coin targeting the $1.35 level, a critical milestone. However, it is far from easy as Pi has shown volatility. If it manages to surpass the $1.90 mark, analysts believe a rally towards $3 could be possible. Market Cap Drop: Pi Coin‚Äôs Recent Struggles In the past week, Pi Coin‚Äôs market position has been shaky. The cryptocurrency has dropped dramatically from the 11th to the 21st spot by market cap. While this decline is concerning, it‚Äôs important to note that Pi still holds potential for recovery. Binance Snub: Could it Affect Pi‚Äôs Growth? One of the major contributing factors to Pi‚Äôs recent market dip is Binance‚Äôs decision not to include Pi Coin in their latest listing vote. Binance ran a poll, and an overwhelming 86% of participants voted in favor of listing Pi. https://twitter.com/Time_and_Trade/status/1902792445630484792 Despite this support, Binance Binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange Cryptocurrencies Trading App Cryptocurrency investment has yet to make a move, and this delay may be costing both Pi and Binance in terms of trading volume and revenue.

For now, the crypto community believes that Pi‚Äôs listing will happen eventually, but there‚Äôs no need for frantic demands or negotiations. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The market saw a high surge and a drastic fall within the last three months. However, topping these uncertain moments is the Dogecoin price, which has continued falling, reaching a new five-month low at $0.1661. But in the uncertain market, some altcoins could be the gold in the rough. Notable choices fueling the altcoin optimism include the Cardano coin and the new player, Remittix. But could an investment in the Remittix and Cardano coins help investors erase the loss in the Dogecoin price over the last few months? Here is a careful analysis of this new direction to help investors make the right choice in the next quarter. Can The Dogecoin Price Reach a Major Milestone In 2025? Following the rise in meme coins in the first quarter of 2025, the Dogecoin price should be nearing a high by the end of the quarter, but this has not been so. Instead, the Dogecoin price has continued downward, hitting a low of about 50% in the last 90 days. This has since raised the panic selling to a record high among Dogecoin investors. The price of the number one meme coin has continued dropping below its strong support, giving way to a strong resistance above it in the last few months. However, despite the high hit on the Dogecoin price, it has remained the biggest meme coin by market cap, raising hope of a potential surge soon. The corresponding drop that has hit other meme coins is why the Dogecoin continues to appear as though it is unmoving. However, the Dogecoin market cap has fallen more than 36% in the last 30 days, from $38B to $24B. Also, the current formation on the Dogecoin price chart shows it is still maintaining a downtrend, which could pose a significant threat to potential price growth soon. Why Remittix Could Follow Cardano On A Surge This Next Quarter There has been a growing trend in crypto payment lately, pushing innovations in the last few months. These rising solutions have continued to receive widespread acceptance, as Cardano rose over 300% between last November and January this year. However, Remittix seems to present the latest innovation in this sector, leading to growing optimism around the Remittix token in the last few months. The Remittix token presale has continued capturing the attention of new and seasoned investors in the crypto world, already selling over 500,000,000 tokens in the last few weeks. With the fast-growing interest in this new altcoin, analysts have continued to wonder how high this token might be climbing this year, with some analysts projecting up to 100x . The solution Remittix is ushering into the crypto payment sector allows users to send crypto and receive it as a FIAT payment directly into a bank account. The Remittix solution is projected to revolutionize the crypto market, opening up a new dimension and use case for cryptocurrencies. As the Remittix exchange continues to usher in a new dimension for crypto users to see new ways to make their crypto assets more valuable, the Remittix token is becoming a top investment option. Hence, there is rising interest from top market players as many rush to leverage the Remittix presale as an opportunity to invest early in the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto adoption is just starting and could hit a new high by the next quarter as more countries follow in the footsteps of the US, creating a strategic crypto reserve. Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to start today with the Remittix presale, which offers the chance to buy at a low price before the price booms.

42132649,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142391,1742618154,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC‚Äôs Crypto Regulation Fiasco: a16z Executive Unveils ‚ÄòFailed‚Äô Approach,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-regulation-failed-approach/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to regulatory scrutiny, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has often been at the forefront of these discussions. But has their approach been effective? According to Miles Jennings, general counsel at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a prominent venture capital firm deeply invested in crypto, the answer is a resounding no. Jennings recently attended the SEC‚Äôs crypto task force roundtable and didn‚Äôt mince words, labeling the SEC‚Äôs past enforcement-based regulatory strategy as a complete failure. Let‚Äôs dive into why a leading voice in the crypto space is so critical of the SEC‚Äôs methods and what this could mean for the future of digital assets. Decoding the Criticism: Why ‚ÄòFailed‚Äô SEC Crypto Regulation ? Jennings‚Äô blunt assessment raises a crucial question: what exactly went wrong with the SEC‚Äôs approach to SEC crypto regulation ? He argues that the primary goals of securities regulation ‚Äì investor protection, fostering capital formation, and ensuring efficient markets ‚Äì were simply not achieved under the previous administration‚Äôs enforcement-heavy strategy. To understand this criticism better, let‚Äôs break down each of these goals: Investor Protection: The cornerstone of securities regulation. The idea is to safeguard investors from fraud, manipulation, and inadequate disclosure. Was the SEC‚Äôs enforcement approach successful in protecting crypto investors? Capital Formation: A healthy regulatory environment should encourage innovation and growth by allowing companies to raise capital efficiently. Did the SEC‚Äôs actions facilitate or hinder capital formation in the crypto space? Efficient Markets: Regulations should contribute to fair, orderly, and efficient markets where prices accurately reflect information. Did the SEC‚Äôs approach lead to more efficient crypto markets? Jennings contends that the answer to these questions, when considering the SEC‚Äôs past enforcement-focused approach, is largely negative. He suggests that instead of achieving these goals, the SEC‚Äôs actions may have inadvertently created more problems than solutions. This perspective challenges the very foundation of the SEC‚Äôs regulatory strategy in the crypto sector. The Bone of Contention: Crypto Enforcement as the Primary Tool The core of Jennings‚Äô critique lies in the SEC‚Äôs reliance on crypto enforcement as its primary regulatory tool. Instead of proactively establishing clear guidelines and frameworks for the crypto industry to operate within, the SEC, according to this view, primarily focused on enforcement actions ‚Äì investigating and penalizing companies for alleged violations of securities laws. Here‚Äôs a simplified look at the two contrasting approaches: Approach Characteristics Potential Outcomes Enforcement-Based Regulation (as criticized by Jennings) Reactive Focus on penalties and investigations Lack of clear upfront guidance Can create uncertainty and fear in the market May deter bad actors, but also stifle innovation Can lead to costly legal battles and resource drain Uncertainty can drive businesses overseas Potentially fails to achieve long-term investor protection and market efficiency Proactive Regulatory Framework Forward-looking and clear Establishes rules of the road Focuses on guidance and clarity Aims to foster innovation within a regulatory perimeter Encourages responsible innovation and growth Reduces uncertainty and promotes investment Can lead to more efficient and compliant markets Potentially better achieves long-term investor protection and market efficiency Jennings and others who share his view argue that the SEC‚Äôs emphasis on crypto enforcement created a climate of fear and uncertainty within the crypto industry. Companies were left guessing about the regulatory boundaries, potentially hindering innovation and driving businesses to jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks. Investor Protection : Did Enforcement Deliver? A central argument against the SEC‚Äôs enforcement-based approach is that it arguably failed to deliver on its promise of investor protection in the crypto space. While enforcement actions can punish wrongdoers after the fact, critics argue they are less effective at preventing harm in the first place. Consider these points regarding investor protection in the context of the SEC‚Äôs enforcement strategy: Reactive vs. Proactive Protection: Enforcement is inherently reactive. It addresses problems after they occur. Proactive measures, such as clear regulations and investor education, could potentially prevent issues before they arise. Complexity of Crypto: The crypto space is rapidly evolving and technically complex. Enforcement actions often lag behind innovation, and may not effectively address the nuances of new technologies and business models. Uncertainty Discourages Compliance: When regulations are unclear and enforcement is the primary communication tool, it can be difficult for businesses to understand how to comply. This uncertainty can inadvertently increase risks for investors. Focus on Securities Laws: The SEC primarily enforces securities laws, which may not be perfectly suited to address all the risks inherent in the crypto ecosystem. A broader, more tailored regulatory framework might be needed for comprehensive investor protection . Jennings‚Äô assertion suggests that a more balanced approach, combining clear regulatory guidelines with targeted enforcement, might be more effective in achieving genuine investor protection in the long run. Capital Formation and Market Efficiency: The Chilling Effect? Beyond investor protection , Jennings also argues that the SEC‚Äôs approach failed to foster capital formation and efficient markets within the crypto industry. The argument here is that regulatory uncertainty and the fear of enforcement actions can stifle innovation and investment. Here‚Äôs how the enforcement-heavy approach might have negatively impacted capital formation and market efficiency: Discouraging Innovation: Startups and entrepreneurs may be hesitant to build and innovate in the crypto space if they face a high risk of facing SEC enforcement actions due to unclear rules. Driving Capital Offshore: Companies seeking to raise capital in the crypto space might choose to incorporate and operate in jurisdictions with more crypto-friendly regulations, leading to a loss of potential economic benefits for the US. Increased Compliance Costs: Navigating regulatory uncertainty and preparing for potential enforcement actions can be expensive and time-consuming for businesses, diverting resources away from innovation and growth. Market Inefficiency: Regulatory uncertainty can lead to market fragmentation and inefficiencies. For example, different exchanges and platforms might adopt varying compliance standards due to a lack of clear regulatory guidance. By creating a less welcoming environment for crypto innovation, the SEC‚Äôs enforcement-focused strategy, according to critics, may have inadvertently hindered capital formation and the development of truly efficient markets in the digital asset space. What‚Äôs Next? Moving Beyond Enforcement-Only Miles Jennings‚Äô comments, delivered at an SEC roundtable, highlight a growing sentiment within the crypto industry: a shift away from a purely enforcement-based regulatory approach is needed. The call is for a more proactive, clear, and balanced framework that fosters innovation while still ensuring investor protection and market integrity. What could a more effective approach look like? Clear Regulatory Guidelines: Providing clear rules and frameworks for different types of crypto assets and activities is crucial. This would reduce uncertainty and allow businesses to operate with greater clarity and confidence. Dialogue and Collaboration: Open communication and collaboration between regulators and the crypto industry are essential. Roundtables like the one Jennings attended are a step in the right direction, but ongoing dialogue is needed. Tailored Regulation: Recognizing the diversity within the crypto space is important. Regulations should be tailored to different types of crypto assets and activities, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. Focus on Education and Guidance: In addition to enforcement, regulators should also focus on educating investors and providing guidance to businesses on how to comply with regulations. The criticism from a prominent figure like a16z‚Äôs general counsel underscores the urgency for a re-evaluation of the SEC‚Äôs crypto regulatory strategy. The future of the crypto industry, particularly in the US, may depend on finding a more effective and balanced path forward ‚Äì one that encourages innovation, fosters capital formation , ensures efficient markets , and genuinely protects investors. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto Regulation Miles Jennings‚Äô remarks serve as a stark reminder that the debate around crypto regulation is far from settled. His assessment that the SEC‚Äôs enforcement-based approach has ‚Äúfailed‚Äù is a powerful statement from a key player in the crypto investment world. It highlights the need for a more nuanced and effective regulatory strategy ‚Äì one that moves beyond solely relying on enforcement and embraces clarity, collaboration, and a genuine understanding of the unique characteristics of the crypto industry. The path forward requires a delicate balance, fostering innovation while safeguarding investors and ensuring market integrity. The coming years will be crucial in determining whether regulators and the crypto industry can forge a constructive path that unlocks the potential of digital assets while mitigating their risks.

Notably, Coinbase (COIN), a leading U.S. exchange, is in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, a major global derivatives exchange, according to Bloomberg report. The companies have already informed Dubai regulators, where Deribit is licensed, about the ongoing discussions. Deal Not Finalised Yet If Coinbase successfully acquires Deribit, it would take over Deribit‚Äôs operating license. While talks are still happening, no deal has been finalized yet. Earlier this year, Deribit‚Äôs value was estimated between $4 billion and $5 billion. This move would enhance Coinbase‚Äôs existing derivatives platform, which currently focuses on futures. In 2024, Deribit saw nearly $1.2 trillion in trading volume‚Äîalmost double the previous year‚Äôs total. Coinbase recently announced plans to offer 24/7 futures trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum to attract more investors to its platform. Coinbase (COIN), known for spot trading, aims to expand into the lucrative crypto derivatives market by acquiring Deribit, the largest platform for trading Bitcoin and Ether options. The ongoing talks align with Kraken, a competitor, which recently announced plans to acquire the derivatives platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, enabling it to offer U.S. crypto derivatives. Kraken also plans to go public by Q1 2026, according to Bloomberg. Coinbase Seeks To Expand Its Derivatives Business Coinbase is also expanding its derivatives business while it explores the acquisition of Deribit. On March 15, it filed with the CFTC to offer futures for Cardano (ADA) and Natural Gas (NGS). If approved, trading could begin by March 31. This comes after launching Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR) futures. Coinbase offers derivatives for 92 assets globally, with fewer available in the U.S., according to its 2024 report. In January, Robinhood jumped into the crypto futures game, aiming to challenge Coinbase. Meanwhile, CME Group, the world‚Äôs biggest derivatives exchange, saw a massive 300% surge in crypto derivatives trading, reaching around $10 billion in daily volume during Q4 2024. .",News|Crypto news|Exchange News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-22 05:10:04

While giants like Solana and XRP battle regulatory uncertainty and market saturation, a lesser-known project, Remittix is quickly gaining traction. Offering instant crypto-to-fiat transfers and targeting a trillion-dollar remittance market, Remittix is drawing serious investor attention. Could this viral PayFi token be the breakout star of 2025? Many traders think so. Institutional Interest Rises as Solana Joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in ETF Listings Solana continues to make headlines with fresh momentum, currently trading at $126.36 with a 24-hour volume of $2.13 billion and a market cap of $64.47 billion. While the Solana price has inched down about 2.4% in the past day, traders are closely watching what could be a breakout moment. The buzz centers on the launch of two Solana ETFs in the U.S. , a move that could elevate SOL‚Äôs standing among institutional investors. Volatility Shares LLC is preparing to release both a standard and leveraged Solana ETF‚ÄîSOLZ and SOLT, respectively. These funds will track Solana futures, offering traditional investors exposure to SOL without direct ownership. With expense ratios of 0.95% and 1.85%, the ETFs position Solana alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as ETF-recognized digital assets. This could fuel long-term adoption and bring in significant new capital. Still, despite the bullish backdrop, some traders are looking elsewhere for steeper returns. The interest is shifting toward altcoins that are still early in their cycle‚Äîassets with low caps but big real-world relevance. XRP Gains Momentum After SEC Case Closure XRP has also been making headlines again , not just for its price swings but for the strong rebound in sentiment following the conclusion of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC . With the case now officially closed, confidence is returning to the XRP ecosystem. Analysts point to a head-and-shoulders pattern forming on higher time frames, often seen as a signal of consolidation before a bigger move. At the time of writing, XRP trades near $2.38 and appears to be holding steady at this critical level. Another catalyst for XRP‚Äôs renewed momentum is its inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve. For many investors, this shows institutional trust in Ripple, especially as financial markets continue to adopt tokenized payments and blockchain-powered settlements. The door now opens wider for developments like spot ETFs and stablecoin integration, giving XRP more utility and reach than ever before. However, this has not been enough to deter investors from seeking maximum gains from projects like RTX. Remittix Steals Attention Away From Crypto Heavyweights Solana and XRP While Solana and XRP continue to dominate headlines, a quieter contender is catching the attention of seasoned crypto traders‚Äî Remittix (RTX) . Unlike other projects chasing hype, Remittix has locked in on solving a very real problem: the high cost and frustrating delays of cross-border payments. With its utility-focused approach, this ERC-20 token is bridging traditional finance and blockchain by allowing users to convert crypto into fiat instantly, all while maintaining privacy and full control over their funds. What makes Remittix stand out is its focus on accessibility. In regions where banks are scarce or unreliable, Remittix steps in to offer users a way to receive crypto, convert it at local points, and use it as cash for everyday needs. The platform‚Äôs low transaction costs and real-time transfers make it a game-changer, especially for unbanked populations around the world. It‚Äôs more than a token‚Äîit‚Äôs a financial access point for millions. With over 521 million tokens sold and $14 million raised during its ICO, Remittix is proving that investor confidence is more than just speculation. Its current price of $0.0734 signals an attractive entry point for those seeking value with upside. And with locked liquidity for three years and smart contract audits already complete, Remittix shows that it‚Äôs just as serious about long-term stability as it is about innovation. Remittix Attracts Capital as Investors Seek Real Value While Solana price benefits from speed and XRP from institutional traction, Remittix is going after a massive $190 trillion remittance market‚Äîuntapped by most crypto projects. Its PayFi system delivers seamless conversions and bypasses traditional banking limitations, giving it a rare edge in functionality. In a market of tokens chasing hype, Remittix is delivering something crypto desperately needs: usability with impact. For traders eyeing 2025 gains, that‚Äôs a formula too compelling to ignore.

42135678,https://invezz.com/?p=2630861,1742621114,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Can Ethereum (ETH) charge toward $3000 this week amid whale activity spike?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/22/can-ethereum-eth-charge-toward-3000-this-week-amid-whale-activity-spike/,"With a rise in whale activity inspiring investor hope, Ethereum (ETH) is about to undergo a notable price breakthrough. As the cryptocurrency market shows more instability, ETH is looking at the crucial $3,000 milestone as its next main opposition. Will the biggest Ethereum investors maintain the upward momentum, or will a market drop cause a reversal of its increasing trend? Can Ethereum break $3,000 this week? Whales, big investors with substantial ETH balances, have mixed signals about Ethereum‚Äôs recent price fluctuation. Recently, 13 fresh super whales with more than 10,000 ETH have entered the market. This flood of institutional investors shows ongoing interest in Ethereum, thereby supporting its dominance in the crypto market. Simultaneously, some whales have been unloading their stocks, leaving short-term price action unpredictable. Ethereum‚Äôs constant transaction volume and rising whale accumulation point to robust underlying demand, which may lay the groundwork for a long-running climb. Ethereum rules the decentralized finance (DeFi) market despite its price swings. Currently the network is ranked as the biggest DeFi ecosystem worldwide, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $51.4 billion. Moreover, Ethereum‚Äôs stablecoin market value exceeds $272 billion, underscoring its fundamental pillar status in the crypto economy. Increased acceptance of Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 scaling solutions‚ÄîArbitrum and Optimism‚Äîhelps to lower transaction costs and enhance network efficiency. These events support ETH‚Äôs long-term positive prognosis even if short-term resistance levels still have influence. Market analysts differ on Ethereum‚Äôs capacity to surpass $3,000 in the coming days. Some suggest that ETH might spike toward $3,200, creating fresh support before moving more significantly toward $3,870 to $4,000. Others warn that failing to remove opposition of around $3,000 could cause a retest with less support of around $2,750. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy fundamentally determines Ethereum‚Äôs price path. If the Fed adopts quantitative easing, liquid injections may propel ETH higher. Conversely, stricter monetary policy might restrict upward potential and postpone Ethereum‚Äôs next big surge. Rexas Finance (RXS): the rising alternative While Ethereum looks at the $3,000 breakout, Rexas Finance (RXS) is becoming a high-growth substitute, especially in the real estate market. Using blockchain technology, RXS allows fractional real estate ownership, opening retail investors access to property investment opportunities. With the global real estate market valued at $379.7 trillion, Rexas Finance removes conventional entrance restrictions so users may easily buy, sell, and trade tokenized real estate assets. Both crypto and institutional investors looking for exposure to blockchain-powered real estate investment find this invention appealing. Early investors in Rexas Finance (RXS) enjoyed an outstanding 6.67x ROI. Driven by growing usage and the platform‚Äôs real-world asset tokenizing approach, this increase indicates great market trust. Rexas Finance is in its last presale stage, with 90.83% of the tokens sold. As demand rises, the remaining supply is rapidly depleting. At a presale price of $0.20, RXS represents an attractive opportunity before its formal exchange listing, where analysts predict a 10x to 25x price increase. To heighten the buzz, the Rexas Finance team formally revealed that the much-awaited RXS coin would start trading on June 19, 2025. Investors and fans are excitedly counting down the days before RXS opens with a $0.25 listing price based on this confirmed launch date. Rexas Finance started a $1 million campaign for community involvement. This program gives early adopters an interesting chance to acquire significant ownership before the platform‚Äôs formal release by rewarding 20 lucky winners with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens apiece. Beyond real estate tokenization, the Rexas ecosystem comprises a strong DeFi infrastructure, AI-driven NFT manufacturing, and simple token creation tools. This all-encompassing strategy confirms RXS‚Äôs role as a game-changing tool with outstanding long-term promise. Conclusion Although Ethereum still rules the blockchain scene, emerging initiatives like Rexas Finance are showing their worth by tackling actual issues. Both assets provide intriguing investment prospects in 2025 as Ethereum‚Äôs price recovers around $3,000 and RXS gains traction in blockchain-powered real estate. Whether ETH breaks its resistance this week or experiences a brief retreat, its long-term direction remains positive. Meanwhile, RXS is rapidly becoming a top competitor in the crypto market, giving investors access to a high-growth industry with enormous upside.

In which, he explains the price could be forming a key demand zone that could be key in pushing BTC to $91K, a level last seen two weeks ago. As of Saturday, March 22, 2025, BTC‚Äôs value is up 0.22% today and stuck in the $84K to $85K region. Ethereum (ETH) is up 1.14% and is close to revisiting the $2,000 psychological level. Bitcoin Price Will Reach $91K if This Happens, Says Crypto Trader RektProof Rektproof, one of the most renowned crypto traders, posted his analysis on Bitcoin price. The recent telegram post shows BTC price hovering inside the $84K to $81.1K daily demand zone. Inside this daily demand, RektProof outlines a potential four-hour demand zone, stretching from $84.3K to $83.1K which could be the support zone that propels the crypto market higher. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart If the crypto trader‚Äôs outlook comes true, i.e., if Bitcoin price creates the four-hour demand zone, it could bounce 3.74% to the most recent swing high at $87,500, formed on March 19. Beyond this first target, the price could extend to $91,279, which is the key high-volume node formed in early March. In one of his early posts , crypto trader RektProof also notes $95K as the next key resistance level to watch, should the bullish momentum continue. Will Bitcoin Bounce Here? According to data from CoinGlass, there is a possibility of a potential dip before Bitcoin price can move higher. The $83.1K level contains nearly $1M worth of liquidity, which might be tapped before a sustained move to the upside. A high dense liquidity pool exists around $84K to $85K, which coincides with the levels noted by crypto trader RektProof. Other liquidity levels include $86.8K, $88K and $90K. BTC Liquidity Heatmap Long-term BTC Holders at Breakeven The 365-day MVRV ratio (Market Value to Realized Value) has hit zero level, suggesting that investors who purchased BTC in the past year are at breakeven. The last time this metric tagged this level was in August 2024, which was followed by more than 50% rally in Bitcoin price in the next five months. If history repeats, Bitcoin price prediction is on the verge of a bullish breakout. BTC 365-day MVRV RektProof‚Äôs analysis suggests that Bitcoin price could revisit $91K if it forms a four-hour demand zone, with potential targets at $87,500, $91,279, and $95K, supported by the 365-day MVRV ratio hitting zero The post Crypto Trader Provides Detailed Plan on How Bitcoin Price Will Revisit $91K appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Price Analysis|BTC price,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-22 05:26:21

It was not because of the option‚Äôs expiry but because the traders were uncertain of its adverse impact that made them prepare for bullish and bearish scenarios. However, BTC prices failed to reach either of the marked levels and remained constrained within a narrow range. Although this offers short-term relief from the volatility, from a wider perspective, such sluggish Bitcoin behaviour could be worrisome! After facing rejection from $86,800, the traders appear to have become pessimistic, which mirrors the volume that has slashed below $20 billion. Whenever the volume plunges to such lows, the prices usually remain lethargic by maintaining a range-bound consolidation. Now the question arises: will the Bitcoin price go up or crash in 2025? Before analyzing the price movements, let‚Äôs have a look at the factors impacting the upcoming BTC price action in 2025. Whale Accumulation at its Peak The recent price action of Bitcoin suggests a notable drop in the on-chain readings and also future data as well. Meanwhile, the whale accumulation remains at its peak, which suggests a substantial rise in the institutional investors. The data from the Glassnode suggests the BTC wallets holding over 1000 BTC have increased from 2040 to 2079 and are currently stabilized to 2077. Monitoring whale activity is extremely crucial, as they can influence the BTC price. The growing number of whales displays the growing confidence among the investors. New Investors Are On the Rise Apart from whales, first-time investors or new investors are also on the rise. The February 23 plunge that dragged the levels from $96,500 to $82,300 attracted huge investors to the platform. The investors appear to have utilized the buy-the-dip opportunity as it happened during the FTX collapse. The above data from Cryptoquant suggests that these new investors have accumulated nearly 172,705 BTC since then. This can be considered one of the bullish signals, as it also denotes a rise in the investor‚Äôs confidence in the token. These on-chain readings hint towards a significant rise in the confidence of whales and new investors, which is important to maintain the volatility within the markets. Besides, huge transfers of cl o se to 3000 BTC between unknown wallets may also shake up the volatility in the coming weekend, compelling the traders to believe a huge whale movement is underway. Therefore, the upcoming weekend could be pretty important for the Bitcoin price, as a rise above the pivotal range at $84,800 may help to close the quarterly close on a bullish note above $85,000. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analyst Outlines Key Bitcoin Level Following a slight uptick after the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) announcement to slow the pace of its balance sheet drawdown, Bitcoin is currently trading in the low $80,000 price range. However, according to Martinez, the leading cryptocurrency could reach a new all-time high (ATH), subject to certain conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says Using Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez pointed to two crucial price levels that could determine Bitcoin‚Äôs next major move. According to the analyst, if BTC breaks and holds above $94,000, it has a ‚Äòhigh probability‚Äô of rallying to $112,000. On the flip side, if BTC falls below $76,000, it risks plunging to $58,000 ‚Äì or even $44,000 ‚Äì if market conditions turn bearish. Notably, BTC previously hit $76,606 on March 10 before rebounding to its current range in the low $80,000s. For the uninitiated, MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands show whether an asset, like Bitcoin, is priced too high or too low compared to its past averages. It helps spot when the market might be overbought ‚Äì potential market top ‚Äì or oversold ‚Äì potential buying opportunity. According to Martinez‚Äôs chart, BTC is currently trading between the mean ‚Äì yellow band ‚Äì and +0.5 standard deviation ‚Äì orange band. A sustained breakout above or below these bands could indicate Bitcoin‚Äôs next significant price direction. Fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin is re-testing the crucial $84,000 support level. A successful hold at this price could set BTC up to challenge the $94,000 resistance, potentially paving the way for a new ATH. The analyst stated: BTC has produced long wicks below this level before which is why a Daily Close above $84k is essential for this retest to be successful. Will BTC Witness A Short Squeeze? In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader suggested that widespread pessimism around BTC‚Äôs recent price action might fuel a powerful short squeeze. According to the analyst, roughly $2 billion worth of short positions could be liquidated if BTC reaches $87,000 ‚Äì potentially driving the price even higher. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Undervalued? Crypto Sentiment Index Flashes ‚ÄúMassive Contrarian Buy Signal‚Äù Adding to the bullish outlook, crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes suggested that BTC‚Äôs March 10 drop to $77,000 may have marked the bottom of this market cycle. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $84,043, down 2% in the past 24 hours.

With liquidations piling up, trading volume surging, and market sentiment turning increasingly bearish, analysts are now speculating on an unsettling possibility‚Äîcould DOGE lose so much value that it adds another zero to its price before March 2025 ends? How Dogecoin‚Äôs downtrend could wipe out its price stability Dogecoin‚Äôs decline has been steep and persistent. The meme coin has already lost 38% over the past month, with its price presently at $0.16 as of writing. DOGE is among the most severely damaged top cryptocurrencies in the current market downturn, losing 20% of its value within only one week. Dogecoin Price Chart (24-Hour), Mar. 11, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko The numbers depict a troubling picture. Over $21.94 million in Dogecoin positions have been liquidated in the previous 24 hours, with $18.51 million coming from long positions‚Äîa strong hint that traders expecting a rebound are being wiped out. Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap, which once rocketed beyond $60 billion, has since plummeted drastically to $23.86 billion. Meanwhile, trading volume remains at $2.6 billion, warning panic selling could accelerate. Is Dogecoin on the verge of adding another zero to its price? A few months ago, DOGE rocketed beyond $0.47 due to post-election euphoria and Elon Musk‚Äôs ongoing backing. However, with Bitcoin (BTC) failing to hold its $100,000 milestone, the entire market has hit, and meme currencies have suffered the most. Analysts fear that if the current decline persists, DOGE could drop below $0.10, reintroducing a zero to its price and causing significant market disruptions. While speculation about a prospective Dogecoin ETF from Bitwise or Grayscale continues, it may not be enough to rescue the meme coin from further fall. As Dogecoin investors explore alternatives, one project stands out for its excellent fundamentals, rapid usage, and zero VC risk: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): a real-world crypto powerhouse gaining market traction Rexas Finance (RXS) is built on actual financial use cases, unlike Dogecoin, which lives on speculation. Fundamentally, Rexas Finance specializes in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a growing industry expected to reach $30 trillion by 2030. The platform makes worldwide investing more possible by allowing fractional ownership of classic assets such as real estate, bonds, and commodities. Rexas Finance is positioned at the vanguard of this change as big financial firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have already delved into RWA tokenization. Rexas Finance recently reached 50,000 active holders, a key milestone in its rapid expansion. This rise in adoption demonstrates the project‚Äôs long-term viability and investor trust in its roadmap. Inside the Rexas Finance presale: a project with no VC sell-off risks With 91% of tokens already sold, the Rexas Finance (RXS) presale is now in its last stage (Stage 12). It is one of the most successful cryptocurrency launches of the year, with $47.2 million raised and 456 million tokens sold. One of the main worries with new crypto ventures is VC dumping. In this situation, venture capitalists buy early allocations cheaply to offload them to regular investors once the tokens are listed on exchanges. Rexas Finance guarantees a fair token distribution by rejecting VC money, removing this risk. Before the exchange launch, the presale price rose 567% from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12. Investor demand and project sustainability confidence drove this growth. Beyond tokenization: what makes Rexas Finance more than just a RWA platform While RWA tokenization is the foundation of Rexas Finance, the project also provides a diverse range of blockchain-powered financial services that appeal to institutional and retail investors. Here are some of its outstanding utilities: Rexas AI Shield: An AI-driven smart contract security technology that finds weaknesses before hackers can exploit them, protecting user funds. Rexas Treasury: A multi-chain staking and yield optimizer that maximizes Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon investment earnings. Rexas Launchpad: A decentralized platform for innovators to raise funds for their tokenization projects. These real-world utilities ensure that Rexas Finance is more than a speculative token; it is an ecosystem that transforms how financial assets are handled, exchanged, and secured on the blockchain. Rexas Finance exchange listing: what investors can expect Investors look forward to June 19, the official listing date for RXS on at least three of the world‚Äôs top ten cryptocurrency exchanges. Historically, high-profile exchange launches have resulted in significant price increases, and RXS will likely follow suit. The listing price is set at $0.25, and given the liquidity and exposure from tier-1 exchanges, industry analysts estimate 45,000% post-launch returns. Given its solid tokenomics, early investor demand, and real-world utility, Rexas Finance is poised to be one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025, mainly as investors shift away from speculative assets such as DOGE. Final thoughts: will Dogecoin collapse as Rexas Finance soars? Dogecoin‚Äôs failure to maintain crucial price levels is generating investor fears. If the current trend continues, DOGE might go below $0.10, adding another zero to its price by the end of March 2025. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is on a unique path. With a rapidly growing user base, solid financial support, and a varied ecosystem of real-world applications, Rexas Finance is emerging as a prominent cryptocurrency competitor in 2025. We are almost at the end of the final presale stage, providing an opportunity to buy RXS tokens before their listing on major exchanges.

According to Ripple, the past commission‚Äôs actions created confusion for the crypto industry, as the agency enforced standards that were not written into law. Ripple says the past SEC‚Äôs enforcement actions aroused confusion in the crypto industry Responding to a February 21, 2025, SEC statement titled ‚ÄúThere must be some way out of here‚Äù (the ‚ÄúRFI‚Äù), Ripple insisted that the commission needs to prioritise providing law-first clarity for crypto companies. In its letter, the exchange referenced Bob Dylan‚Äôs lyric, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much confusion, I can‚Äôt get no relief,‚Äù claiming the previous administration only generated confusion. It further argued that previous enforcement strategies were inconsistent with the Crypto Task Force‚Äôs goal of establishing clear criteria for determining whether an asset qualifies as a security or is part of an investment contract. Echoing this sentiment, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs chief legal officer, even claimed the commission thrived on confusion to mask its failure to follow the law. Today, @Ripple submitted its response to Commissioner @HesterPeirce ‚Äôs Feb. 21 statement: ‚ÄúThere must be some way out of here,‚Äù calling for public input on crypto taxonomy rules. That Dylan lyric continues: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much confusion, I can‚Äôt get no relief.‚Äù The prior‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) March 21, 2025 The exchange now wants the SEC to provide more clarity and return to first principles. It commented: ‚ÄúAs the Crypto Task Force appears to recognize, the SEC should return to first principles and, within the bounds of existing statutes, strive to provide straightforward market guidance that has been absent to date.‚Äù ‚Äì Ripple Ripple even claimed that the SEC does not have jurisdiction over most digital assets and their transactions to date. It added that the agency can only regulate ‚Äúsecurities‚Äù and their transactions as defined by the Securities Act. The crypto firm also argued that staking and yield on public networks differ from securities and asked them to clarify the policies. Additionally, the company reaffirmed its backing for safe harbor provisions and regulatory sandboxes, an approach that has worked well in the UK, Switzerland, and Singapore. The exchange believes the Token Safe Harbor Proposal could allow blockchain projects to grow without being too quickly tagged as securities. Ripple believes the SEC misused some legal definitions, including the Howey Test Ripple, however, accused the SEC of distorting some of the legal requirements for exchanges, including the application of the Howey Test. The crypto company claimed that the agency misused the test to classify digital assets as securities, even without binding agreements or profit participation requirements. Ripple claimed that this approach only created uncertainty and hindered blockchain projects from launching or expanding in the US. The exchange, however, agreed with the SEC‚Äôs decision to categorize meme coins as non-securities, claiming it‚Äôs a step toward clear regulation. Moving forward, the firm believes that all future regulation should be based on existing laws and not on arbitrary constructed norms that could unsettle the markets.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino reportedly said the audit process would be more straightforward under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump. It comes after rising industry concerns over a potential FTX-style liquidity crisis for Tether due to its lack of third-party audits. Tether to produce first full audit after scrutiny ‚ÄúIf the President of the United States says this is top priority for the US, Big Four auditing firms will have to listen, so we are very happy with that,‚Äù Ardoino told Reuters on March 21. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our top priority,‚Äù Ardoino said. It was reported that Tether is currently subject to quarterly reports but not a full independent annual audit, which is much more extensive and provides more assurance to investors and regulators. However, Ardoino did not specify which of the Big Four accounting firms ‚Äî PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst & Young (EY), Deloitte, or KPMG ‚Äî he plans to engage. Tether recorded a profit of $13.7 billion in 2024. Source: Paolo Ardoino Tether‚Äôs USDT maintains its stable value by claiming to be pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio . This means each USDT token is backed by reserves equivalent to its circulating supply. These reserves include traditional currency, cash equivalents and other assets. Earlier this month, Tether hired Simon McWilliams as chief financial officer in preparation for a full financial audit. Industry concerns over Tether‚Äôs lack of audits In September 2024, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons was among those in the industry who voiced concerns about Tether‚Äôs lack of transparency. ‚Äú[Tether is] one of the biggest existential threats to crypto. As we have to trust they hold $118B in collateral without proof! Even after the CFTC fined Tether for lying about their reserves in 2021,‚Äù Bons said.

His commentary focused on the significance of this decision and its implications for XRP. Van Code explained that the primary risk in the SEC‚Äôs appeal was the potential challenge to Judge Torres‚Äô ruling, which determined that ‚ÄúXRP in and of itself, is not a security.‚Äù This ruling had left XRP in a state of uncertainty, particularly among financial institutions and large investors. Van Code stated that the appeal presented ‚Äúthe big RISK which left XRP in a state of limbo with big banks and institutions.‚Äù He also reminded readers that Ripple was fined $125 million for its institutional sales, which the court ruled violated securities laws. He clarified that ‚ÄúRipple ALREADY PAID the fine and is sitting in a bank escrow ready to be released upon clarity of the appeal.‚Äù This means that Ripple had already accounted for this penalty, removing any further financial uncertainty related to the SEC‚Äôs claims. Van Code noted that while Ripple‚Äôs legal team has suggested they may appeal the ruling on institutional sales, this is a separate matter. He emphasized that, regardless of future legal actions, the fundamental outcome of the SEC‚Äôs dropped appeal is that ‚Äúthe UNDISPUTED RULE OF THE LAND IS: XRP IS NOT A SECURITY AND NEVER WILL BE, CASE CLOSED!‚Äù With this legal status confirmed, Van Code stated that Ripple and its extensive network of 1,500 partners no longer have to worry about regulatory threats from the SEC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Market Reactions and Institutional Adoption Despite this legal clarity, Van Code addressed why XRP‚Äôs price had not significantly increased. He acknowledged his expectations, saying he thought the price would have ‚Äú3x already‚Äù and admitted he was surprised by the lack of movement. He pointed to market dynamics as a key factor. According to Van Code, ‚Äúthere is STILL very little volume,‚Äù suggesting that major financial institutions are not yet actively accumulating. He stated that much of the current activity is ‚Äúthe usual market manipulation by Binance and their VIP trading bots.‚Äù He also explained that institutional investors often take time to react to legal developments. Large financial players ‚Äúare not trigger happy‚Äù and may require board approval for significant purchases, which could slow down their decision-making process. He noted that such approvals are often granted during monthly meetings, further delaying potential buying pressure on XRP. Future Outlook and Investor Patience Van Code made it clear that, in his view, the risk associated with XRP has now been eliminated. He argued that there is now ‚Äúnothing stopping its adoption‚Äù and that there are no foreseeable events that could significantly impact its price negatively. Looking ahead, he suggested that the market will see continued upward momentum, stating, ‚ÄúThe rest of the journey Imho is all the way up.‚Äù However, he acknowledged the unpredictability of price movements, admitting, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt pretend to know price, heck I humbly admit I have been wrong too many times.‚Äù Finally, he advised patience, warning that the biggest obstacle for investors now is ‚Äúimpatience.‚Äù He encouraged holders to ‚Äújust sit tight, enjoy the victory and start to plan how you will manage your new fortunes.‚Äù Van Code‚Äôs analysis clearly shows the SEC‚Äôs decision and its impact on XRP and Ripple . The regulatory uncertainty that previously clouded XRP‚Äôs future has now been removed, confirming its legal status. Despite this, market reactions remain slow, with institutional investors likely accumulating XRP over time. He emphasizes patience, reinforcing his belief that XRP‚Äôs adoption will continue without regulatory obstacles.

IMF Adds Bitcoin to Global Economic Stats! In its latest seventh edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7), IMF included cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) in the balance of payments. According to the IMF‚Äôs new standards, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are now non-productive assets in global economic statistics. The updated manual was released on March 20, marking the first time that the IMF has included detailed guidance on digital assets in its global statistical standards. The IMF‚Äôs new framework splits digital assets into fungible and non-fungible tokens and further classifies them based on whether they have associated liabilities. Bitcoin and similar tokens without liabilities are treated as capital assets, while stablecoins backed by liabilities are seen as financial instruments. According to the IMF, crypto assets like Bitcoin, which are not linked to liabilities and serve as a medium of exchange, are categorized as non-produced nonfinancial assets and recorded in the capital account. In practice, this would mean cross-border crypto transactions involving assets like Bitcoin will be tracked as acquisitions or sales of non-produced assets in the capital account. Meanwhile, tokens tied to a platform, like Ethereum or Solana (SOL), may be treated like equity holdings in the financial account if the owner is from a different country than the token‚Äôs origin. For instance, if a UK investor holds Solana tokens from the US, it would be treated like owning foreign stocks, recorded as ‚Äúequity crypto assets.‚Äù The IMF highlights that, despite using cryptography, these assets are similar to standard equity when it comes to ownership rights. Staking and Crypto Yields Furthermore, the IMF acknowledges the complexity of staking and crypto yields, noting that rewards from holding tokens could be treated like equity dividends and recorded as income, based on the size and purpose of the holdings. Notably, this update helps countries better track the economic impact of digital assets. The IMF now treats activities like mining or staking, which help validate crypto transactions, as services. These will be included in computer services exports and imports. Created with input from over 160 countries, the BPM7 manual will guide global economic data. While its application may differ by country, it‚Äôs a big step toward recognizing the economic impact of digital assets worldwide.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-22 05:47:36

XRP‚Äôs price continues to show a larger bearish divergence on the 3-day chart. Despite some short-term bullish movement, the overall momentum is still leaning toward the downside. For months, market analysts have been warning that major bullish movement is unlikely in the near future. Short-Term Bullish Action Amid Larger Bearish Trend XRP has seen brief bullish movements, with some positive price structure breaking above key levels. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, these moves have allowed XRP to flip previous resistance into support, giving traders hope for short-term price action. However, the overarching bearish divergence remains, signaling that larger price increases may still be unlikely for the near future. Key Support and Resistance Levels for XRP XRP currently holds support between $2.24 and $2.30, with major support around $1.95 to $2.50. On the flip side, resistance levels are observed at $2.60 to $2.65 and again near $2.80. A significant resistance zone is near the $3 mark, making it a key level for any possiblr upward movement. Sideways Price Action Likely to Continue Over the past month, XRP has primarily moved sideways within a price range between key support and resistance levels. With the larger bearish divergence in play, it‚Äôs likely that this trend will continue until more definitive market signals emerge. In the immediate term, XRP‚Äôs price is expected to fluctuate within this range, with a lack of strong directional momentum. XRP‚Äôs Long-Term Outlook: Waiting for a Breakout XRP‚Äôs long-term outlook remains uncertain, with market analysts suggesting the possibility of a ‚Äúlast hurrah‚Äù for bullish action. Some believe that XRP could experience a final euphoric surge before a more significant downtrend, driven by broader market forces. As the market is still in a corrective phase, it may take time before XRP can break out of its sideways movement and generate substantial price action. Conclusion: A Market at Crossroads Despite short-term price movements, XRP‚Äôs price is currently stuck within a range, waiting for a catalyst to drive the next price change.

South Korean exchange giant, Bithumb, has just announced a significant update that‚Äôs sure to pique the interest of traders. Prepare for the launch of the ACX/KRW spot trading pair, set to go live on March 22nd. This exciting development opens doors for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into new trading avenues. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. What‚Äôs the Buzz About the Bithumb Listing of ACX/KRW? Bithumb, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, has officially announced the upcoming listing of the ACX/KRW spot trading pair. This announcement, made on their official website, confirms that starting March 22nd at 09:00 UTC, users will be able to trade ACX directly against the Korean Won (KRW) on the Bithumb platform. This move is significant for several reasons, offering both opportunities and raising some questions for crypto enthusiasts. But first, let‚Äôs understand what exactly spot trading is and why this listing is generating attention. Understanding Spot Trading and Its Significance Spot trading is the most fundamental type of trading in any financial market, including cryptocurrencies. In spot trading, assets are exchanged for immediate delivery. When Bithumb lists the ACX/KRW spot trading pair , it means traders can buy or sell ACX using KRW directly, with the transaction settling ‚Äòon the spot‚Äô or very shortly after the order is filled. This is different from futures or margin trading, where you are trading contracts based on the asset‚Äôs price, not the asset itself. The introduction of a new crypto trading pair like ACX/KRW on a reputable exchange like Bithumb is important because: Increased Accessibility: It makes ACX more accessible to the South Korean market, allowing users who prefer to trade in their local currency (KRW) to easily participate in the ACX market. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing on Bithumb, a major exchange, typically increases the liquidity of the asset. Higher liquidity means it‚Äôs easier to buy and sell ACX without significant price slippage. Wider Market Exposure: It exposes ACX to a larger pool of traders and investors, potentially leading to increased trading volume and price discovery. Validation for ACX: Being listed on a prominent exchange like Bithumb can be seen as a form of validation for the ACX project, potentially boosting its credibility and appeal. Why Bithumb Chose to List the ACX/KRW Pair? While Bithumb‚Äôs official announcement is straightforward, it doesn‚Äôt explicitly state the reasons behind choosing to list the ACX/KRW pair now. However, we can infer some potential motivations: Market Demand: Bithumb likely assesses market demand before listing a new pair. If there‚Äôs a growing interest in ACX among their user base or in the South Korean crypto market generally, listing the ACX/KRW pair caters to this demand. Diversification of Trading Options: Exchanges constantly seek to diversify their offerings to attract and retain users. Adding new and potentially popular trading pairs like ACX/KRW expands the trading options available on Bithumb. Strategic Partnerships: Listings can sometimes be the result of strategic partnerships or agreements between the exchange and the project behind the cryptocurrency. While not confirmed in this announcement, it‚Äôs a possibility. Expanding the Crypto Ecosystem: Exchanges play a crucial role in expanding the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. By listing new and promising projects, they contribute to the growth and diversification of the market. Benefits of Trading the ACX/KRW Pair on Bithumb For traders and investors, the launch of the ACX/KRW cryptocurrency exchange pair on Bithumb brings several potential benefits: Direct KRW Trading: South Korean users can now trade ACX directly using their local currency, eliminating the need to first convert KRW to another cryptocurrency like USDT or BTC. This simplifies the trading process and can potentially reduce trading fees. Access to Bithumb‚Äôs Platform: Traders gain access to Bithumb‚Äôs robust trading platform, known for its user-friendly interface, security features, and relatively high trading volumes. Potential for Price Discovery: The new listing can contribute to price discovery for ACX in the KRW market. Increased trading activity and liquidity can lead to a more efficient and transparent price for ACX against KRW. Portfolio Diversification: Adding ACX to a trading portfolio can offer diversification benefits. By trading different cryptocurrencies, investors can potentially spread risk and capitalize on different market opportunities. Bithumb to list ACX/KRW spot trading pair Navigating the Challenges and Risks While the Bithumb listing of ACX/KRW presents exciting opportunities, it‚Äôs crucial to be aware of the inherent challenges and risks associated with crypto trading, especially with new listings: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. New listings can sometimes experience even higher volatility in the initial trading days and weeks. Traders should be prepared for potential price swings. Liquidity Risks: While listing on Bithumb should improve liquidity, it‚Äôs still important to monitor the order book depth and trading volume, especially in the initial phase. Lower liquidity can lead to wider spreads and price slippage. Project Risks: Investing in any cryptocurrency carries project-specific risks. It‚Äôs essential to conduct thorough research on the ACX project, its fundamentals, team, technology, and roadmap before trading. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, particularly in South Korea. Traders should stay informed about any regulatory developments that could impact crypto trading. Actionable Insights for Traders So, how can traders make the most of this new listing? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Before trading ACX/KRW, thoroughly research the ACX project. Understand its use case, technology, tokenomics, and community. Monitor Trading Volumes: Keep an eye on the trading volume of the ACX/KRW pair on Bithumb after the listing. Volume can be an indicator of market interest and liquidity. Start Small: If you‚Äôre new to trading ACX or crypto in general, consider starting with smaller trades to manage risk and get comfortable with the market dynamics. Use Risk Management Tools: Utilize Bithumb‚Äôs risk management tools, such as stop-loss orders, to protect your capital and manage potential losses. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments related to ACX, Bithumb, and the broader crypto market to make informed trading decisions. Conclusion: A Promising Step for ACX and Bithumb The upcoming listing of the ACX/KRW spot trading pair on Bithumb is undoubtedly a positive development for both ACX and the Bithumb exchange. It provides increased accessibility, liquidity, and market exposure for ACX, while offering Bithumb users a new and potentially attractive trading option. As with any crypto investment, it‚Äôs crucial for traders to approach this new opportunity with informed caution, conduct thorough research, and manage risk effectively. The launch of ACX/KRW on Bithumb marks another step forward in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading, offering fresh avenues for engagement and growth within the digital asset ecosystem.

As of today, March 22, 2025, the overall cryptocurrency market remains unchanged. ADA Current Price Momentum Amid this, ADA has registered a price drop of 1.2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $0.70. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 25%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors as the price continued to fluctuate. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia‚Äôs technical analysis, ADA appears bullish on a lower time frame as it is positioned on the lower ascending trendline of a symmetrical triangle pattern formed on the four-hour time frame. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the asset holds above the $0.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 4% to reach $0.74 in the coming days. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain support at the ascending trendline and breaches the pattern, it could see an 8% price drop to $0.64 in the near future. Source: Trading View Major Liquidation Levels At press time, the major liquidation levels are near $0.691 on the lower side and $0.723 on the upper side, with traders being over-leveraged at these levels, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass If the market sentiment remains unchanged and the price drops to the $0.691 level, nearly $14.15 million worth of long positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if the sentiment shifts and the price continues to soar, breaching the $0.723 mark, approximately $9.51 million worth of short positions will be liquidated. These on-chain metrics, along with technical analysis, hint that bulls are currently following the price action, as bets on the long side are notably higher than those on the short side.

With 61.5M TON in TVL and nearly 100,000 stakers, Tonstakers is TON‚Äôs leading liquid staking protocol. Its tsTON liquid staking token is integrated with all major TON DeFi protocols, enabling users to get more rewards in addition to staking rewards. A New Standard for Liquid Staking Key benefits of leveraged liquid staking on Tonstakers with EVAA include: Low-cost borrowing : TON at 0.37% APR with USDT & TSTON as collateral. High-yield staking looping : Up to 7.89% APY with automatic compounding. Instant withdrawals: No waiting period, full liquidity. Dynamic Looping & Total Yield Calculation The EVAA Earn update enables Tonstakers users to leverage their staking position to increase staking rewards. As shown in the new EVAA Earn interface, a dynamic ‚ÄúLoops Amount‚Äù selector has been introduced, allowing users to define the number of staking and reinvestment cycles within EVAA + Tonstakers. The process follows a looping strategy : Stake TON with Tonstakers. Supply tsTON to EVAA. Borrow TON and repeat the cycle. Total Yield is automatically calculated, streamlining the process for both retail users and large-scale investors. This upgrade enhances usability, making the platform more intuitive for all users and everyday users alike , and reinforcing our mission to build a truly user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. Maximizing EVAA XP Rewards EVAA Protocol offers EVAA XP for borrowing TON. The more cycles of supplying stTON and borrowing TON you complete, the more EVAA XP you earn. EVAA XP (Experience Points) is a key component of the Earn section, designed to enhance user incentives. It rewards users for borrowing TON and plays a crucial role in determining the future allocation of $EVAA tokens after the Token Generation Event (TGE). Each iteration of borrowing TON generates additional XP. This means that users actively engaging in looping strategies will accumulate more XP, further increasing their potential rewards.

Should a breach arise, the next resistance zone‚Äîwhere 548 trillion SHIB tokens have accumulated‚Äîis $0.000014 to $0.000019. Though bearish, SHIB has its early 2022/2023 breakthrough chart pattern and its $0.000081 objective active. If SHIB keeps its optimistic chart pattern and purchasing pressure rises in the market, crypto expert Javon Marks notes that it may still reach 450%. SHIB has made many tries, but it has not been able to breach the $0.000014 barrier. It cannot hold at $0.0000125; so, a price reduction to $0.0000115 follows. It follows the past pattern, in which SHIB cannot keep positive momentum. As of March 21, 2025, Shiba Inu costs $0.000012; a 0.16% gain over the last 24 hours results in an RSI of 51.19, which corresponds to neutral momentum in the market. Though caution is advised, the volume is 33.54 million SHIB with investor involvement. Polygon (POL) Suffers Massive Price Decline The drop of Polygon toward $0.20 continues as 99% of Polygon‚Äôs (POL) holders suffer financial loss. The blockchain lost $13.2 million worth of liquidity within a 24-hour period, therefore supporting predictions of a continued declining market trend. The dropping price of Polygon does not show any sign of a temporary trend. The Artemis data shows a continuous negative flow of money from its chain network, therefore suggesting widespread diminishing trust within its network. Most POL token holders now find themselves in a dangerous situation and face the danger of losing their money. To imply strong short-positioning activity, Open Interest declined 1.29% in futures markets at the same time trading volume surged by 73%. The technical examination reveals negative tendencies because POL approaches the February critical support level. Remittix Is Set To Surge Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies, the platform provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. As a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantee accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform‚Äôs open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. At $0.0734 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential.

Furthermore, large volume transactions for SHIB and rising burn rate can serve as an additional catalyst for the same. Technical chart indicators show that a SHIB breakout can lead to an 81% upside for the second-largest meme coin. Shiba Inu Price Breakout Can Trigger 81% Upside Shiba Inu price is showing signs of a potential bullish reversal as it breaks out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe. The daily chart shows SHIB trading within a descending channel that has been in place since December 2024, with the price recently testing the upper boundary of this channel. The cryptocurrency reached a high of $0.00001303 and a low of $0.00001293 during this period as shown in the below image. Source: Crypto SHIB As shown in the above image, a breakout from this descending channel can trigger the next SHIB bull rally with a potential target of 81% on the upside. Some market analysts are also predicting a 17x Shiba Inu rally from here onwards. Shiba Inu Transaction Volumes on the Rise With the Shiba Inu price staging a rebound to $0.00001367 yesterday, the network has witnessed a large transaction volume for the same. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock revealed a significant spike in large Shiba Inu transactions, each valued at $100,000 or more, on March 20. This coincided with the SHIB price seeing a surge past $0.000013 levels for the first time in a week. The total volume of these transactions rose to 7.49 trillion SHIB, valued at over $97 million at the $0.000013 price point. Thus, it shows a massive 197% jump from the 2.52 trillion SHIB traded the previous day. Source: IntoTheBlock Over the last weekend, the SHIB transactions dropped to a low of 571 billion. However, whale activity has resumed once again showing potential interest from big players. The latest spike of 7.49 trillion SHIB marks the highest transaction volume in nearly two months. SHIB Burn Rate on the Rise As per the data from SHIBBurn , the overall Shiba Inu burn rate has surged by 21% in the last 24 hours, now moving past $17.1 million. Over the past week, we have seen a strong surge in the SHIB burn rate thereby raising overall market optimism surrounding the meme coin. Following the latest burn event, the total number of Shiba Inu tokens permanently removed from circulation has climbed to 410,745,403,545,103. This brings the circulating supply down to approximately 589,254,596,454,896 tokens.

His post, accompanied by a detailed price chart, outlines the importance of key resistance levels and the implications of XRP‚Äôs price action in the coming weeks. Egrag Crypto introduced the analysis with a reference to what some traders humorously call the ‚ÄúDouble Boob‚Äù chart pattern, referring to a possible double-bottom formation. He emphasized the importance of XRP closing above a critical resistance zone: ‚ÄúIf #XRP fails to close above the $2.65-$2.70 range, it won‚Äôt negate wave 4 and will likely lead us down to the 5th wave.‚Äù #XRP ‚Äì Double Bottom or Wave 5 Downward? ?(Update) As the Aussies like to call it, the ""Double Boob"" chart!

According to his analysis, failure to achieve a strong close above this range could result in a downward move, confirming the fifth wave in Elliott Wave theory. Regulatory Developments and Market Sentiment Egrag also addressed the broader market sentiment following recent developments with the SEC dropping its case against Ripple . He acknowledged the significance of this event while maintaining a focus on technical analysis. He stated ‚ÄúThis is a significant win for long-term adoption and utility, reinforcing our belief in the valuable use case of #XRP. In the short term, I need to stick to math, numbers, and charts.‚Äù Egrag‚Äôs response indicates that while legal clarity benefits XRP‚Äôs long-term outlook, short-term price movements remain dictated by technical factors rather than market sentiment alone.

Egrag Crypto identified three critical price levels that traders should monitor: ‚ÄúA close above $2.66 would be a good sign, followed by another close above $2.97 as a second #Bullish confirmation. The ultimate confirmation for a bullish trend would be a close at $3.40.‚Äù These resistance levels serve as milestones for XRP‚Äôs potential upward movement . If XRP successfully reaches $3.40, Egrag suggests that the next major targets will be between $5 and $8. He concluded with reassurance that the broader market outlook remains intact despite short-term fluctuations: Technical Outlook and Market Implications The chart accompanying his analysis provides a visual representation of these targets, Fibonacci retracement levels, and potential price movements. The image suggests that XRP is testing resistance while attempting to confirm a breakout. Egrag Crypto‚Äôs technical outlook emphasizes the importance of XRP maintaining strong closes above these key levels to confirm bullish momentum. As XRP navigates this crucial range, traders will be closely watching whether it can sustain upward movement or if it will face another corrective wave.

Blockchain technology promised a borderless financial system, yet many networks remain slow, fragmented, and expensive. High fees, network congestion, and complex cross-chain transactions continue to frustrate users and businesses alike. But this is starting to change. As of March 2025, Qubetics, Algorand, and Terra Classic are introducing game-changing updates that could reshape the blockchain world. Qubetics is leading the charge by uniting fragmented blockchains, making cross-border transactions seamless. Meanwhile, Algorand is investing in innovation despite market fluctuations, and Terra Classic is pushing forward with community-driven reforms. Its unique approach to cross-border transactions, coupled with a highly successful presale, has put it on the radar as a strong contender for the best altcoin to buy in March 2025. Let‚Äôs dive into how each of these projects is shaping the future of digital finance. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, addressing real-world challenges with its unique offerings. As the first Layer 1 Web3 Aggregated Ecosystem, Qubetics unifies major networks like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana, tackling the longstanding issue of blockchain fragmentation. This integration facilitates seamless interoperability, allowing assets and data to move freely across different ecosystems, thereby reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs. ‚Äã A standout feature of Qubetics is its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet. This wallet empowers users to manage and store digital assets securely, offering in-app feeless $TICS transfers and options for debit and virtual cards. By simplifying the adoption process, Qubetics enables businesses to integrate blockchain technology with minimal friction, leading to cost savings and increased operational efficiency. ‚Äã What Presale Numbers Reveal About the Future? Qubetics‚Äô crypto presale has already raised over $15.3 million , with more than 502 million $TICS tokens sold to 23,500+ early buyers . Those who secured their tokens earlier are already seeing substantial paper gains as each new presale stage brings a price increase. At the current price of $0.1181 per token , early adopters who enter now still have the opportunity to lock in significant potential returns before the mainnet launch and exchange listings, where prices are expected to rise further. For those still undecided, consider this: a $100 investment today would yield 846 tokens . If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, that $100 turns into $846 ‚Äîa 746% ROI . At $5, that same investment would be worth $4,230 , and at $15, it skyrockets to $12,690 . However, if you wait and the price doubles before you buy, your potential gains are instantly cut in half . Every delay could mean missing out on one of the biggest opportunities of 2025 . Algorand: Navigating Market Dynamics Algorand, known for its scalable and secure blockchain platform, has experienced notable developments recently. The Algorand community is gearing up for the 2025 Algorand Startup Lab, with the program set to commence on March 21-22 at T-Hub. This initiative aims to foster innovation and support startups within the Algorand ecosystem.‚Äã However, Algorand‚Äôs native token, ALGO, has faced market challenges. As of March 17, 2025, ALGO is trading at approximately $0.19, reflecting a decrease of about 29.85% from its price of $0.27 on February 21, 2025. Despite this downturn, Algorand‚Äôs commitment to technological advancements and community initiatives positions it for potential recovery and growth in the evolving blockchain landscape. ‚Äã Terra Classic: Community-Driven Resurgence Terra Classic has embarked on a path of revival, driven by its dedicated community. A significant proposal is under consideration to reclassify TerraClassicUSD (USTC) from a stablecoin to a Universal Standard Token or meme coin. This reclassification aims to address USTC‚Äôs failure to maintain its peg since the Terra collapse in 2022, potentially influencing buyers sentiment and market dynamics. ‚Äã Additionally, the community has implemented a token burn program to reduce LUNC‚Äôs hyperinflated supply. By March 2025, over 402 billion tokens have been burned, with major exchanges like Binance contributing significantly by incinerating billions monthly from trading fees. This deflationary pressure aims to create scarcity, potentially boosting LUNC‚Äôs price over time. ‚Äã Conclusion As blockchain technology advances, only the most innovative and adaptable projects will thrive. Qubetics stands out as a true problem-solver, addressing cross-chain inefficiencies and making real-world transactions seamless. Algorand, despite recent market turbulence, remains focused on long-term growth by supporting developers and fostering blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, Terra Classic proves that community-driven projects can still rebuild and redefine their value through governance and strategic upgrades. For those looking at the best altcoin to buy in March 2025 , Qubetics, Algorand, and Terra Classic each offer compelling reasons to watch closely. The market moves fast, and the projects leading the next wave of adoption won‚Äôt wait for anyone.

WhiteRock is an RWA tokenization platform positioned to gain interest from institutional investors. By 2031, WHITE is expected to trade at an average price of $0.002241. WhiteRock is a platform that brings traditional real-world financial assets‚Äîlike stocks, bonds, and real estate‚Äîonto the blockchain. By tokenizing these assets, it makes them more accessible to people worldwide and streamlines trading by offering a transparent, efficient system that complies with regulations. Essentially, WhiteRock helps investors seamlessly buy and sell everything from equities to fixed-income products in a way that blends the best of traditional finance with cutting-edge blockchain technology. WHITE is the native token of the WhiteRock platform, which can be traded on various decentralized and centralized exchanges.

It rebounded, forming a wave-like pattern. The selling pressure has eased on the 1-day and 4-hour charts, and the price is finding solid support at $0.0002926. If WhiteRock sustains its support at $0.00029, it may bounce back and test the $0.0006 resistance range again. WHITE/USD 1-day chart analysis WHITE/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The 1-day WHITE/USD chart is showing significant volatility. The coin reached a high price of $0.0016030 on 4th March before experiencing a sharp dip to $0.0003120. It then rebounded before forming a wave pattern. Right now, we can see that the selling pressure has significantly reduced, and WHITE is already forming strong support at the $0.0002926 mark. RSI is currently neutral at 46.49, and there‚Äôs a strong potential for WhiteRock to test the local resistance around $0.0006 by the end of March. WHITE/USD 4-hour chart analysis WHITE/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView On the 4-hour chart, WHITE/USD has dipped below the EMA 50 line and is currently gearing to retest it. The coin is still struggling to recover from its downward price rally that began on the 4th of March. However, the 4-hour chart also confirms that strong support has been established at $0.00029. RSI on the 4-hour chart is currently at 33.36, suggesting that the market may be slightly oversold. For now, WHITE is expected to stay in consolidation. If the level at $0.00029 is maintained, it can pump back and retest the resistance in the $0.0006 range. WhiteRock technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.0003457 BUY SMA 5 0.0003469 BUY SMA 10 0.0004469 BUY SMA 21 0.0005746 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.0003480 SELL EMA 5 0.0003674 BUY EMA 10 0.0004174 BUY EMA 21 0.0004280 BUY What to expect from WhiteRock price analysis next? Due to low volatility, WhiteRock is expected to consolidate sideways for the next few days. However, its 1-day and 4-hour charts suggest that the selling momentum has reduced and new investors have replaced the early buyers. It is in the accumulation phase and has formed strong support at $0.00029. If this level gets maintained, WHITE/USD will pump higher after consolidation, and retest the resistance in the 0.0006$ range in the next couple of weeks. Why is WHITE down? WHITE is currently down because of the initial sell pressure from early buyers. However, the sellers are out, and the sell pressure has reduced. New buyers seem to be in, which means that WHITE is likely to test the resistance around $0.0006 soon and pump back higher. Will WHITE reach $0.01? Yes, WHITE can certainly reach $0.01. However, that would be a long-term price target. Our current price targets are at a potential high of $0.000642 in 2025 and $0.002844 by 2031. Will WHITE reach $1? Yes, it is possible for WHITE to reach $1 if it gains the attention of more institutional investors and adoption rises. With the RWA tokenization market in a boom, WHITE can certainly reach this price target in the next few years. Can WhiteRock reach $5? WHITE may reach $5. However, it would happen in the long-term. The RWA tokenization market is still in its infancy but expected to boom due to growing investors interest. After 2031, WHITE may be over $5. Can WhiteRock reach $100? No, it is unlikely for WhiteRock to reach $100. However, theoretically, it should be able to tap that mark. That depends on the level of adoption and investors interest in the platform. How much will WhiteRock be worth in 2025? In 2025, WhiteRock can retest the resistance levels around $0.000613 and break higher, potentially giving a return of more than 200%. However, on average, it is expected to return around $150% from the current price point. Does WhiteRock have a good long-term future? Yes, WhiteRock has a good long-term future due to the fact that the RWA tokenization market is ripe for investors. There‚Äôs a growing interest in the tokenization of assets like real estate, stocks, and bonds. Is WhiteRock a good crypto to buy? Yes, WHITE/USD is a good crypto to buy. It is the native coin of the WhiteRock platform that focuses on the tokenization of real-world assets like real estate, stocks, and bonds. WHITE price prediction March 2025 Analysts are looking forward to WHITE‚Äôs price increase in March. They suggest it might climb as high as $0.000613 and drop as low as $0.000345 , with an average of around $0.000701 .

Here‚Äôs How High it Could Fly After Ripple‚Äôs SEC Victory (ChatGPT Insight),https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-unleashed-heres-how-high-it-could-fly-after-ripples-sec-victory-chatgpt-insight/,"TL;DR The XRP army got the news it was waiting for earlier this week, as company CEO Brad Garlinghouse triumphantly announced the closure of Ripple‚Äôs legal case against the SEC. With such a big burden behind it, how high can XRP go? Here‚Äôs what ChatGPT had to say. How High (XRP)? The native token of the Ripple ecosystem skyrocketed in the months after the US elections on the hype that the local regulatory landscape would change, and its legal case against the SEC, which continued for over four years, could come to a favorable closure for the company. As with many other similar events that are highly anticipated by the community, the asset‚Äôs value rose ahead of the actual development in what is known as a ‚Äò buy-the-rumor ‚Äò rally. Although XRP spiked by double-digits after Garlinghouse‚Äôs announcement , it quickly lost momentum, and it‚Äôs currently 1% down on a weekly scale. However, there could be long-term implications for XRP, especially if the SEC clears its name and even classifies it as a commodity, as recent reports claimed . Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT about XRP‚Äôs price potential in the following months (and maybe years) after the end of this big battle. In terms of a price target for 2025, the popular AI chatbot highlighted a range between $5 and $7. This would require XRP to break its 2018 all-time high and even double its price from then to tap the bigger mark. Although this sounds promising and slightly unlikely given the current market conditions, ChatGPT brought an even more bullish scenario, which could see XRP rise to $10-$15 within the next 18 months. There‚Äôs also an extreme case, which foresees a surge to $20-$30. What Could Drive Such Mindblowing Rallies? The AI solution noted that the main drivers behind such notable (and perhaps far-fetched) price increases are as follows: Wider adoption of Ripple‚Äôs XRPL ledger and XRP token to be used for cross-border payments and whale accumulation . Increased institutional confidence and adoption, which could be enhanced after the lawsuit‚Äôs end. Potential ETF approval in the States ‚Äì there are several such filings with the local regulator, and the chances for a green light went up exponentially after Garlinghouse‚Äôs announcement. Major partnerships for Ripple ‚Äì the ending of the case could mean that more big names are open to working with Ripple and signing lucrative collaborations. A global pivot toward blockchain-based settlements where XRPL could be a leader. XRP to become a ‚Äúbridge asset for CBDCs or international remittances at scale.‚Äù ‚Äì concluded ChatGPT. Obviously, many (if not all) of those factors have to align for XRP to surge to any of the aforementioned targets, which, at the moment, doesn‚Äôt seem too likely. However, the landscape in crypto can change just as quickly as it did in the past few months, and XRP has already proven that it could registered triple-digit price surges in a very short period of time.

Market Maker Offloads $10M ENA Raising Concerns,https://coingape.com/is-ethena-price-at-risk-market-maker-offloads-10m-ena-raising-concerns/,"Ethena price remains concerningly eyed by crypto market participants against the backdrop of a severe bearish trajectory. ENA erased nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, in sync with a renowned market maker dumping over $10 million worth of tokens. Thus, traders and investors anticipate additional short-term volatility in the coin, whilst it recently faced rejection at a key resistance of $0.48. Ethena Price Gains Bearish Momentum; Here‚Äôs Why On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence on March 22 signaled that market maker Amber Group deposited $10.35 million worth of ENA to Binance. Out of the deposits, $2.5 million worth of tokens were acquired from the same crypto exchange two weeks ago. This accumulation took place at an average price of $0.3979. On the other hand, Amber Group received $7.85 million worth of coins from the Ethena Claim address. These tokens were received between April 2024 and July 2024. For context, the market maker‚Äôs massive dump to Binance impacts a crypto‚Äôs supply dynamics. In turn, market participants expect short-term volatility in price. However, speculations of a bolstered movement also prevail as this endeavor will increase liquidity and trading volumes, thereby magnetizing investors. Ethena Token Unlocks: Another Vital Barrier For Price? Simultaneously, ENA tokenomics faces additional heat amid massive token unlocks recorded this month. Notably, Cryptorank‚Äôs data flagged 2.06 billion coins, worth 13.9% of the total supply, unlocked on March 5. Meanwhile, 94.19 million coins, worth 0.63% of the asset‚Äôs total supply, were unlocked on March 2. These unlocks substantially increase the asset‚Äôs market supply, negatively impacting demand and price sentiments. Another massive unlock of 94.19 million coins is set to occur on April 2. Further, 171.85 million tokens will be unlocked on April 5. As a result, traders and investors reflect highly concerning sentiments surrounding Ethena price action ahead as the supply inflates. How Is The Crypto Delivering As The Month Ends? At the time of reporting, Ethena price crashed nearly 4% and exchanged hands at $0.3581. The coin bottomed and peaked at $0.3497 and $0.3763 in the past 24 hours. Notably, the waning price action comes in sync with Amber Group‚Äôs massive dump to the top crypto exchange . Whereas, the weekly and monthly charts show a dip of 1% and 11%, respectively. The broader slumping action falls in line with the massive token unlocks mentioned above. Renowned market trader and analyst Sjuul/AltCryptoGems took to X, revealing that ENA again faced crucial resistance at $0.48, slamming the chances for a pump ahead. ‚ÄúIf bulls fail to defend this demand, it would be a pretty bad sign,‚Äù the analyst concluded amid bearish dynamics taking over. Source: Sjuul/AltCryptoGems, X. Additionally, an Ethena price prediction by CoinGape indicated that the crypto‚Äôs 3-month bias indicator is tilting in favor of bears. This has further pushed traders and investors to take a cautious trading approach on the token. On the other hand, it‚Äôs also worth mentioning that Ethena Labs and Securitize unveiled plans to launch Converge, a blockchain tailor-made for DeFi and tokenized assets. Nevertheless, traders and investors expect diminished market interest in the asset due to broader dynamics. The post Is Ethena Price At Risk?

So while the market experienced more outflows, it almost has the appearance of a stable day. For the day, total inflows were $2.1 million. Total outflows were $2.3 million. We had a slight net outflow. There are pockets of interest in certain memecoins, with some experiencing inflows while others are not. This is a good example of the recent dynamic nature of the ‚Äòmeme stock‚Äô sector‚Äîwhere if you have a certain amount of capital inflowing, it can signal some freshly bull market sentiment. Memecoins in Focus: Inflows and Outflows On March 20, several memecoins saw increased interest from investors. Of the tokens attracting capital, TRX (Tron) topped the list with inflows of $87,000. Despite being a platform known for its fast transaction speeds and virtually free transaction fees (we calculated about 0.0007 TRX earlier this year), Tron has yet to earn a significant foothold among either DeFi users or the NFT community. Memecoin investors, however, seem to have no such reservations. The native token of the Mondes project, MNDE, has also seen a nice inflow of $105,000. Mondes is a relatively new memecoin that is gaining traction for its unique, community-driven approach and innovative tokenomics. Investors seem to be backing this project in a pretty big way, despite the mixed performance of memecoins overall. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 20/03/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $2.1M Outflow: $2.3M Volume: $4.38M Net Volume: -$221k There was inflow into: $TRX ($87K) $MNDE ($105K) $JUP ($112K) $JLP ($66K) $GRASS ($99K)‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/heLNvRZSgn ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 21, 2025 Performing well in terms of inflow was another token, JUP, which received $112K in fresh capital. Jupiter, known for its decentralized exchange ecosystem and staking rewards, is still a popular choice among memecoin traders looking for new and emerging opportunities. JLP and GRASS (Grass Token) also received excellent inflows, netting $66K and $99K, respectively. Both tokens appear to be enhancing community involvement and fostering ecosystem development, in a way that‚Äôs attracting investor interest as they look to park some capital in the relatively new, fast-moving memecoin market. Top Memecoins with Outflows Conversely, in the market, we saw a notable amount of capital leaving certain memecoins, with ARC (Arcadia Coin) taking an outflow of $82K. Even though it is making strides in community building and has a decent array of use cases, this project seems to be under pressure, with us looking at an outflow that in all probability suggests investors are looking to park their dollars in safer assets in light of recent adverse developments in the memecoin market. The day‚Äôs largest outflow was seen in FARTCOIN, which had a massive $412K leave. FARTCOIN, a humorous and meme-driven token, has been attracting attention due to its satirical nature and high-risk profile. However, the sudden exit of a large portion of capital indicates that investors may have grown wary of the token‚Äôs volatility, especially with the overall market sentiment turning negative for the day. Other tokens that saw outflows were FDUSD, which had $133K depart, PRCL with $67K leaving, and SSE, which lost $56K. These tokens, while not suffering the dire straits that FARTCOIN found itself in, nonetheless had us seeing a trend of investor caution in the current market environment. Market Sentiment: Caution in the Memecoin Space The net total cash outflow of $221K overall, with much larger outflows compared to inflows, speaks to a market sentiment of caution and perhaps of profit-taking. Investors appear to be much more selective with their capital, moving away from tokens that seem like they might be underperforming or are showing volatility. And this is likely a natural response to the fluctuations and inherent risks of the memecoin sector. The substantial outflows from tokens such as FARTCOIN and FDUSD might demonstrate investors‚Äô willingness to take risks, particularly in a market that‚Äôs been more volatile of late. Memecoin investors typically behave in a way that demonstrates the old stock market adage: when you see one, two, or three tokens behaving in such a way, you can bet that a substantial re-evaluation of many speculative positions is underway. Although certain tokens experienced inflows of capital, the overall net movement paints a broader picture of investors being cautious. This could be due to the overall global financial trends we‚Äôre seeing or perhaps due to the extremely volatile nature of the memecoin sector, where price swings are significant and just as often unpredictable. Looking Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for Memecoins? Even as the memecoin market keeps changing, it is clear that the way investors feel about it plays a big part in deciding where money goes. Today‚Äôs data from March 20, 2025, shows that even though there are still chances for certain tokens to see money come in, the overall trend seems to be toward taking it easy and making sure risks are under control. For investors, the need to monitor the overall market climate and sentiment changes in the memecoin sector is paramount. Even though some tokens may signal potential growth, remembering the extreme volatility associated with memecoins is critical. The memecoin marketplace can undergo swift surges and downturns, and having a clear plan for what to do in either instance can mean the difference between a successful navigation and a wipeout. To conclude, the memecoin market on March 20, 2025, experienced greater outflows than inflows. This signals that the smart money is adopting a cautious approach toward this relatively risky sector of the cryptocurrency market. While there was some interest in the memecoins, which was reflected in the greater inflow figures for some other tokens, like TRX, MNDE, and JUP, the memecoin market itself was not attracting much new capital. This shows a general air of risk aversion when it comes to investing in new and emerging cryptocurrency projects. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ‚Äôs price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market‚Äôs effects plummeted the coin‚Äôs price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, ‚ÄúCan the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?‚Äù or at least, ‚ÄúWill Tezos survive?‚Äù Let‚Äôs get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.693 Market cap $718,330,183.35 Trading volume $17,274,477.01 Circulating supply 1,035,783,913.99 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.6791 24-hour high $0.7024 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.60% 50-day SMA $0.8256 14-Day RSI 42.60 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 31 (Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $0.968 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ break the $0.70 barrier? TL;DR Breakdown XTZ has gained 1.02% in the last 24 hours. The coin‚Äôs immediate support is at $0.679. XTZ‚Äôs resistance is around $0.708. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ moves up to $0.692 The daily price analysis of Tezos (XTZ) on March 22, 2025, shows a slight positive move in the last trading hours. XTZ is currently trading at $0.692, up 1.02%. The price is below the 20-day SMA of $0.711, indicating a short-term bearish trend. XTZ moves up to $0.692 XTZ‚Äôs immediate support stands at $0.680, with a potential downside towards $0.640. The MACD shows a slight recovery, with green bars emerging though flat, indicating potential for upward momentum. The RSI is at 39.34, approaching oversold conditions. This suggests buying opportunities and the potential for an upside reversal if buying pressure increases. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ shows a slight pullback The 4-hour price analysis of Tezos (XTZ) shows a slight pullback towards the middle Bollinger Band at $0.679, which acts as immediate support. The CMF at -0.03 indicates that selling pressure is slightly stronger than buying pressure, which suggests a mild bearish sentiment. XTZ shows a slight pullback The MFI at 30.03 suggests a mild cash outflow, which supports the possibility of a short-term pullback towards $0.679. If buyers manage to push XTZ above $0.70, the price may move towards higher resistance levels, including the upper Bollinger Band at $0.737. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9120 SELL SMA 5 $0.8311 SELL SMA 10 $0.7916 SELL SMA 21 $0.7657 SELL SMA 50 $0.8256 SELL SMA 100 $1.0581 SELL SMA 200 $0.9685 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7661 SELL EMA 5 $0.8365 SELL EMA 10 $0.9747 SELL EMA 21 $1.1276 SELL EMA 50 $1.2087 SELL EMA 100 $1.1300 SELL EMA 200 $1.0211 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is consolidating near $0.692 with support at $0.679. A mild cash outflow (MFI 30.03) suggests a short-term pullback, but a break above $0.70 could push the price toward $0.737. The CMF at -0.03 indicates slight bearish pressure, so watch for price action around $0.679 for potential upside or further downside. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs ‚Äì so there are utilities that can keep the coin‚Äôs price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after bouncing off support at $0.6791, a move spurred by a slight capital inflow. The coin is now trading at around $0.691. XTZ 7-day price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

The project announced an important partnership in the past 24 hours ‚Äì can it stop the substantial correction that pushed its price below $1? Recall that the controversial project, which was in development for approximately half a decade, finally released its Open Network on February 20, which also saw the launch of the PI token. The asset went from almost $2 to under $0.7 within hours before it exploded to a new all-time high of $3 just days later on the hype of many crypto exchanges listing it. However, the controversy continued as the CEO of Bybit said his exchange wouldn‚Äôt list it as he considers it a scam, while Binance has yet to add it to its platform, although the community voted highly in favor. PI started to nosedive, and the past seven days have been particularly painful.

In a series of recent posts published on X , McGlone invoked the years 1929 and 1999‚Äîthe notorious eras of the stock market crash and the dot-com bubble‚Äîto underscore the risks of speculative ‚Äúsilliness‚Äù in digital assets. Dogecoin Mirrors 1929-Style Risk He singled out Dogecoin in particular, emphasizing its vulnerability to a potential market reversion, while also pointing to gold as a beneficiary if risk appetite continues to deteriorate. ‚ÄúDogecoin, 1929, 1999 Risk-Asset Silliness and Gold ‚Äì The ratio of gold ounces equal to Bitcoin trading almost tick-for-tick with Dogecoin may show the risks of reversion in highly speculative digital assets, with deflationary implications underpinning the metal,‚Äù he wrote. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Could Skyrocket 16% Any Moment The chart below shows how closely the meme-inspired cryptocurrency‚Äôs market cap has mirrored the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio. The tracking of these two metrics suggests that whenever the relative value of Bitcoin to gold experiences a shift, Dogecoin‚Äôs trajectory pivoted sharply, exposing it to the same market forces that have historically challenged highly speculative assets. McGlone‚Äôs broader thesis does not end with Dogecoin. In another post, he turned attention to the notion of gold reaching $4,000 per ounce, linking such a possibility to dynamics in the bond market and to potential declines across risk-on sectors, including cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúWhat Gets Gold to $4,000? 2% T-Bonds? Melting Cryptos May Guide ‚Äì A path toward $4,000 an ounce for #gold could require something that‚Äôs typically a matter of time: reversion in silly-expensive risk assets, notably cryptocurrencies,‚Äù he stated. He underscored that if the US stock market were to remain under pressure, bond yields might eventually be pulled lower by the comparatively meager 2% or lower yields seen in China and Japan. Such a scenario, in McGlone‚Äôs view, adds tailwinds for gold because a shift from relatively high-yielding Treasuries to lower-yielding government bonds abroad could drive investors toward alternative havens. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin And Altcoins‚Äô Next Surge ‚Äì Here‚Äôs The Timeline The chart shared by McGlone reinforces his analysis of decelerating demand for risk assets. One visual, titled ‚ÄúElevated US Stocks, Bond Yields vs. China, Japan,‚Äù displays the persistent divergence between US Treasury yields, which hover around the 4.19% mark, and the comparatively subdued rates of Chinese and Japanese government bonds, situated closer to 2% and 1.51% respectively. The graphic also portrays the S&P 500‚Äôs market cap-to-GDP ratio, which remains historically high despite recent volatility. McGlone‚Äôs conclusion is that continued pressure on equity markets, combined with global bond rates that sit well below US yields, could accelerate a rotation into gold if investors perceive a downturn in ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù asset classes, including risk assets like Dogecoin. A third post addressed the broader altcoin market, with McGlone pointing to Ethereum as a leading indicator of whether the overall trend has turned bearish for digital assets. ‚ÄúHas the Trend Turned Down? Ethereum May Guide ‚Äì Ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency, is breaking down, with deflationary implications and gold underpinnings,‚Äù he noted. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.16663.

This event is particularly critical, given that the expiration of so many options contracts usually brings about heightened market activity and more pronounced price movements. We need to take a close look at the upcoming expiration. What can the main metrics tell us about likely market outcomes? Breakdown of the $BTC and $ETH Options Expiry Bitcoin Options Expiry: $1.83 Billion in Notional Value at Stake. The expiry of Bitcoin options is very significant indeed, with no fewer than 22,000 BTC options contracts set to expire. The notional value of these contracts combined is something like 1.83 billion dollars, which gives us a sense of the kind of impact that could have on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. At present, the put/call ratio sits at 0.84. This indicates that there are more bullish players in the Bitcoin options market, with a slight edge in favor of call options over put options. Call option traders are banking on an upward price move for Bitcoin, while put option traders are prepping for a possible downward price move. Massive options expiry incoming! 22,000 $BTC options are set to expire: ‚Äì Put/Call Ratio: 0.84 ‚Äì Max Pain Price: $85,000 ‚Äì Notional Value: $1.83 billion 133,000 $ETH options are expiring: ‚Äì Put/Call Ratio: 0.62 ‚Äì Max Pain Price: $2,000 ‚Äì Notional Value: $260 million Expect‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/oRQK3s9wie ‚Äî Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 21, 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs projected max pain price is $85,000. This price point indicates the price at which options sellers take the maximum financial hit. To put it another way, the max pain price is where the most options contracts are out of the money. It could serve as a critical pivot point and possible inflection point for BTC price action as we approach options expiry. Because of the high notional value, the expiration of these options could cause volatility in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Speculators and institutional traders may adjust their positions in the aftermath of this event. Ethereum Options Expiry: A $260 Million Impact A hefty Ethereum options expiry is coming, with 133,000 ETH options contracts slated to lapse. While it isn‚Äôt anywhere near the Bitcoin expiry for notional value‚Äîabout $260 million and counting‚Äîthat influences capital flows, it still is a big enough deal for ETH to matter. Ethereum‚Äôs put/call ratio is 0.62. This means that the sentiment is somewhat bullish for Ethereum. There are more call options outstanding than put options, which indicates that if traders are making bets that are influenced by their expectations, then they expect Ethereum‚Äôs price to move up in the near term and to move up in a way that more directly impacts its own price rather than in a way that primarily impacts Bitcoin‚Äôs price. However, this much open interest means traders must be expecting a big move of some kind, and if the move goes the other way, then the outlook could change in an instant. Ethereum may have a max pain price too‚Äîthat is, a price where held options become most worthless‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt seem to find it. So if options held against the ETH marketplace don‚Äôt help us forecast anything, what are they good for? Why are institutional traders even dealing in this relatively thin market anyway? Given that ETH is a supposed security, can these traders be doing anything legal? The thinness argument is especially worrisome. The Market Impact: Expect Volatility A total of $1.83 billion in Bitcoin options and $260 million in Ethereum options set to expire makes for a clear‚Äîand rather ominous‚Äînew scenario for crypto traders. This much open interest in a market we‚Äôre already seeing movement in means new opportunity. But it also means heightened volatility and risk. Traders need to be especially cognizant of what these steep price movements could do to their P&Ls (profit and losses). And with these looming expirations, it‚Äôs not just retail traders who are on the edge of their seats; institutional traders have quite a bit of open interest to manage as well. Substantial price fluctuations are expected in the market as traders adjust their portfolios in anticipation of the expiry date. Historically, these events have been accompanied by short-term volatility, as the event can trigger both profit-taking and the liquidation of positions. What to Expect from the Crypto Market Potential price action is on the way as the expiry date approaches, and traders and investors need to be ready. They should watch for possible volatility in and around what some price analysts are calling the ‚Äúmax pain‚Äù point for options traders to be at either $28,000 or $24,000 for Bitcoin. In any case, options expiry for top crypto assets can lead to a wide range of outcomes depending on how traders and institutions behave in the days just before the big event. Considering the size of the positions involved, market players ought to be on red alert in the coming days. If you are looking to capitalize on the kind of price movement that could occur, a careful analysis of the actual price action around the time of expiry will be of the utmost importance. Of course, you could take the opposite approach‚Äîif you are not looking to make any significant trades‚Äîthat is, you could wait for the dust to settle in the wake of the expiry before making any significant trading decisions. Final Thoughts The expiration of a large number of options contracts for Bitcoin and Ethereum is set to bring (heightened) volatility to the crypto markets. With over $2 billion in notional value at stake, traders are likely to react in (significant) ways to any price movements leading up to the event. With two max pain prices at critical levels for (both) Bitcoin and Ethereum, could this event serve as a (turning point) for short-term market trends? When the countdown reaches zero, spectators will know for sure whether the United States is the same kind of investment as the next ripe apples and oranges lower down the street‚Äîor a much sweeter deal in the end. Maybe that‚Äôs the only thing anyone can say for certain about how the last fruit will fall. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that two indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are signaling that Bitcoin is primed for more upside after a period of sideways trading. The RSI indicator is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions. The MACD is used to analyze price trends and momentum direction in a bid to identify points to enter or exit positions. ‚ÄúThe MACD on the weekly is showing that the bears are losing momentum and we‚Äôre holding that RSI support on the weekly. Well, I‚Äôm going to be looking for general sideways price action. Could be higher highs, lower lows. But ultimately sideways before a recovery back to new all-time highs. Yes, I‚Äôll say it. I guess I‚Äôll be the only one to say it‚Ä¶ that I‚Äôm still expecting new all-time highs in this cycle. Nothing‚Äôs changed in that perspective.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Svenson, however, says that even though Bitcoin is showing signs of bottoming out, the crypto king is ‚Äúnot totally out of the woods just yet‚Äù and could head lower before rallying. ‚ÄúThere is a possibility that at some point the market does a final flush before actually recovering. I mean, Bitcoin plays out that type of wacky price action all the time‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶if we were to play out kind of like a final flush into a slightly lower low, this scenario wouldn‚Äôt surprise me ‚Äì testing down to the low $70,000s one more time first, going into the $90,000 range first and then flushing before a full recovery.‚Äù Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $83,586 at time of writing. ?

Individual Miner Hits The Jackpot An unknown miner on Friday snared a $266,000 reward for solving block 888,737. Data from Bitcoin block explorer mempool. space shows that that bounty includes the current 3.125 Bitcoin mining reward and another 0.032 BTC from transaction fees. Today‚Äôs Bitcoin price is around $84,200 per coin, which adds up to a payday of around $266,000. Bitcoin miners process transactions and keep the Bitcoin network secure. They input computational power to solve a new block roughly every 10 minutes by competing against the whole Bitcoin network hash rate. When blocks are processed, miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins. Over the years, Mining Bitcoin has gradually become harder and more energy-intensive, requiring more resources. And miners now receive less BTC as a reward for their troubles. In April 2024, the Bitcoin protocol‚Äôs quadrennial halving event took place, reducing miner rewards to 3.125 BTC from 6.25. Most Bitcoin is mined by large mining firms such as Bit Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital, each commanding enormous amounts of hash power through their massive industrial operations. But occasionally, a solo miner can get lucky and mine a block using a home hobby machine ‚Äî though it‚Äôs extremely rare. Per blockchain data, the miner in Friday‚Äôs case used a low-cost DIY FutureBit Apollo machine.

Key metrics like futures open interest and on-chain liquidity show that investors are moving toward a risk-off approach. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high, futures open interest has dropped significantly‚Äîfrom $57 billion to $37 billion‚Äîfor a 35% decrease. This decline in open interest signals a much more subdued market. It‚Äôs one where traders and investors are acting with more restraint, paring back a formerly bigger presence in the crypto space. In futures open interest, we see the same contraction that seems to be a part of the recent trend of the crypto space. Futures open interest has dropped from $57B to $37B (-35%) since #Bitcoin ‚Äôs ATH, signaling reduced speculation and hedging activity. This decline mirrors the contraction seen in on-chain liquidity, pointing to broader risk-off behavior. pic.twitter.com/XPbXiHXlRS ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) March 20, 2025 That overall crypto trend? Decreasing liquidity. Everybody‚Äôs very careful right now, and it seems like liquidity in the open futures market is being reduced almost as much as the open interest itself. And you better believe that if we‚Äôre seeing a contraction right now in the open futures market for Bitcoin, then that‚Äôs likely going to have some kind of effect on the price of Bitcoin in the near future. A Shift in Speculation: The Decline in Futures Open Interest One of the clearest signs that market sentiment is changing is the drop in futures open interest. Futures open interest shows us the total number of contracts that are still in play, and when we look in on it these days, it doesn‚Äôt look so healthy. There‚Äôs now about $37 billion in open interest, down from about $57 billion not so long ago (and with it, an attendant level of speculation and hedging). You might reasonably ask: What‚Äôs going on? And we might reasonably answer: We don‚Äôt know. A 35% drop from Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high (ATH) shows that a lot of traders have been pulling back on their leverage. Since futures contracts allow you to take much larger positions and bet on price moves either way, even with borrowed money, a drop in open interest could mean we‚Äôre not betting on significant price moves as much as we were. Meanwhile, the falling futures open interest also reflects the decline in on-chain liquidity. A contraction of this kind means that the market is not as liquid as it used to be, and that presents the appearance of riskier assets. That is because less liquidity equals more volatility, and when we are on the edge of a market breakdown, it makes sense for traders and investors to go for the appearance of cash or less risky assets. Cash-and-Carry Trade Unwinding: ETF Outflows and CME Futures Closures One of the factors contributing to the decline in futures open interest is the unwinding of the cash-and-carry trade. This strategy, which was used by institutional investors, involved buying Bitcoin in the spot market while selling futures contracts. It was a way to hedge and also a way to generate returns from the difference between the spot and futures prices. But now that the bullish sentiment is not what it was, the long-side bias that fueled the cash-and-carry trade has also not been what it was, and so this trade is happening less. Alongside the unwinding of cash-and-carry trades, ETF outflows, and CME futures closures, a notable trend has emerged: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are losing assets. Viewed as the next-best entry point into crypto for institutional investors after futures contracts, ETFs have shed $1.2B since March 31. That‚Äôs not quite a death knell, but it could get a wee bit noisier before it gets better. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, ETF outflows are way more significant than their shedding assets might imply (I‚Äôll explain more below). Nevertheless, this marks a shift in investor positioning. Selling pressure in the spot markets is compounded by closures of futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The CME is one of the largest exchanges for Bitcoin futures, and when it closes down futures contracts‚Äîespecially on a day when the exchange is otherwise closed for trading, as it was on Monday in November 3, 2021‚Äîthis can signal a further retreat of institutional players from the Bitcoin space. When futures contracts are closed, traders may need to liquidate positions to match the closure of the futures contracts, which means there‚Äôs more pressure on the underlying asset to move lower. This overall dynamic was happening alongside a drop in open interest in Bitcoin. Open interest was down about 15 percent on the week, and when that number drops, it can also lead to a downwards price move in the spot market. Volatility Ahead: What This Means for the Crypto Market A sentiment shift in the crypto market may be underway. This is suggested by the combination of falling futures open interest, ETF outflows, and the closure of futures at the CME. Traders look to the futures market when they have directional trades they want to put on. Falling open interest therefore suggests that either traders aren‚Äôt using the market anymore or that they‚Äôve started to close up their positions and are moving in the other direction. Futures market traders tend to be speculators. And as these folks unwind futures trades and hedge against downside price risks in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptos, they‚Äôve been tightening up the whole crypto market by reducing liquidity. In the short term, this could lead to a surge in volatility as the unwinding of leveraged positions generates sudden price changes. Furthermore, the drop in futures open interest and the outflows from ETFs could produce a market climate in which institutional investors are less involved, rendering the market more responsive to the kind of price changes that retail traders and algorithmic trading send it. For long-term investors, the present market mechanics may offer both chances and difficulties. On the one hand, the decline in futures open interest suggests that we are seeing less of the kind of frivolous buying and selling that characterizes a speculative market. On the other hand, that same decline may also indicate that we are entering a phase in which the market as a whole is more locked up and isn‚Äôt doing much. If that‚Äôs the case, we could be in for a rather boring market until speculative forces start to push things around again. The cash-and-carry trades that are now unwinding‚Äîand the not-so-secret reduction in institutional participation‚Äîmay suggest that the real lack of activity in the crypto space is beginning to affect market makers. Market makers and other larger entities seem unsure about the near-term future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In any event, investors would be wise to keep a close watch on both the goings-on in the crypto space and the trading conditions in the markets at large. Conclusion: Risk-Off Sentiment Dominates The most recent decline in the open interest of crypto futures, together with many other indicators of reduced speculative activity in this market, is pointing to an evolving risk-off sentiment. This is what a retreat by speculative positions can look like. It isn‚Äôt just a reduction in open interest that is making the futures market look less‚Ä¶ While the market deals with these changes, investors will need to stay alert and ready for possible price movements. The tightening liquidity and the repositioning of institutions in crypto suggest that the market could be more uncertain for the next few months. Once this period of volatility passes, however, we could well see new opportunities for those investors who have the patience to wait and the persistence to find their way amid the evolving landscape.

This is a very healthy increase from the initial offering size of $500 million, which later grew to $722.5 million, thanks to investor demand. The stock is expected to commence trading‚Äîan event some see as highly anticipated‚Äîon March 25, 2025. Increased Offering Size Reflects Strong Demand The decision to increase the size of the offering was based on overwhelming investor interest and possible increased demand. This prompted the company to revise the size of the Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock issuance from the initially stated target of $500 million to a final amount of $722.5 million. This move seems to indicate strong investor confidence in the company and, particularly, in the very stable Perpetual Preferred Stock. Strategy announces pricing of its Strife Perpetual Preferred Stock ($STRF) Offering and upsizes the deal from $500M to $722.5M $MSTR https://t.co/GJVCRwIQ0Y ‚Äî Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 21, 2025 Every share of Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock will be priced at $85.00, with the company planning to issue a total of 8.5 million shares. The offering is expected to close on March 25, 2025, pending customary closing conditions. A purchase in this offering gives the right to receive a fixed dividend rate of 10.00% annually, which is paid in regular intervals on a quarterly basis. This fresh offering is part of the Strategy‚Äôs broader push to build up its capital base in order to fund any number of strategic initiatives. Notably, the company has said it will direct the proceeds toward general corporate purposes, which include buying more bitcoin and maintaining continuity on the strategic assets it has already acquired, of which more than $2 billion worth is in the form of bitcoin at this point. A Strategic Move in the Digital Asset Space By acquiring bitcoin, the company shows that it is serious about stepping up its presence in the vastly expanding market for digital assets. Meanwhile, of course, bitcoin itself is becoming more popular as a store of value and an inflation hedge‚Äîoptions that rising numbers of both retail and institutional investors see as very attractive. Despite recent ups and downs, the digital currency has proven its resilience. Increasing adoption of bitcoin by institutions, not to mention the enthusiasm of retail investors, makes it seem an even likelier bet for the future. By offering Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, Strategy is not just raising capital; it is also appealing to an expanding investor profile that favors high-yielding, stable income-producing investment opportunities. The 10.00% dividend attached to the preferred stock is expected to allure yield-hungry investors who are hunting for something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat can give them reliable returns; and Alternative #1 would fit that bill quite nicely. Alongside its digital asset strategy, the money secured will bolster the firm‚Äôs ongoing working capital, a life-sustaining elixir that, in this case, enables not just operational flexibility, but also the preservation of an average 2.5-year runway before the next financing event in which the firm has to get its act together to avoid an in-question pathway toward profitability. A diversified approach toward capital allocation is one sign of long-term success in both traditional and emergent digital currency markets. Financial Details and Expected Use of Proceeds Strategy estimates that it will net approximately $711.2 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. This hefty amount will be applied to general corporate uses as previously specified. These uses include the purchase of bitcoin and other activities that beef up working capital: 1. Buying bitcoin. 2. Non-bitcoin-related working capital uses. 3. More buying of bitcoin. Issuing perpetual preferred stock is a strategic move by the company, enabling it to raise funds without resorting to traditional debt. That kind of debt often comes with strict covenants and repayment terms. The preferreds have no maturity date; the company pays dividends on them as long as it sees fit. From the standpoint of the capital structure, this is pay-as-you-go financing. It enables the company to maintain greater flexibility and financing, for instance, usually allows for the deductibility of interest payments but not for dividend payments. And preferred stock typically doesn‚Äôt have a fixed call date. The offering is well-timed to coincide with a swelling of investor interest in alternative assets, among which digital currencies are numbered. This positions Strategy to capitalize on present market conditions. Its ability to tap into the capital markets while also securing a stable and long-term funding source bodes well for the company‚Äôs growth profile. Conclusion The upcoming issuance and successful pricing of Strategy‚Äôs Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock mark a significant step forward for the company. They are following planned and not unexpected steps that any finance-savvy company would pursue if it wanted to raise funds visibly and at manageable costs. SEC registration. Check. Prospectus filed.

The breach, detected by the Cyber Alert System, appears to have resulted from a compromise of the protocol‚Äôs deployer wallet, which, in turn, was responsible for a very suspicious transaction that involved a total of $8.4 million worth of assets. Zoth users and the platform itself are under the microscope as investigations seek to determine the breach‚Äôs origins and scope. ALERTOur system has detected a suspicious transaction involving @zothdotio . It appears that the protocol's deployer wallet has been compromised. 30 minutes ago, the proxy contract ""USD0PPSubVaultUpgradeable"" was upgraded to a contract created by a suspicious address. The‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/3OHmvJYpR5 ‚Äî Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) March 21, 2025 Attack Details: Deployer Wallet Compromised and Funds Stolen The attack began half an hour ago when the proxy contract called ‚ÄúUSD0PPSubVaultUpgradeable‚Äù was upgraded to a contract associated with a dubious address. The upgrade was reportedly executed through a deployer wallet that had been compromised, letting the attacker assume control over the contract and all its functions. After the contract upgrade, a hacker quickly made off with 8.4 million USD0++ tokens. Minutes later, the stolen assets were turned into a stablecoin known as $DAI, which is pegged to the US dollar, and transferred to a different address, making the stolen funds tough to trace. The assets were moved and converted at such a speed that it indicates a sophisticated level of planning and execution by the attacker, possible exploitation of vulnerabilities within the contract, or the platform‚Äôs security protocols. The attacker‚Äôs immediate actions post-asset theft suggest that the assets may be laundered or used for other illicit purposes. Zoth Platform Takes Immediate Action, Site Goes Into Maintenance Mode The Zoth platform has gone into maintenance mode in response to the attack, likely to prevent additional unauthorized access and to allow for a full and unfettered investigation. The website‚Äôs temporary partial shutdown reflects an attempt to limit the damages and forestall any further breach. How long the maintenance mode will last is still unclear, though there are plenty of concerns about the timeline to consider and the potential recovery ofus without worrying about indentations. The breach has set off alarm bells, especially since Zoth is famed for principle-based DeFi services that are safe, secure, and decentralized. If an attacker could make off with a pot this big, how good can even the safest, most secure DeFi platforms be at protecting user assets? At first glance, the way the attacker did it seems to point fingers at the platform‚Äôs core infrastructure or governance model. Something looks awfully vulnerable if the bad guys can come through that way. What We Know So Far Currently, the breach‚Äôs total impact is unknown. Zoth hasn‚Äôt put out any detailed information about how the deployer‚Äôs wallet was compromised. It‚Äôs probable, though, that the company‚Äôs working with blockchain forensics firms and cybersecurity experts to track down the stolen funds and identify the attacker. There has been no official word as to whether or not the $8.4 million in USD0++ tokens will be returned to the affected users, or if Zoth will be able to make the address to which the funds were transferred spit them back out. In the nature of DeFi, which moves appropriate amounts of money very quickly, it is not clear if Zoth‚Äôs team will be able to track the lost tokens at all, much less before they have been laundered. The Zoth community is extremely vigilant as the investigation takes its course. They are telling us to keep an eye on our accounts like never before, and to take every precaution we can to safeguard our real-world assets. At the time of this writing, there is no overarching recovery plan that has been shared with us, but the platform being in maintenance mode for this long certainly suggests the team is being very thorough in their attempts to address whatever problems have cropped up. DeFi Security: A Growing Concern This reality reminds us in no uncertain terms of the decentralized platform security risks that exist when we handle large amounts of digital assets. The DeFi ecosystem has grown explosively, but that has only been accompanied by a rising tide of security threats. And the latest example makes clear the worst-case scenario for our vulnerable little corner of the blockchain. Smart contracts govern transactions and manage funds in DeFi platforms like Zoth. These contracts are meant to be tamper-proof, but they have weaknesses that hackers are increasingly good at exploiting. When they find a weakness, they attempt to gain access to the platform wallets and take funds. This last attack is an example of that practice. An increasing number of hacks and breaches associated with DeFi platforms has caused many to question just how secure this ecosystem is and to call for risk management enhancements. Auditing, for some, is the magic bullet. Many experts believe that if you hit a smart contract with enough audit power, it will no longer be vulnerable to hacks. Yet even the best audits can‚Äôt ensure that a smart contract is immune to attacks. Added protections, then, have to come from somewhere else. Conclusion The Zoth breach has sent shockwaves through the DeFi space. Not only was a crazy amount of money stolen right under our noses, but it was also taken in such a way that, if it were a movie, we‚Äôd probably call the low-life behind it an ‚Äúantihero.‚Äù Sure, investigations are ongoing, but unless we‚Äôre going to cut up the action like an episode of CSI, let‚Äôs be honest here: this incident puts a huge spotlight on how badly we seem to need improved security practices in DeFi.

The price has fluctuated between an intraday high of $2.42 and a low of $2.36. As the market tests key resistance and support levels, the next move could set the tone for XRP‚Äôs short-term trend. Buyers Challenge Key Resistance XRP recently broke above a downtrend line on the 30-minute chart, signaling potential bullish momentum. Now, buyers are pushing toward the $2.42 resistance level. A successful breakout could trigger further gains, with $2.59 as the next target. If momentum remains strong, XRP could climb to $2.71, and in an extended rally, buyers may even aim for the psychological $3.00 mark before any correction occurs. Bears Eye a Potential Reversal If buyers fail to push past $2.42, sellers may step in, pulling the price back to the $2.35 support level, which aligns with the 1-hour uptrend line. A breakdown here could lead to a drop toward $2.20, with further downside risk to the $2.00‚Äì$1.80 zone. A sustained move below this range would confirm a shift into a broader downtrend, potentially triggering larger losses for traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support Zones Hold the Key For XRP to sustain its uptrend , buyers must protect critical support levels. Holding above $2.35 is essential to maintain bullish momentum. A strong defense of this level could set the stage for another attempt to break resistance, while failure could allow sellers to take control. Make-or-Break Moment for XRP XRP is at a decisive point, with buyers and sellers battling for control. A breakout above $2.42 could ignite a rally, while losing key support could lead to a significant decline. Traders should watch these levels closely as the market chooses its direction.

42138964,https://nulltx.com/?p=147296,1742627701,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Shifts Toward Emerging Trends: AI, Privacy, and Meme Coins Leading the Way",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-shifts-toward-emerging-trends-ai-privacy-and-meme-coins-leading-the-way/,"In the last 24 hours, the kinds of wallets that are known to hold ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù have been making impressive moves. They‚Äôve been focusing on a number of emerging trends in the crypto space, from integration of AI and blockchain to the next big thing in meme coins. Our latest daily report shines the spotlight on these kinds of crypto asset accumulations‚Äîones that are occurring at a moment when the overall market direction is very much in question. As such, they hint at the narratives that increasingly have the crypto community‚Äôs attention. Key Investment Themes Emerging Among Smart Money Wallets In the past day, 15 shrewd money wallets have been spotted accruing tokens linked to AI and blockchain integration, which indicates a pronounced taste for projects harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) in the decentralized domain. Of note, a handful of these investors, just 4 wallets to be exact, have taken a special interest in ventures that are all about ramping up user privacy and security. The meme coin scene is also very much part of the sustenance portfolio of these 15 wallets, seeing as 3 of them have plowed a fair bit of cash into that seemingly anodyne sector lately. Why? Well, it‚Äôs not exactly secure knowledge, but recent AI-driven meme meta seems to be powering that particular vehicle. AI and Blockchain Integration Take Center Stage The integration of AI and blockchain has become a leading narrative for smart money wallets. One of the main tokens in this thematic space is $NOODS, associated with the project PotNoodleDev. Smart money has taken notice of this token, with 11 wallets accumulating over $49,000 worth of $NOODS, and pushing its market cap up to a respectable level of $2.77 million. What isn‚Äôt thus far part of the public story is PotNoodleDev‚Äôs positioning, which is becoming ever more common among Web3 projects, as an AI agent that is capable of handling tasks just like (or in some cases, better than) humans, but with the added advantage of being able to perform such tasks at scale. PotNoodleDev is a leading project in the space of AI-powered blockchain platforms. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI & Blockchain Integration (15 wallets) Privacy & Security (4 wallets) AI-driven Content Creation (2 wallets) MEME (3 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/JNoC9KYovL ‚Äî CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 21, 2025 An AI-focused project that has gathered notice is $RAI, a token tied to Reploy, an infrastructure play for AI. Backed by Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) who are prominent in the space, Reploy interest from two savvy investors, who together purchased $18,000 worth of $RAI. The project has a market cap of $10.8 million but appears to be a great potential piece of the AI infrastructure framework. Interest in the AI infrastructure play is intensifying; Reploy‚Äôs emphasis on building strong, scalable systems for AI applications makes it a compelling long-term investment opportunity. Privacy and Security: A Growing Concern In the area of privacy, the $ESIM token linked to EncryptSIM has caught the attention of two smart money wallets that have bought $14,000 worth of the token. EncryptSIM is a privacy-first eSIM solution that provides eSIMs without requiring KYC. As the cryptocurrency space moves more and more towards a model in which pseudonymity is the primary form of privacy, EncryptSIM‚Äôs model allows individuals to participate in an increasingly digital, mobile economy without compromising their personal, sensitive information. With a market cap of only $1.06 million, EncryptSIM is not an obvious juggernaut, but the project positions itself as one that could capitalize on developments favoring the increasingly privacy-centric digital economy. AI-driven Content Creation Gaining Traction In the sphere of content creation driven by artificial intelligence, Tell A Tale (TAT) is making a splash as the first-ever virtual AI agent made for producing short videos. In the last 24 hours, two smart money accounts have purchased $11,000 worth of TAT, which has pushed the token‚Äôs market cap to $12.27 million. With the near-constant rise in the popularity of ‚Äúvideo-first‚Äù platforms, projects like Tell A Tale show quite a bit of promise within the segment. Offerings from these projects stand to be at the head of the virtual video revolution, right alongside the half-dozen other omnipresent video-first platforms. Meme Coins: Riding the AI Wave Meme coins hold a special place in the market. They tap into the broader cultural trends that can attract a lot of money very quickly. $Fartcoin, for example, is right on the cutting edge of pop culture. Three very smart crypto investors have acquired a considerable amount of it‚Äîabout $349,000 worth, to be exact. Meme coins aren‚Äôt serious; they‚Äôre largely jokes, but their value can fluctuate a lot, depending on the cultural moment. The reason $Fartcoin can command the attention of these investors is simple: it‚Äôs meme culture crossed with AI, which is the AI gold rush of right now. Conclusion: Strategic Accumulations Point to the Future of Crypto The recent activity of smart money wallets underscores several important trends that are shaping the future of the cryptocurrency market. We have found that AI integration with blockchain, privacy-focused solutions, and meme coins, among other things, are driving a growing interest from investors. It is these tokens that have become the focal point of the investor attention that is driving the growth opportunity of the future. The accumulation by smart money highlights these areas as a strategic shift toward tokens that are innovative in addressing what is becoming the new normal for consumer and investor demands. These projects are not going away; they‚Äôre too well-funded and too important to the crypto ecosystem, too much a part of the next big thing, to fade from view. As they push ahead, we can expect the following in the next few weeks: Movement in the market. Obviously, when humans interact with an unsaturated market, movement is inevitable. But what we have here is an interacting unsaturated market at a level of key performance indicators for key narratives that these two projects aim to hit. And hit ‚Äôem they may.

The participants included John Reed Stark, former SEC official, Miles Jennings from Andreessen Horowitz, and ex-SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes. The task force is focused on creating rules and guidance for the crypto industry. Mixed Opinions Over Crypto Rules The task force discussed whether crypto tokens should have their own set of rules, separate from how the SEC handles stocks. Jennings suggested the SEC should be ‚Äútechnology-neutral‚Äù and treat systems like Ethereum differently from owning stock in Apple. Some, including SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, worried that giving crypto its own rules could weaken regulations and let digital assets avoid stricter oversight. John Reed Opposes Changes In Exisiting Rules John Reed Stark, former director of the SEC‚Äôs Office of Internet Enforcement, opposed changes to regulations at the first SEC crypto roundtable. He argued that the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934 should remain unchanged to cover digital assets, emphasizing that they should still be classified as securities under existing laws. Stark emphasized that Crypto buyers aren‚Äôt collectors, they‚Äôre investors, and the SEC‚Äôs mission is to protect those investors. ‚ÄúThe volume of case law has developed so quickly because of all these crypto firms. They went for this sort of delay, delay, delay, idea, and they hired the best law firms in the world, and these law firms all fought the SEC with incredible briefs,‚Äù he added. Stark‚Äôs Views Face Strong Criticism Stark argued that he had thoroughly reviewed the crypto-related cases and believes that they mostly lost. He also stated that he doesn‚Äôt see anything particularly innovative about digital assets compared to earlier technological advancements, like the launch of the iPhone. In February 2024, John Reed Stark criticized a sponsorship deal between the Dallas Mavericks and crypto firm Voyager, comparing it to partnering with a ‚Äúheroin manufacturer.‚Äù He argued that cryptocurrency should follow existing laws, rather than adapting the law to fit digital assets. Stark‚Äôs views have been strongly criticized, with Mark Cuban calling it ‚Äúcrypto derangement syndrome.‚Äù",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-22 07:17:09

This trend marks a pivotal moment for the two flagship cryptocurrencies, as their movement is supposedly indicative of a new phase in investor behavior and sentiment. In what is supposed to be leading us into 2024, recent downturns aside, the crypto space in general and Bitcoin‚Äôs grail-like prospects in particular seem less and less affected by the naysayers who keep saying this space is living on borrowed time. For the first time since 2023, #Bitcoin $BTC and #Ethereum $ETH show negative net position changes, totaling -$3 billion over the last three days. pic.twitter.com/XOO7x01Opd ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) March 21, 2025 Bitcoin Sentiment Takes a Negative Turn In the past week, there has been a significant drop in the on-exchange balance of Bitcoin. Around 10,000 BTC have been moved off of exchanges. This is one of the signs‚ÄîI would certainly consider it a major sign‚Äîof growing investor confidence. It seems our long-term holder base keeps on increasing as more and more SATs are taken off exchanges and stowed away for safekeeping. Around 10,000 #Bitcoin $BTC were moved off exchanges this week! Often a sign of growing investor confidence and long-term holding behavior. pic.twitter.com/8pH3uuVART ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) March 21, 2025 But even as this sign was coming to light, or perhaps because this sign was coming to light, the vibe in the market has taken a turn for the worse. Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high (ATH) last year sent investors into a state of euphoria and pushed the price of the cryptocurrency to levels that had never been seen before. Yet, in the aftermath of the ATH, unease has set in. It is now many seem to view (and vote) with a more cautious tilt toward the future of Bitcoin. This sea change in sentiment toward the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency can be seen in the Bitcoin Sentiment Vote‚Äîup or down. The current quarterly sentiment ratio now has Bitcoin back at the levels seen last September. It was last September when the price of Bitcoin was considered by many to be much too low. We all know what happened after that. After reaching its all-time high (ATH), investors and traders began to take a predominantly negative view of Bitcoin‚Äôs future prospects. This is clearly reflected in the Bitcoin Sentiment Vote ‚Äì Up or Down chart. Currently, the quarterly sentiment ratio has returned to levels‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/UKGgm113iB ‚Äî Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) March 21, 2025 Regardless of the dip in sentiment, Bitcoin is still a bastion for long-term holders. These holders have not gone anywhere. It is almost ironic that these secure storage places (i.e. by the holders) should function as the kinds of Bitcoin-adopting silos that the Bitcoin community once fretted about. Anyway, that‚Äôs how things have played out. Para-masochism here has gone along with a public mental health en-route to Bitcoin. Ethereum Follows Bitcoin‚Äôs Negative Sentiment The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum is experiencing a change in investor outlook. The negative net-position change for Ethereum‚Äîan amount that indicates a substantial loss over the last three days‚Äîunderscores the increasing caution around the two leading digital assets. We‚Äôve seen large movements in liquidity for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, but Ethereum‚Äôs market sentiment is trending toward bearishness. Different factors have impacted the outlook of Ethereum‚Äôs future, not least its recent move to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. While this may have largely been taken as a given and something supposedly to be priced into Ethereum by now, the transition has yet to positively impact the ratio of Ethereum to Bitcoin, let alone catapult any significant amount of capital into Ethereum‚Äôs market cap. Moreover, the reasons for pricing Ethereum more positively in relation to Bitcoin remain unconvincing. Even with these difficulties, Ethereum‚Äîand Bitcoin, for that matter‚Äîremains in the good graces of a solid, loyal base of investors. They see potential in the long-term evolution of the ecosystem that is Ethereum. But the shift in sentiment that some have detected regarding Ethereum is, quite frankly, not good. It suggests that in the minds of many investors, the futures of Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer seen as being intimately tied together. Positive Inflows Into Bitcoin Spot ETFs Although investor sentiment seems to be shifting to a negative outlook in the current markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, there‚Äôs still a solid interest in Bitcoin that continues to grow in other types of investment vehicles. Most notably, on March 20, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, saw a large net inflow of $166 million, with BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin spot ETF, IBIT, leading the charge and enjoying an impressive single-day net inflow of $172 million. These inflows indicate that institutional interest in Bitcoin is quite high and that retail investor sentiment is more subdued, if not negative. For that reason, the recent growth of Bitcoin spot ETFs is important. This new vehicle allows all kinds of investors‚Äîparticularly institutional ones‚Äîto gain exposure to Bitcoin. Spot ETFs offer a way to invest in Bitcoin without actually holding the asset itself. And in several key spots around the world, they further legitimize Bitcoin as an asset class. On March 20, the total net inflow for Bitcoin spot ETFs was $166 million. The Bitcoin spot ETF with the highest single-day net inflow yesterday was BlackRock's IBIT, with a single-day net inflow of $172 million. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $12.4093 million‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 21, 2025 The demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional interest in digital assets is growing. These products are regulated better than most crypto products. They are offered by entities that have to play by the rules, which makes them safer for big counterparty investors. Retail investors may not be too bullish on Bitcoin right now. On the other hand, institutions keep plowing into it. That‚Äôs because they operate in a world where price signals are way more important than what retail traders are signaling. Conclusion: Shifting Sentiment but Long-Term Confidence Remains Over the past three days, sentiment appears to have shifted regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies have experienced a not-so-pleasant net position change, to the tune of $3 billion, between them. While this would seem to indicate that investors are becoming more cautious, it is worth noting that those same investors have been in the process of taking their cryptocurrencies off of exchanges and placing them into cold storage. Ethereum, too, finds itself subject to a similar sentiment change, but its technological advances and potential uses may provide some hope for a recovery. What inflows there are into Bitcoin spot ETFs suggest that institutional interest in the cryptocurrency remains quite robust, even as retail sentiment has turned distinctly more negative. As we move forward, the real question is how these sentiment shifts will influence the long-run movement of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. At present, while the immediate outlook might be more ambiguous, institutional interest and the long-term potential of both Bitcoin and Ethereum remain substantial. The next several months could yield vital clues about how these matters will play out and whether a sentiment shift in the wake of these recent events will be more positive.

42139089,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142418,1742627932,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Call: Ripple Demands SEC Regulate Crypto Under Existing Laws, Congress to Forge New Path",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ripple-sec-crypto-regulation-congress/,"In a bold move that could reshape the landscape of digital asset regulation in the United States, Ripple, a leading player in the cryptocurrency sphere, has formally requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply existing legal frameworks to the crypto market. But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äì Ripple also firmly believes that the creation of entirely new regulations should be the domain of Congress, not the SEC. This development throws a spotlight on the ongoing tug-of-war between innovation and regulation in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the future of crypto in the US. Why is Ripple Calling for Existing Crypto Regulation? Ripple‚Äôs recent letter to the SEC, dated March 21st and highlighted by CryptoBriefing, isn‚Äôt just a simple suggestion; it‚Äôs a pointed critique of the SEC‚Äôs past approach to crypto regulation . The core of Ripple‚Äôs argument lies in its dissatisfaction with how the SEC has previously interpreted and applied the ‚ÄòHowey Test‚Äô to cryptocurrencies. But what exactly is the Howey Test, and why is it so central to this debate? The Howey Test, stemming from a 1946 Supreme Court case, is used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an ‚Äòinvestment contract‚Äô and therefore falls under SEC‚Äôs regulatory purview. It essentially defines an investment contract as a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests their money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Ripple argues that the SEC‚Äôs previous administration has ‚Äòdistorted and overly complex‚Äô application of this test within the crypto market. They believe the SEC‚Äôs role should be more focused and streamlined. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of Ripple‚Äôs key points: Focus on Fraud Prevention and Market Supervision: Ripple emphasizes that the SEC‚Äôs primary responsibility should be to ensure market integrity and protect investors from fraudulent activities within the existing legal structure. Congress for New Rules: The company firmly believes that crafting entirely new regulatory frameworks for the crypto market is the responsibility of Congress, the legislative branch of the US government, not the SEC. Jurisdictional Concerns: Ripple voices apprehension about the SEC potentially overstepping its boundaries and expanding its jurisdiction beyond what is legally mandated. Need for Legislative Clarity: The letter underscores the urgent need for clear and decisive legislative action from Congress to establish a comprehensive and forward-looking cryptocurrency laws framework. The Howey Test and Crypto: A Complex Relationship The ‚ÄòHowey Test‚Äô is indeed at the heart of the SEC crypto regulation debate. Its application to digital assets has been a source of considerable confusion and contention. Why is it so tricky to apply to cryptocurrencies? Decentralization vs. Centralized Efforts: The Howey Test often hinges on the idea of ‚Äòprofits solely from the efforts of others.‚Äô In decentralized cryptocurrencies, this aspect becomes blurry as many projects aim for community-driven growth rather than relying on a central promoter. Utility vs. Investment: Many cryptocurrencies are designed to have utility beyond just being an investment. They might be used for transactions, access to platforms, or governance. This dual nature complicates their classification under the Howey Test, which primarily focuses on investment contracts. Novelty of Crypto Assets: The legal frameworks, including the Howey Test, were developed long before the advent of cryptocurrencies. Applying these older frameworks to a completely new asset class presents inherent challenges and interpretive difficulties. Ripple vs. SEC: A Deep Dive into the Standoff The tension between Ripple SEC is not new; it‚Äôs been simmering for quite some time, most notably with the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. The lawsuit alleges that Ripple‚Äôs sales of its XRP token constituted unregistered securities offerings. Ripple, on the other hand, has consistently maintained that XRP is not a security. This legal battle is more than just a company defending itself; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto industry. The outcome could set precedents for how other cryptocurrencies are classified and regulated in the US. Ripple‚Äôs recent letter can be seen as another strategic move in this ongoing standoff, attempting to influence the regulatory narrative and push for a more industry-friendly approach. Key Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Challenge Description Impact Lack of Clarity Uncertainty around how existing securities laws apply to crypto assets. Hinders innovation, creates compliance burdens, and stifles investment. Fragmented Regulatory Approach Different agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, state regulators) may have overlapping or conflicting jurisdictions. Confusion and inefficiency in regulation; potential for regulatory arbitrage. Rapid Technological Innovation The crypto space evolves incredibly quickly, making it difficult for regulations to keep pace. Regulations may become outdated or irrelevant rapidly, potentially stifling innovation. Global Nature of Crypto Cryptocurrencies operate across borders, making national regulation challenging. Need for international cooperation and harmonization of regulatory standards. What‚Äôs Next for Crypto Regulation? Ripple‚Äôs call for Congress to take the lead in establishing new crypto regulation frameworks is echoed by many in the industry. There‚Äôs a growing consensus that a more comprehensive and tailored approach is needed, one that understands the nuances of blockchain technology and fosters innovation while protecting consumers. The fact that Ripple‚Äôs letter is part of ongoing discussions with other industry giants like Coinbase and Robinhood signals a united front among major crypto players. They are collectively pushing for regulatory clarity and a more predictable legal environment. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation? Actionable Insights: Industry Collaboration is Key: Ripple, Coinbase, and Robinhood working together demonstrates the power of industry collaboration in shaping regulatory outcomes. Advocacy for Clear Legislation: The focus should shift towards advocating for clear and specific legislation from Congress, rather than relying solely on SEC interpretations of existing laws. Education and Dialogue: Continued dialogue between the crypto industry and regulators is crucial to bridge the knowledge gap and foster understanding of the technology and its potential. Global Regulatory Harmonization: Looking towards international standards and best practices can help guide the development of effective and globally relevant crypto regulations. A Crossroads for Crypto: Regulation or Stifling Innovation? Ripple‚Äôs assertive stance underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry in the US. The path forward for cryptocurrency laws and regulation is at a crossroads. Will it be one that fosters innovation and allows the crypto space to flourish, or will it be one that, through overly broad or ill-fitting regulations, inadvertently stifle growth and push innovation overseas? The coming months and years will be critical in determining the regulatory future of crypto. The dialogue initiated by Ripple and other industry leaders is a vital step in ensuring that this future is one of balanced and effective regulation that benefits both innovators and consumers alike.

42139163,https://nulltx.com/?p=147294,1742628044,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum‚Äôs Exchange Supply Hits 10-Year Low, Key Price Levels to Watch Amid Declining ETF Flows",https://nulltx.com/ethereums-exchange-supply-hits-10-year-low-key-price-levels-to-watch-amid-declining-etf-flows/,"Ethereum‚Äôs availability on exchanges has been reduced dramatically to the lowest amount in nearly a decade. Exchange liquidity for Ethereum is down a staggering 37% over the past year. Not only are many of the platforms that used to offer Ethereum now gone (think Bitrex and Cryptopia), but even those that survived have slashed their Ethereum listings and trading volumes. This points to a really interesting observation about Ethereum. While it continues to grow as a platform, the core asset seems to have a smaller and smaller presence on actual trading venues. Thanks to the many DeFi and staking options, Ethereum's holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015). There is 16.4% less $ETH on exchanges compared to just 7 weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/r5957wPhLi ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 20, 2025 Ethereum‚Äôs price movement has become a key point of interest for investors and traders. This is largely due to the substantial cut in available supply and a market landscape that is shifting right before our eyes‚Äîand not necessarily in a way that many were hoping for. And while the available supply of Ether has been cut in half, the price has held firm. Key Levels to Watch in Ethereum‚Äôs Short-Term Price Action As the amounts of Ethereum on exchanges keep falling, people are focusing more on key price levels that could serve as either support or resistance coming up soon. Now, to get a good read on those levels, you really have to look at the address space of Ethereum and the kind of cost clustering that we can see within it. More specifically, you want to look at the points within that space where significant numbers of holders amassed huge volumes of ETH. And when you do that, two levels in particular really jump out at you as being critical to keep an eye on in the near term. 1. $2,240 ‚Äì Resistance Level The first level to watch is around $2,240, which is significant because it marks a key resistance point for Ethereum. At this level, 2.24 million addresses hold a combined total of 711,000 ETH. The presence of such a large number of holders at this price could create selling pressure should Ethereum approach or test this level. If the price of Ethereum reaches this point, it is likely to encounter strong resistance as these holders may choose to sell or lock in profits, especially if the price has risen significantly. A break above $2,240 would indicate strong bullish momentum, signaling the potential for higher prices in the short term. 2. $1,886 ‚Äì Support Level Conversely, $1,886 marks a vital support level for Ethereum. This level is fortified by a significant number of addresses‚Äî4.26 million in total‚Äîthat hold an aggregate 3.84 million ETH. With an abundance of holders that have accumulated Ethereum at or around this price point, it‚Äôs next to certain that this level will serve as a cushion if the price starts to slide. A breakdown below the support level at $1,886 could potentially trigger a servo effect whereby the holders of these addresses sell off a significant quantity of their ETH, causing the price to plunge even further. On the other hand, if Ethereum holds above $1,886, it signals to the market that there is a strong base of demand and plenty of upward momentum.

Traders are watching closely for even the slightest movement around these two points, since the way the price reacts to them will give us a reading on just how strong (or weak) market sentiment is right now. And that, in turn, will give us some clue as to what kind of price trend, if any, Ethereum can expect in the near future. Ethereum‚Äôs ETF Flows Show Signs of Weakness Although on-chain metrics for Ethereum indicate a solid, committed base of long-term holders, the performance of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tells a different story. On March 20, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced net outflows of $12.4 million, this constitutes the 12th consecutive day of net outflows. This long stretch of outflows could be a sign of diminishing confidence from institutional investors. If that‚Äôs the case, it puts an interesting spin on the narrative that is otherwise innocuous. On March 20, the total net inflow for Bitcoin spot ETFs was $166 million. The Bitcoin spot ETF with the highest single-day net inflow yesterday was BlackRock's IBIT, with a single-day net inflow of $172 million. Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total net outflow of $12.4093 million‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 21, 2025 The Ethereum ETFs experiencing heavy outflows could mean that large, sophisticated investors are second-guessing the near-term price of Ethereum. When you look at the presented evidence and weigh it all together, retail investors are currently your best bet in terms of someone holding onto Ethereum for the long haul. That said, if you happen to be an institutional investor looking for a reasonable risk/reward profile in the immediate future, Ethereum probably isn‚Äôt it, given the current market environment and a few too many unknowns. It is striking that the divergence in sentiment between retail investors and institutional investors exists at all. It suggests that Ethereum‚Äôs price is underpinned by retail investor demand, at least for the time being. Meanwhile, it appears that institutional investors may be waiting to see clearer, more reassuring signals of overall market stability before making a fresh re-entry into the crypto space. A Confluence of Factors Impacting Ethereum‚Äôs Price Ethereum‚Äôs supply on exchanges has dropped, and the all-important price levels of $2,240 and $1,886 could influence price action in the near term. But why? Well, frankly, there are lots of reasons. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown: ‚Äì Ethereum plays a big role in DeFi, and its utility is more impactful than ever. ‚Äì The market‚Äôs short-term outlook is hazy at best, showing no real direction. ‚Äì The ETFs on the space have been seeing negative inflows as of late. Ethereum is dealing with these forces, and, as it does, traders will hone in on the aforementioned price levels, peering into the mystique of sentiment as they try to ascertain what is actually happening. Is it omens for either institutions or retail traders that the two are so clearly on different pages? For the moment, all is well. Ethereum‚Äôs balance sheet is more or less fully loaded with positive long-term indicators, which is, of course, exactly what traders who are net long Ethereum would love to see. To conclude, even though Ethereum‚Äôs on-chain performance indicates that there is a solid long-term commitment from holders, the ETF outflows that we are seeing right now, along with the overall market sentiment, may cause some price fluctuations in the short term. What will happen at the $2,240 resistance and the $1,886 support level over the next few days will be very telling. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Surely, this is a key and exciting moment in the push toward blockchain interoperability. Also, it opens up new possibilities within DeFi. TRX is now capable of residing on Solana and operating there as if it were just another Solana token, making it a clear interoperable use case that Solana has for TRX. And what better way to inaugurate this new cross-chain capability than with a new DEX since the DEX is actually a key reason for having an interoperable TRX in the first place? Also, TRON claims that Pumpswap can operate with lower fees and greater speed than most DEXes. TRX on Solana: Bridging Two Powerful Ecosystems Bridging TRX to Solana provides users with a new set of opportunities. Previously, the TRON network was where the majority of TRX existed, and it was known for its rapid speed and high scalability. But Solana has been around for a long time as a major player in the crypto industry; it is known for its incredibly fast transaction speeds, low fees, and a thriving decentralized finance space. Bridging TRX to Solana makes the two networks work together, so TRX users can access the Solana network, which can process a huge number of transactions at once, and also use the many dApps that the TRON network offers. TRX Now on Solana: A Game-Changer for Blockchain Interoperability. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Big news for the crypto community! TRX, the native token of the TRON blockchain, is now officially live on Solana (SOL)‚Äîand liquidity is‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Onobaby (@vibequeen01) March 21, 2025 This partnership is more than a technical accomplishment; it is a shrewd step in exploring the uncharted territories of blockchains. This is now possible thanks to a technical collaboration between the two networks. TRX holders can effortlessly utilize their assets on Platform Solana, which is now part of the growing cross-chain DeFi ecosystem. This augurs well for the asset‚Äôs utility as a part of the DeFi space, and it correspondingly bodes very well for the liquidity and value of TRX. What This Means for Crypto Enthusiasts With TRX now on Solana, users are set to reap a variety of benefits. Cross-chain transactions have become seamless thanks to this integration. Now, whether you are transferring, trading, or using TRX in decentralized applications, you can operate on both the TRON and Solana networks without the usual friction that tends to accompany cross-chain transfers. Interoperability was one of the primary promises of blockchain technology. It‚Äôs nice to see that Solana and TRON have delivered. In addition, Solana‚Äôs low transaction fees and high throughput provide an ideal setting for TRX to thrive. Solana has become known for its scalability, which allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second. For users of TRX, this means that they can accomplish part of the work that they need to do at much greater speeds and with far fewer roadblocks or problems of any kind. Since TRX interacts with Solana, that part of its interaction is going to be more efficient and perhaps more effective than if it were to go through some other blockchain. And the whole efficiency argument certainly isn‚Äôt going to make TRX unpleasant for crypto traders and other enthusiasts. Furthermore, this cooperative effort affords a thrilling occasion to bolster the TRON ecosystem. By moving into the Solana network, TRX‚Äôs presence and profit potential are greatly amplified. Now, too, users can access a much broader spectrum of decentralized apps (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), The Bigger Picture: A Multi-Chain Future for Crypto The TRX-Solana integration is more than the uniting of two popular tokens. It is a look at the future of the blockchain space‚Äîwhere multiple networks can work together seamlessly in an interconnected, dynamic environment for users and developers. Demand for blockchain interoperability is evident. The partnership between TRON and Solana makes clear that the future can involve different chains communicating with one another, collaborating with one another, and unlocking new possibilities in decentralized finance. We cannot overstate how important it is to have multi-chain functionality. As the world of crypto evolves, we must have the ability to move assets freely across different blockchains. Not only does this trend toward interoperability promise to greatly increase the liquidity and utility of TRX, but it also enables the development of more robust and flexible decentralized applications that can leverage the strengths of several different blockchains. Besides these technical accomplishments, the TRX-Solana partnership creates new trading opportunities. Solana‚Äôs vibrant DeFi ecosystem allows TRX holders to access mind-boggling new markets and platforms. Serving as the foundation for all future revenue streams, this is bound to generate a lot more demand for TRX, which should ratchet its value and usefulness up several notches. A Sign of Innovation, Not a Hack The founder of TRON, Justin Sun, has emphasized that this is not just a regular partnership. In the crypto world, where many rumors abound, Sun has made it clear that the collaboration between TRON and Solana is real and is to be regarded as a bona fide landmark event for innovation in the world of blockchain. There can be no doubt about the authenticity of this partnership, for both teams have put in a lot of effort to ensure a smooth and secure integration. With liquidity in place and all necessary technical groundwork done, this collaboration serves as a remarkable demonstration of the potential residing in what has come to be known as ‚Äúmulti-chain‚Äù blockchain technology. Conclusion The first appearance of TRX on Solana is a landmark moment for both the TRON and Solana ecosystems. By smashing down the walls that once separated these two powerful blockchains, we now give our users the chance to engage in faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions and to take advantage of some new trading and investment opportunities. This is just the beginning of a far more interconnected world of powerful blockchains, where cross-chain interoperability is no longer some distant goal but an achieved fact.

42139354,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142396,1742628367,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Stance: Ex-SEC Official Rejects Crypto-Specific Regulation at SEC Roundtable,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ex-sec-official-rejects-crypto-regulation/,"The world of cryptocurrency regulation remains a hotbed of debate, and recent discussions at the SEC‚Äôs first crypto roundtable have only intensified the scrutiny. In a surprising turn, former SEC official John Reed Stark voiced strong opposition to creating new, crypto-specific regulations. But what does this mean for the future of digital assets and the broader crypto landscape? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of Stark‚Äôs controversial stance and explore the potential implications for the burgeoning crypto industry. Decoding John Reed Stark‚Äôs Crypto Regulation Rejection at SEC Roundtable During the SEC‚Äôs inaugural crypto roundtable on March 21st, John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, made a compelling case against modifying the existing Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 to accommodate the unique nature of digital assets. His core argument rests on the belief that current securities laws are perfectly adequate to govern the crypto space. Stark emphatically stated that crypto assets already fall squarely within the definitions of securities as they are currently written, thereby negating the need for any bespoke regulatory frameworks. This perspective immediately positions him as a staunch traditionalist in the rapidly evolving world of crypto finance. Stark‚Äôs presentation at the SEC roundtable was not just a passive observation; it was a clear warning against any perceived regulatory leniency towards the crypto sector. He painted a picture of a landscape where existing regulations are being deliberately sidestepped under the guise of innovation. This firm stance underscores his long-held skepticism about the crypto industry and its claims of revolutionary financial technologies. Why Does Stark Believe Current Securities Laws Suffice for Digital Assets? Stark‚Äôs argument hinges on the fundamental characteristics of many cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. He contends that these assets, in their functional essence, often operate as investment contracts. Under the Howey Test, a landmark Supreme Court case, an investment contract exists when there is: An investment of money In a common enterprise With the expectation of profits Solely from the efforts of others Stark posits that a significant portion of crypto offerings meet these criteria. Investors often purchase tokens with the anticipation that the value will increase due to the efforts of the project‚Äôs developers or the broader market dynamics. Therefore, he concludes, these are inherently securities and should be treated as such under existing securities laws . Dismissing Crypto Innovation: A Controversial Stand One of the most striking aspects of Stark‚Äôs address was his outright dismissal of the claims of groundbreaking innovation within the crypto sector. He is a vocal crypto critic , and his remarks at the SEC roundtable further solidified this reputation. For Stark, the promises of decentralization, financial inclusion, and technological advancement often touted by crypto proponents are largely overstated or simply not materializing in a way that justifies regulatory exceptions. This viewpoint directly clashes with the narrative often pushed by the crypto industry, which emphasizes the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies. Stark‚Äôs skepticism challenges the core premise that crypto represents a fundamentally new paradigm that necessitates a completely new regulatory approach. He suggests that, beneath the veneer of innovation, many crypto projects are simply repackaging old financial schemes in a digital format. Defending Past SEC Enforcement Actions: No Room for Leniency Stark didn‚Äôt just argue against new regulations; he also staunchly defended the SEC‚Äôs past enforcement actions in the crypto space. This defense is crucial because it signals a continuity in regulatory philosophy. He believes the SEC has been justified in its approach to date and that there should be no relaxation of these enforcement efforts. His stance implies that any perceived pushback from the crypto industry against SEC actions is unwarranted and that the agency should continue to rigorously apply existing securities laws to the sector. This is particularly relevant given the ongoing debates about the SEC‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation. Some industry participants argue that the SEC has been overly aggressive and unclear in its guidance, stifling innovation. However, Stark‚Äôs perspective reinforces the view that the SEC is acting within its mandate and is appropriately applying established legal principles to a new asset class. Criticism and Industry Reactions: A Divided Crypto World Unsurprisingly, Stark‚Äôs remarks have ignited a flurry of reactions within the crypto industry. While some figures aligned with traditional finance may find his arguments reassuring, many in the crypto space have voiced strong criticism. The core of the criticism often centers on the idea that applying outdated securities laws to novel technologies like blockchain and digital assets is inherently flawed and stifles growth. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the opposing viewpoints: Perspective Arguments Stark and Supporters (Traditional View) Existing laws are sufficient. Crypto assets often function as securities. Regulatory leniency is risky. Focus on investor protection under current frameworks. Crypto Industry Critics of Stark‚Äôs View Existing laws are ill-suited for crypto‚Äôs unique nature. Innovation requires tailored regulations. Overly strict enforcement stifles growth. Need for clarity and crypto-specific guidelines. The industry‚Äôs counter-argument often highlights the need for a more nuanced and forward-looking regulatory approach. They argue that crypto regulation should be designed to foster innovation while also addressing legitimate concerns about investor protection and market integrity. Simply applying decades-old securities laws, they contend, may not be the most effective way to achieve this balance. The Road Ahead: Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Regulation John Reed Stark‚Äôs firm stance against crypto-specific regulations throws a spotlight on the ongoing tension between traditional regulatory frameworks and the rapidly evolving crypto world. His perspective represents a significant viewpoint within the broader regulatory discourse, one that emphasizes caution and adherence to established legal principles. Whether regulators will ultimately heed his warnings or lean towards a more tailored approach remains to be seen. The future of crypto regulation is likely to involve a continued push and pull between these contrasting viewpoints. Finding a regulatory sweet spot that encourages responsible innovation while safeguarding investors will be crucial for the long-term health and development of the crypto ecosystem. The discussions initiated at the SEC roundtable, and the strong opinions voiced by figures like John Reed Stark, are vital steps in this ongoing and complex process. Actionable Insights for Crypto Stakeholders For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, Stark‚Äôs position offers several key takeaways: Compliance is Key: Regardless of the debate around new regulations, the immediate reality is that existing securities laws are being applied. Crypto projects must prioritize compliance with these laws to avoid enforcement actions. Understand Regulatory Scrutiny: Stark‚Äôs comments highlight the continued skepticism and scrutiny from regulatory bodies. Expect ongoing and potentially intensified oversight. Engage in Constructive Dialogue: The industry needs to actively engage with regulators to advocate for balanced and informed policies. This includes providing education and demonstrating responsible innovation. Prepare for Stringent Enforcement: Stark‚Äôs defense of past SEC actions suggests a continued focus on enforcement. Crypto businesses should prepare for rigorous regulatory scrutiny and potential penalties for non-compliance. Conclusion: Stark‚Äôs Unwavering Stance and the Future of Crypto Laws John Reed Stark‚Äôs firm rejection of crypto-specific regulation at the SEC roundtable underscores a critical juncture in the ongoing debate about how to govern digital assets . His unwavering belief in the sufficiency of existing securities laws and his skepticism towards crypto innovation present a formidable challenge to those advocating for a more tailored regulatory approach. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the tension between these perspectives will undoubtedly shape the future of crypto regulation and the trajectory of the entire industry. Stark‚Äôs voice serves as a potent reminder of the deep-seated regulatory concerns that the crypto world must address as it seeks mainstream acceptance and long-term sustainability.

Will it Reach $50 in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever since the beginning, the Hyperliquid price has been demonstrating strength, even in times of intensifying bearish actions. The platform added new staking tiers, which made the token more useful and gave discounts on trading fees. The traders became highly optimistic over the new staking tier system, which is scheduled to go live after April 30. This intensified the HYPE price rally, which has already rebounded from the local lows of around $12.34. Later, the rounds of over $15 million accumulation in HYPE fueled the bullish momentum, which emphasized the potential demand for the token. However, ZackXBT exposed the ‚Äòfake whale‚Äô for reportedly being William Parker, who has previously been sued for financial crimes. Parker had allegedly gathered $20 million in HYPE through high-stakes leveraged trading. Further investigations revealed a wallet associated with Parker received funds from a phishing scam. Regardless of the exposure, the HYPE price is printing massive bullish candles, suggesting the gaining strength of the bulls. The short-term price action of Hyperliquid suggests the token has been incremental and ranges within a rising parallel channel. The buying volume is accumulating and the MACD displays a rise in the buying pressure, which has risen into the bullish range. This hints towards growing confidence over the token as the price has been holding the 50-day MA firmly in the short term. However, the token is required to surpass a couple of price ranges to mark a strong rise above the bearish influence. The Hyperliquid price is currently testing the first barrier by entering the resistance zone between $15.96 and $16.15. If the price manages to rise above the range, it could face the next barrier at $16.75. This range has been a support and resistance at different stages and hence a rise above this range could further push the levels close to $18 which is the 200-day MA in the short-term. Therefore, the HYPE price is required to clear these resistances during the weekend, which may elevate the levels to $20.

MUTM‚Äôs presale‚ÄÇis priced at $0.02 and has already raised $4.5 million, on the back of 6,400 holders. More than 50% of Phase 3 tokens have been sold so far,‚ÄÇcontributing to strong pre-sale demand before a 25% price increase to $0.025 in Phase 4. Now ready to list on exchanges for $0.06 ‚Äî with predictions of a post-launch advance breaking through $3 ‚Äî investors seeking‚ÄÇexponential profits are turning to this altcoin, with the return potential now upside of 200%. A Real Contender‚ÄÇto Ethereum‚Äôs Steady Climb Ethereum at $1,897 cementing its resilience as the rest of the‚ÄÇcrypto market rallies. The transition to proof-of-stake and upcoming sharding upgrades on the‚ÄÇnetwork should improve transaction efficiency and could bring prices back toward $4,000. Institutional interest‚ÄÇswells, as Ethereum-centered ETFs catch wind; DeFi expansion continues to solidify demand. Yet progress remains gradual. ETH‚Äôs range between $1,800 and $2,200 has remained constant in the‚ÄÇrecent past, as uncertainty looms in the short- to medium-term, with indicators hinting at volatility. So while it could break bullish up to $3,793, its trajectory/user adoption‚ÄÇmay expand, but isn‚Äôt as enthralling as new Alt‚Äôs redefining utility and investor incentives. Cardano‚Äôs Burn Not Quite‚ÄÇHot Enough to Spark Momentum But Cardano is also trading at just $0.7091 and‚ÄÇfailing to return to its 2021 peak of $3.10. An‚ÄÇEthereum alternative, the Ouroboros consensus mechanism and research driven ethos position it well against Ethereum, but adoption lags. Analysts cite ADA‚Äôs neutral RSI at 46.93 and‚ÄÇbear dominance on 4-hour charts, indicating consolidation. Predictions‚ÄÇfor a peak in 2025, at $1.04, also lack the fervor surrounding newer projects. However, considering green days of only 37% in the last month, as well as dirty moving averages, Cardano seems‚ÄÇfar from $3. With‚ÄÇpresale dynamics accelerating return on investment, investors are turning increasingly away from growth, however incremental,at Mutuum Finance. Presale of Mutuum Finance Rises as Interest‚ÄÇGrows Phase‚ÄÇ3 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) runs hot & hush. Only‚ÄÇat $0.02, the token allows early investors to capture a 25% profit before Phase 4 increases the price to $0.025. Its structured presale ensures a minimum 200%‚ÄÇprofit at the $0.06 listing price, but analysts predict much more. Estimates of a blast to $3‚ÄÇpost-launch (14,900% ROI from Phase 3) demonstrate the exceptionality of MUTM‚Äôs tokenomics. The platform‚Äôs lending model creates inherent buy pressure: It uses‚ÄÇrevenue to buy back its tokens, redistributing profits back to stakers, and providing stability and long-term demand.

This comes as a breath of fresh air for many in the burgeoning NFT space, especially those exploring innovative funding mechanisms for their projects. Let‚Äôs dive into what this could mean for the future of crypto fundraising and the role of NFTs . Understanding Hester Peirce‚Äôs Stance on NFT Fundraising Hester Peirce, often dubbed ‚ÄòCrypto Mom‚Äô for her pro-crypto stance, made her comments at a recent task force roundtable. As head of the SEC‚Äôs crypto task force, her opinions carry significant weight. She specifically pointed out that cryptocurrency projects leveraging NFTs as a fundraising tool should not be subjected to the same securities regulations as traditional financial instruments. This perspective stems from the unique nature of NFTs and their utility beyond mere investment vehicles. To put it simply, Peirce believes that projects like Stoner Cats, an animated series that successfully raised approximately $8 million through NFT sales, should serve as a blueprint for a regulatory exemption. These funds were instrumental in producing the animation, and NFT holders gained access to watch the series and trade their NFTs on secondary markets. This model, according to Peirce, showcases a utility-driven approach to NFTs that differs from typical securities offerings. Why Exempt NFT Fundraising from Stringent SEC Regulation? The core argument for exempting NFT fundraising from securities regulations rests on several key factors: Utility vs. Investment: Many NFTs, especially those used for fundraising, offer utility beyond just being an investment. They can grant access to exclusive content, communities, or services, blurring the lines of what constitutes a security. Innovation and Growth: Overly strict regulations can stifle innovation in the crypto space. Exempting certain types of crypto startups using NFTs for fundraising can foster growth and experimentation. Decentralization and Community Building: NFT projects often prioritize decentralization and community engagement. Imposing traditional securities regulations can undermine these principles. Clarity and Framework: Peirce emphasized the need to provide a clear framework for NFT projects . This clarity would help projects operate within legal boundaries without being unduly burdened by regulations designed for traditional securities. The Stoner Cats Example: A Case for Securities Exemption? The Stoner Cats project is a prime example of how NFT fundraising can operate outside the traditional securities framework. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why it resonates with Peirce‚Äôs argument: Aspect Stoner Cats NFT Fundraising Traditional Securities Offering Purpose Fund production of an animated series Raise capital for business operations and growth Utility for Holders Access to watch the animation, community membership, secondary market trading Potential dividends, voting rights (in some cases), stock appreciation Investor Expectation Entertainment and community engagement Primarily financial return on investment Regulatory Framework Proposed exemption from securities regulations Subject to stringent securities regulations As you can see, the Stoner Cats model prioritizes utility and community over purely financial investment returns. This distinction is crucial in differentiating NFT fundraising from traditional securities offerings. Challenges and Considerations for SEC Regulation of NFTs While Hester Peirce‚Äôs stance is encouraging, there are still challenges and considerations regarding SEC regulation of NFTs and crypto fundraising: Defining Utility vs. Security: Drawing a clear line between NFTs that are primarily utility-driven and those that function as securities can be complex. A robust framework is needed to differentiate them effectively. Investor Protection: While promoting innovation is important, investor protection remains a key concern for the SEC. Any exemption must ensure that investors are not unduly exposed to risks. Scalability and Enforcement: Creating a regulatory framework that is scalable and enforceable across the rapidly evolving NFT landscape is a significant challenge. Global Harmonization: Regulatory approaches to NFTs vary globally. Harmonizing regulations across jurisdictions is crucial for the long-term growth and stability of the NFT market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Startups Considering NFT Fundraising For crypto startups exploring NFT fundraising, here are some actionable insights to consider: Focus on Utility: Design NFTs that offer clear utility and value beyond just financial appreciation. This strengthens the argument for exemption from securities regulations. Transparency and Disclosure: Maintain transparency about your project goals, team, and how funds will be used. Clear communication builds trust with your community and potential NFT holders. Legal Consultation: Seek legal counsel to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and ensure compliance with applicable laws. Community Engagement: Build a strong community around your project. Engaged communities are more resilient and can contribute to the long-term success of your NFT fundraising efforts. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for NFT Fundraising? Hester Peirce‚Äôs advocacy for exempting NFT fundraising from securities regulations marks a potentially landmark moment for the crypto industry. Her stance acknowledges the unique nature of NFTs and their potential to drive innovation in fundraising for crypto startups . While challenges remain in defining and implementing a clear regulatory framework, her voice adds significant momentum to the push for a more nuanced and innovation-friendly approach to SEC regulation of NFTs. As the crypto space continues to evolve, this development could pave the way for a more vibrant and accessible fundraising ecosystem for creators and entrepreneurs alike.

Farcaster, the Optimism-powered protocol that‚Äôs been making waves, just dropped a bombshell: Snapchain . Imagine a social network operating at lightning speed, handling interactions at a scale previously unheard of in the decentralized space. That‚Äôs the promise of Snapchain, Farcaster‚Äôs brand new ‚Äúblockchain-like‚Äù data layer. Let‚Äôs dive into what this exciting development means for the future of social media and the crypto world. What is Snapchain and Why is it a Game Changer for Farcaster? At its core, Snapchain is designed to be the engine that powers Farcaster‚Äôs social interactions. Think of it as the roads and highways of a city, but instead of cars, it‚Äôs data flowing at an incredible pace. Farcaster co-founder Varun Srinivasan himself highlighted the sheer capacity of Snapchain, stating it can process ‚Äúnorth of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).‚Äù To put that into perspective, that‚Äôs significantly faster than many existing blockchains and certainly a leap forward for decentralized social networks. But why is this speed so critical? In the world of social media, speed and efficiency are paramount. Users expect instant updates, seamless interactions, and no lag. Traditional blockchains, while secure and decentralized, often struggle to keep up with the high-throughput demands of social applications. This is where Snapchain steps in, offering: Blazing-Fast Transactions: With 10,000+ TPS, Snapchain ensures that your likes, comments, shares, and posts are processed almost instantaneously. Say goodbye to sluggish decentralized social experiences! Low-Cost Efficiency: Srinivasan emphasized that Snapchain provides a ‚Äúlow-cost and efficient processing system.‚Äù This is crucial for making decentralized social media accessible to everyone. High transaction fees can be a major barrier to entry, but Snapchain aims to break down those walls. Scalability for Growth: As Farcaster‚Äôs user base expands, Snapchain is built to scale alongside it. This future-proofs the protocol, ensuring it can handle increasing volumes of social interactions without compromising speed or cost. Enhanced User Experience: Ultimately, all these technical advancements translate into a smoother, more enjoyable user experience. Imagine a decentralized social platform that feels as responsive and fluid as your favorite centralized apps ‚Äì that‚Äôs the goal. The ‚ÄòBlockchain-Like‚Äô Nature of Snapchain: Decoding the Tech The description of Snapchain as ‚Äúblockchain-like‚Äù is intriguing. It suggests that while it may not be a traditional blockchain in the strictest sense, it borrows key principles and architectures from blockchain technology. This could mean it incorporates aspects like: Distributed Ledger: Likely maintaining a distributed and tamper-proof record of social interactions. Consensus Mechanism: Employing a mechanism to validate transactions and ensure data integrity, although perhaps optimized for speed and efficiency over absolute decentralization in the traditional blockchain sense. Cryptographic Security: Leveraging cryptography to secure data and user interactions. However, the ‚Äúblockchain-like‚Äù designation also hints at potential differences from conventional blockchains. It‚Äôs possible that Snapchain prioritizes throughput and cost-effectiveness by making trade-offs in areas like: Decentralization Degree: It might operate with a slightly more centralized structure than some public blockchains to achieve its performance goals. The exact nature of its consensus mechanism and validator setup will be crucial to understanding its decentralization level. Smart Contract Functionality: While designed for social interactions, it‚Äôs unclear if Snapchain will support the full breadth of smart contract capabilities found on platforms like Ethereum or Optimism. Its focus appears to be on optimizing for social data processing. Further technical details about Snapchain‚Äôs architecture will be essential to fully grasp its design and trade-offs. However, the core message is clear: Farcaster is prioritizing performance and user experience to build a truly viable decentralized social media platform. Why is a Robust Data Layer Crucial for Social Media? The data layer is the foundation upon which any social network is built. It‚Äôs responsible for storing, processing, and retrieving all the information that makes up the social experience ‚Äì user profiles, posts, connections, interactions, and more. For decentralized social media, a robust data layer is even more critical due to the inherent challenges of decentralization. Traditional centralized social media giants rely on massive, proprietary databases to manage their data. This centralized approach offers speed and control but comes at the cost of user privacy and data ownership. Decentralized platforms aim to flip this model, giving users more control and resisting censorship. However, achieving this while maintaining performance requires innovative solutions like Snapchain. Here‚Äôs why a powerful data layer like Snapchain is a game-changer for decentralized social media: Feature Centralized Social Media Decentralized Social Media with Snapchain Data Control Platform-owned, users have limited control User-centric, potentially greater user control Performance High performance, but can be opaque and censorable High performance (thanks to Snapchain), transparent and censorship-resistant Cost Cost-effective for the platform, but users may pay with data Low-cost transactions for users, potentially more equitable ecosystem Scalability Highly scalable, but prone to single points of failure Scalable (via Snapchain), more resilient and distributed Farcaster and the Future of Decentralized Social Networks Farcaster has consistently been at the forefront of innovation in the decentralized social space. Built on Optimism, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Farcaster has already demonstrated a commitment to scalability and user experience. The launch of Snapchain is a bold step further, signaling a clear dedication to overcoming the performance bottlenecks that have hindered wider adoption of decentralized social platforms. By creating a specialized blockchain -like data layer tailored for social interactions, Farcaster is not just improving its own platform; it‚Äôs potentially paving the way for a new generation of decentralized social networks. If Snapchain lives up to its promise, it could: Inspire other decentralized social projects: Snapchain‚Äôs success could serve as a blueprint for other developers looking to build high-performance decentralized social platforms. Attract more users to Web3 social: A faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly experience could draw in users who have been hesitant to try decentralized alternatives.

It didn‚Äôt work. His attempt to walk back his old comments about quantum computing ended up dragging down the same stocks he wanted to help. On Thursday, at the company‚Äôs first-ever Quantum Day, Huang said he didn‚Äôt mean it when he claimed quantum was at least 15 years away from being useful. But investors weren‚Äôt buying the apology. Instead of rallying, the sector went red. D-Wave dropped 18% that day. Quantum Defiance ETF (QTUM) lost 2%. Rigetti Computing and IonQ both sank over 9%. That‚Äôs after Huang stood on stage trying to show support for the tech he once dismissed. His old comments in January already caused a sell-off. This new attempt just made things worse. Huang hosts event, but stocks still fall ‚ÄúThis is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,‚Äù Huang said Thursday, trying to lighten the mood. But nothing about the market response was light. The entire event, held during Nvidia‚Äôs big GTC conference, was supposed to build confidence. Instead, it triggered more losses. Back in January, Huang said quantum computing was at least 15 years out, calling that estimate ‚Äúon the early side.‚Äù That comment sent the whole sector down. His Thursday speech was supposed to clear things up. Instead, it repeated the damage. He said he was surprised that his earlier comment moved markets at all, but this time it did again‚Äîand in real time. The whole idea behind Quantum Day was to show the industry some love. Huang invited executives from several quantum companies to join him on stage. The move looked good on paper. Nvidia‚Äôs announcement about the event in January had helped kick off a small rally. But on Thursday, even the companies that showed up saw their shares slide. Needham analyst Quinn Bolton pointed out one big issue: branding. ‚ÄúJensen raised the idea that quantum computing might be poorly positioned, as calling a quantum system a computer sets unrealistic expectations,‚Äù Bolton told clients. He said this was one of the most contested parts of the whole event. Huang seemed to be suggesting that quantum tech should be pitched as a companion to traditional systems‚Äînot a full replacement. Huang made it clear that the technology is still complicated. ‚ÄúOf course, quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut the technology is insanely complicated.‚Äù Nvidia expands research efforts while ETF keeps falling Despite the chaos in the market, Nvidia is still pushing into the quantum space. The company announced plans to build a new research center in Boston. The facility will be a space for quantum startups to work with researchers at Harvard and MIT. It‚Äôs also part of Nvidia‚Äôs strategy to blend classical and quantum systems together. The company already makes GPUs, which are used to run quantum simulators. That hardware is a key part of how current quantum research is done. Now Nvidia is developing tools to integrate those GPUs with quantum chips. No exact timeline was given, but the company is clearly trying to stay relevant in the space it once called decades away. But none of that helped market confidence. The Quantum Defiance ETF is now down over 4% for the year. That‚Äôs after already getting hit hard in January when Huang made his original comment. Investors don‚Äôt seem ready to forget it, even if the CEO is. Meanwhile, the broader stock market saw a small rebound on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.08%, closing at 5,667.56. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.52% to settle at 17,784.05, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 32.03 points, ending at 41,985.35. That marked the end of a four-week losing streak for the S&P 500, which posted a 0.5% weekly gain. The Nasdaq climbed 0.2% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.2%. Friday was also a quadruple witching day. That‚Äôs when options and futures on stocks and indexes all expire on the same day. According to Goldman, over $4.7 trillion in notional options exposure expired. That added more noise to an already messy trading week. Markets were also reacting to comments from Donald Trump, who hinted at some ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù on tariffs. Still, he said the April 2 deadline for reciprocal tariffs would stand. Countries that tax U.S. goods will be taxed the same way, he said. The S&P 500 even flirted with correction territory during the recent sell-off. It dropped nearly 8% from its record high. A correction is defined as a 10% drop. The benchmark tried to recover multiple times this month, including a 1% bounce on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would likely cut rates twice this year. But none of that helped the quantum sector. Even with a tech-driven rally in the broader market, the companies tied to Nvidia‚Äôs Quantum Day kept bleeding. Huang tried to shift the narrative, but it didn‚Äôt land. Instead of fixing things, his public U-turn pushed the stocks even lower. Investors don‚Äôt care what the event was called. They care about numbers. And the numbers were bad. Nvidia stayed quiet on the exact market fallout after the event. No statements, no clarification. Just silence. The company tried to frame the event as a show of unity with the quantum world. But the only thing it united was a bunch of red candles across quantum tickers.

This rare win comes at a time when Bitcoin mining is tougher than ever, with a difficulty level reaching 112 trillion. The miner‚Äôs win shows that patience pays off in a market dominated by large mining pools. Solo Miner Hits the Jackpot On March 21, 2025, an independent Bitcoin miner successfully solved block 888,737 , which included 2,327 transactions. This earned them the current 3.125 BTC block reward ( worth around $266K ) and an extra 0.032 BTC from transaction fees. Blockchain data shows that, unlike industrial mining farms that deploy high-powered ASIC miners, this solo miner reportedly used a DIY FutureBit Apollo machine, a setup typically associated with home-based hobbyists. The victory is similar to hitting the lottery, given the current state of Bitcoin mining, where large-scale operations with immense computational power usually dominate the industry. The Challenge of Bitcoin Mining Today Bitcoin mining has become more difficult over time. The mining difficulty has reached a record 112 trillion, making it much tougher for solo miners to compete with large mining pools. Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate, which measures the total computing power used for mining, has also hit a record high of 817.8 EH/s . This is a 50% jump compared to last year, showing how competitive the industry has become. A Rare but Inspiring Win This solo miner‚Äôs success is rare but inspiring. While most solo miners struggle to earn rewards, this event proves that even small players still have a chance in Bitcoin mining.

Her request, titled ‚ÄúThere must be some way out of here,‚Äù signals an effort to resolve the regulatory confusion caused by previous SEC leadership. Ripple Urges To Clear Up The Confusion Ripple responded by criticizing the SEC‚Äôs previous leadership under Gary Gensler. The company pointed out that the SEC‚Äôs past crypto guidelines were confusing, overly lengthy, and lacked solid legal backing. Ripple highlighted that the previous SEC leadership seemed to create confusion in the market to cover up its failure to follow the law. To address this, it proposed three solutions to help the SEC clear up the confusion left behind. Back To The Basics Firstly, to resolve this confusion, Ripple suggested that the SEC should go back to basics and only regulate what is clearly defined as securities under federal laws. The company argued that many digital assets, especially those that don‚Äôt generate profits or yield, shouldn‚Äôt be classified as securities. Stick To The Existing Laws Ripple also urged the SEC to stick to existing laws instead of creating new ones that could add more confusion. The company highlighted that only Congress has the authority to make new laws, and the SEC should focus on enforcing existing regulations rather than making new ones. Finally, Ripple is calling on the SEC to provide much-needed clarity for the crypto market. The company applauded the SEC‚Äôs decision to clarify that meme coins aren‚Äôt securities, helping to clear up some confusion. Ripple is pushing for the SEC to take a clear and direct approach, hoping it will resolve the ongoing confusion surrounding crypto regulations. Besides, the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, as the SEC has decided to drop its appeal against Ripple.

In terms of value transferred, Base and Arbitrum dominate the space with market shares of 55% and 35%, respectively, with Optimism coming at a distant third. Base and Arbitrum lead L2s in terms of value transferred in 2025. Source: Dune Analytics However, the new data provided information on the activities of L2 blockchains other than Base and Arbitrum, which are also leading in specific metrics such as value transferred by transaction and gas unit. According to Dune, high value per transaction often indicates meaningful usage, like DeFi trades or large transfers, over spammy or low-value interactions. It can reflect the blockchain‚Äôs ability to support real-world use cases that require significant value movement, while value transferred per gas unit reflects the economic density and the efficiency of the blockchain in handling valuable activities relative to resources. In this area, the data shows that blockchains such as Skoll, Zksync, and Arbitrum take the lead in terms of their efficiency. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Filippo (@filippoarman) reports that the biggest winners in terms of the value of transactions per unique wallet are Blast and Optimism. However, Dune also pointed out that this metric can sometimes be misleading because it‚Äôs prone to distortions which are mostly due to Sybil attacks. Blast and Optimism are the biggest L2s winners in terms of value of transactions per unique wallet. Source: Dune Analytics The gulf between the blockchains becomes increasingly clear in the revenue (aka transaction fees) section, which according to Dune, is a great metric because it represents the revenue (transaction fees), costs (L1 fees), and profit (L2 fees). Base takes a major share in terms of transaction fees, accounting for over 80% of the market share. Arbitrum moves between 5 to 10% and is followed by Abstract and Optimism at approximately 5 to 3% of the market share. In analyzing this data, Filippo mentioned that in terms of revenue per transaction, a metric that sheds light on how much profit the layer 2 blockchain generates on average from each transaction processed on a given day, Linea leads and is then followed by Base, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM. However, when it comes to overall profit (profit = revenue ‚Äì L1 costs), Base comes on top again and is followed by Arbitrum on the chart. Both blockchains lead in terms of profit and profit per transaction. Ethereum still dominates with 50%+ share with regards to DEX volume. As for the L2s, Base and Arbitrum lead the charge, with Base taking roughly 25 to 30% share and Arbitrum claiming 15%, while others trail far behind. Ethereum still dominates NFT trading volume, with a share of over 80%. zkSync is second in the L2 front, with a 10% ‚Äì 15% share, followed by Base (3.5%) and Blast (2.5%). Base has proven to be a high performer in revenue and profit, while Arbitrum has maintained a positively consistent metric across nearly all metrics. As the report shows, Base and Arbitrum aren‚Äôt alone at the top; a few L2 blockchains, such as zkSync, Scroll, Linea, Blast, and Optimism, excel at certain metrics. The future of L2 blockchains on Ethereum The report also reflects an increase in the performance and usage of L2 blockchains, echoing the sentiments of Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder, who said that the future of the Ethereum blockchain is tied to L2 scaling solutions. Lubin said this at the Digital Asset Summit, adding that Ethereum‚Äôs security and developed infrastructure make it the best foundation for improving networks, allowing developers to build without the need for a new layer-1 network. However, there‚Äôs no absolute agreement with Lubin‚Äôs position as investors consider L2 blockchains as parasitic to the Ethereum L1 blockchain, citing that L2 blockchains adds little value to the L1 blockchain compared to the value they derive from Ethereum. Given the usage data and metrics available, there‚Äôs no doubt that L2 blockchains on Ethereum are here to stay, and the only way forward will be for both layers to forge a mutually beneficial pact.

This week‚Äôs highlights come from Argentina, which recently granted Crypto.com operating approval. Meanwhile, Hellium installed 100 mobile hotspots in Mexico. The National Securities Commission (CNV) of Argentina has approved Crypto.com to operate as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), according to their official website. This achievement is a crucial milestone for the organization, as they continue to pursue a complete operating license under the new restrictions published on March 14. Alain Yacine, president of Crypto.com for Latin America, expressed delight in the achievement and enthusiasm for giving Argentine customers and merchants a safer and more comprehensive crypto trading experience. The Latin American market, notably Argentina, is quickly increasing bitcoin usage, making it a key emphasis of Crypto.com‚Äôs growth plan. According to recent research, nearly half (46%) of Argentine respondents believe it is vital to spend cryptocurrency via a debit card, with more than half (57%) planning to invest in cryptocurrencies within the next year. Argentina has more than 10 million crypto asset accounts, indicating a strong interest in financial technology and digital currency. According to Crypto.com, local stablecoin activity makes up 61.8% of transaction volume, much exceeding the global average of 44.7%. This demonstrates a desire for financial security in an unpredictable economic climate. The expanding legal frameworks are critical for user safety, as they seek to promote transparency and protection inside Argentina‚Äôs crypto ecosystem, paving the road for a more regulated market. Helium installs 100 mobile hotspots across 18 cities in Mexico Helium is growing its network in Mexico, with the recent installation of 100 new mobile hotspots, bringing the total number to 736 across the nation. According to Cointelegraph , this big breakthrough comes after the company‚Äôs collaboration announcement with Movistar in February. Helium, noted for its decentralized wireless communication platform built on the Solana blockchain, aims to improve user connectivity and service quality while encouraging community-driven network growth. Helium has recorded a total of 281.83 GB of data moved over the last 30 days, showing strong activity in the region. Daily data transmission amounts vary greatly, with peaks surpassing 40 GB on some days and low activity on others. This variance implies that the network has a dynamic usage pattern, which is maintained by community members who contribute to its expansion by adding new hotspots and earning HNT awards for their efforts. Bitso: 39% of the crypto community in LATAM preferred stablecoins in 2024 According to Bitso‚Äôs most recent estimate, in 2024, 39% of Latin American users would turn to stablecoins as a haven in the face of economic crises such as inflation and currency depreciation. The ‚ÄúPanorama Cripto en Am√©rica Latina‚Äù report shows a considerable movement toward stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, indicating a growing demand for these assets as a hedge against economic volatility. According to Cointelegraph , this desire matches broader developments in the region‚Äôs cryptocurrency market, as more people seek out digital assets that offer stability. The research also indicates a shift in customer preferences, with Bitcoin‚Äôs percentage of sales falling from 38% in 2023 to 22% in 2024. This reduction can be ascribed to Bitcoin‚Äôs rising price and a popular investing technique among users known as ‚ÄúHODL,‚Äù in which investors keep their Bitcoin rather than sell. Other cryptocurrencies are also gaining traction, with altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana holding their positions and meme coins such as PEPE and DOGE seeing significant rises in popularity, demonstrating a wide range of interest in digital assets. Furthermore, the paper highlights major trends in key nations such as Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. In Argentina, hyperinflation and capital constraints have increased stablecoin adoption by 11%, increasing the total to 1.6 million users. Brazil‚Äôs regulatory developments and DeFi growth have resulted in stablecoins accounting for 26% of purchases, with a customer base of 1.9 million. Finally, in Colombia, the collapse of the Colombian peso has reinforced stablecoins as the preferred option among users, suggesting a regional response to economic uncertainty.

42141655,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142403,1742631957,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Step: IMF Incorporates Digital Assets Guidance into Global Statistical Standards,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/imf-digital-assets-global-standards/,"Exciting news for the crypto world! The International Monetary Fund (IMF), a major player in global finance, has just taken a significant leap into the digital age. For the first time, the IMF is officially incorporating guidance for digital assets into its globally recognized statistical standards. This is not just a minor update; it‚Äôs a monumental shift that could reshape how countries account for and regulate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Let‚Äôs dive into what this groundbreaking decision means for the future of crypto. Why is the IMF‚Äôs move on Digital Assets Guidance a Big Deal? Think of the IMF as the rulebook maker for global finance. When they set standards, countries pay attention. By including digital assets in their Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7), the IMF is providing a clear framework for how nations should statistically classify and monitor these assets. This is crucial because: Clarity and Consistency: Previously, the lack of uniform standards created a Wild West scenario, with each country interpreting and regulating crypto differently. The IMF‚Äôs guidance brings much-needed clarity and encourages consistent reporting across nations. Legitimacy Boost for Crypto: The IMF‚Äôs recognition elevates digital assets from a fringe phenomenon to a legitimate asset class worthy of international statistical attention. This can boost investor confidence and mainstream adoption. Foundation for Regulation: Sound statistics are the bedrock of effective policy and regulation. With standardized data collection, governments can make more informed decisions about cryptocurrency regulation , taxation, and economic policies related to digital assets. Global Economic Stability: As digital assets become increasingly intertwined with the global economy, proper accounting becomes vital for assessing financial stability risks. The IMF‚Äôs guidance helps in understanding and mitigating these risks. Breaking Down the IMF‚Äôs Classification of Digital Assets The IMF‚Äôs BPM7 provides a detailed categorization of different types of digital assets . Let‚Äôs break down the key classifications and understand what they mean: Bitcoin (BTC): The Non-Produced Nonfinancial Asset According to the IMF, Bitcoin (BTC) is categorized as a ‚Äúnon-produced nonfinancial asset.‚Äù What does this jargon actually mean? Non-produced: This means Bitcoin is not produced in the same way goods or services are. It‚Äôs created through a decentralized process (mining) rather than traditional production methods. Nonfinancial asset: This distinguishes Bitcoin from financial instruments like stocks or bonds. It‚Äôs seen more as a store of value or commodity-like asset in this classification. This classification implies that when Bitcoin is bought or sold, it‚Äôs recorded in the capital account as an acquisition or disposal of a non-productive asset. Think of it like trading gold or art ‚Äì it‚Äôs an exchange of value, not a financial instrument in the traditional sense. Stablecoins and Other Tokens: A Tale of Two Classifications The IMF doesn‚Äôt treat all cryptocurrencies the same. Here‚Äôs how other tokens are classified: Tokens without Liabilities (like BTC): These are also classified as capital assets, similar to Bitcoin. This generally applies to cryptocurrencies that operate without a central issuer or liability structure. Stablecoins Backed by Liabilities: Stablecoins, especially those pegged to fiat currencies and backed by reserves, are treated as ‚Äúfinancial instruments.‚Äù This is because they represent a claim against the issuer (the liability). This classification is crucial for regulatory purposes, as it brings stablecoins under the umbrella of financial regulations. Tokens with Protocols (like ETH and SOL): The IMF suggests that tokens associated with protocols or platforms, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), could be viewed as ‚Äúequity-like holdings‚Äù and classified in the financial account. This is a fascinating perspective, hinting at recognizing these tokens as representing a stake in a network or ecosystem, similar to equity in a company. Staking Rewards: Are They Dividends? The IMF also touched upon staking rewards, a key feature of many proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. They noted that staking rewards gained from holding tokens like ETH or SOL might be akin to equity dividends. This is a significant observation because: Income Classification: If staking rewards are considered dividends, they should be recorded under current account income. This has implications for taxation and how these rewards are treated in national accounts. Size and Purpose Matter: The IMF rightly points out that the classification might depend on the size and purpose of the holding. Large institutional staking might be treated differently from individual retail staking. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the IMF‚Äôs guidance is a positive step, it‚Äôs not a magic wand. There are still challenges and opportunities on the horizon: Challenges: Implementation Complexity: Translating these statistical standards into practical reporting frameworks across diverse countries will be complex. Nations have varying levels of technical capacity and regulatory structures. Evolving Crypto Landscape: The crypto world is incredibly dynamic. New types of digital assets and financial instruments are constantly emerging. The IMF will need to continuously update its guidance to keep pace with innovation. Data Collection Hurdles: Gathering accurate and consistent data on decentralized and often cross-border digital assets will be a significant challenge for statistical agencies worldwide. Opportunities: Enhanced Transparency: The IMF‚Äôs framework can foster greater transparency in the digital assets space, making it easier to track flows of funds and understand the economic impact of crypto. Improved Cross-Border Coordination: With a common statistical language, international cooperation on cryptocurrency regulation and combating illicit activities can be significantly enhanced. Mainstream Integration: Clearer statistical standards pave the way for smoother integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system, potentially unlocking new economic opportunities. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, how does this IMF guidance affect you, whether you‚Äôre a crypto investor, a business, or just curious about the space? For Crypto Investors: This news signals growing institutional acceptance of digital assets . It could lead to more regulated and mature markets in the long run. Keep an eye on how your country adopts and implements these standards, as it could affect taxation and reporting requirements. For Crypto Businesses: Prepare for increased scrutiny and reporting obligations. Understanding the IMF‚Äôs classifications and potential national implementations will be crucial for compliance and strategic planning. For Policymakers: The IMF‚Äôs BPM7 provides a valuable toolkit for developing effective cryptocurrency regulation . Leverage this guidance to create balanced frameworks that foster innovation while mitigating risks. The Road Ahead for Digital Assets and Global Standards The IMF incorporating digital assets guidance into its global statistical standards is a truly pivotal moment. It marks a significant step towards bringing clarity, legitimacy, and structure to the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. While challenges remain, the opportunities for enhanced transparency, better regulation, and mainstream integration are immense. As the world increasingly embraces digital finance, the IMF‚Äôs framework will serve as a crucial foundation for navigating this exciting new frontier.

After recently attempting to break back above the psychological $90,000 level, the asset has pulled back again. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $83,239, down 2.2% over the past 24 hours and nearly 23% below its all-time high above $109,000 reached in January. Despite this, some analysts suggest underlying indicators may point toward a potential market rebound if specific conditions align. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back‚ÄîCould This Be the Catalyst for the Next Rally? Stablecoin Trends Offer Insight into Bitcoin Market Liquidity Crypto Dan, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform shared an analysis titled ‚ÄúComparison of the March 2024 Correction and the Current Market,‚Äù focusing on the relationship between stablecoin supply and Bitcoin‚Äôs price behavior. According to Dan, the flow of stablecoins into the market can serve as a proxy for measuring potential buying power, with higher stablecoin reserves typically associated with increased purchasing capacity among market participants. Dan noted that during the March‚ÄìOctober 2024 correction phase, the supply of stablecoins remained relatively low or declined, contributing to a more prolonged bearish trend. In contrast, the current correction has been accompanied by a gradual increase in stablecoin supply, which may indicate that market participants are preparing to re-enter positions as they await favorable conditions. Dan wrote: The current market is in a state where it is ready to rise quickly whenever strong catalysts emerge. Patience remains essential in the investment market. While it is premature to declare the end of the bullish cycle, the market continues to present conditions worth monitoring closely. Notably, this upward trend in stablecoin reserves suggests that investors are not fully exiting the market but are instead adopting a wait-and-see approach, holding liquidity in stablecoins while watching for confirmation of a trend reversal. This behavior often precedes renewed buying activity when confidence begins to return. Sentiment Signals Shift on Binance as Ratio Turns Positive Another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, analyzed the Taker Buy Sell Ratio on Binance‚Äîan exchange widely viewed as a leading barometer of retail and institutional sentiment due to its high trading volume. The Taker Buy Sell Ratio measures the aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers, with values above 1.00 indicating that buyers are initiating more trades than sellers. Kesmeci observed that this ratio has been steadily forming higher lows over the past ten days and recently transitioned from the negative to the positive zone. Related Reading: This Bear Market Indicator Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed For Crash To $40,000, Here‚Äôs When This shift could suggest that sentiment among active traders is improving, potentially setting the stage for upward price movement if this trend continues.

The presale of its native PEPX token starts on Monday 24th March at 11 am UTC, lasting for 90 days . And this bold meme coin infrastructure play already has traders circling the date in their diaries. In recent months, the ailing pump.fun has faced repeated scandals , with revenue tanking 95% in March . And now, the team behind PepeX intends to deliver the final blow to the former fair launch king. Here‚Äôs how. Pump.fun is dying For well over a year, pump.fun has been the platform for any meme coin speculator to find their next moonshot. But in truth, the platform has been in steep‚Äîlikely terminal‚Äîdecline for the past several months. Daily revenue has been falling faster than Putin‚Äôs presidential rivals, down to $791,500 from a January peak of $15.38 million. And the main reason is obvious: investors are sick to death of disappointment. Every 24 hours , 10,417 tokens are launched on pump.fun, and 9,912 become defunct. Equally depressing is the fact that the average lifespan of meme coins on pump.fun is 12 days, while 15% die within a single day . Meanwhile, it has become clear why only 0.04% of pump.fun traders make money: the platform‚Äôs core mechanics are slanted in favor of insiders and snipers. This is the status quo PepeX is making a stand against. PepeX‚Äôs coordinated attack on pump.fun PepeX has carefully observed the gaps in pump.fun‚Äôs offer and has created a democratized, AI-enhanced challenger. In response, the platform features an extensive range of investor protections, from anti-sniping tech and liquidity locks to fully transparent bubble maps that show exactly who owns what. The aim is to put the ‚Äòfair‚Äô back in ‚Äòfair launches,‚Äô giving everyone an equal opportunity to ape into the next big meme coin rather than favoring the insiders. Even more radically, PepeX is implementing a cap on token allocations for meme coin creators at 5%. This, in theory, ends founder price manipulation and rapid dumping for good. With the remaining 95% spread out among the community, the market can decide precisely what the token is worth. There‚Äôs even a $500 minimum deposit for fair launchers. This is designed to keep out any time wasters conjuring up piles of spam tokens and save investors from having to wade through what feels like the trillionth DOGE derivative. All this presents investors with an interesting future; every meme coin on PepeX promises to be there for a reason, firmly in the hands of the community. AI turns it up a gear PepeX‚Äôs aptly named ‚ÄòMoonshot Engine‚Äô uses AI to turn great ideas into fully fledged meme coin projects. This essentially adds buckets more efficiency to the token creation process. Simply upload an image, choose a ticker, and with some AI prompting, the platform can build the ultimate meme coin. Tokenomics, anti-sniping code, marketing assets‚Äîit‚Äôs all taken care of. AuditGPT even allows creators to add a sheen of legitimacy to their fresh-faced token. The knock-on effects of this streamlined process could be seismic. Now anyone can theoretically create projects that legitimately rival established, VC-backed players. How far could PepeX go? All this begs the question: could PepeX go the way of other major launchpads and meme coin infrastructure plays like say, Virtuals or Hyperliquid? Projects that have claimed gains of as much as 15,000% and +700% , respectively. There‚Äôs no doubt that the $2 trillion crypto market could be about to see a major development as more institutions begin taking crypto seriously. And now that there‚Äôs finally a fair launch platform offering the masses what they want, early PEPX adopters could see strong long-term buy pressure for PEPX in 2025. Plus, with 311% gains available in the presale alone, this is definitely one to keep an eye on.

The network includes Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs, the latter taking the lead in campaign spending, according to a March 21 report from Politico . Defend American Jobs has launched a $1.2 million ad campaign in support of Florida State Senator Randy Fine, who is running to fill the seat vacated by Michael Waltz. Rep. Michael Waltz Resigns to Serve as Trump‚Äôs National Security Adviser Waltz resigned to become President Donald Trump‚Äôs national security adviser. Fine has voiced support for digital innovation, stating on X in January, ‚ÄúFloridians want crypto innovation!‚Äù and emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity in the space. The PAC is also spending $345,000 to support Jimmy Patronis, Florida‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer, in his bid to replace former Representative Matt Gaetz, who briefly accepted a nomination to serve as U.S. Attorney General before withdrawing. Patronis has previously advocated for exploring state investment in digital assets, requesting a feasibility report on using retirement funds for crypto-related investments. Both Fine and Patronis secured victories in their primary elections, with Defend American Jobs spending over $500,000 on Fine‚Äôs campaign and $200,000 on Patronis, according to Federal Election Commission filings. FAIRSHAKE PAC DEPLOYS $700K FOR CRYPTO-FRIENDLY CANDIDATES IN FLORIDA Fairshake supports Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine in races pivotal to the Republican agenda. This move aligns with Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto appointments, further embedding blockchain in political discourse.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/tcuLNWDJc4 ‚Äî IBC Group Official (@ibcgroupio) January 18, 2025 While the crypto-focused Super PAC Fairshake often supports candidates from both parties, Defend American Jobs has focused nearly all of its financial support on Republican candidates, according to OpenSecrets. The group has raised and spent approximately $60 million between 2023 and 2024. Currently, the U.S. House of Representatives has four vacant seats, including the two in Florida. A full sweep by Democrats would narrow the Republican majority to just one seat, raising the stakes for the April 1 elections. A Shifting Regulatory Landscape Last month, U.S. lawmakers overturned the ‚ÄúDeFi broker rule ,‚Äù a regulation that would require decentralized exchanges and other digital asset brokers to report transaction details to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The push to repeal the DeFi broker rule came amid a broader shift in U.S. crypto regulation following the Republican Party‚Äôs control of both the Senate and the House. With hundreds of pro-crypto candidates winning seats in Congress, many industry leaders speculate that the U.S. government could become the most crypto-friendly administration in history. The political shift has already had an impact. Throughout February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped multiple enforcement actions against crypto firms, signaling a change in regulatory tone. As reported, cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department‚Äôs focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump.

Understanding market sentiment is crucial, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a vital tool for gauging the emotional temperature of the crypto market. Let‚Äôs dive into the latest reading and what it signifies for your crypto investments. Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Glimmer of Hope or Still in the Fear Zone? As of March 22nd, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely tracked metric by Alternative.me , registered a score of 32. This marks a slight uptick of one point from the previous day. While any improvement is welcome, it‚Äôs important to note that the index remains firmly entrenched in the ‚ÄúFear‚Äù zone. This indicates that market participants are still exhibiting significant anxiety and caution in the cryptocurrency space. Decoding the Crypto Sentiment: What Does ‚ÄòFear‚Äô Really Mean? The Fear and Greed Index is not just a random number; it‚Äôs a composite score designed to reflect the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale of 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear ‚Äì Suggests investors are extremely worried, potentially indicating a market bottom or oversold conditions. 25-49: Fear ‚Äì Indicates caution and risk aversion among investors, often seen during market corrections or uncertainty. 50-74: Greed ‚Äì Points to increasing optimism and potential for market growth, but also carries the risk of overvaluation. 75-100: Extreme Greed ‚Äì Signals excessive optimism and a potential market bubble, often preceding corrections. Currently, with the index at 32, we are still in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô territory. This implies that while there might be some positive momentum pushing the index up slightly, the overarching feeling in the crypto market is still one of apprehension. Investors are likely hesitant to make bold moves and are prioritizing risk management. Unpacking the Factors: How is the Bitcoin Fear Index Calculated? To provide a holistic view of market sentiment, the Bitcoin fear index (which is used as a proxy for the broader crypto market sentiment) considers a range of diverse factors, each contributing a specific weightage to the final score. These factors are: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can indicate fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Examines Bitcoin‚Äôs market momentum and trading volume compared to recent averages. High buying volume suggests greed, while low volume can signal fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment on social media platforms, particularly Twitter and Reddit, to gauge public opinion on Bitcoin and the crypto market. Surveys (15%): Conducts weekly crypto polls to understand investor sentiment directly. This provides a snapshot of how traders and investors are feeling. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during fearful times, while decreasing dominance might suggest a higher risk appetite. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches like ‚ÄúBitcoin price manipulation‚Äù or ‚ÄúBitcoin crash‚Äù can indicate fear. Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment: Why Does It Matter to You? Understanding cryptocurrency market sentiment , as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, can offer valuable insights for both short-term traders and long-term investors. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important: Identifying Potential Buying Opportunities: Extreme Fear levels can sometimes present buying opportunities. When everyone is fearful, assets can become undervalued, potentially setting the stage for future price appreciation. Recognizing Potential Selling Opportunities: Conversely, Extreme Greed levels might signal an overheated market. Recognizing this can help investors take profits and reduce risk before potential corrections. Gauging Market Mood: The index provides a quick snapshot of the prevailing market mood, helping you understand the overall psychology driving price movements. Informed Decision Making: By incorporating sentiment analysis into your strategy, you can make more informed trading and investment decisions, rather than solely relying on technical or fundamental analysis. Navigating Fear: Challenges and Considerations While the Fear and Greed Index is a helpful tool, it‚Äôs essential to remember its limitations: Not a Crystal Ball: The index is not a foolproof predictor of market movements. It reflects sentiment, which can be volatile and influenced by unforeseen events. Lagging Indicator: Sentiment can sometimes lag behind actual market changes. It‚Äôs crucial to use it in conjunction with other indicators and analysis methods. Oversimplification: Reducing complex market emotions to a single number can be an oversimplification. Deeper analysis of the underlying factors is always recommended. Market Manipulation: Sentiment itself can be manipulated, particularly in the crypto market. Be wary of relying solely on sentiment-based indicators. Actionable Insights: How to Use the Fear & Greed Index So, how can you effectively use the Fear and Greed Index in your crypto strategy? Combine with Technical Analysis: Use the index to confirm signals from technical indicators. For instance, if technical analysis suggests a potential bottom, and the index is in ‚ÄòExtreme Fear,‚Äô it might strengthen the buy signal. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): During periods of ‚ÄòFear‚Äô or ‚ÄòExtreme Fear,‚Äô consider employing DCA to gradually build your positions, potentially benefiting from lower prices. Manage Risk: In ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô or ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zones, consider taking profits, tightening stop-loss orders, or reducing your overall portfolio risk. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor the index and understand the factors driving sentiment changes. This will help you contextualize the index readings and make more informed decisions. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism or Lingering Doubt? The slight rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 32 offers a sliver of hope, suggesting that the extreme pessimism may be easing slightly. However, the market remains in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone, indicating that significant caution is still warranted. As an investor, staying informed, understanding market sentiment, and using tools like the Fear & Greed Index can empower you to navigate the crypto landscape more effectively. Remember to combine sentiment analysis with your own research and risk management strategies for informed and balanced decision-making in this exciting yet unpredictable market.

Half of the funds‚Äî$500 million‚Äîare expected to be dedicated to early-stage crypto startups, while the remaining $500 million will be allocated to late-stage investments in the digital asset space. The effort, if successful, would mark one of the largest crypto-focused capital raises in recent years. Haun Ventures Rose to Prominence in 2022 With $1.5B Debut Fund Founded in 2022 by Katie Haun, a former federal prosecutor and ex-Coinbase board member, Haun Ventures previously made headlines with its impressive $1.5 billion debut fund, launched during more favorable market conditions. Despite setting a lower target this time due to shifting market dynamics, sources suggest Haun expects both new funds to be oversubscribed. The firm has drawn talent from major tech firms, including Airbnb, Coinbase, and Google‚Äôs Jigsaw, and remains active in the crypto venture scene. Most recently, Haun Ventures participated in Bitwise‚Äôs $70 million fundraising round, alongside major investors like Electric Capital, MassMutual, and the MIT Investment Management Company. The current fundraising round is expected to close by June, potentially ranking as one of the largest crypto VC raises since 2022. Comparable efforts include Paradigm‚Äôs $850 million fund closed in June 2024 and Pantera Capital‚Äôs $1 billion blockchain fund drive announced in April. Haun Ventures to raise $1B for new crypto funds Former federal prosecutor Katie Haun is raising $1 billion across two new crypto funds through Haun Ventures, according to Fortune. Set to close in June, the funds will mirror the firm's 2022 structure, with $500 million allocated‚Ä¶ ‚Äî CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) March 21, 2025 While Haun Ventures has not disclosed the specific investment focus of the upcoming funds, market analysts anticipate that stablecoins will remain a key area of interest in 2025. Although crypto VC funding reached $13.6 billion in 2024, analysts like Infinity Hedge predict a moderate rebound in 2025‚Äîstill below the $33.8 billion peak in 2021. Crypto VC Funding Rebounds in February, Surging 14.4% Despite Yearly Decline The crypto venture capital (VC) market experienced a strong recovery in February 2025, with total investment volume increasing 14.4% month-over-month, according to a report by Wu Blockchain. A total of 98 publicly disclosed crypto VC deals took place, up from 86 in January. However, despite the monthly growth, funding remained 35.1% lower compared to February 2024, when 151 projects secured investments. Total capital inflows reached $951 million in February, marking a sharp increase from $831 million in January and a 24.3% rise from $765 million recorded a year earlier. The stablecoin sector and payment solutions emerged as the primary investment targets, reflecting the industry‚Äôs shift toward financial infrastructure and transactional stability. Among the top-funded projects, Raise, a gift card startup, secured $63 million in a strategic funding round to integrate crypto payments and stablecoin transactions into its platform. Meanwhile, Plasma, a blockchain firm specializing in stablecoin networks, raised $24 million in its first funding round. As reported, Kaito AI has ranked Paradigm as the top-performing crypto VC firm over the past 12 months, posting an 11.80% performance metric. The firm leads ahead of Alliance (10.64%), Dragonfly (8.32%), a16z (6.94%), and Multicoin Capital (5.86%), which round out the top five.

The 15-minute chart shows a sharp rejection from this level, accelerating downside pressure, while the 1-hour chart confirms a decisive break below the uptrend line. With selling pressure intensifying, XLM is now clinging to the crucial $0.2770 support, a level that could dictate its next major move. Bearish Scenario: Breakdown Could Trigger a Drop to $0.2612 Bears are relentlessly testing $0.2770, signaling growing weakness. A firm break below this support could unleash further selling, driving XLM toward the next key level at $0.2612. If bearish momentum persists and buyers fail to defend this zone, XLM could see an even steeper decline, shaking market confidence. A breakdown at $0.2620 might open the door for a deeper correction, forcing bulls into a defensive stance. Bullish Scenario: Buyers Aim for Recovery Above $0.2900 Despite the prevailing sell pressure, bulls have a fighting chance if they can hold $0.2770. A strong rebound from this level could send XLM climbing toward $0.2900. Breaking above this resistance would weaken the bearish outlook, potentially shifting momentum in favor of the bulls. If buying interest intensifies, XLM could surge beyond $0.2950, signaling a sustained recovery and reigniting optimism in the market.

Pi Coin maintains its current price at $0.90 as market fluctuations have caused its value to decrease more than 40% in the past week. The market decline arises primarily from worsening negative investor attitudes and claims of scams. Recent trading hours show a 7% price improvement in Pi, although market participants continue to express worries about its future. Will it hit ATH again? Pi Network Price Crashed Below $1 Amid Scam Allegations, Is ATH Still Possible for Pi Coin? The price of Pi Network coins experienced a severe decline as it dropped from $3.00 to $0.87, resulting in a 67% value depreciation within a brief timeframe. Many members within the community intensified their debates to label the Pi Network as both a scam and fraudulent activity after its steep price drop. Critics assert that the system operates unjustly based on their observations of an ongoing negative pattern even after societal attempts to ‚Äúbuy the dip.‚Äù Since its ATH was achieved twenty-four days ago the digital coin has displayed gradual depreciation. Many Pi Network supporters doubt if the coin will return to its previous peak levels as they view its current downward trajectory with skepticism. Despite repeated criticism there still exist people who anticipate the system may eventually recover. The Pi Network has become popular and anticipates its forthcoming exchange listing at Binance that would boost its status. PI Coin recently recovered strongly when it jumped above 60 percent from its all-time price low during the previous month. The path toward reaching a fresh all-time high remains obscure. Many investors show hesitation because of steady price volatility and increasing doubts within the crypto community. The vague path ahead makes investors reluctant to add more money to the coin since its uncertain trajectory scares them away from more losses.

The PI Coin price stabilized at $0.997 following a 7% recovery from its recent market low. The coin experienced a substantial downtrend before it reached various support points, resulting in its latest price move. The crypto market is still struggling to recover, with BTC hovering above $84k and ETH price trading around $1,980. The other top coins are moving in sideways trend, with both bearish and bullish in play. The point of resistance for PI Coin currently stands at $1.1934 because this figure serves as an essential barrier that affects all upward price movements. The price can advance to $1.4280 after breaking through successful resistance at $1.1934. The coin encounters decreasing resistance levels that might hinder its ability to accomplish gains at this time. The recent downward of PI Coin price prediction caused it to fall beneath the $0.8588 value, confirming a sustained negative trend. The price will move toward the $0.6900 support area unless it manages to rise above current levels. Additional price reductions would push the market value towards the $0.6479 support zone before it possibly reaches the $0.6020 and $0.5700 support levels. To sum up, despite minor improvements from its bottom point the future of Pi Coin remains unclear for investors. Investors doubt whether Pi Coin will once again achieve new peak values due to market volatility alongside scam accusations.

42142420,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142380,1742633109,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether‚Äôs Bold Move: Engaging ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô for USDT Audit ‚Äì A New Era of Transparency?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-usdt-big-four-audit/,"In a potentially groundbreaking move for the stablecoin sector, Tether (USDT), the issuer of the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin, has announced it is in discussions with a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô accounting firm for a comprehensive audit. This revelation, shared by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino with Reuters, signals a significant step towards greater transparency for a company that has faced persistent scrutiny over the verification of its dollar reserves. Why is a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô Audit a Big Deal for Tether and USDT Reserves? For years, Tether has navigated a landscape of skepticism, primarily due to the lack of a full, publicly available audit from a top-tier accounting firm. Critics have long questioned whether USDT, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, truly holds sufficient reserves to back its circulating supply. This lack of transparency has cast a shadow over the entire stablecoin market, with concerns ranging from systemic risk to investor protection. Engaging a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô firm ‚Äì Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, or PricewaterhouseCoopers ‚Äì represents a potential turning point. These firms are globally recognized for their rigorous auditing standards and independence. An audit from one of these giants could provide a level of assurance that Tether‚Äôs previous reserve reports have not achieved. Let‚Äôs break down why this is so crucial: Enhanced Trust and Credibility: A ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô audit can significantly boost trust in Tether and USDT. Their reputation for thoroughness and impartiality carries weight in financial markets. Addressing Regulatory Concerns: Regulators worldwide are increasingly focused on stablecoins. A verified audit could proactively address regulatory concerns and potentially pave the way for wider USDT adoption in regulated environments. Market Confidence: Transparency is paramount in the volatile crypto market. A ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô audit could inject much-needed confidence, potentially attracting more institutional and retail investors to USDT. Industry Standard Setting: If Tether successfully undergoes a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô audit, it could set a new standard for transparency within the stablecoin industry, pushing competitors to follow suit. What are the Challenges and Potential Roadblocks for Tether‚Äôs Crypto Audit? While the announcement is promising, the path to a completed ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô audit is not without potential hurdles. Let‚Äôs consider some of the challenges: Complexity of Tether‚Äôs Reserves: Tether‚Äôs reserves are known to include not just cash and cash equivalents, but also other assets like corporate bonds, loans, and even Bitcoin. Auditing such a diverse and sometimes opaque portfolio can be complex and time-consuming for any accounting firm. Audit Scope and Depth: The devil is in the details. The scope of the audit will be critical. Will it be a full attestation of all reserves, or a more limited engagement? The depth and breadth of the audit will determine its impact on public perception. Timeframe and Completion: Engaging with a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô firm is just the first step. Completing a comprehensive audit can take considerable time. The market will be watching closely for updates and timelines. Delays could breed further speculation. Potential Findings: Audits are designed to uncover discrepancies, if any exist. There is always a possibility that the audit could reveal findings that require Tether to make adjustments to its reserve management or disclosures. How Tether handles any potential findings will be crucial for maintaining trust. Simon McWilliams as CFO: A Strategic Hire for Stablecoin Transparency? Adding another layer to this narrative is Tether‚Äôs recent appointment of Simon McWilliams as its new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). McWilliams brings over 20 years of experience auditing large asset managers. This strategic hire can be interpreted as a clear signal of Tether‚Äôs commitment to strengthening its financial processes and paving the way for more rigorous audits. His expertise will likely be invaluable in navigating the complexities of a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô audit. How does McWilliams‚Äô background align with Tether‚Äôs transparency goals? Area McWilliams‚Äô Expertise Relevance to Tether‚Äôs Audit Auditing Large Asset Managers Experience in verifying complex financial statements and asset portfolios. Crucial for auditing Tether‚Äôs diverse reserve holdings. Financial Reporting Deep understanding of accounting standards and regulatory requirements. Essential for ensuring Tether‚Äôs financial reporting meets ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô scrutiny. Risk Management Familiar with identifying and mitigating financial risks in complex organizations. Important for strengthening Tether‚Äôs risk management framework in anticipation of audits and regulatory oversight. The Future of USDT Reserves and Stablecoin Transparency: What to Expect? Tether‚Äôs engagement with a ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô accounting firm is a significant development in the ongoing quest for stablecoin transparency. While challenges remain, this move signals a potential shift towards greater accountability in the stablecoin space. The outcome of these discussions and the subsequent audit (if completed) will be closely watched by the crypto community, regulators, and traditional financial institutions alike. For investors and users of USDT, this news offers a glimmer of hope for increased confidence in the stablecoin. For the broader crypto market, it could represent a crucial step towards maturity and mainstream adoption. Ultimately, the success of this endeavor hinges on the completion of a comprehensive and transparent audit that satisfies market expectations and regulatory demands. The coming months will be critical in determining whether Tether‚Äôs ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô engagement truly marks a new era of transparency for USDT and the stablecoin ecosystem.

That‚Äôs not some random hype‚Äîit‚Äôs the biggest retail buying streak by dollar amount in more than ten years, according to JPMorgan. Emma Wu, a strategist there, said , ‚ÄúWhile this is not the longest consecutive streak of retail buying in TSLA, it is the highest magnitude among all past ‚Äòbuying streaks‚Äô in over a decade.‚Äù Retail is clearly still deep in buy-the-dip mode.

Insiders dump hundreds of millions while retail buys the dip Since November, Tesla insiders have sold off $335.2 million worth of stock. The group includes board members, the CFO, and even Kimbal Elon, Elon‚Äôs brother. Most of those shares were unloaded when the price was between $300 and $400. Meanwhile, the stock was sitting at $242 as of Friday. James Murdoch, a Tesla board director, sold $12.9 million worth of shares on March 10 at around $240 per share. While insiders took profits, Elon Musk tried to keep morale alive. Speaking to employees during a town hall Thursday evening, he said, ‚ÄúIf you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can‚Äôt walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù He urged staff to hold their shares, saying the real value will show when autonomous driving hits the market. ‚ÄúSo what I am saying is, ‚ÄòHang on to your stock,‚Äô‚Äù Elon told employees. That didn‚Äôt stop the bleeding on the chart though. Even with a 40% gain over the past year, Tesla shares have still crashed 40% in 2025 alone, hit by weak sales and market fears. The company‚Äôs latest financials didn‚Äôt help. For Q4 2024, revenue came in at $25.71 billion, only a 2% increase, and missed forecasts of $27.26 billion. Automotive revenue dropped 8% to $19.8 billion because of cheaper vehicle prices. Operating income fell 23% to $1.6 billion, and net income collapsed 71% to $2.32 billion. That was partly due to a one-time tax benefit that helped last year‚Äôs numbers look better. The company also saw its first yearly drop in deliveries, with just under 1.8 million vehicles shipped for 2024. High valuation draws criticism as RSI hits oversold levels Tesla‚Äôs forward P/E ratio is now sitting at 92.4x, compared to the sector average of 15.1x. That‚Äôs a massive gap, and with slowing growth and rising competition, some investors are asking how long the company can justify that kind of premium. But not everyone‚Äôs bearish. Rich Ross at Evercore ISI said the stock is in an ‚Äúextremely oversold condition.‚Äù He pointed to a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 32, which is way down from its former peak of 72. ‚ÄúWhen you have a trillion-dollar company with a 32 RSI and a market cap that has decreased by 55%, that‚Äôs an extremely oversold condition,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúThe risk-reward scenario becomes quite appealing given the extreme levels in terms of price and momentum.‚Äù But outside of stock charts, the brand is getting attacked on the ground. Boycotts, protests, vandalism, and arson have hit Tesla showrooms, EVs, and charging stations in both the U.S. and Europe. These moves have been tied to Elon‚Äôs involvement in the Trump White House, which continues to stir backlash. Elon pushes tech vision as trade risks and sales decline hit Elon spent most of the town hall promoting what‚Äôs coming next. He claimed that a future with robotaxis, AI, and humanoid robots will change everything. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most exciting future that you could possibly imagine?‚Äù he asked employees. Then he answered: ‚ÄúA future of abundance for all,‚Äù where people ‚Äúcould literally just have anything you want.‚Äù He also bragged about the Model Y, saying it would be the best-selling car on Earth again this year, and called it ‚Äúavailable worldwide.‚Äù The Cybertruck, despite getting hit with a massive recall the same day, was still promoted by Elon as the top-selling fully electric pickup, and he said it scored a 5-star crash rating. He also gave a shoutout to Tesla employees who helped get the refreshed Model Y to market, saying supply chains across three continents made it hard, but they pulled through. He hyped the upcoming Cybercab, a two-seater with no steering wheel or brakes, which will eventually run on Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi software via an update. That‚Äôs a promise Elon has been making since 2016, when he said Tesla owners would be able to take a driverless road trip across the U.S. by the end of 2018. That never happened. Tesla‚Äôs sales are also slipping. New vehicle sales are falling in Europe, China, and parts of the U.S. The company is facing more problems due to tariffs put in place by President Trump through executive orders. These hit materials from Canada, Mexico, and China‚Äîall key supply sources for Tesla‚Äôs production. According to Edmunds, more Tesla owners are trading in their EVs than ever before. That data lines up with the broader frustration being felt in the market and on the streets. Still, on Friday, Tesla stock jumped 5.3% to $248.71 after Elon‚Äôs team meeting. Elon tried to offer some kind of hope. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult like for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rearview mirror ‚Äî which is most people ‚Äî to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to ten times the usefulness,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so profound and there‚Äôs no comparison with anything in the past that it does not compute. But it will compute in the future.‚Äù Whether Wall Street buys that story or not is a different question. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The move comes amid growing industry pressure for transparency, especially in light of past controversies surrounding the company‚Äôs claims. Speaking to Reuters on March 21 , Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that a full audit is a top priority for the firm. Tether CEO Says Trump‚Äôs Pro-Crypto Stance Could Ease Audit Process Ardoino noted that the process could be smoother under the pro-crypto stance of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has signaled support for greater integration of digital assets. ‚ÄúIf the President of the United States says this is top priority for the US, Big Four auditing firms will have to listen,‚Äù he stated. While Ardoino confirmed ongoing discussions with one of the four major firms ‚Äî PwC, EY, Deloitte, or KPMG ‚Äî he did not specify which was involved. Tether currently publishes quarterly attestations, but these fall short of a full independent annual audit, which would provide stronger assurance to regulators and investors. Tether‚Äôs USDT is designed to maintain a stable value pegged to the U.S. dollar, claiming each token is backed by a reserve made up of cash, equivalents, and other assets. Critics, however, have long questioned the accuracy and completeness of these claims. Tether just released the attestation for Q4 2024. Highlights as of 31st December 2024: ‚Äì $13.7 billion profit for year 2024 ‚Äì ~$6 billion profit for Q4 2024 ‚Äì $113 billion in direct and indirect holdings ‚Äì $7 billion in Tether's excess stablecoin reserves (36% increase YoY),‚Ä¶ https://t.co/izYONstKuF ‚Äî Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) January 31, 2025 To strengthen its financial operations, Tether recently hired Simon McWilliams as Chief Financial Officer, signaling a more serious approach to conducting a full audit. In September 2024, critics like Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons labeled Tether a major threat to the crypto ecosystem, citing the lack of independent verification of its reserves. His concerns echoed the findings of Consumers‚Äô Research, a watchdog that also questioned Tether‚Äôs transparency. Tether was previously fined $41 million in 2021 by the CFTC for misrepresenting its reserve backing. More recently, it has pushed back against European regulations under MiCA, which prompted exchanges like Crypto.com to delist USDT and other tokens. Tether Engages With U.S. Lawmakers to Shape Federal Stablecoin Regulations Last month, it was revealed that Tether has engaged with U.S. lawmakers to help shape federal regulations for the stablecoin sector. As reported, the company has been in discussions with Representatives Bryan Steil and French Hill, key figures behind the STABLE Act introduced on Feb. 6. Ardoino reportedly confirmed that the company is also seeking to contribute to two additional stablecoin bills proposed by other legislators. More recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell affirmed the central bank‚Äôs support for developing a regulatory framework around stablecoins during a Senate hearing on February 11. Powell stated that the Federal Reserve supports the creation of a regulatory framework for stablecoins , noting the importance of protecting consumers and savers.

42142623,https://coinpedia.org/?p=435804,1742633389,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Solana (SOL) vs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Which Crypto Are Whales Accumulating?,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/solana-sol-vs-mutuum-finance-mutm-which-crypto-are-whales-accumulating/,"The post Solana (SOL) vs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Which Crypto Are Whales Accumulating? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As institutional investors and crypto whales continue to adjust their portfolios, the competition between established blockchain networks and emerging projects intensifies. Solana (SOL), a well-known high-performance blockchain, has been a popular choice for major investors. However, with new opportunities emerging in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has begun attracting significant attention. With its presale gaining momentum and utilities set to go live post-launch, many are questioning which of these two assets whales are favoring for the next growth cycle. Solana (SOL) Solana has maintained its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains, boasting low transaction fees and high throughput. Despite its strong fundamentals, SOL has faced periods of price stagnation, with on-chain activity and network growth showing mixed signals in recent months. While total value locked (TVL) in Solana-based DeFi projects has increased, user engagement across decentralized applications (dApps) has been inconsistent. Whale activity on Solana has also fluctuated, with large holders adjusting their positions based on broader market trends. While some investors continue to hold SOL as a long-term bet on blockchain scalability, others have begun diversifying into alternative assets, seeking projects with lower market caps and higher growth potential. This shift in capital allocation has led some analysts to speculate that whales may be looking beyond Solana for their next major investment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Solana remains a dominant force in the crypto space, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a promising alternative, especially among DeFi-focused investors. The project has been gaining momentum in its presale phase, with over $4.4 million raised and more than 60% of Phase 3 already completed. Currently priced at $0.02, the token is set for a 25% price increase in the next phase, driving significant demand from investors looking to enter early. Shortly after its launch, MUTM is expected to surge by 1200%, fueled by its structured financial model, growing investor demand, and increasing utility within the DeFi space. As the token becomes available on major exchanges and its lending platform goes live, analysts predict a strong price rally, making early investments highly rewarding. Mutuum Finance operates as a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, providing a sustainable financial ecosystem where users can earn passive income by supplying assets or access liquidity without selling their holdings. Unlike speculative projects, MUTM‚Äôs value is driven by real-world utility, making it an attractive option for institutional investors seeking stability alongside growth potential. One major factor contributing to whale interest in Mutuum Finance is its buy-and-distribute mechanism, which ensures continuous buy pressure and rewards long-term holders. The protocol allocates a portion of its fees to purchasing MUTM from the market, redistributing it to mtTOKEN holders. This system not only incentivizes participation but also supports price appreciation over time. Additionally, the team is preparing for a beta launch of its lending platform, set to go live alongside the token‚Äôs official listing. This early functionality ensures that MUTM will have immediate utility, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking for real-world use cases in the DeFi sector. With its structured presale, growing community, and upcoming exchange listings, analysts predict that MUTM could experience exponential growth once trading begins. Many early investors see this as an opportunity to secure holdings at a low price before broader market adoption accelerates demand. Which Crypto Are Whales Favoring? While Solana remains a well-established asset with strong fundamentals, some whale investors appear to be shifting their focus toward projects like Mutuum Finance that offer higher upside potential. With DeFi adoption continuing to expand, projects that introduce real utility and structured financial models are gaining traction among institutional investors. With MUTM expected to surge post-launch, the presale is rapidly selling out as investors look to secure their positions before wider market exposure. As more whales accumulate MUTM, it is becoming evident that this DeFi project could be one of the biggest contenders in the coming months, offering both short-term potential and long-term sustainability.

The MACD suggests weak bullish momentum, while the RSI near oversold territory indicates potential for a rebound.

FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It‚Äôs backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it‚Äôs risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value.

Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

42142887,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142414,1742633752,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: Fidelity Launches Tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund to Rival BlackRock,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fidelity-tokenized-treasury-fund-launch/,"Get ready for a thrilling showdown in the world of digital assets! Fidelity Investments, a financial giant, is poised to launch its own tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund , directly challenging BlackRock‚Äôs pioneering BUIDL fund. This exciting development, first reported by AggrNews on X, signals a significant escalation in the institutional adoption of tokenized assets and promises to reshape how investors engage with traditional financial instruments in the crypto space. What is a Tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund and Why is it Groundbreaking? Let‚Äôs break down what a tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund actually means and why it‚Äôs causing such a stir. Imagine owning a piece of U.S. government debt, one of the safest assets globally, but in a digital, easily transferable form. That‚Äôs essentially what tokenization achieves. Instead of traditional shares or bonds, investors receive digital tokens representing ownership in a fund that holds U.S. Treasury bills. Here‚Äôs why this is a groundbreaking move: Accessibility: Tokenization can lower the barriers to entry for investing in U.S. Treasuries. Traditionally, accessing these markets might involve brokerage accounts and minimum investment amounts. Tokenized funds can potentially fractionalize ownership, allowing smaller investors to participate. Efficiency and Speed: Transactions with tokens on a blockchain can be faster and more efficient than traditional settlement processes. This can lead to quicker access to funds and potentially lower transaction costs. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with set trading hours, digital assets can be traded around the clock, offering greater flexibility for investors globally. Transparency: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions, enhancing trust and security. The introduction of a tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund by Fidelity marks a crucial step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. It‚Äôs about taking a well-established, secure asset class and making it more accessible, efficient, and modern through blockchain technology. Fidelity vs. BlackRock: The Battle for Institutional Crypto Adoption Heats Up Fidelity‚Äôs entry into the tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund arena is not happening in a vacuum. It‚Äôs a direct challenge to BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, and their existing BUIDL fund. BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL, launched earlier, has already made waves in the industry, demonstrating the appetite for tokenized versions of traditional financial products. Now, with Fidelity joining the fray, the competition is set to intensify, accelerating institutional crypto adoption . This competition is healthy for the market and offers investors more choices. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what this rivalry could mean: Feature Fidelity Tokenized Fund (Expected) BlackRock BUIDL (Existing) Asset Focus U.S. Treasury Bills U.S. Treasury Bills Issuer Fidelity Investments BlackRock Competition Direct competitor to BUIDL First mover advantage Impact Potentially expands market, offers more options Established proof of concept, set industry benchmark The entrance of Fidelity, a respected and established player in traditional finance, validates the tokenization benefits and further legitimizes the concept of bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain. It signals to other institutions that tokenization is not just a niche experiment but a serious evolution in financial markets. Unveiling the Benefits of Fidelity Tokenized Fund: What‚Äôs in it for Investors? So, why should investors be excited about the potential launch of a Fidelity tokenized fund ? The advantages are multifaceted and cater to both institutional and potentially retail investors: Diversification: Adding a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund to a portfolio can offer diversification benefits, especially in volatile market conditions. U.S. Treasuries are generally considered low-risk assets. Yield Potential: While Treasury bills are low-yield, they provide a relatively stable return. Tokenized funds offer a way to access this yield within the crypto ecosystem. Integration with DeFi: Tokenized Treasuries can potentially be integrated into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, opening up new avenues for yield generation and financial applications. Imagine using your tokenized Treasury holdings as collateral in DeFi lending platforms. Simplified Access to Traditional Assets: For crypto-native investors, tokenized Treasuries offer a bridge to traditional finance without needing to navigate complex traditional brokerage systems. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that this is a developing space. Regulations are still evolving, and investors should conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with both cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. Details about Fidelity‚Äôs fund, such as fees, minimum investment, and platform, will be crucial in determining its attractiveness to investors. BlackRock BUIDL: Setting the Stage for Tokenized Assets Before Fidelity‚Äôs move, BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund already demonstrated the viability and appeal of tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund products. BUIDL, built on the Ethereum blockchain, provided a blueprint for how traditional asset managers can enter the tokenization space. Its success likely played a role in encouraging Fidelity to launch its own competing product. BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund‚Äôs existence has: Educated the Market: BUIDL helped educate both institutional and retail investors about the concept of tokenized Treasuries and their potential benefits. Established Infrastructure: Its launch contributed to the development of necessary infrastructure and regulatory discussions around tokenized real-world assets. Demonstrated Demand: The fund‚Äôs traction proved that there is genuine demand for these types of products, paving the way for more entrants like Fidelity. The competition between Fidelity and BlackRock is not just about market share; it‚Äôs about driving innovation and accelerating the adoption of tokenization across the financial industry. BlackRock‚Äôs pioneering efforts laid the groundwork, and now Fidelity is stepping in to amplify the impact. The Future is Tokenized: Exploring the Broader Implications of Tokenization Benefits The launch of a tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund by Fidelity, following BlackRock‚Äôs lead, is more than just two firms competing. It‚Äôs a powerful signal about the future of finance. Tokenization benefits extend far beyond U.S. Treasuries and can revolutionize various asset classes, including: Real Estate: Tokenizing real estate can fractionalize ownership, increase liquidity, and simplify property transactions. Commodities: Tokenized commodities can streamline supply chains, improve transparency, and facilitate easier trading. Equities: Tokenizing stocks could lead to faster settlement times, reduced costs, and potentially 24/7 trading. Private Equity and Debt: Tokenization can democratize access to private markets, making them available to a broader range of investors. The momentum behind institutional crypto adoption and tokenization is undeniable. As more financial institutions embrace this technology, we can expect to see a proliferation of tokenized assets, transforming how we invest, trade, and interact with financial markets. Fidelity‚Äôs move is a bold step into this tokenized future, promising to bring the advantages of blockchain technology to mainstream finance. In conclusion, Fidelity‚Äôs planned launch of a tokenized U.S. Treasury Fund is a groundbreaking development in the crypto and traditional finance worlds. It intensifies the competition with BlackRock, validates the concept of tokenized assets, and underscores the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption . For investors, this means more choices, potentially greater efficiency, and a glimpse into a future where traditional and digital finance are seamlessly integrated.

The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF market is heating up, and the latest data is nothing short of electrifying. On March 21st, these investment vehicles collectively pulled in a staggering $83.1 million in net inflows. This marks the sixth consecutive day of positive momentum, signaling a robust and sustained investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. Are we witnessing the dawn of a new era for crypto investment? Let‚Äôs dive into the details and uncover what‚Äôs driving this surge and what it means for the future of Bitcoin. What‚Äôs Fueling the Bitcoin ETF Inflows Frenzy? The consistent Bitcoin ETF inflows are painting a compelling picture of growing institutional and retail interest in cryptocurrencies. But what exactly is behind this bullish trend? Several factors could be at play: Increased Institutional Adoption: Major players in the financial world are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible avenue for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the digital asset. Simplified Investment Route for Retail Investors: For everyday investors, navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be daunting. Spot Bitcoin ETFs listed on traditional stock exchanges offer a familiar and straightforward way to invest in Bitcoin through brokerage accounts they already manage. Positive Market Sentiment: The overall sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has been largely positive, fueled by factors like halving anticipation, growing mainstream acceptance, and potential for future price appreciation. This positive outlook naturally attracts more investment into Bitcoin-related products like ETFs. Diversification Benefits: Investors are constantly seeking diversification to mitigate risk. Bitcoin, with its low correlation to traditional assets, presents an attractive diversification opportunity, and ETFs make it easier to incorporate Bitcoin into a diversified portfolio. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT: The Star Performer in the Spot Bitcoin ETF Arena Among the suite of Spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the U.S., BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT is emerging as a clear leader. On March 21st, IBIT alone raked in a remarkable $105 million in net inflows. This impressive figure underscores BlackRock‚Äôs brand recognition, its extensive distribution network, and the confidence investors have in its ETF management capabilities. IBIT‚Äôs consistent positive inflows are a testament to its growing popularity and its role in attracting significant capital into the Bitcoin market. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC: Navigating Outflows Amidst Overall Growth While the overall trend for Bitcoin ETF inflows is overwhelmingly positive, Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC continues to experience net outflows. On March 21st, GBTC saw a net outflow of $21.9 million. This outflow is a continuation of a trend that began when GBTC converted from a trust to an ETF. Several factors contribute to these outflows: Factor Description Higher Fees: GBTC‚Äôs management fees are comparatively higher than newer spot Bitcoin ETFs, making competitors like IBIT more attractive from a cost perspective. Profit Taking: Investors who held GBTC shares prior to its ETF conversion may be taking profits, especially after the significant price appreciation of Bitcoin. Rotation to Lower-Fee ETFs: Some investors might be rotating out of GBTC and into lower-fee spot Bitcoin ETFs to optimize their investment returns. Despite the outflows, GBTC remains a significant player in the Bitcoin ETF space, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin. The outflows, while noteworthy, need to be viewed in the context of the overall robust inflows into the broader spot Bitcoin ETF market. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin and Crypto Investments? The sustained Bitcoin ETF inflows are undeniably a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency market. They indicate: Increased Liquidity: ETFs enhance liquidity in the Bitcoin market by providing an easily tradable instrument. Price Support: Consistent inflows can create buying pressure, potentially supporting and driving up the price of Bitcoin. Mainstream Legitimacy: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs further solidifies Bitcoin‚Äôs position as a mainstream asset class, attracting a wider range of investors. Catalyst for Further Innovation: The ETF success could pave the way for more innovative crypto investment products and further integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape For investors considering Bitcoin ETF investments, here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence is Key: Research different spot Bitcoin ETFs, compare their fees, track records, and custodians. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin and crypto investments are inherently volatile. Assess your risk appetite before allocating capital. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin ETFs are best viewed as long-term investments within a diversified portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, regulatory developments, and news impacting the crypto space to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Powerful Wave of Institutional Adoption The $83.1 million net inflow into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 21st is more than just a number; it represents a powerful wave of institutional and retail adoption washing over the cryptocurrency market. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT is leading the charge, while even Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, despite outflows, remains a significant force. As inflows continue and market maturity progresses, spot Bitcoin ETFs are poised to play an increasingly crucial role in shaping the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem. The excitement is palpable, and the journey has just begun.

MakroVision notes that XRP has managed to break above the falling trend lines but has yet to gain a solid foothold above $2.48. A decisive break beyond the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $2.58 could signal a bullish reversal. The analytics firm listed the key price levels to watch for XRP as follows: $2.58 ‚Äì $2.65: A critical zone; a breakout of this range could unlock further upside potential. $2.80 (Golden Pocket): A strong resistance level that could lead to price rejection. $2.19 ‚Äì $2.23: A key support range; a pullback to this level would be considered normal. However, a breakout could weaken XRP further. $2.03: A critical threshold; falling below this level would increase the risk of a deeper sell-off.

Reflecting on the matter, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has expressed concerns that the administration‚Äôs apparent preference for Bitcoin may hinder its goal of leading crypto innovation. XRP News: How Will Trump Government‚Äôs Bitcoin Preference Affect US Goal? Despite the enthusiasm surrounding President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto objectives and pledges, there‚Äôs growing uncertainty about his plans‚Äô limitations and potential drawbacks. While Trump vows to turn America into a crypto capital, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan raises concerns over the government‚Äôs preference for Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. In response to key administrative officials‚Äô increasing promotion of Bitcoin, Bill Morgan stated, ‚ÄúThe new Administration claims to be all about making the USA the leader of innovation and crypto, yet all we hear about from the people involved is bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin.‚Äù Trump Government‚Äôs Bitcoin Favoritism Compromises Crypto Innovation As highlighted by the XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, the US government‚Äôs goal of transforming America into a crypto capital is at risk due to the administration‚Äôs lean towards Bitcoin. This bias could stifle innovation in other areas of the crypto space, ultimately undermining the administration‚Äôs goal. Experts argue that Bitcoin maximalism overlooks the potential of altcoins and other blockchain innovations, such as smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi). This narrow focus might lead to missed opportunities for growth and adoption in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Balance Between Bitcoin Promotion and Crypto Growth In a recent post, XRP lawyer Bill Morgan shared a thought-provoking question he posed to GROK, sparking an in-depth response. The question read, Is there a serious risk that despite the stated objective of the current US administration of leading crypto innovation that the administration is giving such a preference to bitcoin that American leadership of crypto innovation will be compromised. Surprisingly, he received a nuanced answer that highlighted the delicate balance between promoting Bitcoin and nurturing the broader crypto ecosystem. The response noted that the US administration‚Äôs preference for Bitcoin might strengthen one pillar of crypto leadership, though it‚Äôs not yet clear if it compromises the foundation as a whole. However, the platform added that if Bitcoin becomes an overriding obsession, the US might dominate a single lane while losing the race in others. Recently, Bill Morgan emphasized XRP‚Äôs positive track in response to SEC‚Äôs decision to drop the lawsuit, defying the bearish market trends of Bitcoin. Bitcoin vs XRP: The Rivalry continues The long-standing rivalry between XRP supporters and Bitcoin maxis continues. Donald Trump‚Äôs plans for a US crypto reserve, which would include XRP and other altcoins alongside Bitcoin, have sparked a heated debate. Bitcoin maxi Samson Mow highlighted the significance of a Bitcoin reserve, hailing it a game-changer. While critics like Peter Schiff questioned the government‚Äôs decision to add XRP to the reserve, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson appreciated Trump‚Äôs decision.

Get ready to hear about Tell A Tale (TAT)! This exciting development, initially reported by BWEnews on X, has the crypto community buzzing. But what exactly does it mean for TAT, and more broadly, for the landscape of new crypto token discoveries? Let‚Äôs dive in and unravel the details. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for New Crypto Token Discoveries? Think of Binance Alpha as a dedicated observatory within the vast Binance ecosystem. Its mission is simple yet crucial: to identify and showcase early-stage crypto projects that exhibit significant growth potential. In a market saturated with thousands of cryptocurrencies, distinguishing genuine innovation from fleeting trends can be a daunting task. Binance Alpha steps in as a guide, using a discerning eye to curate a list of tokens that warrant attention. Why is this important? For investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, Binance Alpha offers several key benefits: Early Access to Promising Projects: Binance Alpha acts as a filter, highlighting projects that have already demonstrated potential based on various metrics. This gives you a head start in discovering tokens before they potentially gain mainstream traction. Curated Selection: The selection process isn‚Äôt random. Binance Alpha considers factors like community engagement, market trends, and project innovation. This curation saves you time and effort in sifting through countless projects on your own. Increased Visibility for Projects: For projects like Tell A Tale (TAT), inclusion in Binance Alpha is a significant boost. It brings increased visibility within the Binance community and the broader crypto space, potentially leading to greater adoption and growth. Educational Resource: Binance Alpha serves as an educational platform. By showcasing these projects, it helps users understand what factors contribute to a project‚Äôs potential and success in the crypto market. It‚Äôs crucial to remember, however, that being featured in Binance Alpha is not a guarantee of future listing on the Binance exchange. It‚Äôs a spotlight, not a promise. Think of it as a ‚Äòones to watch‚Äô list ‚Äì projects with exciting prospects, but still in their early stages of development. Tell A Tale (TAT): A Deep Dive into the New Binance Alpha Token So, let‚Äôs turn our attention to the star of the hour: Tell A Tale (TAT). While the announcement from BWEnews on X provides the initial spark, the crypto community is eager to learn more about this new crypto token . What is Tell A Tale (TAT) all about? What makes it stand out enough to be recognized by Binance Alpha? As of now, detailed information directly from Binance about TAT‚Äôs inclusion in Alpha is still emerging. However, we can infer some potential reasons based on the criteria Binance Alpha typically considers: Strong Community Engagement: Projects with vibrant and active communities are often favored. This suggests TAT likely has a dedicated following and strong social media presence. Positive Market Trends: Binance Alpha keeps an eye on market trends. TAT‚Äôs inclusion could indicate it‚Äôs operating in a sector of the crypto market that is currently experiencing growth or is predicted to expand. Innovative Concept: Early-stage crypto projects that bring something unique to the table ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a novel use case, technological advancement, or a fresh approach to solving a problem ‚Äì are more likely to catch the attention of initiatives like Binance Alpha. To truly understand TAT‚Äôs potential, further research is essential. Here are some actionable steps you can take: Explore the Tell A Tale (TAT) Project: Search for the official Tell A Tale (TAT) website and social media channels. Understand their whitepaper, roadmap, and team. What problem are they trying to solve? What is their technology? Analyze Community Sentiment: Check social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram for discussions about TAT. What are people saying? Is there genuine enthusiasm and support? Monitor Market Data (If Available): If TAT is already trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), look at its price action, trading volume, and market capitalization. This can provide insights into early market interest. Stay Updated on Binance Announcements: Keep an eye on official Binance channels for any further announcements regarding TAT and its inclusion in Binance Alpha. Unlocking Crypto Growth Potential: What Does Binance Alpha Mean for Investors? The addition of Tell A Tale (TAT) to Binance Alpha underscores the platform‚Äôs role in identifying and nurturing crypto growth potential . But what does this mean for you as a crypto investor? Should you rush out and buy TAT? Not so fast. Binance Alpha is about spotlighting potential, not issuing investment advice. Here‚Äôs a balanced perspective on what this development signifies for investors: Benefit Consideration Early Discovery: Binance Alpha helps you discover projects like TAT earlier than the mainstream market. This can present opportunities to get in on the ground floor of potentially successful ventures. Higher Risk: Early-stage projects are inherently riskier. They are less established, have shorter track records, and may be more volatile than mature cryptocurrencies. Potential for High Returns: If a project highlighted by Binance Alpha takes off, early investors could see significant returns. No Guarantee of Success: Inclusion in Binance Alpha does not guarantee success. Many early-stage crypto projects fail to achieve their goals. Due Diligence Resource: Binance Alpha‚Äôs selection process can be seen as a form of initial due diligence. It suggests that the project has passed some level of scrutiny. Requires Further Research: Binance Alpha‚Äôs spotlight should be a starting point for your own in-depth research, not the end of it. Never invest blindly. In essence, Binance Alpha serves as a valuable tool for discovery, but responsible investing always requires your own thorough research and risk assessment. Treat projects featured in Binance Alpha as opportunities to explore further, not as automatic investment recommendations. Navigating the Landscape of Early-Stage Crypto Projects: Key Takeaways The addition of Tell A Tale (TAT) to Binance Alpha is a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the continuous emergence of new crypto token innovations and the platforms like Binance Alpha that are dedicated to uncovering them. Here are some key takeaways to keep in mind as you navigate the world of early-stage crypto projects : Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments in the crypto space, including initiatives like Binance Alpha. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on external endorsements. Conduct thorough research on any project before considering investment. Understand Risk: Early-stage crypto investments are high-risk, high-reward. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio to mitigate risk. Be Patient: Crypto growth potential often takes time to materialize. Be prepared for long-term horizons. Conclusion: Embracing the Potential of Binance Alpha and New Crypto Tokens Binance Alpha‚Äôs recognition of Tell A Tale (TAT) is an exciting signal in the crypto world. It underscores the ongoing innovation and the potential for growth within the digital asset space. While the future of TAT, like all new crypto token ventures, remains to be seen, its inclusion in Binance Alpha is undoubtedly a noteworthy development.

In a new thread, crypto strategist Jamie Coutts tells his 37,300 followers on the social media platform X that market liquidity is expected to increase in the second half of 2025, which may pump Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe bottom line, though, is that if Bitcoin can rally through the worst liquidity withdrawal in decades, it‚Äôs primed for more significant moves as conditions ease through the rest of the year.

What happens if base money expands faster than U.S. debt growth? In some reality, that might steady the ship and dampen the fear fueling Bitcoin adoption. But, in my view, that only hits the margins. Meanwhile, deeper Bitcoin integration at both sovereign and banking levels is inevitable. Ultimately, US structural deficits are not changing.

This week, the net inflows surged to $785 million with BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT and Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC playing a crucial role. Market analysts are hopeful that these institutional inflows could push BTC price to $90K and further. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge Sharply After the first two consecutive weeks of outflows in March 2025, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows for the past six consecutive trading sessions. This shows that institutional interest in Bitcoin has been picking up once again as BTC price continues to flirt around $83,000 levels. As per the data from Farside Investors , the BTC ETFs saw inflows of $755 million over the past week. Of these BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone contributed $486 million. Other players like Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC clocked $70 million of inflows while Ark Invest‚Äôs ARKB saw just over $100 million inflows during this period. Source: Trader T Institutional Demand for BTC on the Rise As seen with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the institutional demand for Bitcoin has been rising pretty fast. On-chain data shows that the demand for BTC has reached the highest levels since the collapse of the FTX exchange. According to recent data, new investors have accumulated 172,705 BTC since February 23, highlighting renewed interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Source: CryptoQuant Crypto analyst Trader T has highlighted the potential for significant inflows into Bitcoin from U.S. pension funds and Target Date Funds (TDFs). Citing data from Grok, the analyst believes that $103‚Äì122 billion could enter the US equity market from these sources. According to Trader T, there could be a plausible allocation of 5‚Äì10% of this amount to alternative asset classes, such as Bitcoin. Thus, it could result in a $1‚Äì2 billion inflow into the leading cryptocurrency. BTC Price Surge to $90K Soon? Over the past week, the BTC price volatility has dropped while Bitcoin ETF inflows have continued. Bitcoin has flirted around $83,000 recently with analysts expecting a potential breakout above $84,000 soon. Popular crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa stated that he expects BTC to surge to $90,000 before making any other significant move. ‚ÄúIt could go to 75k eventually, sure, but I think it‚Äôd go to 89-90k before that time.

According to a March 21 report by Politico, the network‚Äîcomprising Fairshake, Defend American Jobs, and Protect Progress‚Äîis pouring significant funds into backing two Republican candidates vying for congressional seats. Leading the charge is Defend American Jobs, which is set to spend $1.2 million on ad campaigns supporting Florida State Senator Randy Fine. Fine is aiming to replace Michael Waltz, who vacated his House seat to serve as President Donald Trump‚Äôs national security adviser. Known for his pro-crypto stance, Fine has previously advocated for ‚Äúclear rules of the road‚Äù to foster digital asset innovation, declaring on X in January, ‚ÄúFloridians want crypto innovation!‚Äù In addition, the Super PAC will spend $345,000 to promote Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who is competing for the seat formerly held by Matt Gaetz. Gaetz resigned after Trump nominated him for U.S. Attorney General, a position he later withdrew from. Patronis, an outspoken crypto supporter, previously proposed allocating part of Florida‚Äôs retirement funds toward digital asset investments, highlighting his commitment to integrating crypto into the state‚Äôs financial framework. Crypto PACs Are Betting Big The April 1 elections carry significant weight, as they are part of four current vacancies in the U.S. House of Representatives. With two of those seats in Florida, the outcomes could tighten the House‚Äôs power dynamics. If Democrats were to win all four seats, Republicans would be left with just a one-person advantage in the chamber‚Äîa precariously slim majority. Defend American Jobs, a rising force in the crypto-political sphere , has already made substantial financial commitments. During the January primaries, the PAC spent over $500,000 backing Fine and $200,000 supporting Patronis. Both candidates emerged victorious in their respective districts‚ÄîFlorida‚Äôs 6th and 1st‚Äîpaving the way for their general election bids. Growing Influence in U.S. Politics While Fairshake tends to support candidates across party lines , Defend American Jobs leans heavily Republican. According to OpenSecrets, the PAC spent nearly $60 million from 2023 to 2024, almost exclusively backing GOP candidates. This crypto-political influence underscores the industry‚Äôs growing presence in shaping U.S. policy, particularly in states like Florida, where lawmakers are increasingly embracing digital asset innovation.

On the technical side, charts show a bullish descending wedge, while the‚ÄÇnumber of whale transactions over $100,000 has just reached a three-month high. ADA has climbed over 10% since the news of potential ETF filings, but it remains to‚ÄÇbe seen if such moves will hold amidst general market uncertainty. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be a centre of attention, with‚ÄÇan on-fire presale and potential investors‚Äô eyes these guys for a real hedge in uncertain times, structured returns, real-world utility. ADA‚Äôs Journey Dependent‚ÄÇon Crucial Resistance Level The future direction of Cardano hangs in the balance due to an essential breakout of the $1.14 resistance barrier since institutions have recently shown increasing interest in the cryptocurrency. The formation of a descending wedge pattern during the previous month according to Ali Martinez stands as a positive indicator but several analysts warn that ADA will lose its upward momentum if it fails to surpass the $1.14 resistance boundary. ADA faces potential danger from its reliance on speculative ETF approvals because other experts predict market values between $6‚Äì$10 during 2025. The declining token-age measures combined with increasing whale ownership shows short-term market activity instead of steady long-term investment which signals negative stability indicators. The rising ADA leaves its long-term capacity at risk as mutual fund project MUTM competes with DeFi capabilities enhanced by presale incentives to diminish volatility. Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches Final Phase‚ÄÇ4 Phase 3 of the Mutuum (MUTM) presale is now live, with tokens selling for $0.02 and‚ÄÇover 50% already sold! This means investors‚ÄÇgrabbing the tokens now can enjoy a price appreciation of 25% when Phase 4 kicks in and will cost $0.025. The project raised $4.3 million in total since launch‚ÄÇand has garnered 6300 holders attracted to its lending protocols and buy-pressure mechanisms. Unlike market performance driven by speculative ETFs like Cardano‚Äôs MUTM tokenomics promise a 200% upside at‚ÄÇits $0.06 exchange listing. Phase 3 investors will reportedly see a return on investment‚ÄÇof 7,400% if the token rises to its post-launch price of $1.50‚Äì$3.50, a figure based on its revenue-driven buyback system and mtTokens‚Äô interest accrual model. Inherent Demand‚ÄÇMechanisms Fuel Confidence The unique aspect of Mutuum Finance is mtTokens that‚ÄÇmirror collateralized deposits and accumulate passive yields over time. The lenders receive dynamic interest rates that depend on the utilization of the pool,‚ÄÇwhile the borrowers obtain liquidity through overexploited loans, which is a model that decreases the risks of default. Furthermore, 15% of platform fees go towards weekly buybacks for MUTM, these will be‚ÄÇredistributed to those staking and creating ongoing buy pressure. It is an entirely different structure from the dependence on market sentiment as seen with Cardano‚Äînow you have significant‚ÄÇmeasures of growth levers. The team is putting the final touches on a Certik audit, the results of which should be made public in the near future, a huge step to ensure the protocol is secure, especially with exchange listings‚ÄÇbeing lined up. Timing the Presale Window As Phase 3 sells out quickly, the time to grab MUTM at $0.02 is‚ÄÇlimited. Not only do early participants lock in a 200% gain at launch, they‚Äôre positioned for exponential growth as the platform‚Äôs‚ÄÇlending volume grows. Despite Cardano‚Äôs potency, it is nothing compared to the presale model designed by‚ÄÇMUTM, which increases price systematically and so rewards early investors. Some investors who are looking for safe haven from ADA‚Äôs ETF game are turning towards Mutuum Finance, where tokenomics and utility meet, making it less‚ÄÇsensitive to market swings. But as Cardano faces resistance in the markets and uncertainties in the regulatory environment,‚ÄÇMutuum Finance (MUTM) appears poised as a powerful counterbalance. With epic presale progression, audit milestones under the belt, and ROI potential, it‚Äôs‚ÄÇa calculated entry point for portfolios burdened by volatility. But Phase 3 will be limited‚Äîin combination with impending‚ÄÇprice increases‚Äîand that fosters urgency. For those who have put a premium‚ÄÇon measurable gains over speculative gambles, the window for MUTM is still ajar ‚Äî but not for much longer.

However, since then, the Ripple token has been in turmoil. With that, many experts have been questioning the hype around this altcoin as its price performance and other metrics are questionable. One researcher even called it the biggest financial scam due to its low trading volume, but Ripple CTO bets differently. What‚Äôs happening? Let‚Äôs discuss. Researcher Claims XRP is the Biggest Scam Aylo, an alpha please researcher, has questioned the hype around the Ripple token , claiming that this is the biggest scam. In a recent X post, Aylo pointed out the XRPL‚Äôs decentralized exchange volume, arguing that it has only $44,000 in volume despite its high demand. With a snapshot from the DeFiLlama, he questions why such a top crypto with a high market capitalization has such a low volume. His remarks about the ‚Äòbiggest scam‚Äô on crypto, which was announced to be part of the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve , triggered discussion among the community. However, things got shorted as Ripple CTO David Schwartz came in support of the altcoin, along with a few other analysts presenting a different picture. Ripple CTO Discards Researcher‚Äôs XRP Allegation As the allegation led to a major discussion among the community, Ripple‚Äôs CTO corrected the researcher. With a comment on Aylo‚Äôs post, he clarified that the mentioned data represented only the Automated Market Makers (AMMs) on the XRPL. Notably, the AMMs account for just a minor portion of any network usage; Aylo‚Äôs allegation ended. David Schwartz also clarified that the suggested volume does not reflect the potential and utility of the Ripple token. I can‚Äôt find the exact page you‚Äôre looking at, but I bet that‚Äôs just looking at AMMs on XRPL, a miniscule fraction of what people use XRP for. Additionally, Vet, a dUNL validator, supports the Ripple CTO‚Äôs claims by presenting the correct volume figures. According to Vet‚Äôs stats, the actual 24-hour decentralized exchange volume on the XRPL is nearly $9M, which is not what the researcher claimed. More importantly, he called it the right opportunity for the market participants to leverage XRPL‚Äôs growth in the DeFi ecosystem. He claimed that a low DEX volume is the opportunity due to minimal participation. How is XRP Performing Today, and What‚Äôs Next? Despite the researcher‚Äôs scam allegation on the Ripple token, global investors still see it as a potential opportunity due to better updates from the SEC vs Ripple case, Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto reserve formation, and probable ETF launch this year. XRP currently trades at $2.40 with a market capitalization of $139.54B, making it the fourth biggest crypto after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. At present, its performance is significantly down amid the broader market correction. However, significant rallies with a shift in market sentiments are expected.

The cryptocurrency industry may still be facing debanking-related issues in the United States, despite the recent wave of positive legislation, according to crypto regulatory experts and industry leaders. The collapse of crypto-friendly banks in early 2023 sparked the first allegations of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 . Critics, including venture capitalist Nic Carter, described it as a government effort to pressure banks into cutting ties with cryptocurrency firms. Despite numerous crypto-positive decisions from US President Donald Trump, including the March 7 order to use Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized in government criminal cases to establish a national reserve , the industry may still be facing banking issues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs premature to say that debanking is over,‚Äù according to Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank. Long said during Cointelegraph‚Äôs Chainreaction daily X show on March 21: ‚ÄúThere are two crypto-friendly banks under examination by the Fed right now and an army of examiners was sent into these banks, including the examiners from Washington, a literal army just smothering the banks.‚Äù The Crypto Debanking Crisis: #CHAINREACTION https://t.co/nD4qkkzKnB ‚Äî Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 21, 2025 ‚ÄúThe Fed is the outlier and the Fed is still controlled by democrats,‚Äù explained Long, adding: ‚ÄúTrump won‚Äôt have the ability to appoint a new Fed governor until January. So therefore you can see the breadcrumbs leading up to a potentially big fight. Because if the OCC and FDIC overturn their anti-crypto guidance but the Fed does not, where does that leave us?‚Äù Long‚Äôs Custodia Bank was repeatedly targeted by the US debanking efforts, which cost the firm months of work and ‚Äúa couple of million dollars,‚Äù she explained. Industry outrage over alleged debanking reached a crescendo when a June 2024 lawsuit spearheaded by ‚Äã‚ÄãCoinbase resulted in the release of letters showing US banking regulators asked certain financial institutions to ‚Äúpause‚Äù crypto banking activities.

I had my accounts closed in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022, but 2024 was a good year. Operationally these problems exist for both users and crypto firms operating.‚Äù Related: Paolo Ardoino: Competitors and politicians intend to ‚Äòkill Tether‚Äô The comments come two weeks after the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto just hours after US President Donald Trump vowed to end the prolonged crackdown restricting crypto firms‚Äô access to banking services.

Most altcoins sit quietly today, with little to no gains. PI has popped up by 9% after a recent landslide, while HYPE has surged by double digits. BTC Calm at $84K Last weekend went relatively quietly as BTC was stuck around the same level as now. The only exception came on Sunday evening after a whale opened a large short position, and BTC went up and down by about a grand. The beginning of the business week was also quieter, aside from a price slump toward $81,000 on Tuesday. However, BTC bounced off and jumped to $83,000 ahead of the second FOMC meeting for the year. Once that concluded on Wednesday and the Fed refused to change the key interest rates, BTC experienced some more volatility around $83,000 and $85,000. It went on the offensive later and spiked above $87,000 during the early morning Asian trading session. However, that was short-lived, and the asset slumped to $83,000 a day later. It has returned to $84,000 since then as it prepares for another calm weekend. Its market cap has risen to $1.670 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has declined to 58.3%. BTCUSD.

However, it finally saw some relief in the past 24 hours, as its price has returned to $1 after an 8-9% surge. HYPE is the other notable gainer since yesterday, having jumped by 14-5%. It now trades above $16. In contrast, XRP, BNB, ADA, LEO, TON, and XLM are slightly in the red, while ETH, SOL, DOGE, and TRX have marked minor gains.

This piece is known as second-lien debt, and it‚Äôs been sitting like dead weight on the books of seven major banks, led by Morgan Stanley, for almost three years. This last batch is the riskiest of the lot and has been the hardest to get rid of. The buyback might be funded using proceeds from a recent equity raise, according to a report from Bloomberg. They also said nothing‚Äôs locked in yet. The move, if finalized, would let banks finally dump the worst part of the $13 billion loan package that backed Elon‚Äôs takeover. Most of the other debt tied to the deal was already sold off earlier this year. The second-lien piece was the one nobody wanted. Banks unload risky leftovers as X pushes ahead Back when the buyout happened, banks expected to flip the loans quickly. Instead, they hit a wall. The value of X sank fast, and there were no buyers. The banks got stuck holding paper that nobody wanted and had to cut valuations by nearly half. But now the mood has shifted. One reason: Elon‚Äôs tight connection with President Donald Trump. That new proximity to the White House is changing how investors look at X‚Äôs debt. As one source put it, ‚ÄúIt took one election and a billionaire bromance to flip the script.‚Äù Morgan Stanley is now leading the charge to pitch a new $3 billion offering of X debt. They‚Äôre telling investors that X is stabilizing. Buyers who‚Äôve seen X‚Äôs financials say the numbers look better. X posted $400 million in Ebitda on $710 million revenue in Q4 2024. That‚Äôs higher than the two previous quarters. Morgan Stanley says X is on track for about $1.2 billion in adjusted Ebitda this year. Those improvements are making it easier for banks to sell what‚Äôs left. Loans that were once worth 60 cents on the dollar are now being offered at 95 cents or more, according to Bloomberg. Still, not everything looks pretty. X‚Äôs revenue is down nearly 50% since the original buyout. But major cost cuts by Elon have kept the business running. X‚Äôs earnings are flat compared to 2022, but those numbers are padded with a bunch of adjustments to make things look better. One investor said, ‚ÄúIf they thought they had lost 40% of their principal and now get out at something close to break even, that‚Äôs a nice turnaround.‚Äù Investors dig into X‚Äôs shady financials Some investors are raising red flags about how X reports money coming in from ‚Äúrelated parties‚Äù that aren‚Äôt part of the main platform. Restructuring costs are also being removed from the numbers. That includes layoffs ‚Äî a huge chunk of the workforce got axed after Elon took over. The company now has just $400 million in cash. That‚Äôs a steep drop from the $1.4 billion it had in 2022. Even with all that, the interest in X debt keeps growing. The recent $1 billion sale that closed at 90‚Äì95 cents per dollar sparked a flood of inquiries. It‚Äôs not just the business. It‚Äôs the Musk factor. One source said, ‚ÄúThere seems to be no shortage of investors wanting a chance to own a piece of X, and therefore the Musk empire.‚Äù The banks that backed the deal, despite the headaches, have made real money. Bloomberg says they earned about $3 billion in interest since 2022. That‚Äôs more than enough to wipe out any paper losses. Still, the longer they hold the debt, the more it gums up their balance sheets. That‚Äôs why they want out now, while the market is hot. Elon‚Äôs AI play sweetens the deal for buyers A big reason for renewed interest is X‚Äôs $6 billion stake in xAI, Elon‚Äôs artificial intelligence venture. Morgan Stanley is using that as a carrot in its sales pitch. If X goes south, buyers might have a claim on xAI. Investors like the optional upside. The current $3 billion offering matures in 2029 and pays 6.5% above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). That adds up to a fat 12% yield. High return, high risk. X still doesn‚Äôt have a credit rating. Its leverage ratio is around 10 times earnings. That scares off some buyers, but the yield is pulling others in. Banks know this round won‚Äôt be the end. They‚Äôve still got other unsecured chunks on their books. Those are way riskier and could be nearly impossible to sell close to face value. But this round ‚Äî the one backed by xAI and improved numbers ‚Äî is the safest part left. This whole Twitter-turned-X saga is unlike anything Wall Street normally deals with. The fact that it might end with profits for the banks is wild. Robert Willens, a tax expert, said, ‚ÄúThey have certainly recovered more than 100 cents on the dollar.‚Äù Still, a lot of this is based on hype. Nobody knows how stable X really is. The platform‚Äôs revenue is still way down. Layoffs gutted the team. The cash pile is shrinking. But as long as the numbers can be adjusted just right, and as long as Elon keeps that White House connection, there‚Äôs a crowd ready to take the risk. And Wall Street? They‚Äôre finally seeing a way out of the mess. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

In 2028, the coin could be worth between $18.49 and $21.97, with an average price of $19.01. By 2031, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $67.56. Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple ‚Äúzones‚Äù that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the ‚ÄúInternet of Blockchains‚Äù for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

The price has recently bounced off the lower Bollinger Band and is now approaching the middle band, indicating a mild bullish reversal. The RSI stands at approximately 55.69, suggesting increasing momentum without yet entering overbought territory. This reflects a gradual recovery phase, supported by a sustained move above the $4.30 support. A breakout above the $5.00 resistance zone could open room for further gains. However, any sharp rejections at this level may lead to consolidation. Overall, short-term sentiment leans cautiously bullish with upward potential. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOM 4-hour price chart ; Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart, Cosmos (ATOM) shows consolidation near the $4.73 level, reflecting a cautious market tone. The price is moving along the upper range of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting the potential for short-term volatility. The Balance of Power indicator remains negative at -0.84, indicating that sellers still dominate the market. However, the MACD is neutral but closely aligned, hinting at a possible bullish crossover if momentum increases. While immediate resistance lies around $4.80, a break above this could validate a trend reversal. Overall, ATOM exhibits tentative recovery signals but needs stronger bullish volume to confirm sustained upside.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Cosmos (ATOM) is currently attempting a recovery but faces significant resistance. The daily chart shows a modest uptrend with price pushing towards the upper Bollinger Band, while the RSI at 55.69 indicates growing bullish momentum. However, the 4-hour chart reveals consolidation with the price struggling to break past the $4.80 resistance. The Balance of Power remains negative, and the MACD is near a neutral crossover, signaling indecision. Unless bullish volume increases and resistance is decisively breached, Cosmos may continue to range sideways. A breakout above $5.00 could confirm a more stable upward trend. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo‚Äôs current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $45.96 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will unlikely reach $100 soon. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $67.56 by 2031, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $45.96 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos, created by Ethan Buchman and Jae Kwon, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, with the network officially going live two years later in 2019. During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM‚Äôs price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM‚Äôs price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos peaked at $7.77, and in February, it‚Äôs trading between $4.54 and $4.86. ATOM value decreased further in March as it dipped to the $4.0 to $4.2 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-22 09:50:00

The U.S. spot Ethereum ETF market is experiencing some turbulence. Recent data reveals a notable trend that‚Äôs got investors and analysts alike scratching their heads. For thirteen consecutive trading days, we‚Äôve witnessed net outflows from these highly anticipated investment vehicles. Let‚Äôs dive into the details and explore what this could mean for the future of Spot Ethereum ETF s and the broader crypto landscape. What‚Äôs Happening with Ethereum ETF Outflows? On March 21st, U.S. spot Ethereum ETF s collectively saw a net outflow of $18.6 million. This marks the 13th day in a row where more money has been pulled out of these ETFs than invested. This consistent outflow raises questions about investor sentiment and the short-term trajectory of these investment products. While daily fluctuations are normal in the volatile crypto market, a persistent trend like this warrants closer examination. Let‚Äôs break down the key players and their contributions to this outflow: BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA: Leading the pack in outflows was BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), experiencing a net outflow of $11.9 million. As one of the largest asset managers globally, BlackRock‚Äôs ETF movements are closely watched, and this outflow is particularly noteworthy. Grayscale‚Äôs ETH: Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust (ETH) followed closely with a net outflow of $6.7 million. Grayscale, a pioneer in crypto investment products, has been navigating the transition of its existing trust into a spot ETF, and these outflows may reflect investor adjustments during this period. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported minimal net activity on March 21st, indicating that the outflows were primarily concentrated in BlackRock‚Äôs and Grayscale‚Äôs funds. ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Outflow (USD) BlackRock ETHA $11.9 Million Grayscale ETH $6.7 Million Other ETFs ‚Äì Minimal/Neutral Total Net Outflow $18.6 Million Why are we seeing these outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs? Several factors could be contributing to the recent Crypto ETF outflow trend. Understanding these potential drivers is crucial for investors trying to navigate the current market. Let‚Äôs explore some possibilities: Profit Taking: After the initial hype and inflows following the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, some investors may be taking profits. The crypto market has seen significant gains recently, and ETF holders might be rebalancing their portfolios or securing returns. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Periods of uncertainty or price corrections can trigger investors to reduce risk and move assets out of ETFs, especially those who are more risk-averse or trading on shorter timeframes. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as interest rate hikes or inflation concerns, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies and related ETFs. Uncertainty in the global economy can lead to a general risk-off approach. Alternative Investment Opportunities: The crypto space is constantly evolving. New investment opportunities might be emerging that are drawing capital away from existing ETH ETF products. Investors may be shifting funds to DeFi projects, new token launches, or other areas within the digital asset ecosystem. Grayscale ETF Restructuring: As Grayscale converts its existing Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF, some investors who initially held shares in the trust might be re-evaluating their positions or seeking alternative ETF options. This transition period can sometimes lead to temporary outflows. Are Ethereum ETF Outflows a cause for concern? While 13 consecutive days of net outflows might sound alarming, it‚Äôs important to maintain perspective. Here‚Äôs a balanced view to consider: Early Stages: Spot Ethereum ETF s are still relatively new investment products. Market dynamics and investor behavior are likely to be more volatile in the initial phases as the market matures and finds its equilibrium. Broader Market Context: It‚Äôs essential to analyze these outflows in the context of the overall cryptocurrency market. Are we seeing outflows across the board, or is this specific to Ethereum ETFs? Examining broader market trends provides a more comprehensive picture. Long-Term Perspective: Investing in ETFs, particularly in emerging asset classes like crypto, is often a long-term strategy. Short-term fluctuations and outflows are not necessarily indicative of the long-term viability or success of these products. Focus on the underlying fundamentals and adoption of Ethereum and the broader crypto ecosystem. Outflow Volume: While the streak is notable, the daily outflow amounts are relatively small compared to the overall assets under management in the spot Crypto ETF market. It‚Äôs important to consider the magnitude of the outflows in relation to the total market size. What does this mean for the future of Ethereum ETFs? The recent Ethereum ETF Outflows present a mixed bag of signals. While the consecutive days of outflows are noteworthy, they don‚Äôt necessarily signal a long-term downturn for these investment products. Here‚Äôs what we can infer and consider moving forward: Market Correction or Consolidation: The outflows could simply be a sign of a healthy market correction or consolidation after a period of rapid growth and initial enthusiasm. This is a natural part of market cycles and not necessarily a negative indicator. Investor Sentiment Shift: It‚Äôs crucial to monitor if this outflow trend persists. A prolonged period of outflows could indicate a shift in investor sentiment towards Ethereum ETFs, potentially driven by factors mentioned earlier like macroeconomic conditions or alternative investment opportunities. Opportunity for Strategic Entry: For long-term investors who believe in the future of Ethereum and crypto, these outflows and potential price dips could present strategic entry points. ‚ÄúBuy the dip‚Äù is a common mantra in crypto investing, and periods of market correction can offer opportunities to accumulate assets at potentially lower prices. Importance of Diversification: The recent outflows underscore the importance of diversification in investment portfolios. Relying solely on one asset class or investment product can expose investors to concentrated risk. Diversifying across different asset classes and within the crypto space itself can help mitigate volatility and manage risk. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors take away from these ETH ETF outflow trends? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on ETF flow data and broader market indicators. Utilize resources like Farside Investors and other reputable data providers to stay updated on market movements. Do Your Research: Understand the underlying factors driving market trends. Don‚Äôt react impulsively to short-term fluctuations. Conduct thorough research on the assets you invest in and the macroeconomic environment. Consider Long-Term Goals: Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals. Are you a long-term holder or a short-term trader? Your investment horizon should guide your decisions during periods of market volatility. Manage Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies. Diversification, position sizing, and stop-loss orders are essential tools for managing risk in the volatile crypto market. Seek Professional Advice: If you‚Äôre unsure how to navigate these market dynamics, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Navigating the Ethereum ETF Landscape The $18.6 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETF s on March 21st, extending a 13-day outflow streak, is a development worth noting. While it might raise eyebrows, it‚Äôs crucial to analyze this within the broader context of the nascent Spot Ethereum ETF market and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency space. These outflows could be driven by various factors, from profit-taking and market corrections to macroeconomic influences and evolving investment preferences. For investors, the key takeaway is to stay informed, maintain a long-term perspective, and manage risk effectively. The Ethereum ETF market is still in its early innings, and its long-term trajectory will depend on a multitude of factors, including continued adoption of Ethereum, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment.

Right now, SHIB is trading at $0.0000127, holding strong above $0.0000125. Despite facing some price drops analysts predict a massive breakout could push its price up by 81% due to rising whale activity and an increasing burn rate. Shiba Inu Ready for an 81% Surge Looking at SHIB‚Äôs 1-day chart, it is forming a falling wedge pattern, which is generally seen as a bullish reversal signal. Since December 2024, SHIB has been trading within this downward-sloping wedge, consistently making lower highs and lower lows. However, the price is now testing a breakout level around $0.0000129, suggesting a potential trend reversal. If SHIB successfully breaks out of this pattern, it could trigger a massive rally, targeting an 81.63% increase, bringing the price up to around $0.000023. Aligning with the bullish outlook, crypto analyst CryptoELITES anticipates a short-term price surge for SHIB and predicts a massive 17x rally. Why Not a 17 X for SHIB? We're sitting in a strong buy zone, and a big move is coming soon! Are you ready? Tg : https://t.co/EeTzlid4ek #SHIB $SHIB #Shiba $Shiba pic.twitter.com/mGi1GMS3BI ‚Äî @CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) March 21, 2025 Key Levels to Watch SHIB has been trading in a tight range between $0.0000125 and $0.00001365. The real battle lies at the $0.000014 resistance, where 236 billion SHIB tokens are waiting. If bulls manage to break past this level, the next major hurdle is between $0.000014 and $0.000019, where a staggering 548 trillion SHIB tokens have been accumulated. On the flip side, if SHIB fails to hold $0.0000125, a drop to $0.0000115 is likely. So far, the token has struggled to maintain its bullish momentum, facing repeated rejections at the $0.000014 level. Whales and Burn Rate Show Positive Signs Big players are showing interest in SHIB again, with whale activity spiking in recent days. A massive 7.49 trillion SHIB was moved in large transactions, marking the highest volume seen in two months. At the same time, the SHIB burn rate has jumped by 2227% in the last 24 hours, removing over $18.6 million worth of tokens from circulation. The total SHIB burned has now reached 410.7 trillion, reducing the available supply to around 589 trillion tokens. This could drive prices higher as supply tightens. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Dogecoin Has Lost The Support Of An Ascending Triangle Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about an Ascending Triangle pattern for Dogecoin. The ‚ÄúAscending Triangle‚Äù refers to a technical analysis (TA) formation that appears when the price of an asset consolidates inside a triangular region. The ‚ÄòAscending‚Äô in the pattern‚Äôs name comes from the fact that this consolidation happens towards a net upside. There are two trendlines in this pattern: an upper level that‚Äôs parallel to the time-axis, tracing successive highs, and a lower one that has a positive slope, connecting successive higher lows. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Correction Is Different From March 2024‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Why Just like with any other consolidation pattern in TA, the upper level of the triangle is likely to be a source of resistance in the near future, while the lower one that of support. A break out of either of these boundaries can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. The Ascending Triangle isn‚Äôt the only type of triangular pattern in TA, two other popular varieties include the Descending Triangle and Symmetrical Triangle. The former of these is just the opposite of the Ascending Triangle: it forms when the price consolidates to the downside instead. The latter, the Symmetrical Triangle, is a sort of middle-ground between the Ascending and Descending versions, with both of its trendlines having an equal and opposite slope. That is, when the asset is inside this pattern, it converges at a mid-point. Recently, Dogecoin‚Äôs 1-hour price looked like it was following an Ascending Triangle. Here is the chart shared by Martinez, that shows this pattern for the memecoin: As is visible in the above graph, the hourly Dogecoin price recently made a retest of the lower line of this Ascending Triangle, but it would appear the coin has been unsuccessful in finding support at it, as it has slipped right through. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7% After Surge In Network Activity & Whale Buying From the graph, it‚Äôs apparent that the memecoin wasn‚Äôt far from the apex of the triangle when this break came. Consolidation gets narrower as an asset reaches the end of the pattern, so breakouts start to become more likely. As mentioned before, a breakout can mean a potential continuation of trend in the direction of the break. So, in this case, DOGE has just witnessed a bearish signal. Often, the length of a move emerging out of an Ascending Triangle breakout is of the same length as the height of the triangle itself. Based on this, the analyst notes a 16% price swing could occur for the coin as a result of pattern. DOGE Price Dogecoin has taken to flat movement in the past week as its price is still floating around the $0.16 mark.

Their key selling points are 1.16 million SOL in TVL, a yield of up to 28% APY and robust community engagement. After a notable rebrand and a polished website revamp, JPool is advancing what it describes as the ‚ÄúPeak of Staking Satisfaction.‚Äù Why Liquid Staking Matters Traditional staking can sometimes limit DeFi activities by locking up tokens. Liquidity remains one of the biggest advantages of JPool‚Äôs approach: with JSOL in hand, stakers can buy, sell, or deploy those tokens in other protocols at any time. This mobility resonates strongly in the fast-paced Solana environment. Participants earn passive income and can move quickly when new DeFi integrations or trading opportunities arise. ‚ÄúCrypto investors today prize flexibility,‚Äù says JPool CEO and Co-Founder Sonny Wolfson . ‚ÄúThey still want to earn from staking but also remain nimble enough to respond to fast-paced shifts in the market. Liquid staking accomplishes that, and we recognized this need from the start.‚Äù The appeal of JPool‚Äôs model is evident in its growing TVL. Meanwhile, JPool‚Äôs High-Yield Staking delivers up to 28% annual returns boosted by MEV profits. Various Solana community projects have begun to integrate JSOL, which is adding to the token‚Äôs momentum. For example, DeFi platforms offering lending or advanced yield strategies can incorporate JSOL, broadening use cases and overall liquidity; something JPool‚Äôs team is actively encouraging through ongoing partnerships. A Fresh Image for a Growing Community JPool recently changed its look and feel, and these changes were more than just a new design. The updated interface offers a seamless way for users to stake their SOL tokens and immediately receive JSOL in return. From the outset, JPool‚Äôs developers focused on blending sophisticated functionality with a straightforward layout. Their goal is to make liquid staking available to a wider audience, including those new to Solana DeFi. The new platform guides users through each step‚Äîdepositing SOL, receiving JSOL, and tracking yields‚Äîwith as few clicks as possible. JPool‚Äôs team is convinced that streamlining the staking process allows participants to concentrate on spotting new market opportunities instead of wrestling with complex user interfaces. Holders Club and More Upcoming Features Another key part of JPool‚Äôs ecosystem is the Holders Club , an exclusive program that rewards loyal participants. Members earn JPoints by staking SOL, holding JSOL, or simply taking part in community activities. The more they accumulate these points, the higher they climb on the tier ladder: from Silver to Gold to Platinum, with better benefits at each tier. Holders Club members receive dedicated customer support, opportunities to participate in exclusive AMAs, and even have a say in JPool‚Äôs strategic decisions. Rather than throwing in a one-off loyalty bonus, the program encourages people to stay involved in the long term, building a strong, close-knit community. JPool frequently shares user feedback on their Twitter account to show how this direct input helps guide their plans. Looking ahead, the Holders Club will also see expansions. One concept under discussion involves more advanced governance rights, letting top-tier members propose‚Äîand vote on‚Äîkey decisions like fee adjustments or the integration of new Solana dApps. Seasonal challenges and special NFT drops have also been teased, aiming to keep the JPool community dynamic and engaged. The team behind JPool is constantly pushing forward, refusing to settle for past achievements. They‚Äôve been dropping hints about upcoming partnerships designed to deepen JSOL‚Äôs presence throughout the Solana ecosystem. While exact details remain under wraps, it‚Äôs clear that the team is going to collaborate with lending platforms and decentralized exchanges. With the integration of JSOL into additional DeFi services, JPool is going to give users expanded possibilities like margin trading, borrowing, and advanced auto-compounding yields. Security remains a top priority as well. JPool‚Äôs developers continuously conduct audits and test their smart contracts to ensure they‚Äôre strong and safe. The general approach is to maintain and enhance the trust that has already attracted such liquidity. JPool: A Smarter Approach to Solana Staking JPool has quickly become a big name in Solana‚Äôs DeFi space. Besides instant liquidity and user-focused design offerings, it is always on the lookout for new ways to boost community rewards and make liquid staking more profitable. Notably, the platform has introduced an advanced yield aggregator that currently boasts an impressive 28.53% APY, indicated on its dashboard. For many participants, JPool hits the sweet spot: it offers the benefits of staking without giving up the ability to seize new market opportunities. The DeFi ecosystem on Solana grows, and JPool‚Äôs progress serves as a case study of how to deliver a product that meets users‚Äô demands while keeping up with a market that‚Äôs always changing. For seasoned investors looking to optimize yield and newcomers intrigued by the flexibility of liquid staking, JPool clearly shows where the Solana staking space is headed. The project backs that vision with a solid set of tools, a strong community, and a roadmap pointing toward even greater integration in the months to come.

The amount of crypto owned by South Korean investors is currently worth over 105T won. According to reports from local media outlet Donga , data received by Democratic Party lawmaker Ahn Do-Jae from five domestic crypto exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, on the 21st, showed there were 9,667,023 investors who had trading accounts on these exchanges at the end of last year (Korbit as of the end of September 2024). The number of South Korea‚Äôs crypto investors increased by 52.6% (3,333,439 people), bringing the total value of crypto owned to over 105T won.

Surprisingly, 1 in 4 is over 50, and half of the high-net-worth investors with over 1B KRW are in the same age group. What's driving this shift? Dive in: https://t.co/PhQQyHGYFC > #Crypto #Investing ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Satoshi Club Alerts (@satoshi_alerts) March 22, 2025 The number of cryptocurrency investors in South Korea surged by more than 50% last year, reaching 9.66 million.

The average big investor over 50 years of age owned 2.15 billion won worth of crypto. Jess Zeng, mETH protocol ecosystem lead, also noted that South Korea was among Asian countries joining the growing list of countries opening up to institutional crypto investments. She added that increasing institutional capital flows into crypto accelerated the adoption of assets like ETH, with Mantle and mETHProtocol playing key roles in this shift. ‚ÄúIn order to protect investors, a minimum regulatory basis should be established as soon as possible.‚Äù ~ Councilman Ahn Do-Jae Rep. Ahn stressed the need to establish a minimum regulatory framework promptly‚Äô, citing the growing number of older investors and the associated need for investor protection. Rep. Lim Kwang-hyun also pointed out that ‚Äòat a pan-governmental level‚Äô, South Korea needed to take thorough measures to enhance the stability of the crypto market and establish sound trading practices that protect investors‚Äô rights. Bank of Korea (BOK) released first crypto investor data in December 2024 The Bank of Korea‚Äôs data, shared by Rep. Lim Kwang-hyun of the Democratic Party of Korea, revealed that the number of cryptocurrency investors in South Korea surged to 15.59 million (approximately 30% of the country‚Äôs population) as of November, a rise of 610K from the previous month. Additionally, the total market value of crypto held by Korean investors as of the 25th of December 2024 reached 102.6 trillion won. The data also showed a significant increase in crypto transactions, which rivaled domestic stock market volumes.

Stark, a vocal critic of the digital asset industry, argued that the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934 should remain unchanged, firmly stating that crypto should not be given special treatment under U.S. securities laws. Speaking at the event, Stark dismissed the notion that digital assets should be classified differently from traditional securities. ‚ÄúThe people buying crypto are not collectors. We all know that they are investors, and the mission of the SEC is to protect investors,‚Äù he asserted. Stark emphasized that crypto firms have repeatedly fought regulatory oversight but have consistently failed in court. ‚ÄúThe volume of case law has developed so quickly because of all these crypto firms. They went for this delay, delay, delay tactic, hiring top law firms to challenge the SEC,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read every single one of their briefs, and they lost nearly every time.‚Äù No Innovation in Crypto: Former SEC Regulator Starkdismissed claims that cryptocurrencies represent groundbreaking innovation. He compared the rise of digital assets to previous technological revolutions, such as the launch of the iPhone, but concluded that crypto offers no comparable progress. ‚ÄúI see no innovation here. Nothing in crypto comes close to the technological leap of the iPhone or the early internet,‚Äù he remarked. Stark argued that the industry instead thrives on legal maneuvering and delaying tactics, rather than delivering genuine technological advancement. His comments reflect a broader skepticism toward crypto‚Äôs value proposition, as he continues to label the sector as rife with opacity and deception. Critic Faces Industry Backlash Stark‚Äôs anti-crypto rhetoric is nothing new . In February 2024, he likened a sponsorship deal between the Dallas Mavericks and crypto firm Voyager to a partnership with a ‚Äúheroin manufacturing firm.‚Äù His hardline stance has drawn sharp criticism from industry figures. In June 2023, billionaire investor Mark Cuban dismissed Stark‚Äôs repeated crypto bashing as ‚Äúcrypto derangement syndrome.‚Äù Despite the backlash, Stark remains adamant that the SEC‚Äôs regulation-by-enforcement approach under Chairman Gary Gensler is justified, arguing that the crypto industry must comply with existing laws rather than pushing for new, lenient regulations .

The price forecast depends on adoption, burns, and market trends. While the coin‚Äôs ecosystem is expanding, a 10x surge will require massive demand and long-term holding. Will the Shiba Inu coin reach $1 in 2030? Reaching $1 would require an unrealistic market cap in the trillions, making it highly unlikely. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price could increase with burns and adoption, but expecting the price to hit $1 is pure speculation. Many investors prefer projects like Dawgz AI, which offer real earning potential now. What is a realistic SHIB price prediction for 2050?

However, Shiba Inu price movements rely heavily on speculation. Investing in AI-powered projects like $DAGZ may offer better long-term profit potential than waiting decades. Will Shiba Inu reach 10 cents? For the Shiba Inu price to hit 10 cents, the market cap would need to exceed trillions, making it nearly impossible. While the SHIB team is working on ecosystem growth, meme coins often struggle with long-term stability. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, provides real utility and automated earnings.

Price is holding above an ascending trendline and the 50-day EMA, currently near $84,030. Immediate resistance lies at $84,340, with breakouts targeting $87,410 and $89,900. If BTC fails to hold support, it could drop to $81,550. Volume remains steady, but directionless. A strong breakout above $84,340 could be the catalyst needed to make $90,000 a near-term reality. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin eyes $87,410 and $89,900 if $84,340 breaks. The 50-day EMA at $84,030 offers critical support. U.S. policy momentum may provide fuel for another leg up.

42147436,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142400,1742640717,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Secure MET Token Distribution: Meteora‚Äôs Blacklist Enhances Crypto Fairness on Solana DEX,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/met-token-distribution-blacklist/,"In the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), ensuring fairness and security is paramount. Meteora, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Solana blockchain, is taking a bold step in this direction. Responding to growing Web3 community trust concerns, Meteora has announced the implementation of a blacklist system. This strategic move aims to safeguard the integrity of its MET token distribution and foster a more equitable environment for all participants. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it means for the future of DeFi on Solana. Why a Blacklist for MET Token Distribution? Addressing Crypto Fairness Concerns The core of Meteora‚Äôs decision to introduce a blacklist stems from a fundamental question within the crypto space: How do we ensure crypto fairness in token distribution? In decentralized ecosystems, where anonymity and pseudonymity are common, the potential for malicious actors to exploit systems is a persistent challenge. The community voiced legitimate concerns about the possibility of MET tokens falling into the hands of individuals or entities intending to manipulate the system or act against the community‚Äôs best interests. Meteora listened, and acted decisively. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key reasons behind this crucial decision: Preventing Abuse of LP Stimulus Plan: Liquidity Provider (LP) stimulus plans are designed to incentivize users to contribute liquidity to DEXs, fostering a healthy trading environment. However, these plans can be vulnerable to abuse. Malicious actors might attempt to game the system, accumulating tokens unfairly and undermining the intended benefits for genuine community members. Maintaining Decentralized Exchange Security: A fair token distribution is intrinsically linked to the overall security and health of a decentralized exchange security . When tokens are concentrated in the hands of bad actors, it can lead to governance vulnerabilities, market manipulation, and ultimately, a loss of trust in the platform. Upholding Community Values: The ethos of Web3 and DeFi is built upon principles of transparency, fairness, and community governance. Introducing a blacklist is a proactive measure to uphold these values, demonstrating Meteora‚Äôs commitment to its community and fostering a trustworthy ecosystem. Meteora‚Äôs proactive approach underscores the importance of community feedback in shaping the future of DeFi projects. By directly addressing concerns about fairness, Meteora is setting a new standard for responsible token distribution. How Will the Solana DEX Blacklist Work? Transparency and Community Input Transparency is key to the effectiveness and acceptance of any blacklist system. Meteora understands this, and is committed to making the Solana DEX blacklist process open and accessible. Here‚Äôs how it will function: Publicly Accessible Blacklist: The blacklist itself will be publicly available for anyone to view. This transparency ensures accountability and allows the community to monitor its effectiveness. Community-Driven Submissions: Anyone can submit wallet addresses they suspect of abusing the LP Stimulus Plan. This empowers the community to actively participate in maintaining the integrity of the MET token distribution. Supported by Reputable Tools: Meteora is leveraging the expertise of Bubblemaps and Rugcheck, well-known platforms for on-chain analysis and risk assessment. This collaboration adds a layer of credibility and rigor to the blacklist process. Due Diligence and Review: While community submissions are welcomed, it‚Äôs crucial to understand that there will be a process of due diligence and review before any wallet address is added to the blacklist. This prevents arbitrary blacklisting and ensures fair consideration of each case. This community-driven, transparent approach is a significant step forward in fostering trust and accountability within the DeFi space. By making the blacklist public and encouraging community participation, Meteora is building a more resilient and equitable ecosystem. Benefits of the Meteora Blacklist: A Win-Win for the Ecosystem The introduction of a blacklist for MET token distribution is not merely a reactive measure; it‚Äôs a proactive strategy that offers numerous benefits to the Meteora ecosystem and its users. Let‚Äôs explore some of the key advantages: Benefit Description Enhanced Fairness Ensures that MET tokens are distributed more equitably, rewarding genuine community members and contributors rather than malicious actors. Increased Security Reduces the risk of token concentration in the hands of bad actors, strengthening the overall security and governance of the Meteora DEX. Boosted Community Trust Demonstrates Meteora‚Äôs commitment to its community and fosters a more trustworthy and reliable platform, encouraging greater participation and engagement. Sustainable Ecosystem Growth Contributes to the long-term sustainability of the Meteora ecosystem by protecting it from potential exploits and ensuring a healthy token economy. Industry Leadership Positions Meteora as a leader in responsible DeFi practices, setting a positive example for other projects to follow in prioritizing fairness and security. By implementing this blacklist, Meteora is not only addressing immediate concerns but also laying the foundation for a more robust, trustworthy, and sustainable DeFi platform on Solana. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Nuances of Blacklisting While the benefits of a blacklist are clear, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the potential challenges and considerations that come with implementing such a system. Navigating these nuances effectively is crucial for ensuring the blacklist remains a positive force within the Meteora ecosystem. Risk of False Positives: There‚Äôs always a risk of mistakenly blacklisting legitimate users. Robust due diligence processes and mechanisms for appeal are essential to mitigate this risk. Centralization Concerns: Blacklists, by their nature, involve a degree of centralization. It‚Äôs important for Meteora to maintain transparency and community involvement in the process to avoid perceptions of undue control. Evolving Evasion Tactics: Malicious actors are constantly developing new tactics to evade security measures. The blacklist system will need to be continuously monitored and updated to remain effective against evolving threats. Community Education: Clear communication and education are vital to ensure the community understands the purpose and operation of the blacklist, fostering buy-in and minimizing misunderstandings. Meteora‚Äôs commitment to transparency and community involvement will be key to effectively addressing these challenges and ensuring the blacklist serves its intended purpose without unintended negative consequences. Actionable Insights: Participating in a Fairer DeFi Future Meteora‚Äôs initiative provides valuable insights and actionable steps for both users and the broader DeFi community: For Meteora Users: Actively participate in the community by reporting any suspicious wallet addresses you observe. Your contribution can help maintain the integrity of the MET token distribution and strengthen the ecosystem. For DeFi Projects: Consider implementing similar mechanisms to address fairness and security concerns within your own platforms. Transparency, community involvement, and collaboration with security experts are crucial elements. For the Web3 Community: Support projects like Meteora that prioritize fairness and security. Engage in constructive dialogue and contribute to shaping a more responsible and trustworthy DeFi landscape. By working together, we can build a DeFi ecosystem that is not only innovative and accessible but also fundamentally fair and secure for all participants. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Trust and Equity in DeFi Meteora‚Äôs introduction of a blacklist for MET token distribution is a revolutionary move that underscores the project‚Äôs commitment to Web3 community trust , crypto fairness , and decentralized exchange security . By proactively addressing concerns about malicious actors and embracing transparency and community participation, Meteora is setting a powerful example for the entire DeFi space. This initiative is not just about protecting MET token distribution; it‚Äôs about building a more equitable, secure, and sustainable future for decentralized finance on Solana and beyond.

This new coin is Rexas Finance(RXS) and has been in the headlines as it focuses on real-world assets (RWA) such as gold, real estate, and arts, offering alternatives to traditional investment vehicles. SHIB Whales Bet Big on Rexas Finance‚ÄîCan RXS Deliver an 11,205% Surge? Rexas Finance exists as a sophisticated system beyond standard RWA platforms because it streamlines the entire process of creating, managing, and trading asset-backed tokens. Through blockchain technology, Rexas Finance enables retail investors to access previously limited assets, including real estate, fine art, and commodities. Through tokenization on this platform, users gain better asset liquidity and make retail investors less restricted by entry barriers. Users can use the Rexas Token Builder's no-code solution to digitize their assets through ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards while maintaining fast and simple processing. The substantial interest shown by SHIB whales in RXS stems from the promising prospects of financial gain. The initial presale investors achieved a remarkable 7X value increase, and experts expect RXS to continue growing strongly. The upcoming June 19, 2025, launch of RXS at a $0.25 price brings growing market anticipation. The presale achieved high success through investor participation, reaching 90.91% of the $56,000,000 goal and securing $46,910,790 in funding. Rexas Finance's innovative RWA tokenization approach receives substantial investor backing because of the high market demand. RXS presents a potential 11,205% value increase because it enables users to acquire ownership of multi-trillion dollar investments easily. Rexas Finance enables investors to acquire fractional parts of valuable real estate properties and art collections through tokenization using a few dollars. The open access model expands market participation and creates a varied investor group that drives RWA market expansion. Rexas Finance stands out from regular competitors because the platform combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The platform provides businesses and startups with the Rexas Launchpad tool that allows token issuance for raising funds through real-world asset-based backing. Industrial sectors like construction and fine art benefit from this feature because it provides an efficient funding solution beyond traditional limitations. Whales demonstrate their interest in RXS as proof that they want to invest in market-leading assets. The SHIB platform encounters problems from whale investor control, but RXS provides better opportunities because it focuses on RWA tokenization. Conclusion With the interest of SHIB whales in RXS, they are bagging at a high rate, pushing RXS presale to almost sell out as only less than 10% of the tokens remain. Savvy investors are encouraged to act fast and head to the RXS website and buy into the final presale; with 11205% in play, Rexas Finance is a must not miss opportunity.

Wedson stated that the Risk Cap metric signals a short-term decline in line with current data, but that important developments may occur in the coming months. The Risk Cap metric measures the risk level of an asset by analyzing the relationship between its market value (market cap) and capital change (delta cap). Normalized into 24-hour periods, this indicator provides important data on Bitcoin's price volatility and risk levels. The Risk Cap metric peaked in March 2024. A lower peak was formed in December, indicating a loss of momentum in market value. Wedson reiterated that he is bearish for Bitcoin in the short term, predicting that altcoin season is approaching but will gain momentum towards the end of April. Related News: Critical SEC Cryptocurrency Meeting Ends - Here's What Was Discussed and the Outcome The analyst emphasized that even if Bitcoin declines, its overall upward trend could continue: The bull market could continue, although a pullback to $64,000 is possible. (A similar situation occurred in 2021.) Stating that he sold Bitcoin in the range of $102,000 ‚Äì $106,000, Wedson stated that the general upward trend could continue despite the current weakness. According to Wedson, Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high by October 2025. However, the real movement is expected to be on the altcoin side. The analyst thinks that smaller and newly launched projects in particular can come to the forefront in the market by drawing liquidity from older projects. Stating that this cycle could last until November-December 2025, Wedson says investors should turn their attention to the altcoin market. *This is not investment advice.

In an interview on ""Unchained"" with crypto analyst Laura Shin, she expressed her belief that she could create a more positive impact in the world through digital currency. This led her to launch the $MOTHER memecoin on the Solana Blockchain. Although the token hasn‚Äôt garnered much attention in 2025, Nollars Network blockchain creator Richart Dedekind praised the Grammy-nominated artist Friday, noting that her efforts have made crypto investors of her initial coin offering wealthier than President Donald Trump‚Äôs token; a noteworthy feat. In 2 tweets, the $NOLA token creator spoke on Iggy‚Äôs success. ‚ÄúIggy Azaela #MotherToken went to 20 cents from $.001 because guys who wanted to see her booty on OnlyFans. That's a Big Azz Gain, nobody noticed! #PunIntended,‚Äù he wrote in a tweet on Friday. In a follow up tweet on the memecoin he wrote, ‚ÄúIggy made bigger gains for crypto investors than #TrumpToken possibly. And she didn't gas up anything. And she definitely looks like she could produce a lot if needed.‚Äù While injecting humor into the posts, the core message of the tweets remains strong. How Iggy Azalea Memecoin Made More Crypto Millionaires Than POTUS Donld Trump‚Äôs Token In May 2024, renowned rapper Iggy Azalea made a significant splash in the cryptocurrency world by launching her official memecoin, known as the $MOTHER token. Initially, the token was slated for a presale before being listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs). However, in a surprising turn of events, the highly anticipated cryptocurrency bypassed the presale stage and was launched directly on various exchanges. The initial coin offering (ICO) was set at an enticing price point of $0.0001, which quickly drew attention from both fans and investors eager to capitalize on the buzz surrounding Azalea‚Äôs entry into the crypto space. Following its listing, the $MOTHER token experienced an extraordinary surge in value over the next week. The price rose rapidly, jumping from $0.0001 to $0.03 within a few days, and then continuing to gain momentum as it climbed to $0.07, $0.09, and eventually peaking at an impressive $0.11. By June 6th, just weeks after its launch, the $MOTHER token reached a remarkable all-time high of $0.20. This astonishing growth not only showcased the token's potential but also reflected the massive interest generated by Iggy Azalea's brand and the powers of memecoins in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. The launch of $MOTHER illustrated the unique dynamics of celebrity-driven cryptocurrencies and their ability to captivate both die-hard fans and savvy investors alike. The growth of $0.0001 to 20 cents was a goliath ROI yield of +20,000% [per crypto calculator ]. Return on Investments: Iggy‚Äôs Memecoin vs Gold [AU] To put things into perspective, investors of the precious metal Gold haven‚Äôt seen annual ROI yields of just 10.6% per year since 1971. In 50 years, this store of value asset hasn‚Äôt seen the return on investment that the $MOTHER token did in a few weeks. A $100 investment in gold in 1971 would be worth around $560 today. A $100 investment in $MOTHER in June 2024, would have been worth $20,000. vs the POTUS Trump Token The daring jump in value even Trump's US President Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin. The $TRUMP token went from an initial coin offering of $8.50 on public exchanges on January 18th [2025] to an all-time high of $72.68 within 24 hours before facing correction. Though Trump‚Äôs token did well with a near 10x increase in value at its peak, the maximum ROI on initial investments was slightly over +755%. A $100 investment would have yielded profits of $545.53 and a total return of just under $618. And while Official Trump ($TRUMP) and precious Gold [AU] gains are healthy sums compared to most investments, Iggy Azalea‚Äôs coin saw incredibly higher ROI yields than Trump $MOTHER reached a market cap of nearly US$90 million dollars at its peak in June of 2024 and even today, is still worth 4x more than its initial coin listing price. Nollars Network, A Disruptive New Blockchain for Memecoin Trades Therefore, by all accounts, the Nollars Network IES layer-2 blockchain and token‚Äôs creator is valid by all accounts with his controversial statement. And while the crypto-innovators' own project is going through its token presale phase to generate $2 million dollars for the Ineffable Exchange System mainnet, it shows the cryptocurrency inventor is studying the market and its irregularities. The Blockchain innovator is having a bit of fun acknowledging such critical facts about crypto investing and trading. Perhaps he‚Äôs doing this as well to highlight his own project, Nollars Netowrk, which is a disruptor in the memecoin trading market. Kanye West, Iggy Azalea, and Donald Trump‚Äôs tokens will all be traded on the coming hyper-speed layer-2 blockchain via its decentralized exchange, ‚ÄúNoladex.‚Äù However, they will all be traded at faster speeds, allowing better spot prices for investors and also saving money with lower transaction fees. This is just one of the dAPPS expected for the coming Nollars Network ecosystem. The $NOLA token, which is now in presale at 50 cents, is expected to surge in value due to its usefulness for such celebrity-tied markets. The layer-2 project could also become directly useful for Dogecoin (DOGE), as the Dedekind‚Äôs current developers have announced they will push to make the Nollars Network useful for thee ‚ÄúX Money‚Äù payment system for X (formerly Twitter), per Binance News . Though some traditional investors, cryptocurrency and DeFi enthusiasts may not be big on the idea of celebrity memecoins ‚Äî big time money is being made by those who ignore emotions and focus on the profits. Anyone from that group of doubters who went against the grain and bought $5000 or more of Iggy Azalea‚Äôs Mother token at its initial coin offering price would now be a crypto millionaire. Dismissing fake Iggy Azalea Coins & Counterfeit Projects Some may confuse the singer's official coin with scam or leech-brands, created by rug pull artists. For example, one token with the symbol $IGGY was launched by crypto promoter Sahil Arora. The scam artist ran off with $380,000 in presale funds, but the ICO was not related to Iggy Azalea. Simply put, those who bought the IGGY token did not do enough due diligence.There‚Äôs also been other dubious brands by scam artists such as ‚ÄúMother Iggy,‚Äù which has no relation to the grammy-nominated singer either. Projects like Nollars Network (NOLA), Iggy Azalea (MOTHER), and Official POTUS Trump (TRUMP) were all duplicated by scandalous scamsters of the dark web but simply reading a few news articles could allow anyone interested in investing find the official websites. Nonetheless, many still fall victims to their own laze and miss these top crypto investment opportunities. Kanye West Memecoin Prediction While the Nollars Network token presale (via Nollars.com) is highly touted as a long-term hold in the crypto market itself, the creator Richard Dedekind has acknowledged one other celebrity recently that could make a major impact on investor gains. The German mathematician says Kanye West‚Äôs Yeezy token will be a much bigger ROI yield than Bitcoin in 2025 if officially launched. Based on the accuracy of the crypt innovators‚Äô other tweets, perhaps investors should take heed.However, do be aware, the official Ye memecoin will be announced via Yeezy.com and the rapper himself. Do not fall for cryptocurrency brands unverified by West himself. Also check lists of the top token presales of 2025 for notifications of an ICO launch.

With the selling pressure, most major and top meme coins have recorded double-digit losses over the past two months. Most cryptos appear to have found their footing as they hold steady above crucial support zones. Even so, the recovery journey wouldn‚Äôt be without resistance as economic uncertainties persist. At the same time, savvy investors are eyeing revolutionary crypto projects geared towards solving identified problems. PepeX is one such project. It allows for anyone to create and market their own meme coin without the need for technical skills. Besides, a token‚Äôs community is assured of transparency and fairness to avoid insider front-running and other unfair practices. Set to launch on 24th March, its 30-stage presale will end on 22nd June with the pepe.fun platform slated for launching in Q3‚Äô25. Solana bulls seek to end range-bound trade as tariff jitters ease After plunging by 56% over the past two months, Solana price appears to have found its footing at $124.50. However, its path to recovery will not be without resistance as Trump‚Äôs tariffs fuel risk aversion. In the immediate term, the range between the support zone of $124.50 and the resistance level of $137.03 will be worth watching. Further rebounding will have the bulls eyeing the next target at $143.50. PepeX excites retail investors by assuring transparency, inclusion, and fairness The meme culture is shifting from tokens that start as a mere joke and largely rely on their virality on social media to revolutionary projects. PepeX is one of the meme projects whose attractiveness is founded on its ability to solve identified problems in the market. Through its AI-powered token launch system, retail investors can create, brand, and market their tokens with ease. This eliminates any form of gatekeeping and the requirement of technical skills. Besides, it has invested heavily on transparency as a way of ensuring a token‚Äôs creators don‚Äôt engage in insider front-running. This includes implementing anti-sniping protection and limiting the creators‚Äô holdings to 5%. Indeed, this unique trifactor of automation, transparency, and inclusion that has retail investors flocking to the PepeX platform even before the launch of its presale on 24th March. In addition to its growth potential, the project offers crypto enthusiasts an opportunity for their capital investment to surge by 5% after every 3-day stage. By the end of the 30-stage presale on 22nd June, the early adopters will have gotten cumulative gains of 311%. Find out how to buy PepeX here . Cardano maintains proximity to 200-day MA as bulls readies for a rebound After hitting a three-month high in early March, Cardano price has since dropped by about 40%. However, as the broader crypto market appears set for recovery, the altcoin has been trading in close proximity to the long-term 200-day EMA for close to two weeks now. More specifically, it has stayed above the crucial support zone of $0.6805. In the immediate term, the range between $0.6805 and the resistance zone of $0.7500 will be worth watching. Entry of more buyers may give the bulls an opportunity to break the resistance with the next target being along the 50-day EMA at $0.7852.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is gaining traction as it nears $5.7 million in presale funds raised so far. With the broader market conditions having an impact on Bitcoin price and altcoins, what is the price prediction for ACX and could Bitcoin Pepe be a greater opportunity? Across Protocol (ACX) rallies 40% In hitting $0.44, Across Protocol showed a massive upside flip, having hovered near $0.32 in early action on March 22. As noted above, the catalyst for ACX price looks to have been the announcement from Bithumb, South Korea‚Äôs second-largest crypto exchange. The exchange announced the listing of Across Protocol with a Korean Won (KRW) trading pair. With Bithumb‚Äôs large user base and high trading volume key, ACX could get notable visibility and liquidity. Bulls have given up some of the gains as prices currently fluctuate near the previous resistance line. But what is the technical outlook? ACX price prediction A look at Across Protocol price on the daily chart shows key indicators slightly in favour of bulls. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has crossed above the signal line to signal bullish momentum. Across Protocol chart by TradingView Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a measure of price momentum, is upslopping and above the midpoint. However, the 40% spike has the RSI above 70 to indicate overbought conditions. The indicator thus suggests a potential reversal as traders potentially move to lock in latest gains. Support above $0.38 will see buyers target $0.46 and $0.64 range before $1 comes into view. On the other hand, profit taking may see buyers try to defend $0.32. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) gains presale momentum While ACX listing on Bithumb adds to excitement for the project‚Äôs community, fresh enthusiasm is also driving a bullish set up for Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP). The project, the world‚Äôs first meme ICO on Bitcoin, has raised nearly $5.7 million as the presale continues to gather pace. Bitcoin Pepe aims to integrate Solana‚Äôs high-speed blockchain features into Bitcoin, providing a layer 2 network that will drive meme evolution on the flagship blockchain network. Currently priced at $0.0281 in stage 7 of 30, BPEP price will rise 5% in each of the remaining presale stages. Early buyers could see a steady price appreciation ahead of market debut. This appears to be the case as investors position . Notably, BPEP‚Äôs market potential is down to its post-presale outlook. The broader crypto performance will also be a crucial factor. What‚Äôs the price forecast for Bitcoin Pepe? How Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs price moves post-presale is not something to predict with certainty. Nevertheless, presale interest, meme coin trends and long-term outlook for BTC and SOL offer notable factors to consider. Analysts are bullish on both Bitcoin and Solana, top 10 coins that have bullish long term forecasts. Delivering an L2 for the Bitcoin meme ecosystem, coupled with expected momentum for Solana, makes BPEP stand out across the presale market. BTC recapturing $100k and going on to new all-time highs in 2025 is largely anticipated. Solana retaking $200 and edging higher is also possible. If the market conditions permit, BPEP could launch into a new bull run. Should meme coins steal the show, Bitcoin Pepe price could explode in 2025. Do you fancy Bitcoin Pepe at $1?

This slow progress has pushed investors to other projects, including Ripple (XRP) and an emerging altcoin presently selling under $1. XRP has seen a big rise in its value, with its market capitalization increasing by $44 billion following the announcement of the United States crypto reserve. In addition, projects like Lightchain AI, Tron (TRX), Sui (SUI), and Hedera (HBAR) have also been seeing patronage as investors continue to look for opportunities to make profits. This shift in investor interest shows that most of them are adopting a diversification strategy to tokens with potential amidst Solana‚Äôs current price stagnation. The Impact of Ripple‚Äôs (XRP) Inclusion in the U.S. Crypto Reserve The inclusion of Ripple (XRP) in the United States crypto reserve raised its market position, making it earn the trust of institutional and retail investors in the crypto market. The development meant that the project has now been recognized for its role in global financial transactions and payments. While the asset is still being bothered by several regulatory bodies, the development means that it has the credibility that other tokens do not have. Nevertheless, the issue here remains whether or not the move will result in more decentralization or whether the change in policies will impact the direction of the project. According to experts, the token could gain wide acceptance through increased investor patronage, which means that the current tough period could be worth the wait in the end. Although the inclusion signals a win for XRP, another red flag to be bothered about is the regulatory changes on a wider scope for the future of cryptocurrencies. Emerging Altcoins Under $1: A New Opportunity for Investors Emerging altcoins under $1 are seeing attention as investors continue to look for opportunities to make gains in the market. Lightchain AI stands out as one of the best of the emerging crop of tokens. The project has a blockchain powered by AI, integrating artificial intelligence with decentralized applications. Unlike most speculative tokens, Lightchain AI offers real value, providing investors seeking long-term growth opportunities with what they need. With new AI tokens entering the market, Lightchain AI‚Äôs focus on decentralized applications puts it in a leading position among tokens in that category. This is because investors usually purchase tokens with good metrics such as increased adoption, strong team, and very good use cases. With investors going after AI-based tokens, Lightchain AI provides real competition in the under $1 category, proving itself as a better option to most traditional assets. Can Lightchain AI and Other Emerging Altcoins Threaten Solana‚Äôs Dominance? As the crypto market continues to develop, altcoins like Lightchain AI are seeing adoptions, raising questions about whether they can pose big challenges to Solana‚Äôs dominance. While Solana continues to hold on to its number one spot in terms of speed and scalability among layer-1 blockchains, projects integrating AI and blockchain are seriously catching up to it. Lightchain AI stands out among the rest in its focus on AI-powered decentralized applications, providing users with a value that other traditional blockchains don‚Äôt have. Meanwhile, investors are also looking into alternative altcoins that provide features like enhanced security, efficiency, and interoperability. As investors continue to look for these qualities, the need for AI-driven solutions is on the rise. With new projects entering the crypto market, liquidity is leaving projects like Solana and entering into these new projects. While Solana is still strong in the market, the rise of Lightchain AI and other altcoins shows that market dynamics could shift, which may lead to competition in the market space. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-22 11:00:00

With both assets gaining traction, investors are closely evaluating which holds the greater potential for short-term and long-term growth. Cardano (ADA) Showing Signs of a Breakout Cardano has been gradually recovering from its previous price correction, posting a 13.5% increase in March after a sluggish start to the year. The asset has been consolidating within the $0.70 to $0.78 range , but social sentiment surrounding ADA has reached its highest level in four months , reflecting growing investor confidence. Market analysts suggest that if ADA surpasses the critical $0.78 resistance level , it could quickly advance toward $0.88 , representing a 20% surge from its current price . While ADA benefits from a strong and dedicated community, on-chain activity remains below previous peak levels , raising questions about whether the rally can be sustained. Despite this, technical indicators suggest bullish momentum , and a breakout could attract significant new investment. However, as some investors seek projects with higher growth potential and strong DeFi applications , many are shifting their focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Nearing Another Major Price Increase Mutuum Finance ‚Äôs presale is moving at an impressive pace, with over 60% of Phase 3 already sold out . The project has already secured over $4.35 million in funding and gained more than 6,200 holders , demonstrating growing demand. At its current $0.02 price point , the next phase will introduce a 25% increase , raising the token‚Äôs value to $0.025 . As Phase 4 approaches, investors are rushing to acquire MUTM tokens before the next price jump . Each presale stage has resulted in incremental price increases, benefiting early investors with higher potential returns ahead of the token‚Äôs listing on major exchanges. Given the growing FOMO among investors, Phase 4 is expected to sell out even faster than previous rounds . Unlike many speculative crypto projects that rely solely on market hype, Mutuum Finance is building a fully functional decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem . The platform allows users to earn passive income by supplying liquidity , while borrowers can secure funds without selling their assets . To ensure security and transparency, Mutuum Finance is undergoing a full CertiK audit , providing confidence to investors ahead of its official launch. The protocol also features a buy-and-distribute mechanism , where a portion of platform fees is used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market . These tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders , creating sustained buy pressure and rewarding long-term investors . Additionally, the team is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin , which will enable users to mint stable assets backed by on-chain reserves. This feature enhances the platform‚Äôs lending efficiency and overall utility , further driving demand for MUTM tokens. With a well-structured presale, an expanding DeFi ecosystem, and upcoming exchange listings , MUTM is poised for strong post-launch growth . Market analysts believe that once trading goes live, MUTM‚Äôs value could appreciate significantly , driven by increasing adoption and platform demand. The combination of a fully developed lending protocol, stablecoin integration, and strategic buyback mechanisms makes MUTM a top contender for substantial gains . The Next Big Opportunity in Crypto? As the cryptocurrency market rebounds, investors are seeking high-potential projects with strong fundamentals . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most promising investment opportunities , offering real-world DeFi utility, continuous demand mechanisms, and a structured growth strategy . With the next presale phase approaching rapidly, securing MUTM at its current price presents a rare opportunity for early-stage investors before the next surge. As momentum builds, Mutuum Finance could become one of the most sought-after tokens in the DeFi space .

According to the announcement, the National Rugby League (NRL) club said the cryptocurrency exchange will have its insignia at the front of its players‚Äô shorts for the 2025 season.

42147843,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-michael-saylor-set-to-raise-funds-to-buy-bitcoin,1742641252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42147843.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now As Michael Saylor Set to Raise Funds to Buy Bitcoin,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-michael-saylor-set-to-raise-funds-to-buy-bitcoin,"MicroStrategy‚Äôs founder and ardent Bitcoin believer Michael Saylor recently announced his plans to raise over $711 million to buy more Bitcoin via the sale of a new series of preferred stock. His purchases have only risen over the years, with the company now holding close to half a million Bitcoins ; this purchase could potentially help MSTR own more than 500k Bitcoins. If such a huge transaction goes through, then it is quite likely that the overall market will, though slow and steady, see an uptrend in prices. Some of the best cryptos to buy to enjoy excellent ROIs at the time are listed below. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top Altcoins That May Pump Soon BTC Bull ‚Äì BTCBULL When Bitcoin inches toward another major rally, history shows that the ripple effect reaches far beyond the original coin. BTC Bull is one of those projects eyeing the early wave‚Äînot by copying BTC, but by celebrating it, amplifying it, and turning it into a high-engagement meme economy. At first glance, it might seem like just another meme token with a bullish theme. But there‚Äôs more happening under the hood. BTC Bull is designed around community-triggered milestones‚Äîas the project hits growth targets, it unlocks airdrops for holders. This kind of reward-based system gives people a reason to hold, not just speculate. On top of that, it‚Äôs got a burn mechanism baked in, meaning the total token supply reduces over time, applying consistent upward pressure on price as demand grows. The fact that it has already raised nearly $4 million says a lot. There‚Äôs attention, there‚Äôs energy, and‚Äîimportantly‚Äîthere‚Äôs capital already backing the project. The project has already received appreciation from top YouTubers like ClayBro and many others on their respective social media channels. With a brand built around Bitcoin and a structure that encourages participation and scarcity, BTC Bull isn‚Äôt trying to be the next BTC‚Äîit‚Äôs aiming to ride the same wave while giving early adopters more in terms of ROI. If the Bitcoin rally ends up dragging meme tokens along with it‚Äîas it usually does‚Äîthis one could be an early mover. Solaxy ‚Äì SOLX Solana or Ethereum? That‚Äôs been the debate for years now. Solaxy skips the argument altogether. It‚Äôs a Layer 2 solution that builds bridges between both chains while introducing its own staking-powered ecosystem that‚Äôs fast, efficient, and flexible. Here‚Äôs the core idea: as users and capital move between major chains, friction becomes a real problem. Solaxy solves that by offering a scalable environment where assets can move easily, staking rewards stay competitive, and transaction speeds stay sharp. It‚Äôs not aiming to reinvent the wheel‚Äîit‚Äôs simply trying to make the ride smoother and more rewarding. What separates it from the pack is its staking system, which allows users to earn yield while maintaining exposure across ecosystems. This kind of setup could prove valuable as more investors look to generate passive income while staying liquid across chains. With over $27 million raised over a matter of weeks, Solaxy‚Äôs presale success is also one worth noting. In a market that‚Äôs inching toward new highs, platforms like Solaxy aren‚Äôt often the loudest‚Äîbut they tend to stick around. Infrastructure quietly wins when speculation cools. And when the broader trend resumes, these are the projects that support the movement of capital, track fees, and earn. Solaxy is one of the few in its space that actively acknowledges the need for multi-chain convenience, and it‚Äôs building the tools to support that future now. Meme Index ‚Äì MEMEX Most investors don‚Äôt want to bet on just one meme token. They want exposure to the trend without needing to guess which coin is going to blow up next. Meme Index exists to solve that problem, offering a curated bundle of high-potential meme tokens, built with risk levels and market behavior in mind. This isn‚Äôt some random portfolio. Meme Index categorizes tokens based on volatility, sentiment strength, and upside, essentially creating something like a crypto-native meme ETF. For retail investors, it‚Äôs an easy entry into a fast-moving space. For whales and institutions, it offers exposure to meme coins without micromanaging every bet. And it‚Äôs not theory‚Äîit has already raised over $4 million, meaning there‚Äôs active interest and growing belief in this style of meme exposure. As meme tokens continue to pull crazy ROI during hot phases, diversified exposure makes more and more sense. If Saylor‚Äôs next big move pushes BTC higher again, meme token speculation could follow close behind. And in those cases, it‚Äôs usually not one coin that pops‚Äîit‚Äôs a dozen. Meme Index positions itself to catch multiple rallies at once, removing the need to pick winners when the entire segment could thrive. If you‚Äôre bullish on the meme trend but want a structured path into it, this is one to keep on the radar. Best Wallet Token ‚Äì BEST There are plenty of wallets in crypto, but very few that actually do something beyond just holding your tokens. Best Wallet takes a different route‚Äîit turns your wallet into a launchpad, a staking portal, inbuilt support for DEX, and a data hub, all in one sleek app. The Best Wallet as a project is essentially a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that connects users to over 60 different blockchains‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just the beginning. It also features direct access to a decentralized exchange, allowing users to trade assets without ever leaving the app. There‚Äôs a presale aggregator, which gives early access to new projects. You can even stake tokens directly for high APY, monitor your portfolio, and track new market trends‚Äîall without relying on third-party platforms. Its native token, BEST , is central to the experience. Holders get access to exclusive features, reduced fees, and future airdrops. This gives the token actual use rather than being just a passive asset. The presale for the token has also managed to raise $11 million and above, making it among the biggest and most successful presales within the category this year. Best Wallet doesn‚Äôt try to compete on flash. It focuses on functionality and ecosystem power, two things that matter more as the market matures. As more users demand real tools and efficient asset control, Best Wallet could become a go-to companion app for the next generation of retail and pro traders alike. MIND of Pepe ‚Äì MIND Most meme tokens follow the crowd. MIND of Pepe listens to the crowd, learns from it, and then uses that information to chart its own course. This isn‚Äôt a typical speculative coin‚Äîit‚Äôs an AI-powered agent designed to analyze real-time crypto chatter, investor sentiment, and social data to predict what might happen next. Think of it as a meme token with a brain. While other projects rely on pure hype cycles, MIND of Pepe has built a tool that adapts with the market. It‚Äôs programmed to scrape through Twitter threads, Telegram channels, influencer posts, and price action to detect patterns and narrative shifts early. üëÅ Final Thought üëÅMIND of Pepe is not just an AI bot.It‚Äôs an autonomous market intelligence system.It‚Äôs your early warning radar.It‚Äôs the future of AI-powered trading.‚óé The best insights? Locked behind $MIND .Are you inside, or are you guessing? üëÅ #MINDofPepe $MIND ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 7, 2025 This smart backbone is paired with a name that carries cultural firepower‚ÄîPepe remains one of the most iconic meme figures in crypto. But MIND of Pepe doesn‚Äôt just ride on imagery. It‚Äôs attracted real traction, already securing over $7.4 million in funding from investors who believe both in the tech and in the meme economy‚Äôs staying power. As markets become more reactive to social sentiment, tools like this will become not just useful but essential. MIND of Pepe could be the prototype for what future meme projects evolve into‚Äîsmarter, faster, more plugged in, and capable of reacting before humans even spot the trend. Conclusion Michael Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin buys don‚Äôt always spark instant rallies‚Äîbut they do something more impactful. They signal conviction at the highest level, nudging other heavyweight institutions to stop watching from the sidelines and start taking crypto seriously. Over time, these moves reshape how capital flows into the space, shifting sentiment and opening the door for broader adoption. While the market hasn't turned completely green yet, the groundwork is clearly being laid. If Bitcoin starts reversing upward and pushes into new territory in the coming weeks or months, it‚Äôs often the altcoins and early-stage projects that move fastest once momentum kicks in. For investors who prefer thinking a few steps ahead rather than reacting late, this may be the kind of moment worth leaning into‚Äîwith the projects mentioned above being great bets. The market isn‚Äôt shouting right now‚Äîbut the smart moves often happen during the quiet. And this might just be the stretch where careful positioning sets up the best gains.

One such hidden gem that‚Äôs capturing significant attention is XRPTurbo ($XRT) , an innovative AI-powered launchpad built exclusively on Ripple‚Äôs XRP Ledger (XRPL). With over 120,000 XRP raised in its presale so far, XRPTurbo is rapidly emerging as the next big thing on the XRP blockchain, attracting attention from investors seeking exponential returns. Why XRPTurbo is Turning Heads in the Crypto Community XRPTurbo is not your ordinary crypto project‚Äîit‚Äôs the first-ever AI-driven token launchpad specifically designed for the XRP blockchain. Leveraging XRPL blockchain, efficiency, and ultra-low transaction costs, XRPTurbo gives developers and investors access to next-level decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and services, powered by sophisticated AI agents. Unlike Ethereum, which struggles with exorbitant gas fees, or Solana, which has faced repeated network reliability concerns, XRPTurbo utilizes the XRP blockchain to provide a stable, scalable, and cost-effective platform that‚Äôs positioned perfectly to become Ripple‚Äôs next breakout project in 2025. Revolutionary AI Agents: A Game-Changer for XRPL At the heart of XRPTurbo‚Äôs groundbreaking ecosystem is its ability to create, deploy, and manage AI-powered agents. These smart agents automate complex blockchain tasks, eliminating user and developer friction. XRPTurbo ‚Äôs AI agents can seamlessly execute smart contracts, implement automated trading strategies, monitor blockchain data, and manage digital marketing and community engagement. This revolutionary capability ensures users can focus on innovation and strategy, while the AI agents handle routine operations with precision and efficiency, ultimately boosting productivity and profitability. The $XRT Token: Your Gateway to Exclusive Benefits The native $XRT token is central to XRPTurbo‚Äôs robust ecosystem. By holding $XRT tokens, users unlock several powerful benefits: Priority Access: Investors holding $XRT tokens gain early access to innovative AI and real-world asset (RWA) projects launching on the XRPTurbo platform, positioning themselves for lucrative early-stage returns. AI Agent Deployment: Users can utilize their $XRT holdings to create and manage customized AI agents, streamlining operations and unlocking new blockchain efficiencies. Passive Rewards and Revenue-Sharing: Token holders can stake $XRT to earn passive income, creating additional value through platform-generated fees, and incentivizing long-term commitment and engagement. With only 100 million XRT tokens ever to exist, scarcity is baked into the design, setting the stage for significant future appreciation. Final Opportunity: Presale Ending Soon Time is quickly running out to secure XRT tokens at discounted presale pricing. With less than 7 days remaining, XRPTurbo‚Äôs presale offers early investors a strategic entry point before the token is listed on exchanges at a guaranteed 25% premium above the presale price.

Additionally, XRPTurbo is finalizing negotiations with multiple major exchanges for immediate listings post-presale, ensuring robust liquidity and broad market accessibility from day one. Don‚Äôt Miss the Next Ripple Blockchain Gem Crypto history repeatedly rewards early movers. Investors who missed opportunities with Cardano or Solana now have a second chance with XRPTurbo .

As ETH gains momentum, investors are searching for the next high-potential asset that could deliver exponential returns. Among the rising contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing significant attention for its structured presale, DeFi lending model, and built-in growth mechanisms. With market conditions favoring strong utility-driven projects, MUTM could be poised for a major breakout, delivering 50x returns to early investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending by offering a non-custodial protocol where users can lend and borrow assets securely. Unlike traditional lending platforms that require intermediaries, Mutuum‚Äôs system is built on smart contracts, ensuring transparent, automated transactions that eliminate third-party risk. Borrowers can access liquidity by locking collateral, while lenders earn passive income through interest generated from loan repayments. This two-sided lending marketplace creates sustained demand for the MUTM token, as users engage with the platform to maximize capital efficiency. Additionally, Mutuum Finance introduces a stablecoin, designed to maintain value through overcollateralization and algorithmic balancing mechanisms. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this asset operates on a decentralized model, allowing users to mint it against excess collateral. This feature further strengthens the ecosystem by expanding liquidity options for borrowers while reinforcing long-term token demand. Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 3 of its presale, priced at just $0.02, and is set to transition to Phase 4, where the price will rise by 25% to $0.025. Over $4.45 million has already been raised, with more than 6,250 holders securing their positions before the next price jump. The structured presale ensures that early investors benefit from incremental price increases, offering a clear path to profitability before the token‚Äôs official listing. As FOMO builds and the remaining presale phases continue selling out, analysts predict MUTM‚Äôs price could skyrocket once it hits major exchanges. One of the most compelling aspects of Mutuum Finance is its buy-and-distribute mechanism, designed to enhance token scarcity and drive sustained price appreciation. A portion of fees generated within the platform is used to purchase MUTM from the open market and distribute it to mtToken holders. This creates continuous buy pressure, ensuring that as more users engage with the platform, token demand increases. By implementing this self-sustaining model, Mutuum Finance establishes a strong foundation for long-term value appreciation, making it an attractive option for both short-term traders and long-term investors. With its utility-driven model, fast-growing community, and presale momentum, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the most promising altcoins in 2024. While speculative meme coins often experience short-lived pumps, MUTM‚Äôs value is backed by real-world use cases, positioning it for sustained growth beyond market hype. When MUTM reaches just $1, early investors who bought in at $0.02 would see a 50x return. Given its strategic presale structure, upcoming exchange listings, and built-in token demand mechanisms, this scenario appears increasingly realistic as more investors recognize the project‚Äôs potential. Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing rally has ignited a surge in altcoin investments, with Mutuum Finance emerging as one of the most promising DeFi contenders. Its structured lending ecosystem, passive income opportunities, and upcoming stablecoin integration set it apart from traditional speculative assets. With presale phases quickly selling out and market conditions favoring high-utility projects, now could be the best time to secure a position in MUTM before its anticipated surge.

Still, since then, it has been making lower lows instead of new highs. Meanwhile, investors have been noticed piling up big for this new crypto coin that trades at $0.2, and analysts predict a 21805% surge. This is due to its focus on real-world assets(RWA). This DeFi coin is Rexas Finance(RXS) . Dogecoin Drops 58%‚ÄîIs Rexas Finance the Next Big Opportunity with 21,805% Growth Potential? Dogecoin‚Äôs price has experienced a sharp decline since reaching its post-election peak at $0.4843 and currently stands at $0.19941, which has prompted many investors to pursue alternative investment options. The Rexas Finance ecosystem, along with its projected 21,805% growth potential, has become a major draw for investors. The speculative nature of Dogecoin makes RXS provide a more enduring investment method for investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) Set for 21,805% Surge‚ÄîCould It Outshine Dogecoin? Rexas Finance (RXS) creates buzz in the cryptocurrency market through its revolutionary method of converting physical assets into digital tokens. RXS distinguishes itself from traditional cryptocurrencies by linking investors to physical assets, which provides them with a distinctive opportunity to invest in various markets. Through blockchain technology and this approach, investors gain enhanced accessibility combined with secure and transparent operations. The RXS token is available on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko while Certik performed an audit, which provides additional reassurance for investors. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Quick sellout stages have marked the rapid growth of Rexas Finance in its presale events. The fundraising initiative has performed exceptionally well to date because investors reached the 90.91% mark toward its total target. The fundraising efforts have achieved $46,910,790 from the $56,000,000 goal while selling 454,551,661 tokens from the available 500,000,000. The high level of market interest demonstrates substantial excitement about RXS‚Äôs disruptive system. The token plans its initial public offering at $ 0.25 on June 19, 2025 , to reach its long-term goal. Real-world assets receive tokenization capabilities through Rexas Finance, which is a major advantage. The blockchain enables investors to conduct asset trades of real estate and commodities while lowering expenses and broadening access worldwide. RWA tokenization at the core of the platform sets it up for substantial market expansion because it interacts with a financial asset sector with a total value of $486 trillion. Rexas Finance enables investors to build diversified portfolios while providing them with tangible investment options that exceed the speculative nature of Dogecoin and other similar cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance shows increasing strength in the cryptocurrency market, while industry analysts expect it to secure a dominant market position. The projected 21,805% growth of RXS stands solid because the platform combines its innovative structure with robust market interest. The projected growth of RXS exceeds the performance of traditional cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, and its initial listing price stands at $0.25. Real-world asset integration and RXS‚Äôs robust ecosystem position it for successful long-term development, which draws investors who seek substantial returns. Conclusion In conclusion, Rexas Finance emerges as a coin any savvy investors should lay their hands on. With DOGE price action being poor, RXS emerges as a haven coin where top analysts predict a 21805% surge where a modest investment of $200 can grow to a whopping $43K, turning hundreds to thousands and thousands to millions; investors have a small window to participate in this fast moving presale.

There‚Äôs talk that this little-known asset could see immense growth. Speculation is growing about its potential to surge in value. What is attracting attention to this cryptocurrency? Dive into the factors fueling this interest and what it might mean for the future of crypto investments. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $10 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren‚Äôt just spectators‚Äîthey‚Äôre rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It‚Äôs a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More ‚Äì Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: A Digital Currency for Fast and Low-Cost Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to facilitate fast, low-cost transactions that are open and borderless. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, it enables secure and irreversible transactions without the need for a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion units, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, managing supply release through escrow mechanisms. The potential of XRP lies in its ability to streamline payment transfers across various currencies efficiently. Its technology aims to enhance global financial infrastructure by reducing transaction costs and settlement times. In the current market cycle, XRP continues to focus on practical applications within cross-border payments, which may influence its position in the cryptocurrency market. Its features of decentralization, speed, and cost-effectiveness contribute to its role in facilitating global transactions. Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Smart Contracts Ethereum is a prominent blockchain platform that introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the Merge in 2022, enhancing energy efficiency and security. Ethereum hosts a diverse ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which improve transaction speed and reduce fees. The network also introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for various purposes such as governance and utility within dApps, although transactions still require ETH for gas fees. The potential of Ethereum lies in its ongoing development and adaptability. The forthcoming sharding phase aims to increase scalability and lower transaction costs, further solidifying Ethereum‚Äôs role in decentralized technologies. Ether (ETH) remains central to the network, enabling transactions, rewarding validators, and serving as a valuable digital asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum continues to be a significant platform due to its extensive use cases and active development community. Its position as a foundation for many blockchain applications highlights its importance in the evolving digital landscape. Conclusion XRP and ETH show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely combines sports and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and community engagement in the current bull run.

As of March 22, ETH trades at $1,995.69 with a 24-hour trading volume of $9.05 billion and a market cap of $240.7 billion, maintaining its rank as the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency. What‚Äôs driving this rebound? On-chain data points to a significant shift in investor behavior. Over the past 48 hours, more than 360,000 ETH have been withdrawn from centralized exchanges. Historically, such outflows are associated with bullish sentiment, as long-term holders move tokens into cold storage in anticipation of future gains. These withdrawals reduce available supply, creating upward pressure on price. 360,000 #ETH has been withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the last 48 hours. pic.twitter.com/WsaTeoLFaC ‚Äî KIMIA (@Your_Kimia) March 21, 2025 This trend may signal growing institutional interest and renewed investor confidence. If ETH maintains a foothold above $2,000, technical targets include $2,150 and $2,300. However, a breakdown below $1,950 could reignite short-term selling. Key Levels & Market Structure: Signs of a Breakout? Ethereum is currently forming a symmetrical triangle‚Äîa pattern often associated with impending volatility. The lower boundary around $1,956 is reinforced by the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $1,968.20. Immediate resistance aligns closely with the $2,000 level. A confirmed breakout above $2,073 could strengthen bullish momentum and open the path to $2,153 and $2,233. Conversely, a breakdown would bring support levels at $1,871 and $1,809 into focus.

Ethereum Fees Drop 50%: Opportunity or Warning Sign? While ETH‚Äôs price is trending higher, network activity is trending in the opposite direction. Transaction fees on Ethereum have dropped by 50%, reflecting a sharp decline in on-chain engagement. This could be interpreted as either an opportunity‚Äîmaking Ethereum more accessible‚Äîor a signal of declining demand. Lower fees benefit retail users and developers who were previously priced out of the network, potentially encouraging broader adoption. However, the slowdown in DeFi trading, NFT sales, and Layer 1 activity raises concerns about Ethereum‚Äôs ability to retain dominance, particularly as competition from Layer 2 solutions intensifies. The total amount of #ETH fees decreased by 50% this week as on-chain activity continued to slow down. #crypto pic.twitter.com/hBNopTGpmT ‚Äî CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) March 21, 2025 Implications of Lower Fees: Lower barrier to entry for developers and small users Declining transaction volume may reflect weakening user demand Key sectors like DeFi and NFTs showing reduced activity Whether this decline is a temporary dip or the start of a longer-term shift remains unclear. Outlook: Can Ethereum Maintain Momentum? Ethereum‚Äôs recovery above $2,000 marks an inflection point, but the sustainability of this move depends on more than just price. Large exchange outflows suggest investors are accumulating ETH with a long-term view. Yet, falling network usage tempers the optimism. A confirmed move above $2,073 could validate the breakout and pave the way toward $2,300. But if volume and on-chain activity continue to decline, ETH may struggle to hold current levels. The next few weeks will be critical in determining whether Ethereum‚Äôs momentum is part of a broader trend‚Äîor simply a short-lived rally. Want to capitalize on crypto trends?

The token, which once traded at $3, has plummeted below $0.9, marking a staggering 60% drop in value. Many investors are now questioning whether the project is in trouble, especially after Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons called it a potential ‚Äúscam .‚Äù While some traders are worried, others are watching for signs of a recovery. Why Is the Pi Network Dropping? The recent crash in Pi Network‚Äôs price has sparked debates within the community. Some believe the project lacks transparency, while others think it is simply going through a market correction. However, technical indicators show that the downward trend is still strong. One key indicator, the Bollinger Band Trend (BBTrend), has fallen to -40. This is the lowest it has ever been, showing that sellers are still in control. When the BBTrend stays negative for many days, it often signals that the price will continue to drop unless buyers step in. Another important indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), dropped to 17.5, meaning the coin was extremely oversold. It has since recovered slightly to 45 , but this is still in bearish territory. If the RSI fails to move higher, the selling pressure could continue. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Prediction: Binance Eager To List Pi Network, Is $3 Incoming? , Will Pi Coin Fall Below $1? Pi Network has already dropped below $1 for the first time since February 22. If the decline continues, the next key support levels to watch are $0.80 and $0.60. A further drop in these levels could signal even more weakness. However, if buyers regain confidence, Pi Network could rise again. The first resistance level is at $1.25, and if it breaks past this, the price could move toward $1.80 . For now, Pi Network remains in a fragile position. With ongoing concerns and market uncertainty, the next few days will be crucial in determining if PI can recover or continue its decline. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The token‚ÄÇis priced at $0.02 at present, and half of its Phase 3 allocation has already sold, indicating strong demand ahead of a planned 25% price increase to $0.025 in Phase 4. Analysts referencing Ripple (XRP) consider MUTM‚Äôs realistic lending protocols with revenue-generating tokenomics, claiming‚ÄÇthat they are the keys to the kingdom and a strong case for upward trends as gainfulness would lead towards a future heavyweight in DeFi. Suppose you‚Äôre looking to tap into utility-driven assets at a deep level. In that case, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is‚ÄÇone of the last opportunities to gain entry before it‚Äôs swept up onto an exchange ‚Äî and its price skyrockets. The MUTM Token‚ÄÇPresale Starts Strong Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 3 Nears Sellout With Investors‚ÄÇFlocking to Pile on Capital That makes for a $0.02 entry point and a brief opportunity for investors to be prepared to trigger Phase 4 when tokens will be priced in at $0.025‚Äîmeaning a 25% jump for investors‚ÄÇwho get in now. Besides the short-term incentive, Phase 1 contributors potentially gain back with the‚ÄÇproject listing price of $0.06, which equates to a 200% increase from Phase 3. In addition to presale cap, forecasts show a potential move to $1.80 in the months that follow its exchange launch‚ÄÇ‚Äî based on buy-pressure mechanics and growing user numbers driving Mutuum. While Ripple (XRP)‚ÄÇis constantly circling back to old-timey banking partnerships, MUTM‚Äôs decentralized lending structure and mtToken integrations develop their own internal demand and lessen the need for votes of confidence from outside the ecosystem. Investors Sparking Interest with‚ÄÇROI Calculations The‚ÄÇnumbers tell a difficult story of potential opportunity. An investment of $1,000 at the Phase 3 price of $0.02 will return 50,000 tokens worth $3,000 at the $0.06‚ÄÇlisting and worth $90,000 if post-launch targets are achieved and hit $1.80 These predictions have been led by the tokenomic structure of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that uses 30% of platform fees to power weekly MUTM buybacks, redistributing tokens to stakers and‚ÄÇreducing supply. On the other hand, Ripple (XRP) still struggles with the aftermath of the SEC ruling, as MUTM‚Äôs over-collateralization loans‚ÄÇand peer-to-peer lending find a risk-adjusted opportunity. Passive income at a different degree in the form of the protocol‚Äôs mtTokens‚Äîpooled interest-bearing assets tied to different‚ÄÇdeposits such as ETH or USDT‚Äîentice the attention of holders wanting compounded returns on top of their static staking. Tokenomics Allow Future‚ÄÇOutperformance MUTM price‚ÄÇby tethering to real-platform activity Avoiding Speculative Traps Borrowers locked collateral well over the amount of their loans,‚ÄÇstabilizing the ecosystem with liquidity. All the while lenders earn dynamic yields based‚ÄÇon pool utilization rates ‚Äî a differentiator over the fixed-rate models common across legacy platforms. This equilibrium has already seen presale numbers above the $4.4 million mark,‚ÄÇwith Phase 3 participation demonstrating institutional-grade confidence. With Ripple (XRP) seeking clarity‚ÄÇin a courtroom battle, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) embraces transparency friendly to regulatory pursuits, undergoing a Certik audit to verify the integrity of its smart contracts which is on track to be finalized in the coming weeks. Final‚ÄÇChecks Before Takeoff And mutuum finance (MUTM) is not resting‚ÄÇon presale laurels. To enhance utility within the ecosystem, development teams are‚ÄÇfinalizing a proprietary stablecoin backed by overcollateralized deposits. Security is still top of mind, audit results set to calm the jitters for cautious investors when the results‚ÄÇspread to official avenues. For newcomers on the fence, Phase 3‚Äôs‚ÄÇ$0.02 cost is a siren‚Äôs call, providing early-adopter access at a discount price point pre-exchange listings and buyback phases that will compound scarcity.

Despite attempts to reclaim higher levels, the cryptocurrency has remained under the $90,000 mark for over two weeks. This current range-bound activity comes nearly two months after Bitcoin touched its all-time high in January, indicating a period of uncertainty as traders assess macroeconomic conditions and upcoming Federal Reserve policy decisions. In the midst of the stagnation from BTC‚Äôs price, on-chain data is offering contrasting signals on where the market might be headed next. Analysts have pointed to fluctuations in buying and selling pressure on major exchanges, particularly Binance, as key indicators of short-term market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‚ÄòProbably‚Äô Hit Its Bottom At $77,000, Arthur Hayes Says Surge in Binance Net Taker Volume CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost recently highlighted a notable spike in net taker volume on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest centralized crypto exchange. According to Darkfost, net taker volume surged by $467 million in a single hour‚Äîmarking the highest level recorded in 2025 so far. This metric, which measures the difference between aggressive market buys and sells, is often used to gauge the immediate sentiment of active traders. A positive value indicates stronger buying activity and has historically signaled short-term bullishness. Darkfost emphasized that this uptick in taker volume occurred just prior to the recent FOMC meeting, suggesting that some traders may be positioning for favorable policy outcomes. While the data only reflects an hourly time frame and may not imply long-term directional change, the movement could signal a broader shift in sentiment among active participants, especially given Binance‚Äôs influential position in global crypto markets. üßê Buying pressure from Binance traders might be back. ‚Äî Binance is the CeX with the highest trading volume, making it particularly relevant for data analysis. ‚Äî The net taker volume is a powerful metric for gauging trader sentiment, as it measures the volume of market buys and‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/enI1VMAixf ‚Äî Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) March 20, 2025 Bitcoin Whale Activity Returns as Exchange Ratios Spike Meanwhile, another CryptoQuant analyst, EgyHash, provided a more cautious interpretation of recent activity. According to his analysis, the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio‚Äîdefined as the share of total exchange inflows coming from the top 10 largest addresses‚Äîhas surged to its highest point in over a year. This ratio is closely monitored because spikes often precede increased selling pressure, especially when large holders move funds to exchanges.

42149206,https://finbold.com/?p=241715,1742643390,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Binance names 4 lessons from past airdrop inefficiencies ‚Äì report,https://finbold.com/binance-names-4-lessons-from-past-airdrop-inefficiencies-report/,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has released a new report detailing several inefficiencies around airdrops and possible lessons to apply moving forward. According to the exchange, the affected airdrops fall into two categories. The first type is retroactive, where projects typically surprise existing users with rewards. The second group is the engagement airdrops, which are pre-announced events designed to attract new users and fit emerging projects. Depending on the project stage, both airdrops focus on different goals. Retroactive and engagement airdrops. Source: Binance Research Regarding the lessons from existing inefficiencies, the exchange‚Äôs Where Are Our Airdrops Going? highlighted some challenges affecting this type of token distribution, such as planning inefficiencies, insider allocation concerns, and technical issues. Reduced allocations The first problem cited in the Binance Research March 2025 report was last-minute allocation reduction, of which the Redstone airdrop is an ideal example. Before the official distribution, the team lowered the initial community allocation from 9.5% to 5%. Consequently, there was a massive backlash from community members, with concerns about the unfair treatment of users. The report cautioned that such abrupt changes signal poor planning, which erodes community trust. As a lesson, Binance recommended locking in token allocations before the Token Generation Event (TGE), avoiding unilateral decisions, and engaging key stakeholders, like investors and community members, to promote transparency in communication. Opaque eligibility According to Binance, opaque eligibility criteria, which can lead to allegations of favoritism and unmet expectations, have also been a central area of focus when examining airdrop challenges. For this pitfall, Binance pointed to Scroll‚Äôs October 2024 airdrop of 70 million SCR tokens (7% of its supply). While the airdrop intended to reward mainnet activity like transaction volume and dApp engagement, the October 19, 2024, snapshot left users puzzled due to undisclosed rules and inconsistent reward distribution. To address this, the report suggested that projects outline participation rules leveraging tools like on-chain monitoring or proof-of-humanity to deter Sybil farming, where individuals create multiple fake accounts to exploit token distributions. Insider and influencer-heavy distributions Another lingering pain point with airdrops is insider- and influencer-heavy distributions, where projects prioritize their teams, investors, and VCs over the community. The most recent project to face such backlash was KAITO‚Äôs February 2025 airdrop. Interestingly, the platform allocated 43.3% to its team and investors, with only 10% to the community, alongside large influencer payouts. In this case, influencers reportedly dumped their tokens, leading to scrutiny over KAITO‚Äôs insider focus. While acknowledging the need to fund development, Binance noted that excessive allocations to insiders can destabilize token prices and alienate supporters. The report called for vesting periods and lock-ups to curb immediate sell-offs, aligning all parties with the project‚Äôs long-term vision. Technical barriers Finally, technical issues remain among the key challenges in airdrops, especially when they affect the claim process. Magic Eden‚Äôs December 2024 airdrop witnessed such problems. The airdrop was meant to promote Magic Eden‚Äôs mobile wallet adoption, but instead, it left users frustrated with glitches and confusing instructions, leading to widespread frustration. Binance emphasized the need for a smooth, intuitive claim process to avoid such headwinds. The exchange warned that unchecked technical problems could reduce payouts and discourage user engagement. Looking ahead, the report recommended increasing transparency, involving the community more, and improving monitoring to refine airdrop strategies in the future.

In a new strategy session, the trader pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 66,100 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that XRP ( XRP ) has exhibited ‚Äúincredible strength‚Äù over the last couple of weeks relative to other crypto assets. ‚ÄúAnd the reason why is because this is exceptional strength. Compare XRP/Bitcoin to Solana/Bitcoin. Or like XRP to Solana in general. Like that‚Äôs some insane strength against like one of the best altcoins this cycle.‚Äù Going forward, the pseudonymous analyst says XRP is likely to continue on an upward trajectory. ‚ÄúAs long as the market keeps going up, I think this going to continue going up. It‚Äôs going to be basically one of the strongest coins, at least from the big ones. Basically, one big move up into one big consolidation‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶And most of the time in my experience when you get something like this you get another pop. Usually smaller than the first one but still sizable enough. And that‚Äôs kind of what I‚Äôm betting on‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶If Bitcoin holds on I think, and if all coins generally‚Ä¶ like the moment you see a little bit of altcoin strength, I think XRP is going to outperform.‚Äù The trader who entered a long position on XRP at a price of around $0.60 says he will offload his entire position on the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap if XRP appreciates by roughly 4x from the current level. ‚ÄúIf XRP gets anywhere close to $10, I will dump everything and just be happy with what I got.‚Äù XRP is trading at $2.39 at time of writing.

However, this bearish outlook could flip on its head after the approval of SOL futures ETF. But is this enough to prevent the price of Solana from collapsing below $100? Let‚Äôs explore Solana price prediction and key levels to watch ahead as institutions will soon be able to buy and selling SOL via ETFs. Two futures Solana ETF products namely, Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT) will be available to US participants soon, according to reports. Despite this bullish fundamental development, the outlook of Solana price remains bearish, with a potential for further descent. Will the selling pressure crash SOL price below $100? Solana Price Prediction: Is SOL at Risk of Crashing Below $100? From a technical perspective, the daily chart shows Solana price is bouncing off the key support level at $125.31. This key structure served as a stable footing for price from March to September 2024. Hence, a retest of this level is likely to absorb any short-term selling pressure, increasing the odds of a bounce. So expecting a further descent in Solana price is unlikely as long as the $125.31 support level holds. However, a decisive daily candlestick close below it, would signal a breakdown of this critical foothold. Such a development suggests that the buyers failed to establish control and the outlook is now bearish. In this condition, SOL‚Äôs value could easily visit the next critical support level at $100. SOL/USDT 1-day chart Considering the current market conditions, where Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) directional bias is slightly bullish , the chances of SOL price breaching below $100 are equally high. However, help from BTC bears could easily crash Solana below the aforementioned key support level. Key Resistance Levels To Watch If Solana price fails to break $125.31, then the outlook remains bullish. In such a case, a flip of the $136 hurdle into a support floor could send SOL price to $152.70 after a 12% rally. If the bullish momentum sustains, Solana bulls may extend the uptrend to $179 and $186 resistance levels. This move would constitute a 35% gain from $136.71 SOL/USDT 4-hour chart Solana price is currently at risk of crashing below $100 due to the overall bearish market conditions, but the launch of SOL ETF futures could potentially increase demand and impact the price.

In the newly released seventh edition of its Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7), the agency introduces comprehensive guidelines for the first time, integrating digital assets into global statistical frameworks. The IMF classified digital assets on whether or not they had liabilities in its Balance of Payments manual The recently published Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7) categorizes Bitcoin (BTC) and similar cryptocurrencies as non-produced nonfinancial assets. According to the manual, some tokens will be treated similarly to equity holdings. Digital assets were generally split into fungible and non-fungible tokens, with other distinctions based on whether or not these tokens had liabilities. According to BPM7, Bitcoin and similar assets designed to be mediums of exchange without liabilities will be regarded as capital assets. In contrast, stablecoins backed by liabilities will be classified as financial instruments. Ideally, this means transactions involving Bitcoin and similar tokens will be recorded separately in capital accounts as purchases or sales of non-produced assets. The IMF stated, ‚ÄúCrypto assets without a counterpart liability designed to act as a medium of exchange (e.g., Bitcoin) are treated as non-produced nonfinancial assets and recorded separately in the capital account.‚Äù Nevertheless, any newly circulated crypto additions will not be recorded as changes in the assets‚Äô volume if the tokens are already brought into circulation in exchange for production activities like proof of work or proof of stake. Meanwhile, assets with a platform or protocol like Ethereum and Solana will be treated like equity-like holdings, particularly if the token holders live in a different country from the token‚Äôs platform. The IMF says staking rewards will resemble equity dividends Apart from corresponding liability, the IMF further recognized the complexity of staking and yield-bearing crypto activities, depending on the size and purpose of the holding. It pointed out that staking rewards from holding these tokens may resemble equity dividends and should be recorded under current account income. Moreover, the global agency said that transactions such as mining and staking verifying cryptocurrency transfers should be considered service production. The IMF‚Äôs Balance of Payments Manual remains a key reference for countries worldwide and is expected to guide statistical reporting in the years ahead. Originally developed after over 160 nations agreed to have it, the manual continues to shape global economic standards. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a tweet , Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) quipped about the rising number of stablecoin projects, humorously noting that the launch of stablecoins is happening more frequently than that of altcoins. This comment came as recent data showed that the stablecoin market cap has hit a record $230 billion. ‚ÄúI see more stablecoin startups than altcoins,‚Äù CZ tweeted with a touch of humor in response to the data.

According to Fortune Crypto, half of the capital‚Äî$500 million‚Äîwill be allocated to early-stage crypto projects, while the remaining $500 million will target late-stage crypto investments. The fundraising effort comes amid changing market conditions compared to 2022, when Haun‚Äôs firm raised $1.5 billion during its debut funding round. Despite lowering its target this time, the VC firm reportedly anticipates that the funds will be ‚Äúoversubscribed‚Äù, signaling strong investor interest in the crypto sector. Funding Round Set to Close in June The latest Haun Ventures fundraising round is expected to close by June 2025 and could become one of the largest crypto-focused VC rounds in the past two years. The firm‚Äôs initial round in March 2022 was a standout, marking one of the largest crypto venture raises at the time. Haun Ventures is following in the footsteps of major players like Paradigm and Pantera Capital, both of which sought to raise substantial funds in 2024. In June 2024, Paradigm closed a $850 million fund , while Pantera Capital aimed to raise over $1 billion for a new blockchain-focused investment vehicle. Haun‚Äôs latest round could further cement its influence in the crypto VC landscape, which has seen renewed activity despite the industry‚Äôs volatility. Stablecoins and Crypto VC Investment Trends for 2025 While the specific focus of Haun‚Äôs upcoming funds has not been disclosed, industry analysts predict that stablecoins will remain a major area of interest in 2025. Recently, Haun Ventures participated in Bitwise‚Äôs $70 million funding round , joining heavyweights like Electric Capital, MassMutual, and MIT Investment Management Company. Meanwhile, HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao told Cointelegraph that stablecoins were the most reliable crypto use case in 2024, suggesting the sector will continue to attract substantial VC funding next year. However, analysts caution that while VC investment in 2025 is expected to surpass 2024 levels, it will likely fall short of the $33.8 billion raised during the 2021 bull market, which far exceeded the $13.6 billion recorded in 2024.

Since then, $BTC has declined considerably, which has had investors worried. One good piece of news, however, is that the asset hasn‚Äôt closed below the $70K mark and is currently in a strong consolidation phase. Read on as we hunt for clues on Bitcoin‚Äôs upcoming movement and discuss the top crypto to buy. Bitcoin‚Äôs 2025 and 2017 Likeness At the start of the year, there were a lot of talks about how the current $BTC cycle is mimicking the 2015-2017 Bitcoin bullish cycle. However, the current divergence has derailed that correlation a bit. If the cycles were meant to be identical, Bitcoin should have rallied in the past month, possibly making new highs. The question, therefore, is whether the 2017 cycle theory still holds. Well, even after the recent downward movement, the correlation between the two cycles is still 91%, which is just 1% less than what it was earlier. 91% is still a very high degree of correlation, which means we may see fresh highs in the next few months. After a sluggish few weeks, Bitcoin has started marching towards the $90K mark again, which is a positive sign. Divergence May Be Caused by Data Lag A reason for this price divergence may be the lag in data reflection in Bitcoin prices. Historically, $BTC shows a strong correlation with global liquidity, but with a lag of two months. To study this, analysts shifted the 2017 $BTC prices back by 30 days. The prices then showed a correlation of 93%, suggesting that Bitcoin may soon be back on track. Even the MVRV data suggest the same. It says there‚Äôs a correlation of 80% with the 2017 cycle. MVRV, by the way, studies current $BTC prices in relation to the average cost of acquisition for all market participants. Higher MVRV means investors are sitting on high unrealized gains, suggesting a market top. The current MVRV score is just 1.83, which is significantly lower than what it was on January 21 (around 3.1). This means that investors are using this downtrend as an opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin. With the 2017 cycle theory still intact, coupled with a strong pro-crypto boost by the government, $BTC is warming up for the next bull run. If you want to cash in, this is the best time to add some promising cryptos, like the following, to your portfolio. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Top Crypto to Buy to Benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs Success Bitcoin is undoubtedly the leader of the crypto market, so it makes sense to position yourself behind its upcoming rally. However, churning out a sizable profit from $BTC would require a huge investment. Enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It‚Äôs a potentially game-changing new meme coin offering Bitcoin maximalists a cost-effective and more profitable way to invest in Bitcoin. As a $BTCBULL token holder, you‚Äôll receive free $BTC every time Bitcoin crosses a new milestone for the first time. These milestones would be $150K, $200K, $250K, and so on. The most important thing to note here is that you must store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . Furthermore, the project‚Äôs developers have future-proofed the token‚Äôs demand by putting in place a token burn mechanism. Simply put, a part of the total $BTCBULL token supply will be burnt every time Bitcoin rises by $25K. The BTC Bull Token presale has raised close to $4M in less than a month. You can become a part of one of the best crypto presales in 2025 for¬†just¬†$0.00242. For more info, here‚Äôs a guide on how to¬†buy¬†$BTCBULL . 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) ‚Äì Revolutionary Crypto Project Redefining Meme Coin Investing If you don‚Äôt want to miss crypto‚Äôs gravy train but are unsure about where to get started, Meme Index ($MEMEX) might just be the best crypto to invest in for you. For the first time ever, we‚Äôll have baskets of meme coins (similar to conventional stock market indexes and mutual funds) as options for investing thanks to $MEMEX. Each of the four meme coin baskets carries a different amount of volatility, risk, and upside potential. Essentially, you won‚Äôt have to follow a high-risk approach, which has been typically associated with crypto. You can choose the ideal investment for you, depending on your risk appetite. For instance, the Meme Titan Index houses only the top meme coins , meaning it‚Äôs safer than, say, the Meme Frenzy Index, which contains explode-worthy tokens ‚Äì could be very rewarding, but it‚Äôs also quite risky. Early $MEMEX investors can also benefit from the project‚Äôs 553% staking rewards. It currently has over $4.1M in its presale kitty, and you can hop in now for just $0.0166883 per token. 3. SPX6900 ($SPX) ‚Äì Exciting Meme Coin Based on the S&P 500 Index SPX6900 ($SPX) is what you get when you add a meme coin flavor to the traditional S&P 500 stock market index. It‚Äôs an Ethereum-based altcoin that relies largely on its community members and social media hype. However, the fact that this token has over $460M in market cap and has generated mind-boggling returns in the last year is proof of its awe-inspiring potential. Speaking of its price, $SPX is back among the top gainers. It has gained nearly 30% in the last seven days and is showing some serious willingness to trend higher. The $0.75-$0.90 is an important area of resistance, though. If the current buying momentum is strong enough to break it, we could see the token surge past $1. It‚Äôs currently trading at $0.4961 . Final Verdict With a Bitcoin-powered crypto rally just around the corner, the time is indeed ripe to buy trending cryptos like the ones mentioned above. However, you must not lose sight of the fact that the crypto market is, by and large, unpredictable. It‚Äôs also highly volatile, which calls for extra caution. We recommend investing a small sum of money, and that, too, only after you‚Äôve done your own research and due diligence.

A $10,000 contribution made over the course of the 12-months ending Apr. 24, 2007, thusly turned into a $1 million nest egg for the investor by 2025. But Bitcoin accomplished this incredible feat of 100x ROI in just eight years. Bitcoin‚Äôs price rose from $1,000 on Feb. 1, 2017 to $100,000 on Feb 1, 2025. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) pulled off this unbelievable hat trick in only four-and-a-half years. ETH traded on for an average daily price of $48 on Apr. 15, 2017.¬†But by Nov. 8, 2021, investors could sell ETH out of their bag for $4,800 per token. With returns on investment this fast, many investors have made a million dollars or more in ROI by regularly backing cryptocurrencies with their extra savings.¬†Just how many Bitcoin millionaires are there in the world today? How Many Bitcoin Millionaires? In Aug. last year, the 2024 Crypto Wealth Report by London-based investment consultancy Henley & Partners estimated there were 172,300 individuals globally who owned $1M or more worth of crypto. The report counted 85,400 of those to be Bitcoin millionaires, with most or all of their holdings in BTC on Web3‚Äôs most secure layer settlement blockchain. According to Henley, these figures represented a 95% and 111% increase, respectively, in the number of crypto and Bitcoin millionaires over 2023 levels. So, cryptocurrencies on the blockchain are minting more millionaires faster than ever before. That disproves the narrative that the Web3 layer of the Internet is a passing fad or that it‚Äôs too late for newcomers to earn monster ROIs from buying crypto. Bitcoin Millionaire Examples Many crypto investors like their privacy and anonymity, but some Bitcoin millionaires are public figures. Take Erik Finman, for example, who made a million in ROI from Bitcoin as a teenager after investing $1,000 of his savings in BTC in 2011 when he was only 12 years old and living with his parents in Idaho. By the age of 25: ‚Äì I dropped out of school and moved to SF ‚Äì I sold my first startup ‚Äì I made my first million in Bitcoin ‚Äì I created a working Dr. Octopus suit ‚Äì We launched a satellite ‚Äì We launched a multi-million dollar crypto startup Gen-Z gets it done. ‚Äî ERIK FINMAN (@erikfinman) July 28, 2024 Then there‚Äôs Heather Delaney, a business professional from the UK who spent years steadily buying BTC to save her money. Delany‚Äôs stash was worth over a million dollars in 2021. Tommy and James, two unemployed brothers from Westchester, New York, aged 38 and 42, became multi-millionaires in Shiba Inu (SHIB) coins in 2021 from a total investment of $8,000.¬†They pulled off this remarkable caper over a few months during the coronavirus pandemic. (On that note, one fundamental evaluation metric for Shiba Inu this week indicates SHIB prices may skyrocket again soon on cryptocurrency exchanges.) Here are five guidelines for beginning crypto investors for saving up a million-dollar crypto portfolio. 1. Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-Year Price Cycle Legendary American baseball coach and humorist Yogi Berra once said: ‚ÄúA nickel ain‚Äôt worth a dime anymore.‚Äù The greatest factor driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price on crypto exchange markets is the crypto‚Äôs 4-year supply cycle.¬†Since it first launched on Jan 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network has cut by half the daily new supplies of BTC created by the block reward. After the fourth and most recent Bitcoin halving on Apr. 20, 2024, the block reward created approximately every ten minutes is 3.25 BTC. That targets roughly 450 new BTC a day. When Bitcoin‚Äôs new supply contracts, it‚Äôs similar to when the Federal Reserve lowers the supply of new dollars by raising rates, and as a result, the greenback gains purchasing power for goods. When the Bitcoin network cuts supplies, BTC gains purchasing power for goods, other cryptocurrencies, and dollars. This is reflected by Bitcoin‚Äôs price going up (should demand remains the same or increases.) As a result, a modest dollar cost average of dollars to BTC has historically produced a two-comma ROI. Over the last two recent cycles, Bitcoin turned a $192 weekly contribution for just one year into $1,000,000 in under eight years. The average monthly car payment for a new vehicle in 2025 is $724 . So, driving a paid-off beater car instead of financing a new vehicle and putting all the savings in a cryptocurrency that delivers similar results could make any investor a millionaire. 2. Daily, Weekly, Monthly Volatility Dollar-cost averaging Bitcoin and several of the most successful altcoins over the past decade have consistently taken a year‚Äôs worth of new car payments and turned them into a million dollars in just a few years. But, swing trading can deliver that result faster for successful traders. Because of crypto markets‚Äô price volatility, day trading can work even faster than swing trading. Day traders make trades every day and usually more than once a day. But swing traders may trade once a week, once a month, or a handful of times a year. This is a more advanced approach to investing in cryptocurrencies that carries greater risks. It can speed up an investor‚Äôs accumulation with quick gains, but it can also slow it down with quick losses. The key to making Bitcoin millions by swing trading or day trading is the old Wall Street adage: Buy low. Sell high. Or as the famous Pennsylvanian author of the Poor Richard‚Äôs Almanack, Benjamin Franklin once wrote: ‚ÄúEarly to bed and early to rise keeps one healthy, wealthy, and wise.‚Äù In other words, repeatable success in cyclical markets comes from selling early before most of the market and taking profits after buying early before most of the market does, and prices begin to rise. The most famous example of swing trading BTC to roll with the Bitcoin markets‚Äô multi-year high and low tides is probably PayPal founder Peter Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund. The fund made $1.8 billion in profit by selling all of its BTC holdings in Mar. 2022, mere days before the market crashed in a nine-month bear market.¬†After that, Founders Fund began piling up Bitcoin and Ether again as prices began to rise. Every four-year cycle so far, Bitcoin spends about 2.5 years rallying furiously upward and 1.5 years crashing suddenly or trading sideways. Investors who follow crypto news at least once a week can recognize these cycles and prioritize buying at a bargain price during the down markets and selling for a very nice profit during the buying seasons. 3. Altcoins and Fundamental Analysis Bitcoin‚Äôs rise inspired Internet developers to create other alternative currencies using the cryptographic blockchain design. The industry and markets often refer to these as altcoins. There are dozens and dozens of altcoins that have delivered the kind of ROI that has made it possible for many cryptocurrency investors to become Bitcoin millionaires with principal sums the average full-time US laborer can afford in a year of frugality and thrift. But it‚Äôs important to avoid the scams, grift, and hype. Even a Bitcoin millionaire can become a BTC pauper overnight without the proper attention and care to research and understand what they are doing. Crypto markets are full of new blockchain projects that more or less say we‚Äôre like all the other success stories, but without giving specifics that investors can understand, that explain what their unique value proposition is. A great, really hardcore fundamental analysis is one that studies the problem/solution, feature/benefit, and competitive advantage of an altcoin to determine which currencies may be undervalued by the market. 4. IRS Taxes and Crypto Roth IRAs 19th-century poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once joked, ‚ÄúMoney often costs too much.‚Äù¬†There‚Äôs interest on borrowed money, and there are taxes on earned money. But, the taxes on realized capital gains from the profitable sale of cryptocurrencies don‚Äôt have to cost too much. In fact, investing in crypto can be a way to save money on your taxes. Anyone paying taxes in the United States can create a self-directed IRA and use it to buy and hold cryptocurrencies like BTC and XRP. The yearly limit on it is $7,000 . Taxpayers can deduct any amount saved through their IRA from their before-tax income. Depending on a crypto investor‚Äôs finances, this could bump them down a tax bracket for the year and significantly lower their tax obligation. 5. Hacks, Scams, and Crashes One easy way to avoid scams is holding and trading cryptocurrency with a reputable and regulated cryptocurrency exchange or brokerage and custodian. That is as opposed to reading a web page online of a project you‚Äôve never heard of and then connecting your Web3 wallet and getting out your credit card. Crypto investors with large holdings who pull some of their portfolio off exchanges and third-party custody to secure themselves use best practices to protect their crypto wallets. 6. Be a Crypto Billionaire This one is a pro-tip. The easiest way to become a crypto millionaire is if you are a billionaire. Questionable investments in potential rug-pulls will quickly evaporate a few zeros from your net worth and bring you down a notch. Ok, this one is for fun. You probably wouldn‚Äôt be reading this article if you were a billionaire and you were just randomly scanning the Internet to look for ideas on how to become a millionaire. But, if you are ‚Äì make sure you invest in the latest meme coin with massive marketing and unknown creators ‚Äì those turn out great.

In addition, XRP lawyers like Bill Morgan have also weighed in on the matter, reflecting on the possible implications of the XRP case‚Äôs end. Let‚Äôs examine what experts are saying about the SEC‚Äôs decision and how the settlement could impact the crypto industry. Why Did the SEC Drop the XRP Case? Key Insights In the latest XRP case update, the US SEC has reportedly decided to drop its appeal in the lawsuit. Despite this significant development, Ripple has opted to keep its cross-appeal active. This has prompted lawyer Fred Rispoli to weigh in on the possible factors driving the SEC‚Äôs move. Primarily, the attorney linked the SEC‚Äôs decision with its recent moves in multiple crypto lawsuits. In a couple of developments, the US SEC dismissed many crypto lawsuits involving Kraken, Coinbase, Robinhood, and more. Reflecting on these developments, Rispoli stated that the SEC‚Äôs latest move likely signals the regulator‚Äôs ways of negotiating a settlement. Will Ripple Drop Its Cross-Appeal? Though Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has unveiled the SEC‚Äôs potential dismissal of the XRP case, the agency hasn‚Äôt released an official announcement on it. Ripple also remains silent on the matter and hasn‚Äôt yet dropped its cross-appeal. However, Rispoli stated that SEC‚Äôs settlement negotiations could ultimately lead to Ripple dropping its cross-appeal. Reportedly, the SEC may ask Ripple to drop the cross-appeal for a reduced fine. In addition, this agreement could also involve lifting the permanent injunction imposed by Judge Analisa Torres. Moreover, the potential agreement between the SEC and Ripple could pave the way for Ripple to announce a highly anticipated IPO. While the prolonged lawsuit hindered Ripple‚Äôs IPO chances, the agreement could accelerate Ripple‚Äôs plans for an initial public offering (IPO).

However, a new contender is quickly gaining traction‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM). Designed as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a game-changer with its structured financial model, overcollateralized stablecoin, and buy-and-distribute mechanism that supports long-term token value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One of the standout features of Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which offers users access to liquidity without relying on traditional financial intermediaries. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this asset is minted directly through the platform when borrowers provide collateral above a required ratio. This ensures that every stablecoin in circulation is fully backed by on-chain assets, maintaining a predictable and sustainable peg to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the stablecoin model benefits the overall Mutuum ecosystem. Borrowers can access liquidity without selling their assets, and lenders receive interest on their deposited funds. Interest generated from stablecoin loans remains within the platform, reinforcing protocol reserves and enhancing long-term stability. Mutuum Finance enables both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models, offering users flexibility in accessing liquidity or generating passive income. In the P2C model, lenders supply assets into liquidity pools and earn a dynamic annual percentage yield (APY). Borrowers can access these funds by locking collateral, ensuring overcollateralization to maintain platform stability and minimize defaults. The P2P lending model allows borrowers and lenders to negotiate loan terms directly, making it an attractive option for those looking for customized agreements. This is particularly useful for more volatile assets, which may not fit into traditional DeFi lending pools. By offering both models, Mutuum Finance creates an inclusive and scalable lending protocol that caters to a wide range of users. Mutuum Finance incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism that actively supports long-term token appreciation. A portion of the platform‚Äôs revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens from the market, which are then distributed to mtToken holders. This process not only creates consistent buy pressure but also incentivizes long-term participation in the ecosystem. Additionally, mtTokens play a crucial role in the platform‚Äôs functionality. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens, which represent their stake in the liquidity pool. These tokens automatically accumulate interest over time and increase in redemption value, allowing users to earn passive income without actively managing their funds. Mutuum Finance is currently in its presale phase, offering early investors an opportunity to enter before the price surges. The project is now in Phase 3, with MUTM priced at $0.02. The presale consists of 11 phases in total, and the price is set to increase to $0.025 in Phase 4. With over $4.45 million raised so far and more than 6,250 holders onboard, demand for MUTM continues to rise as investors secure their positions ahead of the next phase. The rapid fundraising and structured presale model indicate growing confidence in Mutuum Finance‚Äôs potential. As the platform progresses toward its token launch, investors are anticipating significant value appreciation, especially given the project‚Äôs upcoming exchange listings and beta platform release. Mutuum Finance sets itself apart from traditional DeFi lending protocols by combining stablecoin functionality, flexible lending models, and a sustainable token economy. With a growing community, a presale that continues to gain traction, and a unique buy-and-distribute mechanism reinforcing its market strength, MUTM is shaping up to be a strong competitor in the DeFi space. As the project prepares for its next phase, those looking for an early opportunity in a fast-growing DeFi ecosystem may find that Mutuum Finance offers one of the most compelling investment prospects of 2024. With momentum building, now may be the best time to consider joining before the next price increase and broader market adoption.

Other Pi Network rivals such as Kaito, AI16Z, Fartcoin, and SPX are starting to attract more attention despite facing challenges in the market. The cryptocurrency market presents an opportunity for investors to grow their $1,000 investments worth $100,000 during April while the market achieves stability. Pi Network Rivals: Kaito (KAITO) KAITO (KAITO) has recently gained significant market interest because its price increased by 15% during the last month. InfoFi token has shown significant activity through its AI design and now stands among the Pi Network competitors. The crypto asset KAITO entered the market not long ago and maintains a price point of $1.32 while demonstrating rising popularity in the current altcoin sector. Other crypto markets are trading in in sideways trend, with the BTC price hovering around $84k. The chart of KAITO showed a falling wedge pattern which a crypto analyst has highlighted. A confirmed $1.50 breakout could initiate a price movement to reach KAITO‚Äôs previous all-time high according to the market analyst. In the past KAITO witnessed its highest price at $2.88 before starting its downward trend. ai16Z AI16Z has demonstrated a 17% price increase within the previous 24 hours which positioned it near $0.2020 during trading sessions. The descending triangle pattern shows a token‚Äôs potential bullish trend that emerged as it exceeded its weeks-long range restriction. The chart pattern suggests robust upward potential when volume increases to validate the price movement. The market analysts observe the $0.24 resistance level with growing interest because it could lead to upward movement beyond $0.30 in the market price. AI16Z stands as one of the top four competitors of Pi Network price , attracting investor interest during April 2023. Source: Tradingview Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin experienced an impressive market boom by achieving a 37% rise in value within one day where its price moved from $0.35 to $0.48. The market value of Fartcoin experienced a sudden increase of 37% over that period. Fartcoin price rose by 40% within the last week which established it as one of the growing competitors against Pi Network. Within 24 hours the derivative market volume for Fartcoin reached $1.48 billion after recording a 35.15% increase. During the same time frame open interest numbers increased at a significant rate of 60.41% to reach $194.98 million. Source- Coinglass SPX6900 (SPX) In the last 24 hours, the SPX6900 token experienced a 16% price rise as the market started to recover from its losses. The token now trades at $0.4966. SPX6900 provides advanced blockchain cryptography features that enable wide-ranging applications such as scientific research. The recent market momentum of SPX has placed it among the Pi Network rival which allegedly can transform $1K into $100K by April. Final Thoughts In conclusion, The Pi Network rivals stand alongside Kaito, AI16Z, and Fartcoin along with SPX as promising cryptocurrency opportunities for amplifying $1K to $100K. According to market trends, the crypto market demonstrates recovery potential and these selected projects might emerge as leading forces. Monitor the growth of these projects because they may deliver profitable outcomes.

Despite constant outflows in ETF ETFs over the past few days, this upswing has emerged, sparking market optimism over future price movements. For context, Ether ETFs have recorded constant outflows on a daily basis, sparking market concerns globally. Although these outflows remained below the $20M mark each day, market watchers speculate over future aspects amid evolving market dynamics. Ethereum Price Jumps Despite ETH ETF Outflows ETH coin‚Äôs price witnessed a nearly 2% uptick in the past 24 hours and closed in at $1,995 as of press time. The crypto recovered from an intraday low of $1,937 and even hit a high of $2,005 briefly this Saturday. This price upswing primarily caused a market stir, defying usual investor sentiments in light of constant outflows in ETF products. Sosovalue data indicated that Ethereum recorded $102.89 million in weekly outflows from March 14 to 21, a concerning factor for investors. Of these outflows, $11.72 million, $12.41 million, and $18.63 million occurred on March 19, 20, and 21, respectively. Traders and investors speculate whether these outflows could top the $20 million mark ahead, which could bring potential heat to the price. Ethereum price is up nearly 5% since it last recorded over $20 million in outflows in ETFs, which was on March 18. The asset‚Äôs price rose from the $1800 level to $1,985 since then to date. The rising action has ignited speculations of cooling ETF outflows ahead, further supported by other dynamics. Is ETH Supply Shock Incoming? Simultaneously, recent on-chain data has cemented a considerable bullish sentiment for the coin. Renowned market trader and analyst ‚ÄòMerlijn The Trader‚Äô revealed that whales scooped up $236 million worth of ETH over the past 72 hours. The massive buying pressure paves an optimistic path for future price action, underlining the potential for an ETH bounce back to previous highs. Simultaneously, market analyst Crypto Rover took to X, revealing that Ethereum reserves on exchanges hit an ATL. For context, drying up exchange reserves signals heightened withdrawing for a crypto and rising market interest. The data also indicates that a potential supply shock looms, which could further offer support to the price. Source: Crypto Rover, X Despite constant ETF outflows, the abovementioned stats indicated that price gains await. Given this feat takes place, rising interest could also propel inflows in ETFs ahead. Top Analyst Says 100% Pump For Ethereum Price Ahead Also, market expert ‚ÄòPatron‚Äô posted on X, revealing that ETH price claimed a vital support level near $1,978. A sustained break above this level, further escorted by the abovementioned bullish factors, could result in a potential 100% rally ahead. As per the analyst, the upcoming targets remain $2,296, $2,913, and $4,000, which is up nearly 100% from the current level. Source: Patron, X However, it‚Äôs also worth taking into account that ETH‚Äôs fear and greed index stood at 37. This stat conversely signals that investors are cautious despite bullish dynamics, primarily due to macro trends and institutional interest decline. According to Ethereum price prediction , ETH could reach $2,100.57 by 2025.

At a post-raising price of $0.02 in Phase 3, already over 60% of Phase 3 tokens have been sold out, as everyone weighs up who‚ÄÇwill be there in Phase 4, where prices will update up to $0,025 (an increase of 25%.) Early buyers who lock in now could see a 200% return when MUTM starts trading at $0.06, with analysts specifying a post-launch rally to $3‚ÄÇ‚Äî a 14,900% jump from today‚Äôs price. On the other hand, upward moves for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) will be hard due to market conditions ‚Äî‚ÄÇDOGE‚Äôs inability to break free of meme coin volatility and ADA‚Äôs long-term $7 prediction dependent on new market conditions that are not guaranteed. For investors‚ÄÇsearching for quick growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the clear leader. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): presale and‚ÄÇtokenomics hype Mutuum Finance Phase‚ÄÇ3 presale is moving fast towards sellout due to its real-world utility in decentralized lending. The project‚Äôs buy-and-distribute model helps to redirect‚ÄÇplatform revenue back into the system for repurchase the much desired for MUTM tokens, which creates further sustained demand whilst supplying rewards for stakers. In particular, with a price of $0.02 now, investors coming in now can enjoy immediate profit if the next stage sees a 25% price increase and bring their holdings up to $1,250‚ÄÇper $1000 invested. Post-listing projections are significantly higher:‚ÄÇa $1,000 stake today would grow to $50,000 at $3 paid out per token, which analysts are calling entirely realistic based on tokenomics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) links value to concrete DeFi mining mechanisms‚ÄÇlike overcollateralised loans and mtTokens generating yield, unlike speculative assets. Security has been a key focus for Dave, and a Certik audit is in progress to professionally verify‚ÄÇthe integrity of the smart contract. The results will be released through the usual channels shortly,‚ÄÇbut might boost investor confidence further. Dogecoin : meme hype meets market realities Dogecoin recaptured the $0.17 benchmark after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged. Although DOGE price predictions include a $0.60 long-term climb, the token‚Äôs course is unlikely. Technical data such as the MACD is providing confidence in DOGE gaining momentum. The token, however, faces a high obstacle at $0.18. Even if it triples to $0.60, it pays only $3,529 for a $1,000 investment, far below the 5,600% return that Mutuum Finance offers. Since DOGE‚Äôs development is based on social network fads and provides no real-world value, its future development is in question, and holders are at risk of losing cash due to arbitrary reactions. Cardano (ADA): slow burn vs. rapid gains. Cardano remains below $0.72, down 45% from December. Although some forecasts predict a 264% jump to $2 or even $7.8, it will take several years due to the project‚Äôs peer-reviewed changes. When seeking rapid profit, ADA is a significant drawback because of its stability-driven approach. The weekly chart indicates consolidation, but breaking $0.80 will require continuous buying pressure. By the way, this investment increases to $10,833 when a $1,000 investment is converted into $7.8. Timing the Market: why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holds the edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has begun to finalize its‚ÄÇCertik audit, an event due to enhance trust prior to exchange listings. As DeFi transitions‚ÄÇfrom speculation to reality, projects balancing utility and tokenomics are poised for success. For investors targeting $50,000 from $1,000, hesitation now may result in the most epic presale of the‚ÄÇdecade.

Tether is in discussions with a Big Four accounting firm to conduct a full financial audit. Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department has officially removed crypto mixer Tornado Cash from its sanctions list. Crypto markets will be pressured by trade wars until April: analyst Despite a multitude of positive crypto-specific developments, global tariff fears will continue pressuring the markets until at least April 2, according to Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen. Risk assets may lack direction until the tariff-related concerns are resolved, which may happen between April 2 and July, presenting a positive market catalyst, added the analyst. BTC/USD, 1-day chart.

Tether seeks Big Four firm for its first full financial audit: Report Stablecoin issuer Tether is reportedly engaging with a Big Four accounting firm to audit its assets reserve and verify that its USDT ( USDT ) stablecoin is backed at a 1:1 ratio. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino reportedly said the audit process would be more straightforward under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump. It comes after rising industry concerns over a potential FTX-style liquidity crisis for Tether due to its lack of third-party audits. ‚ÄúIf the President of the United States says this is top priority for the US, Big Four auditing firms will have to listen, so we are very happy with that,‚Äù Ardoino told Reuters on March 21. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our top priority,‚Äù Ardoino said. It was reported that Tether is currently subject to quarterly reports but not a full independent annual audit, which is much more extensive and provides more assurance to investors and regulators. However, Ardoino did not specify which of the Big Four accounting firms ‚Äî PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst & Young (EY), Deloitte, or KPMG ‚Äî he plans to engage. Tornado mixer dropped from US blacklist The US Treasury Department has dropped cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, the agency said on March 21. The removal follows a January ruling by a US appeals court , which said the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) cannot sanction Tornado‚Äôs smart contracts because they are not the property of any foreign national. According to the January court ruling, ‚ÄúTornado Cash‚Äôs immutable smart contracts (the lines of privacy-enabling software code) are not the ‚Äòproperty‚Äô of a foreign national or entity, meaning OFAC overstepped its congressionally defined authority.‚Äù In a March 21 statement , the Treasury said OFAC removed several dozen Tornado-affiliated smart contract addresses on the Ethereum blockchain network from its sanctions list. Tornado‚Äôs native token, Tornado Cash (TORN), was up around 60% on the news, according to data from CoinMarketCap. As of March 21, TORN has a market capitalization of around $73 million and a fully diluted value (FDV) of nearly $140 million, the data shows. TORN is up around 60% on the news.

According to reports, the Pima County Sheriff‚Äôs Department mentioned that con artists have been targeting the residents with a series of cryptocurrency scams. The Sheriff‚Äôs Department mentioned that most of these scammers are from other countries, noting that they target the elderly while using Bitcoin ATMs to carry out their criminal activities. According to the Pima County Sheriff‚Äôs Department (PCSD) Financial Crimes Detective Michael Wilson, the scams have grown from being frequent to being carried out daily. Wilson mentioned that the rate has ticked up a little, with these international scammers impersonating several government officials. He added that most of them call the elderly in the country, pretending to be officers from PCSD to carry out these bad acts. Bitcoin ATM scams on the rise in Pima County According to Wilson, the scammers usually employ different tactics to convince the elderly ones, noting failure to show up for jury duty as an example. ‚ÄúThey will say ‚ÄòHey you unfortunately didn‚Äôt show up for jury duty and as a result, you have a warrant for your arrest. The best way to prevent you from going to jail is to just pay the bond in advance,‚Äô‚Äù Wilson said. He added that the scammers will take their time to convince their victims about their disregard for the law, while mentioning that they also offer and convince them to pay using digital assets. ‚ÄúThey will give some reasoning for why they need you to pay this in cryptocurrency,‚Äù he added. Wilson mentioned that after the scammers are done convincing them to pay in digital assets, they will then ask the victim to make a big cash withdrawal and deposit the funds into a Bitcoin ATM, which are often in convenience stores across the county. These machines then convert the cash into digital assets and are moved across different accounts before they disappear. ‚ÄúOnce it‚Äôs in there the money moves from account, to account, to account, in extremely rapid speed, and as a result it becomes very difficult to locate after that,‚Äù Wilson said. He added that most of their targets have been the elderly because they have a steady income, are worried about breaking the law, and are a little bit more trusting compared to younger people. PCSD warns residents about rampant Bitcoin ATM scams According to the PCSD, victims have lost a lot of money as a result of these criminals ‚Äò activities, with some losing thousands of dollars in a single visit to the convenience store. Wilson also added that it can be quite hard to recover the funds, noting that the scammers are in other countries and their victims are depositing the funds directly into their accounts. He added that they always try to recover some of these funds immediately the victims report, but most of it reaches overseas, and it is not always possible. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a lot of success, we continue to make progress in these types of scams, but as the technology grows it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, the PCSD has started putting warning signs on some of these Bitcoin ATMs to warn potential victims of the scam before they lose funds. ‚ÄúHaving these alerts right in a place they can see right where they‚Äôre making those deposits can sometimes be the difference between them losing money and them safeguarding themselves and just hanging up the call,‚Äù Wilson said. He added that since these criminals are evolving their tactics, anyone who gets a suspicious call or text should call 911 or try to contact the fraud unit of the PCSD.

This announcement comes just days after Pump.fun, which recently launched its own DEX, PumpSwap, is facing a revenue dip and increased competition in the Solana ecosystem. Pump.fun has been having mixed success lately. While it attracted millions of users and generated over $600 million in revenue, most of the 8.7 million tokens created have lost value. Only four have maintained a market capitalization above $100 million. In response to a nearly 60% drop in monthly revenue, is why Pump.fun had launched PumpSwap. In just 3 months; A total of 8.7 million ‚Äúmemecoins‚Äù were launched on @pumpdotfun , generating a total revenue of $600M Out of those 8.7M coins, only 4 managed to sustain a market cap level of $100M pic.tw‚Ä¶ The post Solana Showdown: Raydium‚Äôs LaunchLab Set to Challenge Pump.fun‚Äôs Reign appeared first on Coin Edition .",Altcoin News|Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|DEX|Raydium (RAY)|Solana (SOL),EN,0,0,SOL|RAY|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-03-22 13:00:00

In that quaint, bygone era, they would often conduct funding events called ‚Äúinitial coin offerings,‚Äù and then use those raised funds to try to do things in the real and blockchain world. Now, they largely do this ‚Äúoffshore‚Äù through foreign entities while geofencing the United States. The effect of this change has been dramatic: Practically all major cryptocurrency issuers started in the US now include some off-shore foundation arm. These entities create significant domestic challenges. They are expensive, difficult to operate, and leave many crucial questions about governance and regulation only half answered. Many in the industry yearn to ‚Äúre-shore,‚Äù but until this year, there has been no path to do so. Now, though, that could change. New crypto-rulemaking is on the horizon, members of the Trump family have floated the idea of eliminating capital gains tax on cryptocurrency, and many US federal agencies have dropped enforcement actions against crypto firms. For the first time in four years, the government has signaled to the cryptocurrency industry that it is open to deal. There may soon be a path to return to the US. Crypto firms tried to comply in the US The story of US offshoring traces back to 2017. Crypto was still young, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had taken a hands-off approach to the regulation of these new products. That all changed when the commission released a document called ‚ÄúThe DAO Report.‚Äù For the first time, the SEC argued that the homebrew cryptocurrency tokens that had developed since the 2009 Bitcoin white paper were actually regulated instruments called securities. This prohibition was not total ‚Äî around the same time as The DAO Report‚Äôs launch, SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman publicly expressed his views that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) were not securities. To clarify this distinction, the commission released a framework for digital assets in 2019, which identified relevant factors to evaluate a token‚Äôs security status and noted that ‚Äúthe stronger their presence, the less likely the Howey test is met.‚Äù Relying on this guidance, many speculated that functional ‚Äúconsumptive‚Äù uses of tokens would insulate projects from securities concerns. In parallel, complicated tax implications were crystallizing. Tax advisers reached a consensus that, unlike traditional financing instruments like simple agreements for future equity (SAFEs) or preferred equity, token sales were fully taxable events in the US. Simple agreements for future tokens (SAFTs) ‚Äî contracts to issue future tokens ‚Äî faced little better tax treatment, with the taxable event merely deferred until the tokens were released. This meant that a token sale by a US company would generate a massive tax liability. Related: Trade war puts Bitcoin‚Äôs status as safe-haven asset in doubt Projects tried in good faith to adhere to these guidelines. Lawyers extracted principles and advised clients to follow them. Some bit the bullet and paid the tax rather than contriving to create a foreign presence for a US project. How SEC v. LBRY muddied waters All this chugged along for a few years. The SEC brought some major enforcement actions, like its moves against Ripple and Telegram, and shut down other projects, like Diem. But many founders still believed they could operate legally in the US if they stuck to the script. Then, events conspired to knock this uneasy equilibrium out of balance. SEC Chair Gary Gensler entered the scene in 2021, Sam Bankman-Fried blew up FTX in 2022, and an unheralded opinion from Judge Paul Barbadoro came out of the sleepy US District Court for the District of New Hampshire in a case called SEC v. LBRY. The LBRY case is a small one, affecting what is, by all accounts, a minor crypto project, but the application of law that came out of it had a dramatic effect on the practice of cryptocurrency law and, by extension, the avenues open to founders. Judge Barbadoro conceded that the token may have consumptive uses but held that ‚Äúnothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract.‚Äù He went on to say that he could not ‚Äúreject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered [the token] as a security simply because some [token] purchases were made with consumptive intent.‚Äù Because of the ‚Äúeconomic realities,‚Äù Barbadoro held that it did not matter if some ‚Äúmay have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes.‚Äù This was devastating. The holding in LBRY is, essentially, that the factors proposed in the SEC framework largely do not matter in actual securities disputes. In LBRY, Judge Barbadoro found that the consumptive uses may be present, but the purchasers‚Äô expectation of profit predominated. And this, it turned out, meant that virtually any token offering might be considered a security. It meant that any evidence that a token was marketed as offering potential profit could be used against you. Even the supposition that it seemed likely that people bought it to profit could be fatal. Regulation and hope drove firms offshore This had a chilling effect. The LBRY case and related case law destabilized the cryptocurrency project landscape. Instead of a potential framework to work within, there remained just a single vestige of hope to operate legally in the US: Move offshore and decentralize. Even the SEC admitted that Bitcoin and ETH were not securities because they were decentralized. Rather than having any promoter who could be responsible for their sale, they were the products of diffuse networks, attributable to no one. Projects in 2022 and 2023 were left with little option but to attempt to decentralize. Related: Ripple celebrates SEC‚Äôs dropped appeal, but crypto rules still not set Inevitably, the operations would begin in the United States. A few developers would create a project in a small apartment. As they found success, they wanted to fundraise ‚Äî and in crypto, when you fundraise, investors demand tokens. But it‚Äôs illegal to sell tokens in the US. So, their VC or lawyer would advise them to establish a foundation in a more favorable jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands, Zug in Switzerland, or Panama. That foundation could be set up to ‚Äúwrap‚Äù a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which would have governance mechanisms tied to tokens. Through that entity or another offshore entity, they would either sell tokens under a Regulation S exemption from US securities law or simply give them away in an airdrop. In this way, projects hoped they could develop liquid markets and a sizable market cap, eventually achieving the ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù that might allow them to operate legally as an entity in the US again. Several crypto exchanges were incorporated in friendlier jurisdictions in 2023. Source: CoinGecko These offshore structures didn‚Äôt just provide a compliance function ‚Äî they also offered tax advantages. Because foundations have no owners, they aren‚Äôt subject to the ‚Äúcontrolled foreign corporation‚Äù rules, under which foreign corporations get indirectly taxed in the US through their US shareholders. Well-advised foundations also ensured they engaged in no US business activities, preserving their ‚Äúoffshore‚Äù status. Presto: They became amazing tax vehicles, unburdened by direct US taxation because they operate exclusively offshore and are shielded from indirect US taxation because they are ownerless. Even better, this arrangement often gave them a veneer of legitimacy, making it difficult for regulators to pin down a single controlling party. After the formation, the US enterprise would become a rump ‚Äúlabs‚Äù or ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù company that earned income through licensing software and IP to these new offshore entities ‚Äî waiting for the day when everything would be different, checking the mail for Wells notices, and feeling a bit jumpy. So, it wasn‚Äôt just regulation that drove crypto offshore ‚Äî it was hope. A thousand projects wanted to find a way to operate legally in the United States, and offshore decentralization was the only path. A slow turning Now, that may change. With President Donald Trump in office, the hallways of 100 F Street in Washington, DC may just be thawing. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has taken the mantle and is leading the SEC‚Äôs Crypto Task Force. In recent weeks, Peirce has expressed interest in offering prospective and retroactive relief for token issuers and creating a regulatory third way where token launches are treated as ‚Äúnon-securities‚Äù through the SEC's Section 28 exemptive authority. At the same time, evolutions in law are beginning to open the door for onshore operations. David Kerr of Cowrie LLP and Miles Jennings of a16z have pioneered a new corporate form, the decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association (DUNA), that may allow autonomous organizations to function as legal entities in US states like Wyoming. Eric Trump has proposed favorable tax treatments for cryptocurrency tokens, which, though it might be a stretch, could offer a massive draw to bring assets back onshore. And without waiting on any official shifts in regulation, tax attorneys have come up with more efficient fundraising approaches, such as token warrants, to help projects navigate the existing system. As a16z recently put it in a meeting with Commissioner Peirce‚Äôs Crypto Task Force, ‚ÄúIf the SEC were to provide guidance on distributions, it would stem the tide of [tokens] only being issued to non-U.S. persons ‚Äî a trend that is effectively offshoring ownership of blockchain technologies developed in the U.S.‚Äù Maybe this time, they‚Äôll listen.

Over the last six consecutive weeks, Bounce ( AUCTION ) moved to a high of $67.55 ‚Äî its highest level since October 2021. It has jumped by over 712% from its lowest level this year, bringing its market cap to over $380 million. The surge has accelerated as many retail investors embraced the fear of missing out or FOMO. Santiment data shows that the number of active addresses has gone parabolic, reaching a high of 1,505. This is a significant increase since the seven-day addresses stood at less than 400 earlier this month. More on-chain data points that this surge could be part of whale manipulation. The number of whale transactions worth over $100k has jumped to the highest level in months. Similarly, transactions worth over $1 million have soared, too. You might also like: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP prices form risky patterns ahead of triple witching The rising number of whale transactions could be a good signal, especially when they are accumulating. The Santiment number of whale transactions does not provide more information on whether these whales are buying or selling. A look at the Mean Dollar Invested Age or MDIA sends a red alert on the coin. The 365-day MDIA indicator has crashed from 112 earlier this month to 38. Similarly, the 90-day MDIA indicator has moved from 33.4 to just 3. A drop in the MDIA indicator is often a sign that a token will have a big reversal. Bounce Token on-chain data | Source: Santiment The risk of whale manipulation has risen because the ongoing surge has not coincided with any major news from Bounce Finance. The most recent news occurred Friday when the developers launched the Bouncing Art Onchain, a product for tokenizing real-world art. Bounce token price analysis BOUNCE chart | Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the AUCTION token price bottomed at $7.10 earlier this month to $67.54. It crossed the important resistance level at $48.95 ‚Äî its highest level in December last year. It has also moved above the 50-week moving average. There are signs that it has moved to the markdown phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase is usually followed by the distribution and then the markdown, where the asset drops. The AUCTION price also moved to the overbought level, with the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator soaring. Therefore, there is a risk that it will have a harsh reversal in the coming days as it moves to the distribution phase.

Analyst Says ADA Price Must Hold This Crucial Level,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/can-cardano-reclaim-1-analyst-says-ada-price-must-hold-this-crucial-level/,"Cardano (ADA)‚Äôs price continues to move sideways, holding its range for the past 10 days, while online sentiment grows. Some analysts suggest that a retest of the local resistance could be near if the cryptocurrency holds its crucial support zone. Related Reading: Crypto Sleuth Claims Mysterious $20M ‚ÄòHyperliquid Whale‚Äô Is Tied To Illicit Activity Cardano Holds Key Range Cardano has retraced 40% from its two-month high of $1.17, dropping to the $0.7 range over the past few weeks. ADA climbed 80% on March 2 after US President Donald Trump announced a ‚ÄúCrypto Strategic Reserve,‚Äù including the cryptocurrency, which sent the token to monthly highs. After its massive pump, the altcoin retraced to $0.9, holding this zone through the following days. However, the March 6 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a ‚ÄúDigital Asset Stockpile‚Äù sent ADA below the crucial level. At the time, the White House‚Äôs Crypto Czar, David Sacks, clarified that the ADA and the other altcoins named were just used as a reference for the top cryptocurrencies in the market. Since then, Cardano has moved sideways, hovering between $0.68-$0.75. ADA dropped to $0.64 during the March 11 market crash before bouncing. Despite the ongoing price action, online sentiment has been positive towards ADA this week. On Tuesday, on-chain analytics firm Santiment pointed out that Cardano saw a highly positive sentiment on social media. The bullish sentiment was fueled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classification of ADA‚Äôs use case as ‚Äúsmart contracts for government services.‚Äù The news ‚Äúpushed bullishness to its highest rate in over 4 months,‚Äù the firm noted. Moreover, large-scale investors have also shown positive sentiment toward Cardano, with Whales purchasing around 190 million ADA tokens in the past 48 hours. ADA Breakout Or Breakdown Next? ADA has been in a downtrend since December 2024, when it hit its 3-year high of $1.32. The February market retraces sent the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price below several crucial support zones, with the token hovering between the $0.60-$0.80 price range. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted ADA has ‚Äúa weird-looking chart, mainly due to the announcement of the strategic reserve.‚Äù As a result, Cardano‚Äôs most crucial support level is at $0.66, as it could send it to monthly lows. According to the analyst, ‚ÄúThat level should hold; otherwise, all this recent price action will result in a distribution phase.‚Äù Previously, Sjuul affirmed¬†Cardano‚Äôs chart displayed a Power of 3 in the making, signaling that the cryptocurrency was entering the third phase. This pattern divides the price cycle into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. In the last phase, a strong price breakout occurs, with momentum building in the direction opposite to the manipulation. Based on this, if ADA lost the $0.66 mark, the token could see a significant price correction. Meanwhile, a pseudonym trader pointed out that the altcoin shows ‚Äúa bullish reversal after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern.‚Äù Per the post, Cardano could enter a strong uptrend if it maintains its momentum.

Analyst Ali Martinez noted that ADA trades within a right-angled descending wedge, with the upper trendline at $1.15. He suggested that a daily close above $1.15 would push ADA‚Äôs price to the $2 mark, not seen since 2021.

In a market known for rewarding early movers, countless undervalued tokens have surged to deliver life-changing returns. The tried-and-true ""buy low, sell high"" strategy continues to stand the test of time‚Äîespecially when applied to fresh projects that are just beginning to show signs of breakout potential. In this article, we explore five cryptocurrencies, both established and beginning projects, that could be on the cusp of significant growth, with the potential to deliver returns of up to 30x. While market volatility remains a constant, sentiment around these assets is notably bullish. Among them, Catzilla is attracting significant attention for its unique blend of meme culture, animal lover appeal and strong presale momentum. Catzilla‚Äôs High Profit Potential Explained Catzilla is one of the most promising new entries in the meme coin space. Besides the viral appeal of community-driven tokens, it boasts structured tokenomics and utility-focused incentives. While many meme coins rely solely on hype, Catzilla ($CATZILLA) offers a sustainable basis by integrating gaming elements, staking rewards, and community-centric mechanics such as Meow Points. Catzilla is also riding the wave of growing enthusiasm for Solana-based meme coins, which have been outperforming competitors on other chains in recent months. For instance, Bonk (BONK) surged by over 1,100% in Q4 2023, climbing into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap and securing listings on major platforms like Binance and Coinbase. Similarly, Popcat (POPCAT) posted gains exceeding 500% following its December 2023 rally, fueled by community-driven momentum and Solana‚Äôs booming on-chain activity. A deflationary token model, combined with a capped supply and token burn mechanisms, could boost $CATZILLA rise in the longer term. Catzilla taps into multiple trends within the crypto market by targeting meme coin lovers and gaming audiences. It could potentially give it the kind of viral momentum to rival breakout tokens like BONK and POPCAT. Learn more about Catzilla The community is strongly bullish on $CATZILLA, as 96% of CMC voters are expecting its price increase. Besides, popular crypto influencers like Franklin Emmanuel have already noticed the strong potential of Catzilla. The outstanding features of Catzilla are: Broad Audience Appeal: Blends viral meme culture with elements that resonate across various communities, including crypto enthusiasts and gamers. Presale Momentum: Currently in Stage 7 of a 14-stage presale with steady demand and early price appreciation, offering early investors an entry point before exchange listings. Deflationary Tokenomics: Implements deflationary mechanics such as token burns and staking incentives to encourage long-term holding and reduce supply over time. Community Engagement: Features programs like Meow Points and multi-level referrals to foster active community participation and loyalty. Ecosystem Growth: Plans for gaming and NFT integrations align Catzilla with growing sectors like GameFi, expanding its potential reach beyond just meme coin traders. Catzilla‚Äôs Presale Halfway Through Currently, Catzilla is running a presale to offer early investors the opportunity to capitalize on its future growth potential at the best price. The presale is advancing through Stage 7 of 14, with the $CATZILLA token priced at $0.0009 at the time of writing. The presale structure implies gradual price increases at each stage, providing early buyers with an immediate advantage in terms of pricing. The project‚Äôs final presale price is set at $0.0016, meaning that early-stage investors have received a higher discount. Demand for $CATZILLA remains steady thanks to an active community and incentives tied to staking and Meow Points rewards. If Catzilla successfully executes its roadmap , investors participating in the presale may see strong returns once exchange listings begin and liquidity improves. Become Early Investor in Catzilla Cardano (ADA): Slow Development Could Stall Momentum Cardano has long been positioned as an Ethereum competitor due to its emphasis on peer-reviewed development and scalability. However, its relatively slow pace of network upgrades and the delayed rollout of critical features such as smart contracts have caused skepticism among investors. While Cardano has a loyal community and a strong academic approach, its progress has lagged behind other layer-1 blockchains that are quicker to implement new technologies and partnerships. In a fast-moving market where speed and adaptability often define winners, Cardano risks falling behind unless it accelerates its development pipeline. Additionally, the overall DeFi ecosystem on Cardano has yet to reach the same level of adoption as competing platforms like Solana or Ethereum, limiting ADA‚Äôs immediate upside potential. Solana (SOL): Fast-Growing but Vulnerable to Network Instabilities Solana continues to capture attention as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the crypto space, driven by its high throughput and low transaction costs. However, despite its impressive technical performance and growing developer base, Solana has struggled with network outages and centralization concerns. While the ecosystem has benefited from the recent surge in meme coin activity and strong DeFi usage, persistent issues with reliability could impact long-term investor confidence. The project has taken steps to improve network resilience, but questions remain around its ability to handle mainstream adoption without technical hiccups. That said, if Solana can successfully resolve these challenges and maintain momentum in NFT, gaming, and meme coin markets, SOL still has significant upside heading into 2025. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Uncertainty Clouds Long-Term Growth Ripple‚Äôs XRP token has weathered years of uncertainty due to the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While Ripple scored a partial legal victory in 2023, regulatory risks continue to weigh on the token‚Äôs price and broader adoption in the United States. XRP‚Äôs core strength lies in its use case for cross-border payments and partnerships with financial institutions. However, these partnerships have yet to translate into widespread XRP adoption for utility purposes. Investors may be cautious about XRP‚Äôs growth potential until further regulatory clarity is achieved. Without a decisive resolution to its legal issues, XRP may underperform relative to other large-cap cryptos that are unburdened by regulatory headwinds. Ethereum (ETH): The Blue Chip with Scaling Hurdles Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform and a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. However, scalability challenges persist, and while the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and Layer 2 rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism offer solutions, the broader network still faces competition from faster, lower-cost alternatives. High gas fees during periods of network congestion can deter retail users and developers seeking more affordable options. Ethereum‚Äôs transition to proof-of-stake has improved energy efficiency, but it hasn‚Äôt fully solved the cost and speed challenges. Despite these hurdles, Ethereum‚Äôs first-mover advantage, massive developer community, and role in institutional DeFi and NFT markets give it undeniable staying power. While ETH might not be as explosive as newer altcoins, it is still a foundational asset for long-term investors. Comparative table of Pros and Cons Pros Cons Catzilla Early presale price advantage; Unique combination of meme coin appeal and structured tokenomics; Deflationary mechanics and staking incentives; Focus on gaming and community engagement. Dependent on community growth and roadmap execution. Cardano Strong academic foundation; Energy-efficient proof-of-stake; Loyal community; Long-term focus on scalability and security. Slow development pace; Lagging DeFi adoption; Risk of losing ground to faster-moving competitors. Solana High throughput and low transaction fees; Rapidly growing ecosystem; Strong presence in NFTs and gaming sectors. Network outages and reliability concerns; Centralization criticisms; Competes with multiple scalable blockchains. Ripple Established partnerships with banks and payment providers; Focus on cross-border transactions; Partial legal victory boosts sentiment. Ongoing regulatory uncertainty; Limited adoption for XRP utility; Relies heavily on institutional partnerships. Ethereum Dominant smart contract platform; Large developer and institutional ecosystem; Integral to DeFi and NFTs; Ongoing Layer 2 scaling solutions. Scalability issues persist despite upgrades; High gas fees during peak usage; Faces competition from faster Layer 1s and rollups. Conclusion While ADA, SOL, XRP, and ETH hold strong positions in the crypto market and could deliver solid returns, each faces hurdles‚Äîranging from scalability issues to regulatory uncertainty‚Äîthat could limit their explosive upside. In contrast, Catzilla offers a fresh, high-risk/high-reward opportunity. Its mix of meme coin appeal, deflationary tokenomics, and growing presale momentum gives it an edge in the speculative segment of the market. Positioned at the intersection of community-driven hype and structured long-term mechanics, Catzilla could be one of the more compelling candidates for investors seeking outsized returns in the next cycle.

This development, highlighted by crypto analyst Mintern, positions Cardano to potentially surpass the transaction speeds of prominent blockchain platforms like Solana and Sui. BREAKING NEWS: CHARLES REVEALS DATE FOR BASHO DELIVERY @IOHK_Charles just revealed that basho, will be implemented when Leios goes online this year or next. If this happens cardano will be faster than Solana and Sui The bullishness is stacking up pic.twitter.com/jZuyMofeQ3 ‚Äî Mintern (@MinswapIntern) March 21, 2025 The Basho Phase: Enhancing Scalability The Basho phase represents a pivotal era in Cardano‚Äôs roadmap, focusing primarily on scalability and network optimization. Unlike previous phases that emphasized decentralization and smart contract functionality, Basho aims to enhance the underlying performance of the Cardano network, ensuring it can handle a higher volume of transactions with increased efficiency. Ouroboros Leios: The Catalyst for Speed Central to achieving the goals of the Basho phase is the implementation of the Ouroboros Leios protocol. Introduced in 2022, Leios is designed to significantly boost Cardano‚Äôs throughput capabilities. Hoskinson has expressed confidence that this upgrade will enable Cardano to outperform Solana in terms of speed without compromising its decentralized nature. He emphasized that while the existing Rust node serves its purpose, Leios will offer substantial enhancements, making Cardano ‚Äúfaster than Solana.‚Äù Comparative Performance: Cardano, Solana, and Sui Currently, Solana boasts transaction speeds of approximately 3,000 transactions per second (tps), significantly outpacing Cardano‚Äôs several hundred tps. Sui, a newer entrant in the blockchain space, has been designed with an object-centric model that supports parallel execution, aiming for high-speed transactions. The integration of the Leios protocol is anticipated to elevate Cardano‚Äôs performance metrics, positioning it competitively alongside or even ahead of these platforms. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications and Investor Sentiment The prospect of Cardano achieving superior transaction speeds has generated considerable optimism within the crypto community. Enhanced scalability not only improves user experience but also attracts a broader range of decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise solutions to the platform. As Cardano advances towards the Basho phase, stakeholders are closely monitoring these developments, anticipating a potential shift in the blockchain hierarchy. The forthcoming implementation of the Basho phase, in tandem with the Ouroboros Leios protocol, marks a significant milestone in Cardano‚Äôs evolution. By potentially surpassing the transaction speeds of established platforms like Solana and emerging ones like Sui, Cardano is poised to reinforce its position as a leading blockchain network, offering scalable and efficient solutions for the decentralized future.

In a post on X, Sun said TRX entering a halving cycle similar to Bitcoin would be great for the network. According to Sun , who shared his thoughts on the proposal, it is worth paying attention as it could have a significant impact. He claimed that TRX is already deflationary with the supply rate falling 1% per year and added that it is the only major cap token that is deflationary. Tron may benefit from reward reduction ‚Äì Justin Sun Justin Sun believes a moderate reduction could be necessary because the rise in TRX value has attracted more validators to the network. Sun said: ‚ÄúDue to TRX‚Äôs rising price, the rewards for block-producing nodes across the network have increased significantly, so a moderate reduction could be considered.‚Äù He compared this to what happened to the Bitcoin network, where rewards were reduced as the network grew, and the price of BTC soared. Sun noted that the halving of Bitcoin played a crucial role in making Bitcoin sustainable. TRX has been a top performer in the past year, enabling it to become a top ten cryptocurrency. Source: CoinMarketCap Although the crypto entrepreneur emphasized that the TRX community would decide on the way forward, he did highlight some of the advantages of block reward reduction on the TRX token, particularly how this would increase the network‚Äôs deflation rate. He said: ‚ÄúIf (daily block rewards are) reduced by 2 million TRX, the deflation rate would rise to 2% per year, effectively doubling the deflation rate, with an impact on TRX cycles comparable to Bitcoin‚Äôs halving.‚Äù Interestingly, Solana recently concluded a failed attempt to reduce its block rewards to lower the inflation rate. The SIMD 0228 proposal on Solana could not get the supermajority needed for its approval, as many small validators were concerned about its impact. Perhaps in reference to this, Sun noted that reducing block rewards will not significantly affect Tron validators because the incentives remain highly attractive. Proposal to reduce TRX block rewards under discussion Meanwhile, the proposal Sun is referring to was submitted three days ago by one Jamestepforward and advocates for reducing the amount of TRX validators get to boost TRX value through an increased deflation rate. The proposal added that this could also incentivize staking. Two parameters determine how much Super Representatives (SRs) get for producing blocks on the Tron network. Parameter No. 5 says Tron rewards participants involved in block production with 16 TRX for each block, while Parameter No. 31 stipulates 160 TRX as rewards. The new proposal seeks to adjust the two parameters so that TRX production will also be reduced. However, it did not specify the amount to reduce the TRX tokens to and instead called on the community to suggest reasonable values. It said: ‚ÄúIt is proposed to adjust these two network parameters to reduce the TRX production rates. Everyone is welcome to make specific suggestions and participate in discussion on the setting of reasonable parameter values.‚Äù So far, users have been submitting recommendations. Some users proposed a 50% reduction, noting that this would make the impact more obvious. However, others have called for a gradual reduction starting with 10% or 20%. Still, some believe that reducing the rewards could have an immediate negative impact on the validators, while the positive benefits might take a while before participants feel them. It is too early to determine which direction the community will go, and the discussion is still in its early stages. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Ripple's recent victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has infused new investor confidence in XRP. Ripple Secures a Landmark Victory Ripple Labs has clinched a significant win in its years-long legal battle with the SEC. The regulator recently announced it would drop its appeal against a July 2023 court ruling that had declared XRP‚Äôs sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities. This decision has ended a contentious chapter in the regulatory battle between traditional financial oversight bodies and the crypto industry. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple‚Äôs CEO, called the SEC's surrender a ""resounding victory"" and a pivotal moment for the crypto space. On March 19, 2025, after the news broke, XRP surged by 10%, climbing from $2.29 to $2.51 by the end of the trading day. Although it slightly corrected to $2.47 the following morning, the price movement reflects renewed market confidence. Investors see this as a significant milestone, not just for Ripple but for the broader crypto market, signaling a potential retreat from aggressive regulatory stances under the new SEC leadership. Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, reinforced this sentiment, stating that the company is now in the ""driver's seat"" to determine its next strategic moves. This legal breakthrough paves the way for reinvigorated investments and partnerships in XRP, as well as for other blockchain projects wary of regulatory uncertainty. BinoFi Presale Captures Investor Excitement While Ripple celebrates its legal triumph, BinoFi is making waves with its hybrid exchange platform and remarkable achievements. Combining the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges, BinoFi offers advanced trading solutions, including cross-chain functionality and robust security measures powered by Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets. BinoFi‚Äôs presale has been a runaway success, with over 20 million $BINO tokens sold as of March 2025. Early investors were quick to seize the opportunity to purchase $BINO at $0.02, anticipating a launch price of $0.30. This remarkable early adoption is driven by the platform‚Äôs innovative features, including AI-powered trading tools, non-custodial gasless wallets, and real-time proof-of-reserves transparency. These features are positioning BinoFi as a strong contender in the DeFi space, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The prospect of bridging liquidity from centralized exchanges with the autonomy of decentralized platforms is particularly appealing in a market hungry for trustworthy and user-friendly solutions. With predictions suggesting significant ROI potential for $BINO holders, interest in the project shows no signs of slowing down. A New Era of Opportunity in Crypto? Ripple‚Äôs victory marks an inflection point in the regulatory landscape, providing more clarity for crypto projects navigating complex legal frameworks. Meanwhile, BinoFi‚Äôs rapid ascent demonstrates that the appetite for innovative and reliable crypto solutions remains robust. Together, these developments point to a promising era of growth and resilience in the crypto market. As XRP continues to rally and BinoFi prepares to disrupt traditional trading paradigms, investors and industry watchers alike are gearing up for what could be a transformational year. Whether you're celebrating Ripple's regulatory win or considering getting in on BinoFi‚Äôs presale momentum, the time to rethink your crypto strategy might just be now.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.66 million YouTube subscribers that several big-named crypto companies may launch their initial public offerings (IPOs) in the near future, which may attract massive amounts of traditional finance wealth. According to Turner, crypto companies that are most likely to launch IPOs include Kraken, the second-largest US-based crypto exchange by trading volume, Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, and blockchain data analysis firm Chainalysis. ‚ÄúThis influx of crypto IPOs will likely attract institutional investors to the space. As regulators like the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) become more crypto friendly, investors everywhere will see a more legitimized and mature crypto market to invest in. This would draw in the more traditional investors who normally prefer to stick to equities.‚Äù He also says that as more crypto companies go public another trend may emerge, companies may start offering initial coin offerings (ICOs) instead of stock shares. ‚ÄúWith the right regulations in place, ICOs could again become a great way to raise capital from crypto natives who are probably more familiar with these companies than outsiders are. This, in turn, could provide some serious money-making opportunities for investors. After all, being early to a project is still the best way of making life-changing gains. We‚Äôre some way off from that for now, but seeing dozens of crypto projects and companies going public in the future will be the first step to unlocking the next stage in cryptos evolution, and that‚Äôs replacing IPOs with ICOs, native tokens replacing stocks.

Meanwhile, a bright new star, BinoFi, has captured the attention of investors with its hybrid exchange model and a record-breaking presale. Here‚Äôs a detailed view of how these crypto trends are shaping March 2025. Dogecoin's Modest Upswing Captures Attention The meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a long-time favorite among enthusiasts, has returned to the spotlight with modest gains this week. Trading around $0.092, Dogecoin recorded a 4% increase over the past five days. While this growth pales in comparison to the triple-digit gains from its 2021 heyday, it nonetheless reflects a growing sense of stability and confidence for a token once considered a joke.For long-term supporters, Dogecoin remains a nostalgic and intriguing token with ongoing utility in the crypto ecosystem. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Dogecoin‚Äôs steady growth, pointing out that its community-driven nature and active development team are vital in maintaining its relevance amidst stiff market competition. Bitcoin Holds Ground at an Unprecedented $85,000 While altcoins like Dogecoin are making smaller waves, Bitcoin remains a powerful anchor for the market. Bitcoin's price, which crossed the $85,000 milestone earlier this month, has remained stable, signaling strong market confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Investors are buoyed by Bitcoin's resilience in the face of global economic uncertainties and a more favorable regulatory landscape in key markets. The next major driver could be increasing spot Bitcoin ETF approvals as more regulators show openness to cryptocurrency-backed financial products. BinoFi Takes the Spotlight with Revolutionary Presale Success Leading the headlines this March, however, is BinoFi , hailed as one of the most innovative crypto projects of the year. This hybrid exchange bridges the gap between centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, combining their best features to deliver a seamless, high-performance trading experience. Its unique capabilities include cross-chain trading, AI-driven analytics, and gasless, MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallets, solving many pain points faced by both seasoned and first-time crypto traders. BinoFi‚Äôs presale has been nothing short of phenomenal. Selling over 20 million tokens at a starting price of $0.02, early adopters eagerly anticipate a potential launch price of $0.30, representing an astounding 15x return. The buzz surrounding BinoFi isn‚Äôt solely about its presale numbers but also its robust roadmap and commitment to redefining how digital assets are traded. What sets BinoFi apart is its cross-chain functionality, which removes the inefficiencies of traditional wrapped tokens, and its pioneering security features. By offering traders speed, safety, and flexibility, BinoFi has positioned itself as a unique solution in a market full of competitors specializing in either centralized or decentralized models. With its innovative technology and strong community support, BinoFi is set to be a change in the exchange market, making it a key player to watch as 2025 progresses. An Exciting Time for Cryptocurrencies March 2025 is underscoring the diversity and depth within the crypto space. Dogecoin‚Äôs steady growth shows that even meme coins can carve out a niche in the market. Bitcoin's stability at $85,000 reflects its maturation as a financial product with a long-term outlook. Meanwhile, BinoFi‚Äôs unique approach to crypto trading represents the bold innovation that keeps the market moving forward. Whether you're a seasoned investor eyeing Bitcoin‚Äôs continued dominance, a Dogecoin fan eager to see its evolution, or an early supporter of BinoFi's ambitious plans, there‚Äôs no shortage of opportunities in the current landscape. The crypto market‚Äôs mix of established leaders and forward-thinking newcomers ensures it remains a dynamic, unpredictable, and rewarding space for those ready to take the plunge.

42154952,https://invezz.com/?p=2631268,1742650800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"This under $0.03 cryptocurrency could be the next Solana (SOL), says experts",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/22/this-under-0-03-cryptocurrency-could-be-the-next-solana-sol-says-experts/,"Analysts are comparing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now priced below $0.03 in its ongoing presale, to Solana‚ÄÇ(SOL), as they recognise its potential for exponential growth. Six days into Phase 3, and already sitting at $0.02, the‚ÄÇproject has raised $4.5million+ from 6400+ investors ‚Äî a strong sign of early demand. Over 60% of Phase 3 tokens have already been claimed, speeding up the‚ÄÇcountdown to Phase 4 ‚Äî where prices hike 25% to $0.025. Market observers speculate‚ÄÇthat Mutuum Finance‚Äôs structured tokenomics, which guarantee current purchasers a 200% return when the token lists (the listing price will be set at $0.06), have proven to be a primary catalyst. The initial projection following launch is anticipated to‚ÄÇreach $3.50 with early bird entry resulting in a potential upside of over 17,400% while MUTM is set to become a very special low entry point vital to the growth of DeFi. Presale frenzy intensifies Mutuum Finance ‚Äôs presale Phase 3 is rapidly filling up ahead of an‚ÄÇimpending price increase. During Phase 4 the same investors will enjoy a $0.025 price per token‚ÄÇand an instant 25% profit on the tokens they pre-purchase now, in addition to the 200% return when P2P launch. This uplift is the job of the project‚Äôs tokenomics design, which means they leave speculation‚ÄÇout of the equation. This number is already more‚ÄÇthan 6,400 holders and confirms the faith in Mutuum Finance‚Äôs lending ecosystem and its revenue-sharing model. With the clock ticking toward Phase 4, the reduced window in which to buy at a —Ü–µ–Ω–∞ of $0.02 is causing urgency to skyrocket for‚ÄÇboth retail and institutional buyers alike. ROI calculations fuel the interest Just basic maths illustrates the potential of Mutuum Finance: A $500 investment at the existing $0.02 price point expands to $1,500 on‚ÄÇlaunch and potentially $87,500 if the token reaches $3.50. These projections‚ÄÇare derived from the platform‚Äôs buy and distribute mechanism utilizing protocol fees to perpetually purchase MUTM from the market to redistribute tokens to stakers. This‚ÄÇgenerates consecutive demand, which fights sell pressure and incentivizes long-term holders. While meme coins thrive on hype, the value of most virtual currencies like Mutuum Finance is secured in real-world utility: decentralized lending, borrowing, and‚ÄÇpassive income generation, so it‚Äôs a prudent investment during a crypto downturn. What makes Mutuum‚ÄÇFinance unique Instead of relying on over-collateralization like other platforms or offering under-collateralized loans like competing projects that put‚ÄÇusers‚Äô funds at risk, Mutuum Finance loans require borrowers to lock assets valued higher than their loans, mitigating the risk of them defaulting. For instance, each $5,000 USDT loan requires $7,000 in ETH collateral, which helps‚ÄÇthe system to remain stable. The protocol also mints mtTokens ‚Äî interest-earning representations of depositing assets, such as ETH or‚ÄÇDAI ‚Äî which inflate over time and are transferrable between DeFi services. These features, combined with dynamic interest rates that respond to market conditions, make them attractive to‚ÄÇboth cautious lenders and yield-hungry borrowers. Audits build trust Mutuum Finance‚ÄÇhas security at the forefront of their project, and the team is finalizing a smart contract audit by CertiK. Results will‚ÄÇfollow shortly through official channels and boosted investor confidence in the reliability of the platform. This contrasts with other projects in a crowded space, where speed is prioritized over‚ÄÇsafety, but MUTM‚Äôs approach to risk management defies this trend. Similar to Solana (SOL), which grew from a token that was less than $1 to a top-five‚ÄÇcryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale performance and real-world utility demonstrate their growth potential. So, to identify a compelling need to deliver exceptional results, look no further than past successes, single failure method all the way ‚Äì but past results is never a guarantee of future results, so‚ÄÇeven with that said, with MUTM‚Äôs presale mechanics, deflationary tokenomics, and income-driven demand, there‚Äôs good reason to suspect growth. Act now‚ÄîPhase 3 won‚Äôt last. Get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now and earn the lowest price of the‚ÄÇpresale.

According to its statement, the Tokyo-based company mentioned that it enabled the payment option to simplify the process of buying properties in Japan. The recent development was highlighted by former Vice President of Strategy Initiatives at Ripple, Emi Yoshikawa, noting it in an X post. The Open House Group is one of the leading real estate companies in Japan with annual sales reaching one trillion Japanese yen. In its announcement, the company mentioned that it will also be accepting Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL) and XRP. Japanese real estate firm announces XRP payment option In its announcement , Open House Group mentioned that the newly added digital assets will be available to be used in line with its previous payment options, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company announced its decision to commence the acceptance of crypto payments on January 31, mentioning that it will begin with the two biggest digital assets by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company has been exploring the use of digital assets since 2022, including sponsoring research on Bitcoin‚Äôs lightning network. With the latest development, it seems the Japanese outfit is ready for a full experience in the sector, while giving its users a taste. The company also mentioned that it has now opened a Chinese website, where customers can also use the payment options available. The company also added that the new payment options are available for customers to purchase the whole range of properties they offer, from residential houses to condominiums and one-room apartments. The firm mentioned that instead of seeing digital assets as speculative assets, it prefers to put it into practical use in terms of cross-border payments and micropayments. However, Open House Group has clarified that customers who intend to use its crypto payment options should follow laws, tax laws, and other applicable laws in their country of residence when carrying out transactions. It also mentioned that the customers are responsible for their acts during transactions. It also added that depending on the country, digital assets used for payments may be subject to seizure. Implications of the development for XRP The announcement of XRP as one of its payment options could be a further boost in the adoption of the fourth-largest digital asset according to market cap. The token has been witnessing good fortune over the last few weeks, starting with its addition in the United States crypto reserve. On Wednesday, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was dropping its appeal, bringing an end to a protracted lawsuit. Meanwhile, Yoshikawa says the adoption of the asset by the Open House Group is a big deal, considering that they are one of the biggest real estate companies in Japan. She mentioned that the real estate firm ranks fifth among the biggest Japanese firms by revenue. Given such a dominant position in the Japanese real estate market, users may prefer to use XRP to purchase properties, boosting its adoption and driving its value up. Open House has major properties in key cities across Japan, while operating several businesses which include consultation, sales, development, and property management. While Open House is the latest to join the party, the trend of integrating XRP as a payment option among businesses has been ongoing for a while. In 2023, XRP ranked among the most used digital assets for payments. The token saw a 42% uptick in use for payment transactions on BitPay, a platform used to facilitate crypto payments for businesses globally. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Despite a prolonged period of consolidation, analysts now see bullish momentum building around SHIB, which could act as a catalyst for the broader altcoin market. Historically, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have signaled increased risk appetite in the market, often preceding major rallies across smaller altcoins and presale projects. While SHIB continues to capture attention, investors are also diversifying into emerging opportunities that combine speculation with strong fundamentals. One of the most discussed new projects is The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) , a blockchain-based gaming ecosystem that introduces an investment-driven model, setting it apart from traditional meme coins. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Bullish Outlook ‚Äì Can It Spark an Altcoin Rally? Shiba Inu has been trading near key support levels, with analysts pointing to a potential breakout that could see SHIB reclaim higher price ranges. After months of downward movement, technical indicators suggest a reversal, with increased trading volume and whale accumulation signaling renewed confidence in the asset. One of the biggest factors driving optimism around SHIB is its expanding ecosystem, which now includes Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain that enhances scalability and transaction efficiency. The platform has also been integrating DeFi utilities and NFT-based applications, further strengthening its long-term appeal beyond its meme coin origins. However, while SHIB‚Äôs ecosystem is evolving, its large market cap presents a challenge for exponential price growth. Many investors seeking higher returns are now looking beyond established meme coins and exploring early-stage crypto projects that offer greater upside potential. The Shift Toward High-Growth Crypto Investments As Shiba Inu‚Äôs bullish momentum signals renewed confidence in the altcoin market, investors are increasingly shifting their focus toward high-growth opportunities beyond established large-cap assets. Historically, altcoin cycles follow a pattern where capital flows first into major layer-1s like Ethereum and XRP, before rotating into smaller-cap tokens with high upside potential. One of the biggest trends shaping this shift is the growing demand for emerging sectors that offer real utility and engagement. In particular, DeFi, Web3 gaming, and gamification models have gained traction as investors look for projects that go beyond speculative price movements. These sectors offer innovative ways to interact with blockchain technology, providing yield-generating mechanics, interactive ecosystems, and real-world applications. With the crypto market expanding beyond traditional trading strategies, projects that combine utility, adoption potential, and strong market narratives are becoming the top focus for investors seeking early-stage opportunities with long-term sustainability. One such project gaining attention is The Last Dwarfs ($TLD), which is positioning itself at the intersection of these high-growth trends. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) ‚Äì A High-Utility Crypto with Real Growth Potential Unlike speculative meme coins, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is built on an active gaming ecosystem, where users engage in mining, staking, and battling for tokenized rewards. The platform‚Äôs Gamified Launchpad also provides exclusive access to early-stage crypto projects, turning the gaming experience into an interactive investment strategy. The project is integrated with the TON blockchain and Telegram, offering direct access to a 900M+ user base, significantly increasing its reach. Additionally, over 300,000 users have already onboarded, demonstrating strong demand ahead of its full launch. Investors participating in The Last Dwarfs‚Äô presale can also benefit from staking rewards of up to 300% APY and the Ref2Earn program, which provides a 15% token bonus for successful referrals. With Stage 2 currently live at $0.00852, the opportunity to buy before the next price increase is still open. Final Thoughts ‚Äì Could $TLD Be the Best Altcoin Play of 2025? The resurgence of Shiba Inu is once again fueling excitement in the altcoin market, signaling that investors are ready to move beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum in search of high-growth opportunities. However, while SHIB continues to gain traction, its potential for exponential returns is more limited compared to newer projects still in their early adoption phase. For those looking for the strongest risk-reward ratio, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) presents a compelling alternative, offering a fully developed platform, strong user traction, and real utility. With the presale rapidly progressing, early investors still have a chance to position themselves before the next major price increase, making $TLD one of the top altcoin investments to watch in 2025.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Swings Push Investors Toward $TLD, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Among the Top Crypto Picks",https://nulltx.com/altcoin-season-incoming-bitcoins-price-swings-push-investors-toward-tld-litecoin-dogecoin-shiba-inu-among-the-top-crypto-picks/,"The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a crucial moment as Bitcoin continues to test resistance at $87,000. After experiencing multiple rejections at this level, the leading digital asset remains in a consolidation phase, with traders closely watching for a decisive breakout. Historically, such periods of Bitcoin stability have led to a surge in altcoin interest, as investors seek higher growth potential in smaller-cap assets. This pattern has played out in previous bull cycles, where capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins resulted in significant price appreciation for select assets. With altcoin season potentially on the horizon, analysts are now identifying key contenders for the next market rally. Among these, Litecoin ($LTC), Dogecoin ($DOGE), Shiba Inu ($SHIB), and The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are emerging as strong candidates, each offering unique advantages in the evolving market landscape. Bitcoin‚Äôs Consolidation and the Shift Toward Altcoins Bitcoin has been testing the $87,000 resistance zone multiple times, signaling strong buyer interest but also facing rejection. The market is currently in a phase of consolidation, with Bitcoin dominance still high. However, historical data suggests that such conditions often precede a strong altcoin market, as traders diversify into assets with greater upside potential. The altcoin cycle typically follows a predictable pattern: Bitcoin leads the rally, Ethereum follows, and then smaller-cap altcoins experience explosive gains. With Bitcoin stabilizing, investors are now looking at altcoins that could outperform during the next bullish phase. Litecoin ‚Äì The Reliable Alternative to Bitcoin Litecoin ($LTC) has maintained its status as a strong alternative to Bitcoin, often referred to as ‚Äúdigital silver.‚Äù With faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Bitcoin, Litecoin remains a preferred choice for transactions and payments. As the market trends toward mass adoption, Litecoin‚Äôs long-standing reputation and real-world use cases position it well for growth. Analysts believe that if the altcoin market gains momentum, Litecoin could see renewed investor interest as traders seek exposure to established, yet undervalued, assets. Dogecoin ‚Äì The Meme Coin That Refuses to Fade Dogecoin ($DOGE) continues to be a dominant force in the meme coin sector, backed by a loyal community and high-profile endorsements. While initially created as a joke, DOGE has demonstrated resilience in market cycles, with its price frequently surging during speculative rallies. Currently, Dogecoin‚Äôs price action is influenced by broader meme coin sentiment and retail investor enthusiasm. Despite its speculative nature, DOGE remains a popular choice for traders looking to capitalize on social media-driven price movements. If the altcoin season takes off, Dogecoin could once again become one of the most volatile and high-reward plays in the market. Shiba Inu ‚Äì Can It Repeat Its 2021 Rally? Shiba Inu ($SHIB) rose to prominence during the 2021 bull run, capturing retail investor interest with its aggressive marketing and ecosystem expansion. While initially dismissed as another meme coin, SHIB has evolved with its Layer-2 solution, Shibarium, and expanded DeFi functionalities. Despite these advancements, SHIB remains heavily influenced by overall market sentiment. The token has been showing bullish signs recently, with analysts predicting a potential breakout if Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum. Investors are keeping a close watch on Shiba Inu as one of the top meme coins to watch in the next altcoin cycle. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) ‚Äì A New Era for Web3 Gaming Investments As the crypto landscape evolves, investors are seeking projects that go beyond speculation and offer real-world engagement. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is at the forefront of this shift, pioneering the Play-to-Invest model that merges Web3 gaming with decentralized finance (DeFi). Unlike traditional Play-to-Earn projects, TLD allows users to mine, battle, and stake their tokens while gaining early access to emerging blockchain projects through its Gamified Launchpad. This interactive investment model transforms gaming into a financial opportunity, offering both entertainment and tangible rewards. A significant differentiator for The Last Dwarfs is its integration with the TON blockchain and Telegram, providing direct access to over 900 million users. This strategic positioning gives $TLD a substantial edge in achieving mass adoption compared to other Web3 projects. With over 300,000 users already onboarded, The Last Dwarfs has demonstrated strong early traction, reducing the risks typically associated with presale investments. Unlike speculative meme coins, $TLD offers a structured ecosystem with clear long-term growth potential. Final Thoughts ‚Äì Which Crypto Holds the Most Potential? Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements remain the primary driver of market sentiment, and as it consolidates, altcoins are gaining attention. Litecoin ($LTC) presents a stable and established option, Dogecoin ($DOGE) continues to be a speculative favorite, and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) is eyeing a resurgence fueled by ecosystem growth. However, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) stands out as a unique investment opportunity, thanks to its innovative approach to crypto investing and an already visible strong early adoption. With its presale currently in Stage 2, investors still have the chance to secure $TLD at a discounted price before the next price increase. As the altcoin market heats up, those looking for the next high-growth opportunity may find that $TLD offers one of the best risk-reward plays in 2025. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

This month, Solana, Avalanche, and BinoFi are stirring excitement among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. From Solana's ecosystem expansion to Avalanche's market resurgence and BinoFi's revolutionary cross-chain trading , here's what you need to know about these major players in March 2025. Solana Expands Its Ecosystem with New Capabilities Solana has long been favored for its high-speed and low-cost blockchain solutions, but recent updates have taken its ecosystem to the next level. The platform recently rolled out enhanced scalability features, making it more efficient than ever for developers to launch decentralized apps (dApps) and services. These upgrades include improved parallel transaction handling, which drastically reduces congestion during peak usage. The impact is evident in its market performance. At $126.45, Solana‚Äôs token (SOL) has shown steady resilience despite industry-wide volatility. Its robust ecosystem continues to attract developers, investors, and institutional partners, ensuring Solana remains a top contender in the blockchain space. Avalanche Gains Momentum in a Bullish Market Avalanche has joined the ongoing crypto rally, proving its place as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the industry. Known for its high throughput and eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake consensus, Avalanche has successfully bridged decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. The platform saw a 2% price increase this past week, with AVAX now valued at $18.15, reflecting renewed investor confidence. Avalanche‚Äôs roadmap also focuses heavily on improving cross-network functionality, and its recent steps toward integrating Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)‚Äìcompatible subnets give it an edge in connecting the fragmented DeFi landscape. BinoFi Redefines Cross-Chain Innovation Amid the excitement surrounding Solana and Avalanche, BinoFi has truly stolen the show with its advancements in cross-chain trading. Tackling one of crypto's biggest challenges, BinoFi‚Äôs hybrid exchange model combines the benefits of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. By focusing on cross-chain functionality, BinoFi empowers users to trade assets across multiple blockchains without the complexities of wrapped tokens or unreliable bridges. At the heart of BinoFi‚Äôs innovations are its AI-augmented analytics and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology, which guarantees both speed and security for users. Traders can execute gasless transactions through the platform while retaining full custody of their funds, a feature that has resonated strongly with the community. BinoFi‚Äôs presale success continues to make waves, with over 20 million $BINO tokens sold at $0.02 each. Early participants are optimistic about the set launch price of $0.30, potentially offering a 15x return on investment. The platform‚Äôs ability to balance cutting-edge technology with an intuitive user experience ensures that it will remain a key player in the evolving DeFi ecosystem. Crypto‚Äôs Growing Landscape of Innovation March 2025 brings exciting developments for the crypto industry, with Solana, Avalanche, and BinoFi driving significant progress. Solana‚Äôs ecosystem expansions and developer-friendly tools underline its leadership position. Avalanche‚Äôs focus on interoperability and enterprise solutions strengthens its appeal to institutions. Meanwhile, BinoFi is breaking barriers for cross-chain trading, combining innovation with the practical needs of both retail and institutional traders. For investors and crypto enthusiasts, the opportunities these projects present reflect the broader evolution of the blockchain space. Whether you‚Äôre exploring Solana‚Äôs dynamic dApps, leveraging Avalanche‚Äôs high-performance solutions, or joining BinoFi‚Äôs revolutionary trading platform, the market is ripe with potential for 2025 and beyond.

Linear Finance is doing exactly that with its Perpetual Decentralized Exchange (PerpDEX), a platform designed for fast and seamless perpetual trading while also prioritizing user experience (UI/UX) and new features that boost trading efficiency like never before. Built on Orderly Network, Linear's PerpDEX offers deep liquidity, smooth execution, and a high-performance trading experience without the usual headaches of traditional decentralized exchanges. Additionally, it introduces slick new features such as One-Click trading, Pop-out charts, and Custom Uniswap Deposits, allowing traders to interact with the platform in a way that maximizes efficiency and accessibility. Why Perpetual Trading Matters Perpetual contracts have become a staple in crypto trading. Unlike standard futures, they don‚Äôt have an expiration date. Traders can hold positions indefinitely, provided they have enough margin. Moreover, perpetuals also allow you to trade against the markets, ensuring that you're able to maximally capitalize on reading markets both rising and falling. Perpetuals also allow traders to capitalize on market movements in both rising and falling conditions‚Äîits powerful for making gains in various market scenarios. This flexibility means that traders can strategically position themselves to take advantage of market trends without the limitations of traditional futures contracts. Orderly Network: The Omni-Chain Liquidity Layer Orderly Network is a permissionless liquidity layer that enhances both spot and derivatives trading in DeFi. It‚Äôs built to provide a seamless trading experience while maintaining full decentralization. So why did Linear Finance choose Orderly? Simple: it solves the biggest problem DeFi traders face‚Äîliquidity. Orderly aggregates liquidity from multiple sources, ensuring that even large orders can be executed without major price impact. It also provides an efficient matching engine, making trade execution smoother than what most decentralized exchanges offer. The collaboration between Linear and Orderly Network brings a significant advantage: deep liquidity combined with a seamless, high-performance perpetual trading environment.

Linear is addressing all of these issues with: Deep Liquidity Thanks to Orderly Network, Linear taps into a wide liquidity pool, ensuring smooth trade execution. Fast Execution The matching engine allows for near-instant order placement, reducing waiting times for traders. Minimal Slippage More liquidity means less price fluctuation when executing trades, making it ideal for both retail and institutional traders. Cross-Chain Compatibility Linear‚Äôs protocol is built to work across multiple chains, making it more accessible to traders regardless of their preferred blockchain. A Better Alternative to Centralized Exchanges For years, centralized exchanges (CEXs) have dominated trading. While they offer liquidity and fast execution, they come with major drawbacks: custodial risks, withdrawal restrictions, and potential regulatory crackdowns. Linear‚Äôs PerpDEX provides an alternative that combines the efficiency of centralized trading with the security and transparency of DeFi . Unlike CEXs, where users have to trust the platform with their funds, Linear allows traders to maintain full custody of their assets while still benefiting from deep liquidity and low-latency trading. The Road Ahead is Linear Linear Finance is creating an ecosystem where deep liquidity, cross-chain trading, and innovative trading interfaces converge. As more traders look for decentralized alternatives to traditional exchanges, Linear‚Äôs PerpDEX stands out as a viable option for those who want speed, security, and flexibility. Next-generation decentralized trading platforms are slowly being paved by projects like Linear Finance with the DeFi evolution at lightning speed. By leveraging the Orderly Network liquidity infrastructure, Linear is making perpetual trading efficient, accessible, and above all decentralized. Furthermore, the emphasis on UI/UX improvements means that traders will be able to enjoy an intuitive and flowless trading experience much beyond the threshold of any conventional DEX. Traders looking for a high-performance perpetual DEX that does not compromise on security, execution speed, or user experience should keep an eye on the Linear Finance PerpDEX.

33767162,[object Object],1742651920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Breakout? RSI Signals Bullish Reversal as BTC Bull Token Gains Steam,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breakout-rsi-signals-bullish-reversal-as-btc-bull-token-gains-steam/,"Bitcoin is flashing some serious bullish signals ‚Äì and the crypto world is starting to take notice. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) breaking out of a long-term downtrend, many traders believe a new macro bull run might just be heating up. Some analysts even say Bitcoin could push past $90K and enter a ‚Äòre-accumulation‚Äô phase just shy of the six-figure mark. And while the charts are looking spicy, there‚Äôs also a new contender riding the momentum ‚Äì BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It‚Äôs a fresh project with a meme coin vibe, a presale raising almost $4M, and a clever hook into Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Add in exclusive airdrops and a growing community, and you‚Äôve got the perfect storm for some crypto fireworks. Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI Is Breaking Out ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why That Matters The RSI is one of the simplest indicators in technical analysis, but also one of the most powerful. It measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, helping traders catch reversals before they happen. Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI has just broken through a major resistance level that‚Äôs held it down since the last bull cycle. This kind of breakout usually means one thing: bulls are back in town. If Bitcoin holds above key levels, we could see a sustained uptrend ‚Äì and some believe we‚Äôre heading for the $100K zone. It‚Äôs the kind of move that could make even meme coins blush and altcoin hunters scramble for their favorite ‚Äò best crypto presale ‚Äô lists. But we‚Äôre not just talking theory here. The charts are screaming for attention, and smart traders are already drawing lines to the moon. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) Rides the Bitcoin Momentum Wave While Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI breakout is lighting up the charts, it‚Äôs also setting the stage for projects built to surf the momentum ‚Äì like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . This new crypto project is quickly gaining traction among traders looking to amplify their exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs potential rally, without needing to buy a full $BTC. Instead of competing with Bitcoin, $BTCBULL leans into it. The token is directly designed to mirror ‚Äì and reward ‚Äì Bitcoin‚Äôs upward journey. As Bitcoin hits major price milestones, $BTCBULL holders are eligible for exclusive airdrops. But there‚Äôs a catch: you only qualify if you bought the $BTCBULL token through Best Wallet and you keep it there. No shortcuts, no swaps ‚Äì just simple, loyal holding. This mechanism builds a kind of crypto loyalty club around Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. The closer BTC gets to $100K, the more the $BTCBULL community stands to gain. It‚Äôs a clever way to turn Bitcoin‚Äôs macro moves into tangible micro rewards ‚Äì and it‚Äôs catching the attention of everyone from meme coin chasers to long-term HODLers hunting the best presale of the year. With nearly $4M raised so far and growing hype from both retail and influencers, $BTCBULL is proving that riding Bitcoin‚Äôs wave might just be the smartest way to go big in the next bull cycle. A Meme Coin With Macro Vision? $BTCBULL sits at the intersection of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action and meme coin marketing. That might sound odd, but it actually makes sense. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu proved that a strong narrative and a committed community can create explosive growth. BTC Bull Token borrows that energy ‚Äì but adds a clear roadmap tied to the biggest crypto of them all. In other words, it‚Äôs not just about riding the meme wave. It‚Äôs about creating an ecosystem that‚Äôs both fun and fundamentally tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs success. Currently priced at just $0.002425, the token sits at the sweet spot where early adopters dream of buying in. But it‚Äôs not just about low entry ‚Äì it‚Äôs also backed by solid tokenomics. The total supply is capped at 6.9B tokens, with carefully allocated portions for presale, liquidity, ecosystem rewards, and marketing to keep the project fueled for the long haul. For those browsing the ‚Äò best altcoins to buy now ‚Äô or looking for the next big crypto before it hits major exchanges, $BTCBULL is quickly rising on radar screens. It‚Äôs using meme coin energy as a launchpad‚Äîbut pairing it with a roadmap that includes CEX listings, staking features, and community-driven utility. $BTCBULL might love the bull emoji, but behind the memes is a serious shot at growth ‚Äì especially for those who believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs path toward six figures. All Eyes on the Bulls With Bitcoin flashing bullish indicators left and right ‚Äì from RSI breakouts to funnel patterns ‚Äì it‚Äôs clear that the market mood is shifting. Whether we see $90K next month or next quarter, the momentum is building. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the first meme-inspired projects to harness this energy in a structured way. It‚Äôs low-priced, well-funded, and rewarding loyalty in a unique format. For investors watching both charts and presales, this one might be worth a closer look.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $16.48. By 2031, FIL may reach $53.54. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity‚Äôs most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network‚Äôs native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The price is currently trading around $2.97, hovering near the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential shift from bearish to neutral momentum. The upper Bollinger Band around $3.23 now acts as immediate resistance. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is gradually trending toward positive territory, while the MACD and signal lines are close to a bullish crossover. This convergence indicates weakening bearish momentum. If buying volume increases and a breakout above $3.23 occurs, FIL may rally toward $3.50. However, failure to hold $2.65 may resume downside pressure. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FIL/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Filecoin (FIL) exhibits modest bullish momentum, consolidating near $2.97 and trading along the upper Bollinger Band, hinting at short-term upward pressure. The MACD line is gradually approaching a bullish crossover with the signal line, though still below the zero mark, suggesting a cautious bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power indicator reads 0.77, showing increased buyer dominance in recent sessions. If the current momentum holds, FIL could challenge the $3.09 resistance. However, a rejection at that level may push prices back toward the middle Bollinger Band support near $2.87. Volatility remains contained.

On the daily chart, price action hovers near the mid-Bollinger Band, with the MACD nearing a bullish crossover, hinting at a potential trend reversal. The RSI is neutral, indicating room for upward movement without entering overbought territory. On the 4-hour chart, FIL maintains steady consolidation above $2.95 with the Balance of Power favoring buyers. The MACD histogram is slightly positive, reinforcing short-term bullish sentiment. If momentum strengthens, FIL could test resistance around $3.23. However, failure to sustain buying interest may pull prices back toward $2.87. Is Filecoin a good investment?

Sonic ( S ) price was trading at 50 cents on Saturday, down by about 50% from its all-time high. This drop has led to a big drop in its market cap from $2.8 billion in February to 1.48 billion. Sonic‚Äôs crash occurred even as its DeFi ecosystem continued to do well. DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked in its ecosystem jumped to a record high of $860 million this week. The TVL jumped to 1.7 billion in Sonic terms. Notably, unlike other chains, this Sonic growth is being driven by numerous decentralized applications. Silo Finance has $202 million in assets, while AAVE V3 has accumulated over $184 million a month after launch. Avalon Labs, Shadow Exchange, and SwapX are the other top players in the Sonic ecosystem, while Beets and Veda are the largest liquid staking platforms.

Sonic price analysis S price chart | Source: crypto.news While Sonic has strong fundamentals, technicals suggest that it may soon have a breakdown. The token has formed a rising wedge pattern, which is characterized by rising and converging trendlines. This pattern often leads to a strong breakdown. Sonic token has also formed a head and shoulders pattern whose neckline is at $0.3795. Therefore, there is a risk that the price will drop in the coming days. If this happens, it will likely drop to the key support at $0.3795, down by 25% from the current level.
