During the interview, he outlined an ambitious target for the company’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple aims to position RLUSD among the top stablecoins by the end of 2025, reflecting confidence in both the asset and the broader market’s expansion. BREAKING: RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: „THE GOAL IS BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR RLUSD, RIPPLE STABLECOIN, TO BE ONE OF THE TOP FIVE IN THE MARKET BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I THINK THE WHOLE MARKET IS GONNA GROW DRAMATICALLY THIS YEAR!“ #XRP pic.twitter.com/NliNtSZYy4 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) March 20, 2025 Ripple’s Goal for 2025 In the interview, Garlinghouse highlighted that RLUSD, which was launched at the end of last year , is already exceeding Ripple’s internal forecasts. While acknowledging that Ripple’s stablecoin is still in its early stages, he emphasized its strong trajectory. Interestingly, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple’s goal for 2025 is to make RLUSD one of the top five stablecoins in the market by the end of the year. He also noted that the stablecoin sector, currently valued at around $230 billion, could grow tenfold over the next five years, and the company plans to dominate that market with its stablecoin. Market Growth and Competition Stablecoins remain a critical component of the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. The dominant players, USDT and USDC, continue to lead, but Garlinghouse believes the RLUSD will do well in the market. RLUSD is currently ranked #9 by 24-hour trading volume, and Ripple’s deep integration into global payment systems and established relationships with financial institutions may provide it with a competitive edge as the market grows. Expanding RLUSD’s Reach Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple is actively working to increase RLUSD’s market presence. The company recently took a significant step forward by integrating its systems with RWA.xyz , allowing aggregation of the stablecoin’s data alongside other tokenized assets. Garlinghouse mentioned that new exchange listings for RLUSD continue to go live, helping drive adoption. “Anytime you do something new, it takes a minute for the ripple effect to play out,” he said, referring to the stablecoin’s growing impact. If the company leverages its partnerships and connections on its existing network, it may have a strong chance of reaching its goal by year-end and making RLUSD a household name. A Bullish Outlook for Stablecoins Garlinghouse’s bullish stance on stablecoins shows the growing importance of this sector within the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory clarity improves in the U.S. and global adoption increases, stablecoins will play an even larger role in digital finance. Whether RLUSD can break into the top five remains to be seen, but its early success suggests that Ripple is making significant strides in the competitive stablecoin market.

The analysis report highlights technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which failed to reach past extremes, raising concerns about Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Bitcoin Indicators Fall Short Of Historical Peaks Bitcoin has historically exhibited strong indicator readings during major cycle tops, reflecting extreme market engagement and enthusiasm. However, in this bull cycle, the pioneer cryptocurrency’s RSI reading has failed to reach historical peaks despite Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days Tony Severino, a crypto market technician on X (formerly Twitter), has Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days a detailed analysis of Bitcoin, challenging the assumption that the cryptocurrency must reach the same overbought RSI levels as in previous cycles to confirm its market peak. The key argument here is that lower highs on oscillators like the RSI, combined with higher highs in Bitcoin’s price, can be a bearish signal, suggesting waning strength in the market. Severino shared an example comparing Bitcoin’s current bull cycle to past cycles. In the previous bull market, Bitcoin’s monthly RSI reached above 90, but its current cycle has not. The analyst posed a question about whether this inability to reach past extremes means that Bitcoin hasn’t reached a market top or simply lacked the same momentum to push its RSI to the highest level. The analyst has warned that believing that Bitcoin must reach past extremes on indicators before hitting a price peak is a dangerous way of thinking. Historical patterns do not always repeat in the same way, and relying too much on past indicator peaks could cause traders to miss warning signs of a top or underestimate the possibility of a bear market. Severino also pointed to historical data from the S&P 500 in the 1950s and 1960s, where similar RSI failure preceded a long market meltdown. During these times, cyclical peaks hit RSI readings of 77 or higher, but in 1969, the RSI failed to reach those highs, signaling underlying weakness. This market downturn ultimately led to the first lower low in over 20 years. While this historical behavior of the S&P 500 does not mean that Bitcoin is destined for a lower high, it does suggest that the cryptocurrency does not need to reach extreme RSI levels to confirm a cycle top and a subsequent bear market. Analyst Says BTC Has Hit Its Market Top In his analysis Severino confirmed that Bitcoin has already hit its market top for this bull cycle. Following his detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s RSI levels, a community member asked if Severino believes that Bitcoin reached a market top when its price surged above $109,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash From $91,000, Why It’s Far From Over The analyst responded positively, stating that current market data indicates that the cryptocurrency hit its highest price point for this bull cycle after Donald Trump’s US Inauguration Day. At the time, Bitcoin soared past $109,000, setting a new ATH and surpassing previous records.

42118601,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142350,1742594450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breaking: Fidelity’s Groundbreaking Solana ETF Filing Ignites Crypto Investment Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fidelity-solana-etf-registration/,"Get ready for a potential shake-up in the crypto investment world! News just dropped that Fidelity Investments, a financial behemoth, has officially registered a “Fidelity Solana Fund” as a statutory trust in Delaware. This exciting development, first highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has sent ripples of anticipation through the cryptocurrency community. Could this be the precursor to a spot Solana ETF ? Let’s dive into what this registration means and why it could be a game-changer for both Solana and the broader crypto market. Fidelity Solana Fund Registration: What’s the Buzz About? So, what exactly happened? Fidelity, a name synonymous with traditional finance and now increasingly embracing the digital asset space, has taken a significant step by registering a fund specifically tied to Solana. According to public records in Delaware, the “Fidelity Solana Fund” is now officially on the books. This isn’t just another registration; it’s a clear signal of intent. But what kind of intent? Let’s break it down: Registration as a Statutory Trust: This legal structure is often used for ETFs. Think about it – ETFs need a trust to hold the underlying assets. Registering as a statutory trust is a common and crucial step in the ETF creation process. “Fidelity Solana Fund” Name: The name itself is incredibly telling. It’s not just a generic crypto fund; it’s explicitly linked to Solana. This specificity suggests a focused approach on providing investment exposure to SOL. Timing and Market Context: This news comes at a time when the crypto market is showing signs of renewed vigor, and there’s increasing demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and demonstrated the appetite for such offerings. While registration doesn’t guarantee the launch of a spot Solana ETF , it’s a very strong indication that Fidelity is seriously considering this move. It’s like laying the foundation for a house – you wouldn’t go through the trouble unless you planned to build something significant. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Monumental Leap for Crypto ETFs Let’s zoom out and understand why a potential spot Solana ETF is such a big deal, especially in the context of the evolving Crypto ETF landscape. We’ve already seen the groundbreaking approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was a monumental victory, opening the doors for billions of dollars of institutional and retail investment to flow into Bitcoin through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. Now, Solana could be next in line, and here’s why that’s significant: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, the market is increasingly recognizing the potential of other cryptocurrencies like Solana. A spot Solana ETF would offer investors diversification within their crypto portfolio, moving beyond just Bitcoin exposure. Legitimizing Altcoins: The approval of a spot Solana ETF would further legitimize altcoins as a viable asset class. It signals to traditional investors that cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin are gaining institutional acceptance and regulatory consideration. Broader Market Access to Solana: Currently, investing directly in Solana requires navigating crypto exchanges, wallets, and understanding blockchain technology. A spot ETF removes these barriers, making Solana accessible to anyone with a brokerage account. This includes a vast pool of retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to directly engage with crypto. Institutional Interest in Solana: Fidelity’s move underscores growing institutional interest in Solana. Large financial players are recognizing Solana’s technology, ecosystem, and potential for future growth. An ETF would be a way for institutions to gain exposure to Solana in a regulated and compliant manner. The difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF is crucial here. A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Solana. This is generally preferred by investors as it more accurately reflects the price movements of the cryptocurrency. Futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts, which can introduce complexities and tracking errors. The demand is clearly for spot crypto ETFs, and Fidelity seems to be listening. Unlocking Solana Investment: The Compelling Benefits of a Fidelity Solana ETF Imagine the doors that a Fidelity Solana Fund , potentially structured as a spot ETF, could open for investors. The benefits are numerous and compelling, spanning accessibility, legitimacy, and investment potential: Benefit Description Simplified Investment Access Investing in Solana becomes as easy as buying shares of a stock through a brokerage account. No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Increased Liquidity ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity. This makes it easier for investors to buy and sell Solana exposure at market prices. Enhanced Security and Custody Fidelity, a regulated financial institution, would handle the custody and security of the underlying Solana, mitigating risks associated with self-custody or exchange custody. Tax Advantages (Potentially) Depending on jurisdiction, investing through an ETF might offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption Catalyst A Solana ETF from a reputable firm like Fidelity could further encourage institutional adoption of Solana and other cryptocurrencies. Price Appreciation Potential Increased demand for Solana through an ETF could potentially drive up its price, benefiting early investors and the Solana ecosystem as a whole. For retail investors who have been curious about Solana but intimidated by the technicalities of crypto, a Solana ETF could be the perfect on-ramp. For institutional investors, it provides a regulated and compliant way to allocate capital to a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Considerations for a Spot Solana ETF While the registration of the “Fidelity Solana Fund” is undeniably exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to a spot Solana ETF isn’t without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles, market volatility, and competition are all factors that need to be considered: SEC Approval: The biggest hurdle is, of course, obtaining approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, their stance on other cryptocurrencies remains to be fully seen. The SEC will need to be convinced that the Solana market is mature enough and resistant to manipulation for a spot ETF to be approved. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. This volatility could make a spot Crypto ETF a riskier investment compared to traditional ETFs. However, it also presents opportunities for high returns. Regulatory Landscape Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and viability of crypto ETFs. Competition: If Fidelity launches a Solana ETF, it’s likely to face competition from other asset managers who may also be eyeing the Solana ETF space. This competition could be beneficial for investors in the long run, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative products. Solana Network Risks: While Solana is a technologically advanced blockchain, it has faced challenges in the past, including network outages. Potential investors need to be aware of these risks associated with the underlying technology. Despite these challenges, the fact that Fidelity is moving forward with registration suggests a degree of optimism that these hurdles can be overcome. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has undoubtedly provided a blueprint and increased confidence in the possibility of spot altcoin ETFs. Solana’s Bright Future and the Expanding Horizons of Crypto Investment Why Solana? Why is Fidelity potentially betting on a Solana ETF ? The answer lies in Solana’s compelling technology and vibrant ecosystem. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs. It has attracted a thriving community of developers and users, building a diverse range of applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more. Here’s a quick look at Solana’s strengths: High Speed and Scalability: Solana is designed to handle a high volume of transactions at incredibly fast speeds, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time processing. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some other blockchains, Solana’s transaction fees are remarkably low, making it attractive for users and developers. Growing Ecosystem: Solana’s ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with a growing number of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other innovative projects being built on the network. Strong Community Support: Solana has a passionate and active community that is constantly contributing to its growth and development. A spot Solana ETF could be a significant catalyst for further growth and adoption of Solana. It would bring increased capital into the Solana ecosystem, potentially fueling innovation and development. More broadly, it signals the continued maturation of the crypto investment landscape. We are moving beyond the early days of crypto being a niche asset class to a point where mainstream financial institutions are offering regulated investment products linked to a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Solana and Crypto ETFs? Fidelity’s registration of the “Fidelity Solana Fund” is more than just a procedural step; it’s a powerful statement about the future of Solana and the evolution of Crypto ETFs . While the launch of a spot Solana ETF is not yet guaranteed, this move significantly increases the likelihood and signals a growing confidence in Solana’s potential. For investors, it presents an exciting prospect – the potential to access Solana investment through a familiar, regulated, and convenient ETF structure. Keep your eyes peeled – this story is just beginning, and it could mark the start of a new chapter in crypto investment history.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase says its listing decentralized roll-up protocol AltLayer ( ALT ), decentralized finance network Pendle ( PENDLE ), and gamified learning platform Layer3 ( L3 ) to its listing roadmap. The crypto exchange’s listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to it means Coinbase is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the additions sprung the trio of assets to life as AltLayer – a protocol that uses restaked rollups to enhance scalability – went from a low of $0.0354 on March 20th to a peak of $0.0395 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.0376 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Pendle, a project that enables the trading and tokenization of yields, went from a price of $2.41 to a peak of $2.59 during the same time frame. However, the digital asset also retraced and is trading for $2.47 at time of writing, a gain of 1.2% on the day. Layer3, a web3 education program that teaches users through interaction and games, saw the biggest gains as it went from a low of $0.0577 on March 20th to a peak of $0.103 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is moving for $0.0820, a gain of 38.6% during the last day.

42119102,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697638,1742594747,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42119102.jpeg,Tether taps Big Four firm for audit after years of infamous vagueness,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tether-taps-big-four-firm-for-audit-after-years-of-infamous-vagueness/,"Tether is finally doing the thing it kept saying it would do for years—getting a real audit. CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the company is “engaging with a Big Four accounting firm,” though he didn’t say which one or when the audit would happen. He said it’s now “feasible” thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly policies. “It’s our top priority,” Ardoino said. He claims the regulatory environment has changed completely, and that Trump’s crypto push makes it easier. Tether has been promising transparency forever, but so far, it only puts out quarterly attestations, not full audits. Tether seeks Trump-era support to push audit forward Ardoino didn’t say if it’s PwC, EY, KPMG, or Deloitte—but said they’re talking to one of them. He pointed to Trump’s stance as a green light. “If the President of the United States says this is top priority for the U.S., Big Four auditing firms will have to listen,” he said. This is all part of Tether’s latest push to prove it actually backs the $140 billion worth of stablecoins it has issued. It says every coin is supported by dollar-denominated assets. The goal now is to finally show the math. The firm recently hired Simon McWilliams as CFO to lead the audit effort. This isn’t coming out of nowhere. Trump has signed an executive order for a strategic crypto reserve and is promising new rules for digital assets. Ardoino took a shot at U.S. regulators under Biden, calling their actions “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a phrase the crypto crowd uses to describe the government’s campaign to cut off crypto from the banking system. Meanwhile, Tether keeps stacking U.S. debt. In 2024, it bought more than $33.1 billion in Treasury bills, making it the seventh biggest buyer of U.S. government debt. As of December 31, it held over $94 billion in Treasurys and more than $108 million in bank deposits, based on numbers from BDO Italia. According to Ardoino, 99% of those Treasury bills are held with Cantor Fitzgerald. And now that former Cantor CEO Howard Lutnick is Trump’s commerce secretary, it all sounds like one big reunion. Tether gets bigger than BlackRock, keeps dodging rules Tether has $120 billion in assets. Most of it is in U.S. Treasurys. The rest is a mix of bitcoin and gold. It made $6.2 billion in profit last year, beating BlackRock by $700 million. Ardoino bragged that with less than 100 employees, the company makes more money per person than anyone. But it’s not all glory. According to a Wall Street Journal report , this unregulated coin is getting used to get around U.S. sanctions. Russian oligarchs, Venezuelan oil firms, and even terror groups like Hamas have used Tether to move money. “We need a regulatory framework that doesn’t allow offshore dollar-backed stablecoin providers to play by a different set of rules,” said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo in his testimony to Congress. He called out Tether by name. The Journal dug through blockchain data, court records, and private messages. They found Venezuelan oil payments made in Tether, sanctioned groups laundering money, and a huge black market. Tether says it freezes wallets tied to criminals. Ardoino claimed, “We have a proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities.” That sounds nice, but ChainArgos says that from 2018 to June 2024, Tether blacklisted 2,713 wallets holding $153 billion. Only $1.4 billion was frozen. The rest moved too fast to catch. The company says it can track everything on public blockchains and even destroy tokens held in wallets if needed. But it’s like a never-ending Whac-A-Mole game. Tether turns up everywhere—war zones, scams, economies in collapse Back in 2014, Tether started with a weird founding team. One of them, Giancarlo Devasini, was a plastic surgeon. Another was William Quigley, who called the idea of profiting from billions in backing “a fantasy.” Quigley and the others left early. Devasini stayed and still runs the company today. He lives in a luxury villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Ardoino has become the face of it all. Tether really took off during the 2020–2021 bull run. Its market cap went from $4 billion to $80 billion fast. Traders loved it for moving in and out of bets without touching banks. Now, it’s used in all kinds of places regular dollars can’t go. In Iran, a platform called TetherLand lets people swap their rials for Tether. In Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is out of control, people use Tether to save money and make everyday purchases. Over 300 million people use Tether, according to Ardoino. But criminals use it too. Southeast Asian money launderers love Tether, according to a 2024 UN report. The tokens bounce from one wallet to another so fast it’s hard to trace them. That same report said Tether is a “preferred choice” for bad actors in the region. The structure is simple. Direct customers wire dollars to Tether Holdings, and the company issues tokens backed by U.S. Treasurys. But once those tokens hit the open market, anything can happen. Exchanges and brokerages all over the world move the coins, and nobody watches the secondary market. In Venezuela, PdVSA, the state oil company, started demanding oil payments in Tether in 2020. Buyers were told to send coins to specific wallets. Others just swapped suitcases of cash for Tether, then spent it on prepaid crypto cards. That setup didn’t just help Maduro’s government dodge sanctions—it fueled corruption. Middlemen kept the money. The scandal blew up so badly that it forced the oil minister to step down. “This cryptocurrency’s use only has served to perpetuate gigantic levels of corruption,” said former oil minister Rafael Ramírez. Even so, for regular Venezuelans, Tether became survival. Inflation hit 2 million percent. Currency controls blocked overseas payments. A guy named Guillermo Goncalvez started a platform called El Dorado that connects users for peer-to-peer Tether trading. The platform has over 150,000 users. “USDT is the digital dollar for all Venezuelans,” he said. In Russia, Tether is everywhere. A report from a Russian research group found that importers use it to swap rubles for foreign currencies. Rosbank, a major lender, helps clients send Tether to suppliers. A fixer named Ekaterina Zhdanova arranged deals worth hundreds of millions in Tether, according to Telegram chats and blockchain data. She’s from a Siberian town but built a luxury business helping rich Russians dodge sanctions. She handled so much cash they needed planes to move it. One client wanted to buy $10 million in Tether per month for a total of $300 million. The money was going to be handed over in Turkey or the UAE. “They will use planes to pick up the cash,” she said. Zhdanova was later sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. French cops arrested her at an airport as part of a separate money laundering case. She’s still in custody. Now, Tether is investing in businesses that use its token for daily payments. More usage means more token issuance. More issuance means more dollars to manage. In Tbilisi, Georgia, shops show the Tether logo outside. ATMs let people buy the coin with cash. It’s become the go-to currency when real dollars are blocked. Tether has become the shadow dollar—moving money anywhere, fast, without much oversight. And now it wants a Big Four audit. Maybe. Eventually. If the vibes are right.

Korea to Sanction Crypto Exchanges The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission said these overseas crypto trading platforms are operating illegally in the country because they have failed to report as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act. The Special Financial Transactions Act states that entities engaging in crypto trading, storage, and management in South Korea must formally report their activities to the FIU. Failure to do so could attract criminal punishment and administrative sanctions because the firms will be considered illegal businesses. In addition, these exchanges have been operating Korean-language websites without providing marketing and customer support for South Korean investors. As a result, the FIU is now investigating their activities, evaluating appropriate procedures with relevant organizations, and strongly considering measures like blocking site access. “We are currently reviewing blocking access to unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year,” stated an FIU official. A Continuous Crackdown on Crypto Platforms This is not the first time financial authorities in South Korea have made moves to sanction or block investor access to non-compliant crypto exchanges. In September 2021, the FIU asked more than 60 exchanges that could not meet up with the local anti-money laundering (AML) rules and registration requirements to shut down their services and exit the country. At the time, only four trading platforms, including Upbit, Bithumb , Coinone, and Korbit, were fully operational, while about 28 others, which obtained security certificates, could offer certain services without won settlements. Furthermore, in 2022, the FIU asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission to block access to 16 overseas exchanges that failed to report their operations as VASPs. The regulatory agency also joined forces with local card companies to block crypto purchases and payment services made from these platforms. Earlier this year, the FIU revealed there are only 31 registered crypto firms in South Korea, down 26% from 42 in 2024. With the latest crackdown, that number is bound to shrink even further.

This prediction aligns with growing industry speculation, including comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has suggested that XRP ETFs could launch in the second half of 2025 . The prediction market’s surge in confidence follows multiple ETF filings, and the possibility of approval has generated significant anticipation within the crypto community, with many seeing it as a pivotal moment for XRP’s institutional adoption. WOW! POLYMARKET USERS PREDICT AN 83 PERCENT CHANCE THAT AN #XRP ETF WILL BE APPROVED IN 2025! XRP ETF IN 2025! pic.twitter.com/p5F6lHOT8f — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) March 20, 2025 Market Optimism and Institutional Interest The increasing probability of an XRP ETF approval reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency market. Institutional interest in digital assets has grown substantially, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in 2024. This momentum has led investors to speculate that regulators may soon greenlight additional crypto ETFs, including those tied to XRP. 11 notable firms including Bitwise and Franklin Templeton , have applied for XRP ETFs, and if approved, they would provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible vehicle to gain exposure to the digital asset. This could result in increased liquidity, heightened mainstream adoption, and further legitimization of XRP within the financial sector. One observer noted that an ETF approval could “bring massive institutional inflows and solidify XRP’s place in the market.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Predictions The crypto community has reacted enthusiastically to the Polymarket prediction, with many believing approval is inevitable. One commenter expressed excitement for the ETFs, predicting that these could be approved by June or July. The growing number of filings suggests asset managers see potential in an XRP-based fund. Now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple, we could see more applications shortly. Outlook for 2025 The current sentiment surrounding an XRP ETF reflects broader expectations for regulatory advancements in the crypto space. As the year progresses, attention will be on the SEC’s approach to approving additional crypto-based financial products. The regulator has already acknowledged most of these filings. While this does not guarantee approval, it is a positive step that shows the SEC’s willingness to engage with the crypto industry and its offerings to consumers. With institutional demand rising and multiple filings already submitted, the approval of XRP ETF in 2025 appears increasingly likely. Polymarket’s prediction shows that the community is eager to see these products approved. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Calls for stablecoin regulation seek to establish uniform standards, easing compliance and reducing market uncertainty. These shifts may foster a clearer environment that encourages institutional participation and deeper market engagement. The evolving U.S. framework could set international benchmarks, prompting a broader rethinking of digital asset rules. Regulatory developments in cryptocurrency intensified this week, marked by two major U.S. events: the SEC ending its prominent legal dispute with Ripple over XRP, and President Donald Trump calling for clear stablecoin regulation . Additionally, the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash. Meanwhile, on the international stage, Germany’s BaFin intensified enforcement by cracking down on Ethena’s USDe token, while Pakistan actively considers legalizing cryptocurrency to stimulate economic growth. These events highlight the evolving global approach as nations seek clearer crypto regulation news, balancing innovation with oversight. SEC Ends Ripple Case, Shaping Crypto Regulation News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended its extended legal proceedings against Ripple, concluding the contentious debate over whether XRP qualifies as a security. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the resolution on X, emphasizing that XRP was ultimately not classified as a security. This is it – the moment we’ve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright. Let's build. pic.twitter.com/7WsD0C92Cm — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 19, 2025 Ripple maintained that XRP should not be regulated as a security, consistently challenging the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions, which it claimed negatively impacted XRP investors. Legal experts view the case’s resolution as influential, potentially changing regulatory attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Legal expert Seth Goertz, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP and former federal prosecutor, indicated that the case’s outcome is key in establishing legal clarity for the crypto industry, particularly in defining when digital assets fall under securities regulations. Following the announcement, XRP experienced a sharp price increase, moving up to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and surpassing major stablecoins like Tether. This resolution is expected to encourage regulatory clarity and bolster investor confidence, especially among digital asset exchanges that previously operated under uncertain legal conditions. Daniel Stabile, from Winston & Strawn LLP, noted that the SEC’s decision to end the case may signal a broader shift toward allowing legislative and regulatory processes, rather than litigation, to set clear guidelines for crypto markets. As Ripple celebrates its legal win, another major political figure is stepping into the debate over cryptocurrency regulation . Trump Pushes for Stablecoin Regulation and U.S. Crypto Dominance In a virtual speech at the Digital Assets Summit in New York, Donald Trump urged Congress to pass stablecoin regulations with “simple, common-sense rules.” Today President Trump spoke at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit — becoming the first sitting president in history to address a crypto conference. @blockworksDAS @POTUS pic.twitter.com/8aijMb1VcG — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 21, 2025 He also vowed to position the U.S. as a leading player in global cryptocurrency markets. This push for stablecoin regulation matches industry demands for clearer rules, balancing innovation and financial stability. If implemented, such legislation could clarify how stablecoins operate within the U.S. financial system, potentially attracting more institutional investors to the sector. Treasury Lifts Tornado Cash Sanctions, but Cautions Remain In a major reversal, the U.S. Treasury removed sanctions on Tornado Cash , the Ethereum-based mixer previously blacklisted for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions. You might also like US Treasury Removes Sanctions on Ethereum Mixer Tornado Cash This decision follows a reassessment of how financial sanctions apply to decentralized platforms, particularly as the crypto industry evolves. While the move marks a shift in the Treasury’s approach, officials stressed that they remain committed to combating financial crime. The agency highlights ongoing concerns over cyber threats, particularly state-sponsored hacking and money laundering linked to North Korea. U.S. residents and businesses were advised to be cautious when engaging with digital asset services that could be exploited for illicit purposes. The decision to lift sanctions suggests regulators may be moving toward a more nuanced approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) , recognizing both its risks and its potential. While the U.S. eases some crypto sanctions, European regulators are tightening oversight. Germany’s BaFin Cracks Down on Ethena’s USDe Token In Europe, Germany’s financial regulator BaFin took action against Ethena GmbH, freezing its asset reserves over concerns about the approval process for its USDe token. BaFin suspects that Ethena GmbH is offering unapproved securities, including USDe and sUSDe tokens, without proper authorization under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This move shows the increasing regulatory pressure in the European Union as authorities enforce the recently implemented MiCA framework. BaFin’s crackdown on Ethena’s USDe token highlights compliance challenges. Other crypto firms may also need to reassess their strategies to comply with MiCA. Not all countries share Europe’s caution—Pakistan is exploring crypto adoption as a growth strategy. Pakistan Considers Legalizing Crypto to Boost Economic Growth While some countries tighten restrictions, others are moving toward crypto adoption. Pakistan is exploring the legalization of cryptocurrency trading in an effort to attract international investment and stimulate economic growth. JUST IN: Pakistan to legalize cryptocurrency. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 20, 2025 Bilal bin Saqib, chief advisor to Pakistan’s finance minister for digital assets, emphasized that the country wants to leverage its young, tech-savvy workforce to become a Web3 hub. With 60% of its population under the age of 30, Pakistan sees crypto as an opportunity for financial inclusion and technological advancement. If Pakistan successfully establishes a regulatory framework for crypto, it could position itself as a key player in the digital asset space, particularly in South Asia. However, uncertainty persists about how the government will balance oversight and innovation. The Future of Crypto Regulation: A Global Balancing Act This week’s developments highlight the complex and often contradictory nature of global crypto regulation news. The U.S. is showing signs of a more structured regulatory framework, while Europe is tightening enforcement. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Pakistan are looking to embrace crypto as a means of economic growth. As regulatory approaches evolve, governments worldwide recognize crypto’s lasting role in the financial sector. The challenge now is finding the right balance between oversight, innovation, and financial security. Whether through stablecoin regulations, sanctions revisions, or new frameworks for token approvals, the next few months could shape the future of crypto for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will the SEC’s withdrawal affect crypto enforcement? The SEC’s retreat signals a shift from heavy litigation to clear, consistent rules. This move aims to lower enforcement burdens and create a stable regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty for crypto operators. What benefits can clear stablecoin regulations offer? Defining stablecoin rules can standardize market practices and lower compliance costs. Clear guidelines boost investor confidence and spur innovation by cutting legal ambiguities that hinder institutional investment. How might these changes influence global crypto standards? U.S. policy shifts may set international benchmarks, encouraging other nations to streamline their frameworks. A unified approach can boost cross-border investments and harmonize digital asset practices globally. What impact could clearer crypto rules have on institutional investment? Clearer rules reduce legal risks and operational uncertainty, making the market more attractive to institutions. Predictable oversight can spur long-term investments and deepen overall market engagement. What further changes can we expect in the crypto regulatory landscape? We can expect incremental updates as regulators refine their approach through ongoing industry dialogue. Future measures will likely target major market players and clarify compliance standards for digital assets.

Various accounts on X, formerly Twitter, shared the news after misunderstanding a previous post by the TON Foundation X account. The post created a false impression that sent the TON token surging by about 8% before it stabilized. The news has now been debunked by the TON official X page, which provided clarification earlier today. pic.twitter.com/FKVPbwgb9c — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) March 21, 2025 TON clears the air According to TON’s X page, the reports from some news outlets claiming the TON Foundation “raised” $400 million is untrue. Contrary to reports from some news outlets, TON Foundation has not ""raised"" $400 million. Instead, the Foundation has disclosed that over $400 million in Toncoin is held by some of the world’s most forward-thinking US-based venture capital firms. — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) March 21, 2025 “Instead, the Foundation has disclosed that over $400 million in Toncoin is held by some of the world’s most forward-thinking US-based venture capital firms,” the statement read. The fact that Toncoin is being held in massive amounts by forward-thinking VC firms in the US is in itself a flex for the project, reflecting investor confidence in the ecosystem. However, it’s not the same as direct fundraising. In the comment section of TON’s clarification post, many users praised the team for ending the confusion, while others reaffirmed their bullish sentiments, making it clear the little misunderstanding has not changed how they feel about Toncoin. Of course, there were also some who wanted to know who planted the rumor in the first place and also those who suspected foul play, as the clarification came about a day after the news had spread and caused a brief price surge for the TON token. One user implied the rumor was planted to “hype” things up, while another implied that they waited for some time to retract the rumor so the token could pump. Whether this is true or not is up for speculation, but it is true that the TON token pumped almost 8% as a result of the VC investment rumors. At the time of this writing, the confusion has cleared up, and TON’s price is now worth $3.61, having fallen by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The fundraising confusion came days after Pavel Durov left France The confusion regarding TON receiving millions in funding from VCs comes days after Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the social messaging app Telegram, was allowed to fly home to Dubai. Telegram’s founder Pavel Durov shared a picture he claims is the new photo on his passport. Source: Pavel Durov (X/Twitter) The privilege does not mean he is free of all charges as the French authorities continue their unprecedented case against him. Durov was arrested in August after he was accused of not doing enough to properly moderate his app to curb criminality, even though Telegram has previously denied having insufficient moderation. The tech billionaire has denied not cooperating with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual abuse content and fraud. The case has attracted a lot of attention as it marks the first time a tech leader has been arrested for the lawlessness taking place on their platform. In a post on his Telegram channel, Durov expressed happiness to finally be home, but clarified that the “process is ongoing.” He also thanked the French judges for letting him go home and praised his lawyers for their “relentless efforts in demonstrating that, when it comes to moderation, cooperation, and fighting crime, for years Telegram not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.” His arrest happened in August 2024 as he arrived in Paris on his private jet, and French judges initially banned him from leaving France. As for the conditions of his release, all we have to go on is what the office of the Paris prosecutor told the BBC on Monday, which is that “the obligations of judicial supervision” had been suspended between 15 March and 7 April. Durov, who was born in Russia, resides in Dubai. He also has residences in France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis. Since his arrest, Telegram has significantly altered the way it operates to deal with allegations that have dubbed it a portable version of the dark web. It has joined the Internet Watch Foundation program, which aims to help find, remove and report child sexual abuse material being shared online. According to an announcement from the app, it will also disclose the IP addresses/phone numbers of those who violate its rules and hand them over to police in response to valid legal requests. Telegram has also published transparency reports about how much content is taken down – a standard industry practice it previously refused to comply with. A Telegram spokesperson has said the company now actively moderates its platform to get rid of harmful content each day.

The regulator’s intervention is seen not merely as a punitive measure but as a wake-up call to reassess operational resilience in the evolving digital asset landscape. Market observers believe that such rigorous enforcement might restore investor confidence and encourage clearer standards across synthetic token markets. BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, banned all public sales of Ethena GmbH’s USDe token this week, citing flaws in the approval process and violations of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR). The regulator outlined several immediate actions against Ethena GmbH to enforce the ban. According to BaFin, the synthetic dollar token had been offered as an unregistered security in Germany, prompting the authority to restrict its operations without delay. BaFin Orders Asset Freeze and Website Shutdown for USDe Token In its announcement , BaFin instructed Ethena GmbH to freeze the reserve assets backing the USDe token and halt all new customer registrations. The company must also shut down its website, and a special representative has been appointed to oversee compliance with these directives. “The BaFin also has reasonable grounds to suspect that Ethena GmbH in Germany sells securities in the form of sUSDe tokens from Ethena OpCo. Ltd. without the required prospectus,” the regulator said. Breaking: The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority announced that it had found serious flaws in Ethena GmbH's approval process for USDe tokens and ordered immediate enforcement measures to prohibit Ethena GmbH from further offering its USDe tokens to the public and… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 21, 2025 “The USDe and sUSDe tokens are interconnected in such a way that investors can receive a sUSDe token in exchange for a USDe token,” it added. Despite the prohibition on primary sales and issuance, secondary market trading of USDe remains unaffected by the ban. BaFin identified “serious deficiencies” in Ethena GmbH’s approval process, including noncompliance with MiCAR’s capital and asset reserve requirements. Ethena GmbH had been operating under a transitional provision that allows issuers of asset-referenced tokens to continue business while awaiting regulatory approval. The company applied for authorization on July 29, 2024, a day before the deadline, and has been issuing USDe in Germany since June 28, 2024. Currently, approximately 5.4 billion USDe tokens are in circulation, with a substantial portion issued outside Germany before MiCAR took effect. To safeguard customer interests, BaFin has ordered the company’s asset reserves to block and restrict the authority of its managing directors over those funds. Holders of USDe tokens cannot redeem them directly with Ethena GmbH, though trading on secondary markets continues as normal. BaFin’s statement also raised concerns about the company issuing sUSDe tokens, suggesting they could constitute unregistered securities. The tokens are linked to USDe, allowing investors to exchange them while receiving additional returns. The regulator is now considering further enforcement actions, which could include a complete ban on the public offering of these securities. BaFin is overseeing the authorization process in collaboration with the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Further details will be provided upon completion of the licensing process. Ethena Defends USDe Token Amid BaFin Ban Following BaFin’s ban on USDe in Germany, Ethena Labs reassured users that redemptions remain unaffected through its British Virgin Islands-based entity, Ethena BVI Limited. The company, addressing the situation on X, stated that while its German subsidiary’s MiCAR application was denied, USDe remains fully backed. “We are disappointed by this decision but will continue evaluating alternative regulatory frameworks,” Ethena wrote. Since its inception, Ethena has been exploring various options and jurisdictions when it comes to regulatory frameworks globally that would be conducive to our business, and as a result we have multiple entities within our structure facilitating minting and redemption. A MiCAR… — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) March 21, 2025 The firm also dismissed claims that its assets were frozen, clarifying that all funds remain accessible. It plans to update its terms in the coming week to reflect the regulatory developments. Ethena’s regulatory challenges come as institutional interest grows. Recent investments include a $20 million backing from MEXC and a 500,000 ENA token purchase by World Liberty Financial. BaFin Tightens Oversight on Synthetic Assets Across Europe BaFin’s decision reflects the regulator’s cautious approach towards crypto assets operating within Germany’s jurisdiction. Its ban on Ethena’s USDe token highlights the tightening regulatory grip on stablecoins and synthetic dollar tokens in Germany and across Europe. With MiCAR enforcement ramping up, stablecoin and synthetic asset issuers will face increased scrutiny over compliance with capital, reserve, and disclosure requirements. The outcome of BaFin’s assessment of Ethena GmbH could set a precedent for how synthetic dollar tokens are regulated under MiCAR across the EU. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is BaFin’s ban of USDe actually protecting German innovation rather than hindering it? Counterintuitively, yes. By enforcing strict compliance standards early, BaFin creates a more predictable environment where legitimate crypto projects can thrive without unfair competition from operators who bypass proper authorization channels. Does this ban reflect MiCAR’s flexibility or its rigidity? Neither—it demonstrates MiCAR’s intentional interpretative space. Germany’s interpretation reveals how the regulation creates room for national authorities to calibrate enforcement based on local market conditions and risk appetites. Is this primarily about USDe’s technology or about EU regulatory sovereignty? The latter. This action positions Europe as asserting regulatory independence from both American permissiveness and Chinese restriction, establishing a distinct “third way” in global crypto governance.

Key Metrics Show $200,000 Prediction Is Likely",https://coingape.com/is-bitcoin-price-bottom-in-key-metrics-show-rally-is-likely/,"Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility is slowing down as the coin’s capitulation continues. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was changing hands for $84,278.83 as it pared off the losses accrued in earlier trading. At this pace, the question now hinges on whether BTC can form sustainable support at the $84,000 price mark or whether further drawdown lies ahead. Core Bitcoin Price Metric to Watch According to Glassnode data , BTC Short-Term Holders (STH) are under increasing pressure. This group’s unrealized losses have surged, pushing many STH coins into losses. As revealed, their holdings are now nearing the two-standard deviation threshold. Despite this outlook, the data platform hinted that losses remain within historical bull market bounds. Specifically, it noted that these losses are less severe than the May 2021 sell-off from the all-time high. Glassnode said the rolling 30-day losses for STH have topped $7 billion. It confirmed that “this remains well below prior capitulation events, such as the $19.8B and $20.7B losses in 2021-22.” BTC price jumped to an ATH above $109,000 in January but has since dropped by 22.79%. While experts predicted a drop of over 35%, the limited loss from holders can form a good rebound basis. BTC Price Bottom In, Here Are Triggers for Rally Over the past week, Bitcoin has rallied within very tight price ranges, from a low of $81,300 to a high of $87,320. Some market observers believe the coin has attained its floor price and might be set for a rebound. While firms like Strategy have kept Bitcoin purchase plans alive with Strife’s perpetual stock offering , the Global Money Supply M2 also lays a positive basis for growth. With the current outlook, the projection that the $83,00 level is the BTC price floor is resounding among analysts. The shift in regulation and the backing of Bitcoin by President Donald Trump creates a tailwind for the coin’s proponents. At the Digital Asset Summit earlier this week, President Trump reiterated the plan to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Several government agencies have shifted their policies in this regard, which might attract investors in the long term. How High Can Bitcoin Valuation Rise? Despite the slowdown in growth in recent weeks, many market leaders are still confident in the coin’s prospects. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan maintained the price target of $1 million by 2029. He cited a longer-term reaction to macroeconomic uncertainties as the basis for his prediction. While this Bitcoin price prediction appears lofty, others believe Bitcoin may cross $200,000 once the bull rally returns. With spot Bitcoin ETF hype and other growing institutional adoption, BTC price has an arguably bright future. The post Is Bitcoin Price Bottom In?

The Financial Services panel will then review the bill on April 2. So far, the Trump administration has been very vocal about its crypto support and the need for a stablecoin bill. However, bipartisan support for crypto is growing significantly, increasing the likelihood that the stablecoin bill will be fully approved. The stablecoin bill has received support from both Republicans and Democrats A key House Committee is likely to vote in favour of the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) first proposed the bill, which has quickly earned the support of both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Genius Act, and five of the committee’s 11 Democrats joined the Republican majority to support the bill. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers will have the choice of both federal and state charters based on market capitalisation. Moreover, foreign issuers will be obligated to follow The nation’s protocols on reserves, anti-money laundering measures, sanctions compliance, and liquidity. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan, even commented, “The reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.” Maxine Walters and Elizabeth Warren believe the bill fails to protect consumers adequately Like many other analysts and crypto enthusiasts, Chairman French Hill believes the stablecoin market should be regulated. Hill claimed that a regulated stablecoin environment would yield a stronger dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms that have presented their legislative agenda in the Capitol before have also consistently promoted stablecoins as a means to improving financial inclusion and a much cheaper and faster transaction option. However, Maxine Walters, the top Democrat on the House committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts believe the bill will not protect consumers adequately. They also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk’s X or Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins. Other critics have also raised concerns about the lack of stablecoin FDIC insurance, fearing huge losses for users if the token collapses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Deribit leads crypto options trading, a market segment that has expanded rapidly in recent years as institutional investors seek exposure to digital assets through derivatives. Its acquisition would allow Coinbase to strengthen its footprint in this fast-growing segment. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, has been growing its presence in the derivatives space as part of its broader strategy. If completed, the acquisition would bolster Coinbase’s position in the crypto derivatives market as demand for regulated platforms increases. Coinbase Derivatives Expansion Includes ADA, Natural Gas Futures Amid Deribit Talks As Coinbase explores acquiring crypto options exchange Deribit, the company is also advancing its derivatives strategy, seeking regulatory approval for new futures contracts. On March 15, Coinbase Derivatives filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to self-certify futures for Cardano (ADA) and Natural Gas (NGS), signaling a broader push into both crypto and traditional commodities. If the CFTC raises no objections, trading could begin as early as March 31. This move follows the recent launch of Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR) futures.

We anticipate going live with these products on Monday,… pic.twitter.com/YZGmkb1TvM — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) March 14, 2025 Coinbase’s introduction of Cardano futures offers traders exposure to ADA’s price movements without holding the asset itself. Cardano, known for its scalable and energy-efficient blockchain, has seen growing adoption in DeFi and enterprise use cases. Following the announcement, ADA rose 2%, hitting $0.75, according to CoinGecko. Beyond crypto assets, Coinbase is also diversifying its offerings. The introduction of Natural Gas futures marks Coinbase’s first venture into the energy sector, positioning it as a competitor to traditional futures exchanges. Natural gas’s importance in global markets could attract institutional traders beyond crypto. Beyond its latest futures filings, Coinbase is set to launch 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures in the U.S., aligning domestic markets with global trading standards. Crypto derivatives account for 75% of global trading volumes, and Coinbase’s expansion seeks to attract more of this activity to U.S. markets while staying compliant with CFTC regulations. Coinbase ranks as the largest Ethereum staking operator , holding 11.42% of staked ETH. With 3.84 million ETH staked and near-perfect validator uptime, the exchange continues strengthening its influence across trading and staking sectors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What could this deal indicate about evolving trends in crypto derivatives? This potential acquisition hints at an industry shift. Exchanges are broadening their toolset to offer comprehensive trading options, reflecting rising investor interest and evolving regulatory norms in digital assets. How might a unified license structure impact crypto market compliance? Uniting licenses under a single operator may simplify compliance checks and encourage uniform oversight. This consolidation could ease regulatory processes and offer a steadier framework for digital asset trades. What long-term impacts could arise from integrating options trading with existing platforms? Merging options trading into established platforms may boost market engagement and broaden revenue streams. This integration supports legacy exchanges in adapting offerings to meet evolving investor demand and digital market shifts.

Based on recent data, around 8.97 million ETH are in their possession now. This shortage comes as the price of Ethereum has taken a precipitous decline. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin In New Whale Hands—A Mega BTC Rally On The Horizon? Supply Tightens On Exchanges The declining volume of Ether on exchanges is an indication that the holders are taking their money elsewhere in growing numbers. One of the main reasons behind this is the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, according to a recent examination by Santiment. People are interacting with several DeFi protocols with their Ethereum to lend liquidity or earn rewards. Another principal element is the expansion of staking, whereby ETH owners “lock up” their coins to help secure the network and be rewarded while doing so. Therefore, there is fewer Ethereum to sell on the exchanges. 👋 Thanks to the many DeFi and staking options, Ethereum’s holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015). There is 16.4% less $ETH on exchanges compared to just 7 weeks ago. 😮 pic.twitter.com/r5957wPhLi — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 20, 2025 Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Despite the lower supply of Ethereum on exchanges, which some would expect to drive prices up because of scarcity, the opposite has occurred. Based on latest figures, the price of Ethereum has dropped by about 45% from its December high. On March 21, the price was about $1,899. Ethereum has been among the worst-performing major cryptocurrencies over the past few years. The cause for such a decline in price is varied and can involve overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and increased competition from other blockchain systems. Experts Share Their Thoughts Financial analysts are giving their opinions regarding what this means for the future value of Ethereum. Standard Chartered, a well-known financial institution, has recently reduced its year-end price target for Ethereum. They now predict a price of $4,000 at the end of the year, a significant drop from their previous estimate of $10,000. The primary purpose of this revision is the rising competition from Ethereum’s competitor layer-2 networks, which aim to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum foundation blockchain. Users and traffic on such networks can be different from the central Ethereum network. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It’s Lift-Off Time Upsides On The Horizon? Despite the current price hiccups, there are potential explanations why a recovery could be realized. One possibility is staking exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. If regulations allow ETFs that directly stake Ethereum, it could attract more institutional investment and increase demand.

In 2020, this so-called “Dogecoin killer” launched with barely any fanfare. The entry price was so microscopic that even a hundred bucks could’ve fetched millions of tokens. Fast forward to today, and those same early investors are sitting on insane profits—some turning a few hundred dollars into millions. But let’s be real—Shiba Inu’s explosive moment has passed. The days of getting in at a rock-bottom price and riding a rocket to the moon are over. It’s already mainstream, and massive gains aren’t as easy. But here’s the thing about meme coins: there’s always a next big play. Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a brand-new meme coin that isn’t just another Shiba Inu wannabe—it’s rewriting the script. Arctic Pablo isn’t riding on the past success of other tokens. It’s carving out its own legacy with an immersive story, a lucrative staking system, and an insanely limited-time presale where early adopters can get in at a fraction of its potential worth. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Frontier in Meme Coins Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors on an adventurous journey alongside its eponymous explorer, Arctic Pablo. Set against the backdrop of icy terrains and mystical ice-covered islands, Pablo’s quest is not just about exploration but also about uncovering the enigmatic $APC coins. These tokens symbolize more than mere currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity, imbued with the magic of forgotten lands. This storytelling approach transforms the investment experience, making participants feel like integral parts of an unfolding legend. Departing from traditional presale models, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is structured around Pablo’s journey through various mythical locations. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is in the Nippy Nook location, the 15th phase of its journey. The token is priced at $0.000079, with over $1.96 million raised so far. The launch price is $0.008, offering early investors a potential return on investment (ROI) of over 10,027.85% from the current presale price to the listing price. An investment of $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 12,656,860 APC tokens, which could be worth $101,254.88 upon reaching the listing price. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance token scarcity and value through weekly token burns. At the end of each presale phase, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens over time. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Its one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now . The Shiba Inu Phenomenon: A Missed Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene as a decentralized meme token, positioning itself as an experiment in community-driven cryptocurrency. Launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly gained traction, riding on the coattails of Dogecoin’s popularity. Its initial price was minuscule, allowing early investors to acquire large quantities with minimal capital. As the coin gained popularity, its value soared, creating substantial returns for those who got in early. However, as with many rapidly appreciating assets, the window for maximum gains was narrow. Many potential investors were on the sidelines, watching SHIB’s value escalate beyond their reach. This scenario underscores the importance of identifying and acting on emerging opportunities before they become mainstream. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities for investors. While the Shiba Inu moment may have passed, Arctic Pablo Coin is a compelling contender among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Its unique narrative, innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanisms, and attractive staking rewards position it as a project with significant potential. Investors seeking to capitalize on low entry points and participate in a community-driven adventure should join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now, before this opportunity, too, becomes a tale of missed chances.

Two established coins, Dogecoin and Cardano, are currently struggling, creating room for a new project like RCO Finance to shine. Investors are rapidly taking notice, shifting toward projects that can deliver real value alongside massive profits. Dogecoin Struggles as Miners Dump Millions of Tokens Dogecoin (DOGE), once touted as one of the top altcoins to watch, has been going through a rough patch lately. An analyst recently shared data revealing Dogecoin miners sold off over 65 million tokens in just 48 hours. Such significant selling pressure from miners usually signals trouble, potentially pushing the meme coin even lower. At the current price of $0.17, Dogecoin sits far below its peak of $0.431 from January. Analysts warn if this selling continues, DOGE could slip under $0.15 soon. However, some traders remain hopeful, believing past patterns could bring a major comeback. Notably, large-scale investors bought over 1.4 billion DOGE in a single day last week, hinting that “smart money” may expect a bullish turn. This mixed sentiment makes Dogecoin one of the key altcoins to watch closely. Source: Coinmarketcap Cardano Losing Investor Interest Amid Declining Volume Cardano (ADA), another top altcoin, isn’t faring much better. ADA is currently priced at $0.7086, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Even more concerning is that its trading volume dropped significantly by over 20% , hinting that investors might be losing interest in Cardano’s previously compelling story. With ADA down 1.58% this week and a declining volume, analysts see signs of a potential trend reversal. Cardano’s slow pace in delivering promised upgrades, coupled with current macroeconomic conditions, has investors reconsidering their holdings and seeking alternative altcoins with stronger growth potential. This cautious sentiment toward Cardano might encourage traders to explore other altcoins to watch—especially those showing increased market excitement and rapid growth potential, like RCO Finance. Source: Coinmarketcap RCO Finance Emerges as the Most Promising Altcoin of 2025 While established coins like Dogecoin and Cardano struggle, investors are swiftly turning toward RCO Finance , recognizing it as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Currently priced at only $0.1 and boasting a modest market cap of $591,220, investors see a huge growth runway ahead. RCO Finance isn’t just another crypto platform; it’s a revolutionary decentralized financial ecosystem. Users can buy crypto, stocks, real estate, and numerous tokenized assets—all seamlessly from a single account, without cumbersome KYC processes. This simplicity makes investing hassle-free, attracting new users in droves. But what really sets RCO Finance apart from other altcoins is its advanced AI Robo Advisor. This innovative tool continuously monitors the crypto market, analyzing live data from reliable sources like Reuters and Bloomberg, along with comprehensive on-chain analytics. Imagine spotting opportunities early, like the recent surge in Immutable X (IMX), which exploded from $0.4 to $1.2—a +200% gain within just months. RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor could have caught such price moves well before mainstream traders noticed, helping investors get in early and maximize profits. Additionally, RCO Finance offers an extensive range of 120,000 assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, and tokenized real estate. Investors can conveniently diversify their portfolios without converting crypto into fiat first, all within one simple platform. Investor enthusiasm is evident, as RCO Finance has raised over $13 million already, showcasing robust community backing. Analysts expect a massive rally post-launch, with predictions suggesting gains of up to 20,000%. To put this into perspective, a modest $500 investment today could potentially grow to $100,000. It has also been audited by SolidProof , a popular auditor in the field, verifying its security, trustworthiness, and reliability. In addition to that, investors already get to experiment with its functionalities with the newly released Beta Platform . Why RCO Finance is a Must-Have Altcoin Before the Bull Market Returns Given the current crypto landscape, RCO Finance is perfectly positioned to become one of the most profitable altcoins this year. With features like its AI-powered Robo Advisor, no-KYC simplicity, and robust staking options, the platform offers unmatched potential. As the crypto market prepares for its next bullish phase, this might be the last chance to enter RCO Finance at its current presale price. The extraordinary profit potential and real-world functionality mean it’s a strong contender to outperform traditional favorites like Dogecoin and Cardano. When the market turns, you want to be holding the best-performing altcoins—those with strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. RCO Finance is clearly leading the way, offering investors the tools to succeed in the next crypto boom.

Freysa AI’s native asset, FAI , is trading at $0.0226 at time of writing, up from around $0.0183 a day ago. The 298th-ranked crypto asset by market cap launched in late November. Freysa AI aims to be “the first truly sovereign AI agent.” The project’s AI agent has overseen a series of games designed to test human interaction with powerful artificial intelligence systems. For example, in November, entrants used prompts to “trick” the Freysa AI into authorizing a transfer of prize pool funds. Each prompt cost a fee that in turn increased the prize. Being added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering adding trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was created in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company’s standards. “It’s kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it’s probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it.

42122979,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697668,1742602006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42122979.jpeg,Trump admin may tap gold profits to stack Bitcoin Reserves: Bo Hines,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-may-tap-gold-to-stack-btc-reserves/,"According to Bo Hines, a senior Whitehouse advisor on crypto who spoke on the Crypto in America Podcast, the US could cash in on its gold holdings to fund its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Hines suggested that the Trump administration would explore creative ways of funding the SBR without further burdening the American taxpayer. His sentiments seem to be an attempt to pacify Americans, many of whom, according to a recent survey, oppose the SBR. The Data for Progress advocacy group poll showed 51% of American voters disapprove of the idea, placing it last on the list of priority areas for federal funding. America’s budget-neutral means of financing its SBR Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins’ Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. He said, “If we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.” How does revaluing the gold certificates work? Lummins’ push and, therefore, Hines’ stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037 , which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold’s current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M) , bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B – $11B). As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold’s prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers’ funds. Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates’ scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations. Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue. Revaluing gold certificates is a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve. Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR via decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

Here’s how Coinbase latest $5 bilion acquisition deal could impact Bitcoin prices in the long-term . Bitcoin holds $84K as Coinbase moves to Acquire Deribit Bitcoin (BTC) closed trading around the $84,200 mark on Friday, March 22, as markets retreated from upwards volatility triggered by Trump’s appearance at Blockwork’s Digital Asset Summit. Following Trump’s speech advocating for Stablecoin regulations , and long-term BTC holding, BTC price raced to a weekly timeframe peak of $85,900 before returning 4% to close trading on Friday around $84,228. The impact of Trump’s BTC price was short-lived since his major talking points during speech had been relatively priced in during the previous market really. However, a recent media report surrounding Coinbase acquisition of derivatives-based crypto exchange could have far reaching longer-term impacts on Bitcoin price. Bitcoin price action | March 22, 2025 According to Bloomberg reports, Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange has entered advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the world’s leading bitcoin and ether options trading platform. Notably Bloomberg cited anonymous sources in the report , showing that the deal has not yet being made official. “The companies have notified regulators in Dubai about the discussions as Deribit holds a license there, which would be taken over by any acquirer.” – Bloomberg, March 21, 2025. Coinbase representatives were also coy on the rumours, declining to confirm any ongoing deal discussions. , “We have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner and invest to accelerate our roadmap.” – Coinbase. While official sources from Deribit and Coinbase keep mum, Bloomberg’s latest report suggests negotiations are progressing with the options trading platform reportedly valued between $4 billion and $5 billion. Coinbase (COIN) Traders See Mild Gains as Deribit acquisition hints Dubia Expansion Considering that Deribit holds an active license to operate in Dubai, Coinbase’s decision to pursue this acquisition appears to be a strategic move to expand into the Middle Eastern market. With increasing regulatory pressure from the U.S. and EU, regions such as the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore have emerged as key global hubs for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses. Coinbase (Coin) price surges 4.4% to hit $190 as Bloomberg reveals Deribit acquisition talks | March 21, 2025 The softening stance on crypto regulation in the U.S. could influence the trajectory of this deal. With growing institutional support and strategic reserve announcements expected, the industry could witness a shift in policy under former President Trump’s potential return. Trump recently reiterated his support for cryptocurrency at Blockworks’ industry event this week. If finalized, Coinbase’s acquisition of Deribit could enhance its global footprint, broaden its derivatives offerings, and position the exchange to benefit from increasing institutional and sovereign adoption of cryptocurrencies—particularly in the Middle East and Asia. Will Coinbase Acquisition of Deribit Impact Bitcoin Price? According to Bloomberg Deribit it’s the largest Options trading platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Options trading is an institution-dominated space. By acquiring Deribit, Coinbase can deploy options trading offerings, not only to US-based customers but also institutions with corporate headquarters in crypto hotbeds like Dubia, Singapore and Hong kong. Hence, the Coinbase acquisition deal for Deribit, could be yet another major catalyst that could spark increased institutional adoption of BTC in the months ahead. Notably, Donald Trump crypto strategic reserve heading for congressional approval could be a key determinant in Bitcoin global appeal as 2025 unfolds. Bitcoin price forecast: Double-bottom pattern hints at $114,000 rebound target Bitcoin price forecast signals on the BTCUSD daily chart shows a confirmed double-bottom reversal pattern, a historically bullish structure suggesting a potential move toward a long-term target of $114,000. The pattern formed with two distinct lows, at $78,000 and $76,000 followed by a breakout above the neckline resistance. At press time BTC Price is currently consolidating around $84,053, hovering near the middle Keltner Channel (KC) level of $85,392, indicating a neutral market trend as traders await the next major directional move. A bullish scenario could unfold if Bitcoin price can decisively reclaim the upper KC boundary at $93,252, especially if accompanied by increased trading volumes. More so, the BBP (Balanced Bull and Bear Power) indicator, while still negative at -859.38, has begun a reversal with green bars emerging—an early signal of bullish divergence. Conversely, failure to hold support at $77,533—the lower KC band—could invalidate the breakout structure, triggering renewed selling pressure. If bears regain control in the secenraio, BTC price risks retesting liquidity zones around $75,000, delaying the bullish trajectory. The next few sessions could be pivotal; as sustained price action above $85,000 strengthens could case for a continued uptrend toward the $114,00o target.

The Tron ecosystem is pushing a new proposal to implement a Bitcoin-like halving for TRX. In his post on X, Justin Sun revealed how the move will not disadvantage current validators in the ecosystem. Justin Sun and Advocacy for TRX Halving As explained on X by the Tron founder, Bitcoin developers had to evolve to limit their reward to users involved in crypto mining at the time. Going back memory lane, he noted that Bitcoin had to create an attractive 50 BTC per block reward to bootstrap the network. However, as the protocol grew, halving helped reduce the incentives to a sustainable level. Liking it to the Tron ecosystem, Justin Sun recounted that TRX is a deflationary asset that drops 1% per year. This made it the only deflationary asset among the top assets. As revealed, the massive rally in the price of TRX has pushed up the reward considerably. This, he believes, might make sense if a moderate slash is approved by the community. Per the analogy, he noted that the Tron ecosystem can achieve a 1.5% per year deflation by paying out about 1 million TRX in validator rewards daily. Notably, increasing this daily payout to 2 million TRX will increase deflation by 2% per year. To Sun, even if the community approved the halving reduction, Tron will remain an attractive chain for miners. The Tron Ecosystem Updates Beyond the TRX halving clarification, Justin Sun has been front-running many positive ecosystem updates. Over the past week, the Tron Founder has revealed the push for Tron integration on Solana . This partnership is poised to increase the transfer of native tokens across both chains. In addition, the ecosystem is also being increasingly embraced by top industry stakeholders. CoinGape reported that Justin Sun was appointed an advisor to President Trump-linked World Liberty Financial International (WLFi). Since then, TRX has remained a favorite for the coin in WLFi’s portfolio. Reports also show that TRX may bag an inclusion in the crypto reserve that the US government is putting together. TRX Price and Performance Outlook The price of TRX remains under the radar amid the growing shift in network supply and related trends. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.2366, up by 0.13% in 24 hours. Amid the week-long fluctuations, the coin’s price rose from a low of $0.2305 to a high of $0.2373, showing a relatively mild volatility. However, earlier TRX price predictions from Sun teased the coin as hitting an all-time high soon. Analysts remain speculative about how the Tron halving proposal will shape out and its impact on price.

In response to an inquiry on professional orientation for all Gen Z high school graduates this year, Altman responded that studying AI tools is essential to succeed at work now. He argued that AI rapidly transforms work, and studying those skills makes sense. Altman drew an analogy by stating that during his high school days, when he studied how to program, it was the most stable route to decent-paying jobs. AI is already having a huge influence in the tech world. According to Sam Altman, AI currently handles about half the coding at most companies. Some experts, like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, reckon AI will be capable of 90% of coding in three to 6 months. That shift is leading companies to rethink their hiring practices. Software engineers will not be extinct. However, businesses now need individuals who can work with and utilize AI capabilities. This is evident in job postings at big employers like Apple, Amazon, and Meta, which recently offered seven-figure salaries for the best AI scientists. AI literacy has become the most sought-after skill According to a recent report by LinkedIn , AI literacy is the fastest emerging skill for 2025. Companies in all sectors want someone who understands AI and can wield it for problem-solving and innovation. The report describes AI literacy as a general skill covering knowledge and using tools like ChatGPT and other generative technologies. No one can deny it—it’s not just an inevitable part of the life of a tech whiz anymore. Business, marketing, media, and communication professionals also use AI to enhance their work. Programmer engaged in coding: Source: Pixabay AI literacy allows people to leverage AI-powered tools, which can be applied without advanced technical know-how for model building or data analysis. With artificial intelligence emerging as a powerful component in personal and professional workflows, engineers and tech professionals are adopting AI to automate processes, increase efficiency, and drive innovation. But getting one of these lucrative AI jobs is no easy feat. As LinkedIn’s editor-in-chief, Dan Roth, reported today, while the fingertips attached to the dwindling hiring rate are at 3.4%, people are applying in droves. He said companies are hiring less. It’s not a catastrophe, but it’s not good out there. AI skills are important, of course, but they are not the only way to future-proof yourself at work. Soft skills are more important than ever. Indeed’s chief executive, Chris Hyams, told Fortune that employers should focus on candidates with “curiosity and an openness” to learn. Adapting and bouncing back will be crucial in navigating a shifting labour market. Soft skills remain important even with AI expertise While AI capabilities are an asset, technical skills alone will not be enough. Altman recommends Gen Z consider soft skills such as adaptability and resilience. As the employment landscape continues to shift, employees who can easily learn new technology will be sought after. Indeed chief executive Chris Hyams agrees. He recommends hiring managers seek out inquisitive applicants who will be adaptable. As AI automates more things, businesses still need people who can analyze, innovate and adapt. Despite formal education initiatives or self-instructing using AI tools like Google’s NotebookLM, younger professionals must stay ahead of the curve. According to Altman, as AI advances and the career sector is primed for disruption, Gen Z should use such tools in their favour to stay at the forefront.

Rival Token Poised for Bigger Returns in the Next 3 Months,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ada-breakout-to-1-50-rival-token-poised-for-bigger-returns-in-the-next-3-months/,"As bullish momentum gathers steam behind a potential breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, Cardano (ADA) retires above $0.72. Analysts are forecasting a rally to $1.00 as buying pressure persists, though whale activity potentially undermines this trend. In the last few days, over 100 million ADA tokens have been splashed on markets, and short-term stability is doubtful. As Cardano’s technical indicators suggest it may have hit the bottom, another project is stealing the limelight—Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a recently launched presale that’s already blitzed past $4.1 million and is forecasting 10x+ gains after its token launch. Cardano’s Shaky Ascent The 4-hour chart of Cardano glooming a triple white soldier pattern with three consecutive green candles in the tug-of-war game between the bulls and bears. This usually indicates upward momentum, but ADA’s 2.82% intraday increase to $0.7246 is facing resistance. The MACD indicator approaches a bullish crossover, which is complemented by RSI readings approaching neutrality. But according to data from Santiment, a grim truth is being unearthed: whales have dumped 100 million ADA in a week, cutting big holders balances to only 5.89 billion tokens. Such sell-offs could put a lid on gains at $1.00, well below the $1.50 that some optimists see. Key support comes in at $0.65; a break there threatens a drop to $0.60. Presale Momentum of Mutuum Finance Builds As Cardano faces volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to forge ahead into phase 3 of its presale at $0.02 per token. More than 6,300 investors have already joined, driving a $4.1 million raise. Phase 3 is nearly sold out before Phase 4, where prices will increase 25% to $0.025. Early investors securing their tokens now can already make 200% when the launch comes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will hit the market at $0.06. After the initial jump, analysts predict $3.00 within months of exchanges (14,900% above current prices). Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics include a buy-and-distribute model with platform revenue redirected to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from open markets. These tokens go back to stakers, driving repeated buying pressure while preventing sell-offs. At the same time, the protocol’s lending infrastructure — with overcollateralized loans and mtTokens that accrue interest — ensures utility. A Certik audit of its smart contracts is being finalized by developers — an achievement likely to lend credibility to the project once officially announced. The Window for Strategic Choice Reshapes Unlike whale pump and dump actions that mask any path to success, Mutuum Finance represents a quantifiable opportunity. Its presale system offers early investors a 200% launch return and targets on post-listing price action dwarf ADA’s vague estimates. With Phase 3 almost full, the time left to acquire token at $0.02 is narrowing down. Adventurous investors have begun to lend an ear and stop shuffling deck chairs; through a systemic approach to demand generation and real-world DeFi utility, this prototype asset has proved itself to be valuable in its own right, and with it, those who prioritize measurable gains can find respite in the lovely new world of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This will soon be topped by the completion of its Certik audit, which can act as a catalyst for adoption, as confirmed via Mutuum Finance social channel. For individuals looking for asymmetric results within a volatile crypto marketplace, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is a deliberate point of entry— a convergence of tokenomics and timing. Fewer tokens are available now and you can secure before Phase 3 is over making the tokens more expensive.

Unlike volatile price swings seen in other assets, TON’s consistent rise signals strong underlying demand and market stability. The cryptocurrency has successfully held key support levels, preventing major pullbacks and allowing buyers to take control of the trend. With momentum building, market participants are closely monitoring resistance levels that could determine the next phase of TON’s price action. Should buying pressure continue to increase, the cryptocurrency could be poised for further gains, potentially testing higher resistance zones. Can Toncoin Sustain Its Renewed Upswing? Toncoin recent price resurgence has strengthened bullish sentiment, but the sustainability of this uptrend remains a critical focus. The cryptocurrency has managed to establish solid footing above the $2.36 key support level. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on several technical and market factors. Related Reading: TON Price Jumps 20% Following Positive News On Telegram Founder The cryptocurrency is currently maintaining its upward momentum as it approaches the $4.34 resistance level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This steady climb indicates growing bullish strength, with buyers continuing to push the price higher despite potential resistance. A decisive breakout above the $4.34 resistance level could strengthen the ongoing uptrend, setting the stage for Toncoin toward the $6.13 resistance mark. If buying momentum remains strong and the price clears this key level, it could open the door for a potential test of its all-time high of $7.29. Technical indicators such as the MACD suggest that momentum remains in favor of the bulls, but increasing resistance pressure might lead to volatility. Sustained buying pressure will confirm the uptrend and push the price beyond these critical technical barriers. Volume analysis further reinforces Toncoin’s upward momentum, with trading volume increasing by over 10%, indicating strong market participation. Should volume continue to rise alongside price movement, it could validate the strength of the uptrend and enhance the likelihood of further gains. Potential Downside Risk If Toncoin faces rejection at a key resistance level, monitoring critical support zones will be essential to assess the strength of its uptrend. The first major support level to watch is around $2.36, where buyers previously showed interest. A dip to this level is likely to attract fresh demand and stabilize the price. Related Reading: Toncoin Gears Up For A Fresh Rally With Bullish Momentum Building A breakdown below this level could indicate a shift in momentum, accelerating selling pressure and leading to a deeper decline.

After a descending triangle trend from mid 2021 through early 2025, the ETH/BTC pair has now reached a level where it showed a buying range in late 2020. Such a technical development combined with increased open interest in the futures is fueling the debate on trend reversal. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery: Key Support Level Could Spark Reversal According to a recent post on X , analyst AndrewCryptoHQ noted that ETH/BTC is now trading at a crucial technical level. This level previously acted as a launchpad for gains during Q4 2020. Since its peak in mid-2021, the pair has remained in a downtrend, posting consistent lower highs and lower lows. As of late March 2025, ETH/BTC is resting near a multi-year support zone. Market participants are watching closely to see whether this zone can hold and initiate an altcoin rebound. If supported, it could mark a key turning point in Ethereum price performance compared to Bitcoin. Source: X However, downside risks remain. A decline in Bitcoin could put pressure on Ethereum price action. ETH has shown sensitivity to Bitcoin’s market direction in previous cycles. Without a confirmed breakout or higher low formation, traders remain cautious about calling a full reversal. ETH Futures Open Interest Hits Record as Caution Lingers On March 21, Ether futures open interest reached a record high of 10.23 million ETH, according to data from CoinGlass . This figure represents a 15% increase over two weeks, signaling growing participation in derivative markets. Despite the rise in open interest, the futures premium dropped below 4%, down from 5% two weeks prior. This lower premium suggests subdued bullish sentiment, as traders are not aggressively pursuing leveraged long positions. Binance, Gate.io, and Bitget accounted for over half of the futures market, while CME captured 9%. The increased leverage does not automatically indicate upward price movement. Open interest simply reflects matched positions between buyers and sellers. The absence of a strong premium points to a neutral stance from investors regarding the altcoin price trajectory. Ethereum Network Fees Fall as On-Chain Activity Slows However, Ethereum network fees fell by 50% over the past seven days, according to IntoTheBlock . The reduction signals a decline in user activity and overall demand on the Ethereum mainnet. Total revenue for Ethereum’s base layer dropped to $605,000 as of March 17, compared to $2.5 million just two weeks earlier. Lower fees are partly due to the growing use of Layer 2 solutions, which move transactions off the mainnet to improve scalability. However, the shift has also reduced transaction volume on the core network. Users and protocols are increasingly exploring alternative chains such as Solana and Avalanche. This slowdown in network usage presents challenges for Ethereum price support. The downturn in activity may contribute to hesitancy around the altcoin’s near-term outlook. However, Ethereum whales have started to accumulate again as one of them bought nearly $270 million worth of ETH. This goes hand in hand with the increase in the daily active addresses by 26%, which may signal a reversal of the Ethereum price chart.

Disinterest among short-term traders puts ETH price as risk of another pull back towards $1,850. Ethereum (ETH) fails to hold $2,000 support despite Trump’s speech Ethereum (ETH) price showed promising price action earlier this week, but latest price action suggests the optimism may have already petered out in less than 24 hours. Ethereum price rallied 10% at the start of the week, rising from $1760, to hit $2,065 riding on positive tailwinds for successful deployment of its Hoodi update. Ethereum (ETH) price action , March 22, 2025 | CoinMarketCap Trump’s appearance at Blockwork’s Digital Asset Summit, boosted market momentum on Thursday, driving ETH price above the $2,067 mark on Friday, according CoinmarketCap data. Recent market trends show the majority of ETH bull traders failed to hold the gains for up-to 24 hours. Following Trump’s speech, Ethereum opened trading on Friday above the $2,000 for the first time in nearly two-weeks dating back to March 9. However, ETH bulls failed to build on the rebound, as ETH price rapidly plunged below the $2,000 mark and closed for the day around $1,965. However, as seen in the chart above, the persistent decline in ETH trading volumes suggests bears could struggle to drive major downward moves in the coming trading session. Ethereum Derivatives Markets Analysis: Open Interest Dips Below $20 Billion but Multiple Upside Signals Remain Ethereum’s derivatives market reflects mixed sentiment, with open interest holding at $19.94B, barely above the $20B threshold, despite a 26.7% drop in trading volume to $22.80B. Options open interest has also fallen 5.45% to $5.88B, indicating instutional speculators are also scaling down their exposure to Ethereum. Ethereum Derivatives Markets Analysis Beyond that, Conversely, Liquidation data also provides key insights into recent negative tilt in mark sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, total rekt positions reached $24.63M, with $17.18M in long liquidations and $7.45M in short liquidations, suggesting that bullish traders were over-leveraged before recent price correction. Additionally, $3.47M was wiped in the past 4 hours, further reflecting the market’s vulnerability to sudden price swings. Ethereum price outlook today: Failure to Hold $1,850 Exposes ETH to More Downside Risks ETH price is trading just above the $1,900 mark at press time. However, Ethereum price forecast signals on derivatives trends suggest caution is warranted if ETH stagnates near $2,000. The Coinglass derivatives chart shows ETH/USDT long/short ratios on Binance (3.42) and OKX (3.44) show bullish positioning from traders, with Binance’s top traders maintaining a 4.16 long/short ratio on accounts. This suggest that traders may be entering fresh bullish positions after the recent profit-taking phase that ensued after Trump’s speech on Thursday. A prolonged lack of directional momentum could deter speculative traders, and prompt existing holders to close ETH positions in search of more volatile assets.

This week, three top meme coins to invest in this week have captured the spotlight: Arctic Pablo Coin , Shiba Inu, and Dog (Bitcoin). Each offers distinct features and investment opportunities. Let’s dive into what makes these top meme coins to invest in this week stand out. Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week: Arctic Pablo Coin – Embark on a Legendary Crypto Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin presale ; it’s one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week, offering an exhilarating expedition led by the intrepid explorer, Arctic Pablo. This daring adventurer journeys through icy terrains and mystical islands, uncovering hidden treasures and ancient mysteries. The narrative isn’t just a backdrop; it’s integral to the coin’s identity, transforming the investment experience into a thrilling saga. The presale structure of Arctic Pablo Coin is as unique as its storyline. Eschewing traditional stages, the presale is segmented into ‘locations,’ each representing a new chapter in Arctic Pablo’s journey. Currently, at the 15th location, Nippy Nook, the coin is priced at $0.000079. To date, the presale has amassed over $1.96 million, reflecting a burgeoning interest from the crypto community. Early investors are looking at a staggering 10,027.85% ROI, making it one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week before it surges to the anticipated listing price of $0.008. But the adventure doesn’t end there. Arctic Pablo Coin offers a generous 66% APY staking program, allowing investors to stake their $APC tokens and watch their holdings grow. With all staked coins vested for two months post-launch, this mechanism fosters a committed and engaged community—yet another reason why Arctic Pablo is among the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary model by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the coin’s value over time. The token burns are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. In essence, Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just a meme token—it’s one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week, blending a captivating narrative with innovative tokenomics. Investors aren’t just buying a digital asset; they’re securing a ticket to an ongoing adventure with massive potential Shiba Inu: The Dogecoin Killer with a Robust Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB), often dubbed the ‘Dogecoin Killer,’ has solidified its position in the meme coin arena. As of now, SHIB holds the 17th spot in global crypto rankings, boasting a market cap of $7.6 billion. Trading at $0.00001289, SHIB has witnessed a 24-hour volume surge of 25.89%, reaching $146.53 million. Despite being down 85.41% from its all-time high of $0.00008845, SHIB remains a favorite among investors, with 2 million holders and strong whale activity, as 74% of SHIB is held by large accounts. A recent 857% spike in token burns indicates SHIB’s deflationary mechanics are in full swing, fueling speculation of a potential breakout. ​ The community-driven approach, coupled with these developments, positions Shiba Inu as more than just a meme coin; it’s evolving into a multifaceted digital asset with real-world applications.​ Dog (Bitcoin): Bridging Meme Culture with Bitcoin’s Robustness Dog (Bitcoin) ($DOG) is a decentralized meme coin built on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Runes Protocol. With a market cap of $193 million and a circulating supply of 100 billion DOG tokens, it has gained traction across centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and Bitcoin Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. Despite a recent dip of 2.02%, DOG has seen a 24-hour trading volume surge to $7.09 million, reflecting strong market activity. Since its launch on April 24, 2024, through a volunteer-led airdrop, DOG has aimed to onboard millions to Bitcoin. While it hit an all-time high of $0.009947 in December 2024, it currently trades at $0.00193—down 80.65% but up 28.08% from its all-time low on March 11, 2025. With growing community support and exchange listings, DOG continues to be a notable player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. ​ The community-centric approach, combined with the robust foundation of the Bitcoin blockchain, makes Dog (Bitcoin) a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio.​ Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, these three meme coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Dog (Bitcoin)—each bring something unique to the table. Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its adventurous storytelling, high ROI potential, and innovative presale structure, making it a top pick for investors seeking excitement and exclusivity. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has already established itself as a major player with strong ecosystem developments like ShibaSwap, Shibarium, and an active community driving its long-term success. Meanwhile, Dog (Bitcoin) leverages the security of Bitcoin while capitalizing on the virality of meme culture, creating an intriguing mix of stability and hype. With Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale nearing its final locations, now might be the last chance to get in at a low price before it hits the market.

42125340,https://coingape.com/?p=245367,1742606988,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Solana Price Eyes Rally To $200 As Network Adoption Hits New ATH,https://coingape.com/solana-price-eyes-rally-to-200-as-network-adoption-hits-new-ath/,"Solana (SOL) is gaining attention in the crypto market after hitting a new all-time high (ATH) in network adoption. The number of addresses holding SOL has surpassed 11 million, signaling increasing interest in the network. This surge in adoption comes amid recent developments, including the launch of Solana futures ETFs and rising institutional interest. With these factors, analysts are now eyeing a potential rally for Solana’s price, possibly pushing it towards the $200 mark. New Adoption Milestone for Solana On-chain analytics reveal that more than 11.09 million addresses currently hold the SOL token on the Solana network. This is the new ATH in terms of network adoption of Solana which is a signal in the context of its long-term development. The increase in address activity indicates that more users are participating in the Solana ecosystem, which is further expanding progressively as a decentralized network. From the statistics, this uptick is expected to compliment the Solana price in the coming months especially after the development of Network. Solana’s increase in the adoption rate can be attributed to the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The introduction of Solana futures ETFs, followed by the possibility of the spot Solana ETF, has attracted corporate investors/traders. Analysts see these as optimisms within the market that could lead to another push up in the price of Solana. The breakout from the current range and continued institutional participation could lead to new highs for Solana price. Solana Futures ETFs Spark New Interest In March 2025, Solana still saw one of the most important events in its existence by launching own futures ETFs. These include the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the leveraged Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT). These are funds that give investors direct access to Solana futures contracts and are present on Nasdaq. The listing of Solana’s futures ETFs is a sign that Solana is gradually gaining more recognition in mainstream finance, meaning that more investors can invest in Solana token. While the launch has brought Solana into the spotlight, some market analysts have noted mixed reactions. Despite this, the debut of these financial products has led to an increase in Solana’s price, with the token briefly rising above $136. Analysts believe that these products could provide long-term support for Solana’s price as they bring more liquidity and market visibility to the SOL price hitting $200 again. Institutional Support and Increased Market Confidence There is growing support by institutions such as Fidelity Investments with the latest accruing to Solana network. This new Fidelity Solana Fund was recently filed with the registry of Delaware shows that Solana might stand on the entity of mainstream finance. Given that Fidelity has a network of $4.9 trillion in assets, its entrance to the Solana ecosystem could be a major boost to the project. With a growing number of institutions seeking to invest in Solana to diversify their portfolio the future appears promising for the network. These institutional backs are encouraging by the increasing growing rate in the cryptocurrency market and for Solana in particular. Polymarket further reveals that the probability of Solana attaining an ETF has risen to 88% this year. With more institutions investing in Solana, it is perhaps only a matter of time before regulators change their stance and approve SOL spot ETFs boosting Solana price rally towards $200.

42126160,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697678,1742607733,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42126160.jpeg,Bitcoin open interest plunges 43% to $24.5B since ATH,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-open-interest-plunges-43/,"Open interest in Bitcoin has dropped 35% from its all-time high, meaning less hedging and speculative trading. Open interest , which tracks the total number of outstanding derivative contracts at any time, declined from $57 billion when BTC hit its ATH to $24.5 billion today. This means that market movers are closing out uncertainty or unwinding leverage. The digital asset is now attempting to regain momentum after recent selling pressure. Despite hitting an ATH of over $109,000 in January, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $90,000 level. Bitcoin struggles to regain important price levels Bitcoin has been attempting to break above the $90,000 resistance level for the last two weeks. This follows its failure to remain upward after hitting its all-time high. This put downward pressure on BTC, igniting speculation on whether the most recent bull run was complete or if a second rally could see it soar higher than ever. According to on-chain data provider Glassnode, this fall in open interest comes amid an overall trend of falling on-chain liquidity. The unwinding of long-side bias from cash-and-carry trade, where traders make money on the difference between spot and futures prices, has also contributed to downward pressure. Adding to the strain, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also under pressure and recorded outflows, while some CME futures contracts are terminating, which further pressures the price of Bitcoin. Another notable shift is the decline in BTC’s “Hot Supply”—coins held for one week or less. In the last three months, the hot supply dropped from 5.9% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply to a mere 2.8%, a decline of more than 50%. This suggests fewer newly acquired Bitcoins are being actively traded, reducing market liquidity. Bitcoin exchange inflows have also dramatically declined, going from 58,600 BTC / day to 26,900 BTC / day — a 54% decrease. While that may signal less selling pressure, it also means that demand is weaker, as fewer coins are being sent to exchanges to be traded. Bitcoin prepares to test crucial support levels BTC is currently trading at $84,001, holding above the important support at $85,000. Industry analyst “Unknown Trader” stressed that the Bitcoin uptrend is only intact above this level, and BTC only closed recently. Additionally, the asset remains above the 200-day moving average, a historically bullish indicator for long-term price momentum. BTC is back up to the retest of around $85,000 again. If it soars, analysts anticipate a move to the resistance zone of $90,500–$92,441. Yet, this solid rejection level can keep fine-tuning a swoop back up until another retest at $85,000. CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu, for his part, reported potential institutional accumulation. He pointed out how the 30-day EMA of the Coinbase Premium Index is struggling to cross above the one-hundred-day EMA. This crossover happened before BTC’s price rallies typically; therefore, institutional players could be accumulating Bitcoin. As institutional demand continues to pour in, BTC’s price could still rise, prolonging this bull market instead of signalling its top. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

More on Dogecoin Market Cap & ADA Price Forecast,https://thecoinrise.com/will-blockdag-reach-1-after-2380-growth-more-on-dogecoin-market-cap-ada-price-forecast/,"The latest market activity has reignited discussions about Dogecoin’s market cap, with some analysts suggesting DOGE could rise to $2.3 if it ever equaled Elon Musk’s net worth. Meanwhile, Cardano price prediction remains under scrutiny as ADA struggles to break the $0.80 resistance level, which continues to challenge traders. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is not waiting for the market to dictate its path—it’s creating its own momentum. Its presale has already amassed $205 million, and BDAG’s price has soared 2,380% since batch 1. Forecasts indicate BDAG could reach $1 in 2025 and climb to $30 by 2030, making it a strong contender for the next crypto to explode. Dogecoin Market Cap Needs a 1,083% Jump for $2.3—Is It Feasible? Dogecoin’s price speculation continues, with many questioning whether it can hit $2.3 per coin. Achieving this milestone would require the Dogecoin market cap to jump 1,083% to match Elon Musk’s estimated $342.4 billion net worth. DOGE is currently trading at $0.1951, struggling to regain traction after falling from its 2021 peak of $0.7376. Unlike other assets with structured development roadmaps, Dogecoin heavily depends on community enthusiasm and external endorsements. Even if another price surge happens, its long-term sustainability remains uncertain. Cardano Price Prediction: Can ADA Surpass the $0.80 Mark? Cardano continues to test the $0.80 resistance level, a price it has struggled to overcome multiple times. If ADA successfully breaks through, it could target $0.95 or even $1.15. However, its future trajectory remains unclear as maintaining an upward trend has proven difficult. Trading at $0.72, ADA has yet to reclaim its former highs after reaching $1.15. Weak buying momentum, coupled with an RSI reading of 42.54, indicates hesitancy among market participants. If ADA fails to stay above $0.70, a dip toward $0.63 or lower could be possible. BlockDAG’s Rapid Rise— Early Holders Gained 2,380% Returns! Securing a high-growth cryptocurrency at a low price is an opportunity few want to miss. With an overwhelming number of options available, identifying the right project can be difficult. However, BlockDAG has emerged as a standout in 2025. Raising over $205 million and selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG is gaining recognition as a leading cryptocurrency. Its presale has seen rapid expansion, with BDAG’s value skyrocketing 2,380% from its initial $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27, showing growing demand. What’s driving this momentum? Accessibility. BlockDAG is designed for broad adoption, enabling seamless participation in its ecosystem. Over 500,000 individuals are already mining BDAG effortlessly through the X1 Miner App . Additionally, developers benefit from BlockDAG’s WASM compatibility, allowing for smooth smart contract deployment using widely used programming languages. The growing engagement from miners and developers is not only increasing adoption but also strengthening BlockDAG’s ecosystem. Projects with real expansion potential tend to attract sustained interest, and BlockDAG is consistently demonstrating its capacity for long-term growth. With a mainnet launch and 10 major CEX listings approaching, BDAG’s price trajectory remains strong. Predictions suggest $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and a projected $30 by 2030. For those considering entering this growing project, the timing might be right. BDAG coins are currently priced at $0.0248, but demand is pushing batch sales to sell out quickly. As each batch closes, prices are expected to climb even further. Which Cryptocurrency Will Be the Next to Explode? As speculation intensifies over Dogecoin’s market cap potentially reaching new heights and Cardano price prediction hovering near critical resistance, market participants are evaluating their choices. While DOGE’s path to $2.3 remains unclear and ADA continues to struggle at $0.80, BlockDAG is making notable progress through its expanding ecosystem and strong presale performance. Having already secured $205 million in funding and attracting a growing user base, BlockDAG is gaining traction globally. With a mainnet launch and major CEX listings on the horizon, BDAG is well-positioned for a potential $1 price target in 2025, solidifying its status as the next crypto to explode .

If successful, $500 million will be allocated to early-stage crypto investments, while the remaining $500 million will go toward late-stage crypto investments, people familiar with the matter told Fortune Crypto on March 21. Different market conditions to 2022 led to lowered expectations The VC firm, founded by former Coinbase board member and federal prosecutor Katie Haun in 2022, reportedly did not aim for the $1.5 billion it raised in its highly praised funding round in 2022. It cited different market conditions as the reason for the lower target. However, Haun reportedly expects the two new funds will be “oversubscribed.” In March 2022, Haun secured $1.5 billion in the company’s first funding round, shortly after its launch. Haun had also recruited former executives from Airbnb, Coinbase and Google tech incubator Jigsaw . The firm’s latest fundraising round is set to close in June and is expected to be one of the largest in crypto funding in the past two years. Venture capital firm Paradigm and digital asset investment manager Pantera Capital both sought similar amounts in 2024. 137 crypto companies raised a combined $1.11 billion in funding in February 2025. Source: The TIE In June 2024, Paradigm closed an $850 million investment fund , while in April, digital asset investment manager Pantera Capital sought to raise over $1 billion for a new blockchain-focused fund. VCs predict that stablecoins will continue to be a focus in 2025 More recently, Haun Ventures participated in crypto asset management firm Bitwise’s $70 million funding round alongside investors such as Electric Capital, MassMutual, MIT Investment Management Company, and Highland Capital. While the specific focus of Haun's upcoming crypto funds is not publicly known yet, other venture capitalists have recently predicted that stablecoin interest will continue into 2025. Related: Venture capital firms invest $400M in TON blockchain Deng Chao, CEO of institutional asset manager HashKey Capital , recently told Cointelegraph that stablecoins were the strongest proven use case for crypto in 2024. Meanwhile, market analyst Infinity Hedge predicted that crypto VC investment in 2025 would surpass last year’s levels but wouldn’t approach the peak recorded during the 2021 bull market. VC crypto funding in 2021 reached $33.8 billion, while in 2024 it reached $13.6 billion . Cointelegraph reached out to Haun Ventures but did not receive a response by time of publication.

Right now, Qubetics is in Stage 26, with a price of $0.1181 per $TICS token. Here’s where it gets interesting: Over $15.3 million already raised. More than 502 million $TICS tokens sold. Over 23,500 holders and counting. Mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025. Now, let’s talk numbers. If $TICS hits just $1, that’s a 746.04% ROI from today’s price. But analysts are eyeing much bigger milestones: $5 per $TICS = 4,130.23% ROI $6 per $TICS = 4,976.27% ROI $10 per $TICS = 8,360.26% ROI $15 per $TICS = 12,590.69% ROI For perspective, a $100 investment today could turn into $8,360 if $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch. That’s the kind of upside that has the crypto community buzzing. With best crypto presale opportunities dwindling fast, this one is on a serious watchlist. Sonic’s $S Rally: Could It Hit $0.70? Sonic has been one of the most talked-about projects this week, and for good reason. According to recent reports, $S is showing strong upward momentum and could be primed for a surge towards $0.70. Analysts are closely watching key resistance levels, and if it breaks through the current price barriers, a substantial rally could be on the way. Adding to the hype, on-chain metrics suggest increasing whale accumulation, signaling confidence among major players. The trading volume has seen a sharp uptick, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. However, while Sonic is riding this wave, the big question remains—will this momentum hold, or is this just another short-term spike? With speculation running high, Sonic is undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week if the rally continues. But as always, the volatility of the crypto market means timing is everything. Solana’s Latest Move: Tron Integration Expands DeFi and NFTs Solana has been making major headlines with its new integration with Tron, announced by Justin Sun. This move aims to increase access to TRX across Solana’s ecosystem, unlocking new possibilities for DeFi and NFT applications. By bridging the two ecosystems, users can now seamlessly interact with Tron-based assets on Solana, boosting liquidity and cross-chain functionality. This isn’t just a technical update—it’s a strategic move that could further cement Solana’s dominance in the DeFi space. Over the past year, Solana has consistently ranked among the most widely adopted blockchains, and this integration only strengthens its position. If this development attracts more developers and protocols to build within its ecosystem, Solana could see another wave of growth. For those looking to capitalize on major network expansions, Solana’s latest move puts it high on the list of top cryptos to join this week. With DeFi and NFTs continuing to thrive, this update could be a game-changer for the ecosystem. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Stands Out the Most? Sonic and Solana are both making impressive strides—one riding an anticipated price rally, the other expanding its ecosystem with a major integration. Both are strong contenders in their own right, but neither offers the kind of early-stage opportunity seen in Qubetics presale. With its Web3 aggregation model and mind-blowing ROI projections, Qubetics isn’t just competing—it’s redefining what blockchain networks can do, making it one of the top cryptos to join this week. For those looking at crypto presale opportunities, few match the potential of Qubetics right now. As the best crypto presale, it offers both a practical solution to blockchain’s interoperability problem and a presale model designed for exponential growth. While Sonic and Solana remain top-tier projects, Qubetics is the one early buyers are watching closely. The countdown to the next price hike is on—join this crypto presale before the next jump.

The Qubetics presale stands out with its innovative Web3 aggregator model and strong ROI projections, making it one of the top cryptos to join this week. Why is Solana’s Tron integration important? This move expands TRX’s access to DeFi and NFT applications on Solana, increasing cross-chain functionality and boosting liquidity. What is Sonic’s price prediction? Analysts predict $S could rally to $0.70 if it breaks key resistance levels, with increased whale accumulation signaling bullish momentum.

42128493,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61179,1742609758,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto’s Power Players —Meet the 6 Most Popular Cryptocurrencies,https://timestabloid.com/cryptos-power-players-meet-the-6-most-popular-cryptocurrencies/,"Web3 is no longer a whisper—it’s a roaring wave, and some crypto projects are riding it better than others. From ecosystems expanding into AI and real-world assets to Layer 1 chains redefining cross-chain communication, 2025 has already begun to separate the trendsetters from the crowd. The market’s buzz is louder than ever, and if you’re wondering which names are breaking the mold, you’re in the right place. Among all the noise, Qubetics is emerging as a serious contender—and arguably the one making the most headlines right now. With a laser focus on interoperability and a visionary decentralized toolkit, it’s staking its claim among the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025. If you’re scouting the space for strong plays, get ready. These are the crypto powerhouses that deserve your full attention right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Interoperable Superchain of Web3 When it comes to the most popular cryptocurrencies redefining the Web3 landscape, Qubetics tops the list—no questions asked. It’s not just another Layer 1; it’s the first Web3 aggregator blockchain designed to unify ecosystems across Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and beyond. Qubetics’ decentralized architecture is all about one thing—freedom. And that freedom shines most in its interoperability framework. With the QubeQode IDE at its core, developers now have a no-brainer solution to build cross-chain apps without the usual chaos. Think of QubeQode as a one-stop powerhouse where builders can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts, test AI integrations, and make multichain functionality the default. It’s not just innovation—it’s Web3 without borders. For everyday users and businesses, Qubetics is solving real pain points. Imagine a fintech startup in Canada being able to settle payments, run DeFi protocols, and push NFTs across three different chains—all from one dashboard. That’s what Qubetics is doing. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet plugs directly into this system, letting users interact with multiple networks securely and simultaneously. No more chain-switching. No more confusion. It’s seamless crypto like it always should’ve been. That’s why it’s dominating every “most popular cryptocurrencies” list in 2025—and it’s just getting warmed up. Currently in Stage 26 of its crypto presale with a token price of $0.1181, Qubetics is on fire. With over 502 million $TICS sold, 23,500+ token holders, and $15.3M already raised, the hype isn’t slowing down. And here’s the kicker—analysts are buzzing over its ROI potential. At $1, early buyers stand to gain 746.05%. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet launch? That’s a 8,360.47% return. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, it’s clear why this is the best time to grab hold. Among the most popular cryptocurrencies, Qubetics is leading the charge—and making the case for why it’s the Best Crypto to Watch Now. 2. SUI: Speed-Obsessed and Developer-Friendly SUI continues to make headlines in 2025 as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 chains on the market. Built by Mysten Labs, the SUI blockchain leverages the Move programming language, known for its parallel transaction processing. This setup gives it ultra-low latency and insane throughput. In fact, SUI has routinely achieved over 300,000 transactions per second in controlled environments, making it a darling among developers building dApps for gaming and real-time financial services. SUI isn’t just fast—it’s intuitive for devs. It offers programmable object ownership and easy composability, setting it apart from Ethereum’s account-based system. More than just a tech upgrade, SUI is enabling Web3 use cases that feel Web2-smooth. In 2025, as dApps prioritize UX as much as decentralization, SUI’s tech stack is hitting all the right notes. On the adoption front, SUI has also inked partnerships with gaming studios, DeFi projects, and infrastructure providers, positioning itself for long-term relevance. While it’s not new to the scene, its consistent evolution and performance upgrades have made sure it remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market right now. 3. Cardano: Slow and Steady Is Starting to Win Cardano is one of those projects that people love to underestimate—until it surprises everyone. In 2025, the ADA ecosystem has matured into a bustling platform, housing a robust DeFi sector, growing NFT presence, and smart contract capabilities that are finally seeing wide adoption. Cardano’s emphasis on academic research and peer-reviewed development has often made it a slow mover—but that slow burn is paying off. This year, we’ve seen a major uptick in Cardano’s on-chain activity, with a 27% increase in active wallets and a 42% boost in DeFi TVL since the start of Q1. Projects like Indigo Protocol and Minswap are thriving, while the Hydra scaling solution is helping the chain push transaction costs lower than most competitors. That’s helping ADA re-enter top crypto lists—and rightly so. For participants looking to avoid overhyped meme tokens and bet on long-term value, Cardano offers that patient power play. It’s not making explosive moves, but it’s making the right ones. With global partnerships in education, governance, and finance, Cardano continues to prove it belongs on any list of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025. 4. XRP: A Comeback Fueled by Regulation Relief XRP is back—and it’s back with a vengeance. After years of legal limbo with the SEC, Ripple Labs recently scored a huge win with the dismissal of key charges. That cleared the fog hanging over XRP and triggered a rally that pushed the token back above the $0.75 mark. Community sentiment is strong again, and global remittance firms are returning to test RippleNet for cross-border payments. Beyond the court wins, Ripple is focused on growing its footprint in CBDC development. Several central banks are currently piloting digital currencies using Ripple’s infrastructure, further solidifying XRP’s place in the Web3 finance ecosystem. That makes it more than just a speculative token—it’s a serious utility play. As XRP climbs back into the top ten by market cap, it’s reclaiming its title as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies of this cycle. With regulatory clarity, expanding use cases, and renewed momentum, XRP’s comeback story might just be one of 2025’s best narratives. 5. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Finds Its Moment Cosmos is finally getting the recognition it deserves. In 2025, its vision of interoperable blockchains is no longer just theory—it’s reality. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is now widely adopted, and dozens of sovereign blockchains are operating within the Cosmos Hub. As DeFi and NFT apps go multichain, Cosmos is the quiet backbone making everything connect. This isn’t just about tech—it’s about experience. For users and devs, Cosmos provides seamless cross-chain transactions without relying on wrapped tokens or sketchy bridges. That’s a massive deal in a post-bridge-hack world, and it’s why developers are flocking to the ecosystem. With ATOM now serving as both a governance token and staking asset across several zones, its utility is stronger than ever. As more chains plug into Cosmos, its influence will only grow. For anyone tracking the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2025, Cosmos is one name that deserves serious attention. 6. Polkadot: Cross-Chain Connectivity Done Right Polkadot was built for a future where blockchains talk to each other—and that future is now. Its relay chain and parachain structure are proving to be incredibly efficient for hosting niche projects with specific needs. In 2025, we’re seeing an influx of real-world applications launching on Polkadot, from identity verification platforms to supply chain tracking dApps. What’s most exciting is how flexible the parachain model has become. It allows developers to experiment with different consensus algorithms and fee structures while still enjoying the shared security of the Polkadot network. This makes DOT a serious contender in the cross-chain infrastructure space. Though DOT hasn’t had the wild pumps of meme coins, its consistency, developer activity, and scalability potential make it a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. That’s why Polkadot remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies being watched by serious players this year. Conclusion: The Decentralized Wallet That Could Define Your Crypto Future If you’re tracking the most popular cryptocurrencies with long-term upside, it’s impossible to overlook the consistent dominance of Qubetics. Its ability to unify chains, streamline decentralized development, and provide unmatched user experience through its non-custodial multi-chain wallet makes it more than just another altcoin—it’s a next-gen infrastructure layer. And the fact that it’s still in presale makes it the best crypto to watch now. Backed by a powerful suite of interoperable tools, Qubetics is rapidly becoming the go-to ecosystem for developers and users alike. Its real-time wallet integration across multiple networks eliminates the friction that’s plagued DeFi, making it ideal for both retail and enterprise adoption. With over $15.2M already raised and more than 501M $TICS sold, the market’s confidence is already showing. At $0.1181 per $TICS, the numbers speak for themselves. A $1 price tag brings 746.05% ROI. At $10? Over 8,360.47%. With a mainnet launch coming in Q2 2025, the timing couldn’t be better. If you’ve been scanning for the most popular cryptocurrencies that still offer ground-floor access, this is your cue to dive in. And if you’re serious about gains? It’s time to join the Qubetics presale before this rocket leaves the launchpad. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other altcoins in 2025? Qubetics stands out due to its Web3 aggregator model, which lets it unify multiple leading blockchains under one ecosystem. Its focus on real-world usability—especially with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet and QubeQode IDE—offers developers and users unmatched flexibility and scalability. Is Qubetics still in presale? Yes, Qubetics is currently in Stage 26 of its presale with a token price of $0.1181. With over 502 million $TICS sold and $15.3 million raised, the project is gaining massive momentum. Each presale stage lasts 7 days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at 12 AM. Why is Qubetics considered one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025? Qubetics is earning that title by solving some of Web3’s most persistent problems—fragmented chains, clunky UX, and limited scalability. Its real-time interoperability, wallet simplicity, and presale value have made it a standout among altcoins gaining serious traction in 2025.

He describes the cryptocurrency’s current price action as a “ Bermuda Triangle or boredom phase” — a period where the market moves slowly or sideways, fuelling doubt and uncertainty among traders and investors before a price rally. XRP Price Boredom Phase To Trigger $27 Surge Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned that the XRP price is in a Bermuda Triangle, a boredom phase characterized by price stagnation and market uncertainty designed to shake out weak hands before a significant price move. According to his prediction, while traders and investors are growing impatient and questioning why XRP has not experienced any notable price increases, this phase is merely a set-up for a strong rally toward $27. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reignites $100 XRP Price Target, What You Should Know Following a predicted downturn in mid-March, XRP has struggled to recover its bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency was one of the top-performing altcoins in this bull cycle, jumping from a $0.5 low to over $3 for the first time in seven years. Due to the current market decline, Egrag Crypto revealed that many traders are now wondering why “XRP hasn’t mooned.” The analyst explained that this price decline was intentional, forcing investors to second-guess themselves and make emotional trading decisions. He also disclosed that the XRP market is now filled with ‘What ifs’, as Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) cloud traders’ minds. Moreover, concerns over potential dips to $1.60 or $1.30 could push investors to panic-sell or attempt risky trades. The analyst also revealed that the XRP market is currently controlled by sharks and larger players, also called Whales. These large holders tend to influence price movements, triggering stop-losses and shaking out weak hands before a major rally. Egrag Crypto warns that new investors and traders are especially vulnerable, as frustration and boredom can lead to making financial mistakes. He disclosed that the best strategy to implement during this current market phase is to do nothing. He suggested investors stay disciplined and patient, recognizing that boredom phases are normal in crypto market cycles. The analyst also urged investors to remain vigilant and hold their positions while accumulating at ideal prices rather than react impulsively to rapid changes in the market. XRP Breakout Point Hints At New ATH In other analyses, market expert ‘Steph Is Crypto’ has announced that XRP is currently retesting breakout levels to trigger a surge to a fresh ATH. The analyst’s price chart shows a Falling Wedge pattern which has been broken above the resistance at the upper trend line. Related Reading: XRP Threatens Death Cross On 4-Hour Chart, Is Another Crash Coming? After breaking out, XRP now retests this level to confirm a larger upward move. The large green arrow on the chart points to the cryptocurrency’s projected price target, suggesting a bullish continuation if the Falling Wedge breakout holds. XRP’s upside potential is predicted to be $4 or higher if its bullish momentum is maintained. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $2.4, reflecting a 3.5% decline in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. If its price rises to $4, it would represent a significant 66.7% increase from current levels.

But now, bipartisan support for cryptocurrency is growing, boosting the chances of the stablecoin bill passing. As per a latest Bloomberg report, the Financial Services Committee will review the stablecoin bill on April 2. This development highlights the growing influence of the cryptocurrency industry in Washington, D.C., bolstered by bipartisan support from figures like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and significant campaign contributions that have strengthened industry allies. ​ GENIUS Act Gets Bipartisan Support The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and enhance consumer protections, has garnered support from both Republicans and Democrats. A key House Committee is expected to vote in favor of the bill, signaling strong momentum for its approval. The act aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the bill, which has quickly gained support from both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to move the Genius Act forward , with five Democrats joining the Republican majority in backing it. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers can choose between federal or state charters, depending on their market size. Foreign issuers will also need to follow U.S. rules on reserves, anti-money laundering, and sanctions compliance, and liwuiduty. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan noted, “The reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : IMF Recognizes Cryptocurrencies in Global Economic Data for the First Time , Chairman French Hill, along with many analysts and crypto supporters, believes the stablecoin market needs regulation. He argues that regulating stablecoins would strengthen the dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms have also pushed for stablecoins as a way to boost financial inclusion and offer cheaper, faster transactions. Criticisms Prevail However, Top Democrat Maxine Waters and Senator Elizabeth Warren worry that the bill doesn’t do enough to protect consumers. Besides, they also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk’s X or Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins. While other critics are concerned that without FDIC insurance for stablecoins, users could face big losses if a token crashes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recent transactions linked to Binance’s hot wallet highlight major players’ involvement. PEPE’s price dips by 3.86%, but trading activity remains moderate with a 19.47% ratio. The PEPE token market saw a surge in activity, with a notable whale increasing their holdings despite PEPE price dip. This, along with significant transfers involving Binance’s hot wallet, suggests a rising demand for the token. The PEPE whale, known for its “100% winning rate,” kept on accumulating tokens, even as the price fell. Despite a 55.6% decrease in the value of their initial position, this whale, now holding 1.134 trillion PEPE tokens, continued to add to their holdings. This approach aligns with their past strategy of buying more during market downturns, likely based on a long-term perspective. The PEPE token has experienced unusual movements recently, with large-scale transactions and position increases drawing attention. An Ethereum address, identified as “PEPE Band Winning Rate 100% Whale,” has been expanding its holdings despite ongoing market losses.

Stablecoin Supply Is Displaying A Different Pattern In This Bitcoin Downturn In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has shared about how the latest trend in the stablecoin circulating supply has been looking. “Stablecoins” are cryptocurrencies that track the price of a fiat currency, with USD being by far the most popular choice. These tokens run on multiple networks, but in the context of the current topic, only the Ethereum-based ones are of interest. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7% After Surge In Network Activity & Whale Buying Stablecoins are, by nature, relatively ‘stable’ in value, so the investors generally buy into these coins whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Holders who invest into stables, though, usually plan to eventually go back into the volatile side of the sector. For if they didn’t, they would have exited into fiat instead. Once these traders feel the time is right, they use their stablecoins to swap into Bitcoin or whatever desired coin. This shift naturally applies a buying pressure to the price of the asset. Due to the potential of the stablecoins to act as dry powder for the volatile cryptocurrencies, these assets are often looked at as the ‘available’ buy supply of the sector. As such, an increase in its value may be considered as a bullish sign. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant, which shows the trend in the supply of the ERC-20 stablecoins over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoin supply has been on the rise during the last few months, which suggests capital has been flowing into these fiat-tied tokens. This rise in the metric has come as Bitcoin has been going through a phase of bearish momentum. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted the trend that the indicator followed during BTC’s bearish period from last year. It would seem that the stablecoin supply was moving sideways back then. This would imply that as BTC corrected in 2024, a net amount of capital flowed out of the sector as if the capital was rotating into the stablecoins instead, their supply would have registered an increase. This time around, however, a rotation of capital has indeed been occurring, with these stablecoin buyers potentially waiting on the sidelines for a profitable entry point. Of course, this current setup isn’t the most bullish one, either; that would have been the case if both the Bitcoin market cap and the stablecoin supply rose simultaneously. Related Reading: Here’s Where Support & Resistance Lies For Solana, Based On On-Chain Data Nonetheless, the fact that the stablecoins haven’t been shrinking during this market downturn could still be taken as an optimistic sign for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen yet another failed recovery rally as its price has dropped back to $84,000, after having broken above $87,000 just earlier.

Even amidst a significant $81.5 billion legal face-off with crypto giant Binance, the Nigerian government is keen to project an image of openness to crypto businesses. But what does this apparent contradiction truly mean for the future of Nigeria crypto regulation and the broader digital asset landscape in Africa’s largest economy? Decoding Nigeria’s Crypto Regulation Approach Information Minister Mohammed Idris has been vocal in clarifying Nigeria’s position. It’s not about slamming the door on crypto innovation, but rather about establishing a robust regulatory framework. This stance emerges even as the country navigates a high-profile dispute with Binance, showcasing a nuanced approach to digital assets. The core message is clear: Nigeria is aiming for controlled growth, not outright prohibition of the burgeoning crypto sector. This balanced approach is critical for fostering trust and attracting legitimate crypto businesses while safeguarding against illicit activities. Here’s a breakdown of Nigeria’s regulatory focus: Emphasis on Regulation, Not Restriction: The government aims to create a safe and regulated environment for crypto operations. Recent Regulatory Tightening: New rules and transaction taxes have been introduced, signaling a move towards stricter oversight. Enforcement Challenges: Widespread peer-to-peer (P2P) trading poses a challenge to the effective implementation of these regulations. Despite these hurdles, Nigeria’s intent is clear – to channel the energy of its massive crypto adoption Nigeria rate into a structured and beneficial ecosystem. Why Nigeria Remains a Crypto Hotspot: Unveiling the Adoption Numbers Nigeria’s position as a global leader in crypto adoption is undeniable. The numbers speak volumes: Global Rank: Nigeria proudly holds the second position worldwide in terms of crypto adoption. Massive Inflows: A staggering $59 billion in cryptocurrency was received by Nigerians within a single year, according to Chainalysis. This phenomenal level of adoption highlights the critical role of crypto in the Nigerian economy. Factors driving this surge include: Factor Description Currency Devaluation Crypto offers a hedge against the fluctuating value of the Naira. Remittance Efficiency Cryptocurrencies provide faster and cheaper channels for international money transfers. Financial Inclusion Crypto offers access to financial services for the unbanked population. Tech-Savvy Population Nigeria boasts a young and digitally adept population readily adopting new technologies. These elements combine to create a fertile ground for cryptocurrency news Nigeria and its widespread integration into daily financial life. The Binance Nigeria Lawsuit: Navigating Troubled Waters The ongoing $81.5 billion lawsuit against Binance injects a layer of complexity into Nigeria’s crypto narrative. This legal action underscores the government’s resolve to enforce regulations and hold crypto exchanges accountable. The specifics of the Binance Nigeria lawsuit are still unfolding, but it serves as a potent reminder to all crypto platforms operating in Nigeria – compliance is non-negotiable. Key takeaways from the Binance situation: Enforcement Focus: Nigeria is serious about enforcing its crypto regulations. Accountability for Exchanges: Crypto platforms will be held responsible for operating within the legal framework. Precedent Setting: This case could set a precedent for how other nations approach regulatory enforcement with global crypto exchanges. Opportunities for Crypto Business Nigeria: A Path Forward Despite the regulatory tightening and the Binance dispute, Nigeria’s message of openness to crypto business Nigeria is significant. For legitimate crypto ventures, this signals potential opportunities within a regulated environment. The key lies in understanding and adhering to the evolving regulatory landscape. Businesses that prioritize compliance and transparency are likely to find a welcoming, albeit regulated, market in Nigeria. Actionable insights for crypto businesses considering Nigeria: Stay Informed: Closely monitor regulatory updates and adapt operations accordingly. Prioritize Compliance: Implement robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures. Engage with Regulators: Proactively communicate with Nigerian regulatory bodies to foster understanding and collaboration. Focus on Education: Contribute to user education to promote responsible crypto adoption. Nigeria’s Crypto Crossroads: Balancing Innovation and Oversight Nigeria stands at a fascinating crossroads in its crypto journey. The nation’s deep-seated crypto enthusiasm is undeniable, yet the need for responsible regulation is equally pressing. The government’s current stance – signaling openness while enforcing stricter rules – reflects this delicate balancing act. Whether Nigeria can successfully navigate this complex terrain and emerge as a model for regulated crypto growth in Africa remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Nigeria’s crypto story is far from over, and its next chapters will be pivotal for the future of digital finance on the continent and beyond.

42132299,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142383,1742617539,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Meta’s Lucrative Llama AI Revenue Sharing Agreements Spark Controversy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-llama-ai-revenue-sharing/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Just when you thought you had the tech giants figured out, a new revelation drops. Meta, the behemoth behind Facebook and Instagram, is making headlines again, but this time, it’s about their seemingly ‘open-source’ Llama AI model. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg said selling access to Llama wasn’t their business model? Well, a recent court filing suggests otherwise. Let’s dive into the juicy details of Meta’s AI Model Revenue strategy and what it means for the future of open AI. The Shocking Truth: Meta’s Secret AI Partnerships and Revenue Streams According to an unredacted court filing in the Kadrey v. Meta copyright lawsuit, Meta isn’t just giving away its Llama AI models for free. They’re actually engaging in revenue sharing agreements with companies that host these models. This bombshell contradicts Zuckerberg’s previous statements and raises questions about Meta’s true intentions with its open-source AI initiative. Here’s the breakdown of what we know: Revenue Sharing is Real: The court filing explicitly states that Meta “shares a percentage of the revenue” generated by companies hosting Llama models. This is a direct contradiction to the narrative that Llama was purely an open-source, non-profit endeavor for Meta. Hosts Remain Mysterious (For Now): The filing doesn’t name names, but Meta has previously listed several AI Partnerships in blog posts. These include major players like AWS, Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake. It’s highly likely some of these are involved in the revenue-sharing agreements. Open Source with a Catch?: Developers can still download and run Llama models independently. However, using host partners offers convenience and additional services, potentially making them the preferred route for many and thus generating revenue for both hosts and, indirectly, Meta. This revelation adds a layer of complexity to the Open Source AI landscape. Is Meta truly committed to open source, or is Llama a strategic play to establish dominance and generate income through less direct means? Zuckerberg AI Strategy : From Open Source Savior to Revenue-Focused Player? Let’s rewind a bit. Zuckerberg himself hinted at monetization possibilities for Llama in an April earnings call, mentioning licensing, business messaging services, and even ads within “AI interactions.” However, the emphasis shifted later towards the community benefits and model improvements derived from open sourcing Llama. During Meta’s Q3 2024 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated, “I think it’s good business for us to do this in an open way… It makes our products better rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was kind of standardizing around in the industry.” This suggested a long-term, indirect benefit approach, focusing on industry standardization and product improvement, rather than immediate financial gains from Llama itself. But the court filing paints a different picture. It suggests a more direct and immediate monetization strategy through AI Model Revenue sharing. This raises a crucial question: Is Meta’s Zuckerberg AI Strategy evolving, or was the open-source narrative partially a smokescreen? Key Takeaways on Meta’s Llama Revenue Sharing: Contradiction of Public Statements: The revenue sharing agreements directly contradict previous public statements suggesting Llama monetization wasn’t Meta’s primary goal. Strategic Financial Play: This move indicates a calculated financial strategy behind Llama, potentially to offset massive AI investments. Implications for Open Source: It prompts a re-evaluation of what “open source” means when major corporations are involved. Is it truly about community and collaboration, or are there always underlying business motives? Fueling the Lawsuit: The revenue sharing revelation adds fuel to the fire of the Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit, which accuses Meta of training Llama on pirated ebooks and facilitating copyright infringement. The Copyright Controversy: Does AI Model Revenue Justify Questionable Training Data? The Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit is central to this unfolding story. Plaintiffs allege that Meta trained Llama on “hundreds of terabytes of pirated ebooks,” obtained through questionable torrenting methods. They argue that Meta not only used pirated works but also facilitated further infringement by “seeding” these works. The fact that Meta is now generating AI Model Revenue from Llama becomes particularly significant in this context. Plaintiffs can argue that Meta is profiting directly from a model allegedly built on illegally obtained copyrighted material. This could strengthen their case and increase the pressure on Meta. Why This Matters for the Crypto and Tech World For those in the crypto and decentralized tech space, this Meta Llama AI revenue sharing story has several layers of relevance: Centralization vs. Decentralization in AI: While Llama is open source, its development and monetization are still controlled by a centralized entity, Meta. This contrasts with the ethos of decentralization often championed in the crypto world. Business Models for Open Source: The Llama case highlights the complex business models emerging around open-source AI. It raises questions about sustainability and ethical considerations when large corporations are involved. Transparency and Accountability: The initial discrepancy between Zuckerberg’s statements and the revealed revenue sharing agreements underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the tech industry, especially concerning powerful AI technologies. Legal and Ethical Implications of AI Training Data: The copyright lawsuit and the reliance on potentially pirated data bring to the forefront the crucial legal and ethical questions surrounding AI training datasets. This is a critical discussion for the future of AI development. What’s Next for Meta and Llama? Meta is doubling down on AI, projecting a massive $60 billion-$80 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, primarily for data centers and AI development teams. They are also reportedly considering a subscription service for Meta AI, aiming to offset these costs. The AI Partnerships and revenue sharing agreements for Llama are likely to become even more critical for Meta as they ramp up their AI investments. The company is clearly looking for ways to monetize its AI efforts, even within the framework of open-source initiatives. However, the Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit and the questions surrounding Llama’s training data remain significant challenges. How Meta navigates these legal and ethical issues will be crucial for its long-term AI strategy and its reputation in the tech community. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Open Source and Big Tech The revelation of Meta’s Llama AI revenue sharing agreements is a pivotal moment. It forces us to reconsider the narratives surrounding open-source AI and the motivations of big tech companies in this space. While open source can foster innovation and collaboration, it’s clear that financial considerations and strategic business objectives are still very much in play. As Meta continues to invest heavily in AI and explore various monetization strategies, the tech world will be watching closely. The Llama story is a powerful reminder that in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, the lines between open source, commercial interests, and ethical considerations are becoming increasingly blurred.

The digital currency is now trading at $0.99, marking a gain of more than 5% in the last day. This upward momentum has many wondering if Pi Network can continue to push beyond the $1 level and continue its climb. Next Target: $1.35, but $1.20 Stands as a Major Hurdle Despite recent gains, Pi Coin faces a hurdle at $1.20. Breaking through this resistance could see the coin targeting the $1.35 level, a critical milestone. However, it is far from easy as Pi has shown volatility. If it manages to surpass the $1.90 mark, analysts believe a rally towards $3 could be possible. Market Cap Drop: Pi Coin’s Recent Struggles In the past week, Pi Coin’s market position has been shaky. The cryptocurrency has dropped dramatically from the 11th to the 21st spot by market cap. While this decline is concerning, it’s important to note that Pi still holds potential for recovery. Binance Snub: Could it Affect Pi’s Growth? One of the major contributing factors to Pi’s recent market dip is Binance’s decision not to include Pi Coin in their latest listing vote. Binance ran a poll, and an overwhelming 86% of participants voted in favor of listing Pi. https://twitter.com/Time_and_Trade/status/1902792445630484792 Despite this support, Binance Binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange Cryptocurrencies Trading App Cryptocurrency investment has yet to make a move, and this delay may be costing both Pi and Binance in terms of trading volume and revenue. According to analyst Kim Wong, Pi’s average 24-hour trading volume is around $500 million, making it a considerable asset that Binance could capitalize on. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: Will Binance Ever List Pi Coin?

For now, the crypto community believes that Pi’s listing will happen eventually, but there’s no need for frantic demands or negotiations. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The market saw a high surge and a drastic fall within the last three months. However, topping these uncertain moments is the Dogecoin price, which has continued falling, reaching a new five-month low at $0.1661. But in the uncertain market, some altcoins could be the gold in the rough. Notable choices fueling the altcoin optimism include the Cardano coin and the new player, Remittix. But could an investment in the Remittix and Cardano coins help investors erase the loss in the Dogecoin price over the last few months? Here is a careful analysis of this new direction to help investors make the right choice in the next quarter. Can The Dogecoin Price Reach a Major Milestone In 2025? Following the rise in meme coins in the first quarter of 2025, the Dogecoin price should be nearing a high by the end of the quarter, but this has not been so. Instead, the Dogecoin price has continued downward, hitting a low of about 50% in the last 90 days. This has since raised the panic selling to a record high among Dogecoin investors. The price of the number one meme coin has continued dropping below its strong support, giving way to a strong resistance above it in the last few months. However, despite the high hit on the Dogecoin price, it has remained the biggest meme coin by market cap, raising hope of a potential surge soon. The corresponding drop that has hit other meme coins is why the Dogecoin continues to appear as though it is unmoving. However, the Dogecoin market cap has fallen more than 36% in the last 30 days, from $38B to $24B. Also, the current formation on the Dogecoin price chart shows it is still maintaining a downtrend, which could pose a significant threat to potential price growth soon. Why Remittix Could Follow Cardano On A Surge This Next Quarter There has been a growing trend in crypto payment lately, pushing innovations in the last few months. These rising solutions have continued to receive widespread acceptance, as Cardano rose over 300% between last November and January this year. However, Remittix seems to present the latest innovation in this sector, leading to growing optimism around the Remittix token in the last few months. The Remittix token presale has continued capturing the attention of new and seasoned investors in the crypto world, already selling over 500,000,000 tokens in the last few weeks. With the fast-growing interest in this new altcoin, analysts have continued to wonder how high this token might be climbing this year, with some analysts projecting up to 100x . The solution Remittix is ushering into the crypto payment sector allows users to send crypto and receive it as a FIAT payment directly into a bank account. The Remittix solution is projected to revolutionize the crypto market, opening up a new dimension and use case for cryptocurrencies. As the Remittix exchange continues to usher in a new dimension for crypto users to see new ways to make their crypto assets more valuable, the Remittix token is becoming a top investment option. Hence, there is rising interest from top market players as many rush to leverage the Remittix presale as an opportunity to invest early in the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto adoption is just starting and could hit a new high by the next quarter as more countries follow in the footsteps of the US, creating a strategic crypto reserve. Don’t miss the opportunity to start today with the Remittix presale, which offers the chance to buy at a low price before the price booms.

42132649,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142391,1742618154,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC’s Crypto Regulation Fiasco: a16z Executive Unveils ‘Failed’ Approach,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crypto-regulation-failed-approach/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to regulatory scrutiny, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has often been at the forefront of these discussions. But has their approach been effective? According to Miles Jennings, general counsel at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a prominent venture capital firm deeply invested in crypto, the answer is a resounding no. Jennings recently attended the SEC’s crypto task force roundtable and didn’t mince words, labeling the SEC’s past enforcement-based regulatory strategy as a complete failure. Let’s dive into why a leading voice in the crypto space is so critical of the SEC’s methods and what this could mean for the future of digital assets. Decoding the Criticism: Why ‘Failed’ SEC Crypto Regulation ? Jennings’ blunt assessment raises a crucial question: what exactly went wrong with the SEC’s approach to SEC crypto regulation ? He argues that the primary goals of securities regulation – investor protection, fostering capital formation, and ensuring efficient markets – were simply not achieved under the previous administration’s enforcement-heavy strategy. To understand this criticism better, let’s break down each of these goals: Investor Protection: The cornerstone of securities regulation. The idea is to safeguard investors from fraud, manipulation, and inadequate disclosure. Was the SEC’s enforcement approach successful in protecting crypto investors? Capital Formation: A healthy regulatory environment should encourage innovation and growth by allowing companies to raise capital efficiently. Did the SEC’s actions facilitate or hinder capital formation in the crypto space? Efficient Markets: Regulations should contribute to fair, orderly, and efficient markets where prices accurately reflect information. Did the SEC’s approach lead to more efficient crypto markets? Jennings contends that the answer to these questions, when considering the SEC’s past enforcement-focused approach, is largely negative. He suggests that instead of achieving these goals, the SEC’s actions may have inadvertently created more problems than solutions. This perspective challenges the very foundation of the SEC’s regulatory strategy in the crypto sector. The Bone of Contention: Crypto Enforcement as the Primary Tool The core of Jennings’ critique lies in the SEC’s reliance on crypto enforcement as its primary regulatory tool. Instead of proactively establishing clear guidelines and frameworks for the crypto industry to operate within, the SEC, according to this view, primarily focused on enforcement actions – investigating and penalizing companies for alleged violations of securities laws. Here’s a simplified look at the two contrasting approaches: Approach Characteristics Potential Outcomes Enforcement-Based Regulation (as criticized by Jennings) Reactive Focus on penalties and investigations Lack of clear upfront guidance Can create uncertainty and fear in the market May deter bad actors, but also stifle innovation Can lead to costly legal battles and resource drain Uncertainty can drive businesses overseas Potentially fails to achieve long-term investor protection and market efficiency Proactive Regulatory Framework Forward-looking and clear Establishes rules of the road Focuses on guidance and clarity Aims to foster innovation within a regulatory perimeter Encourages responsible innovation and growth Reduces uncertainty and promotes investment Can lead to more efficient and compliant markets Potentially better achieves long-term investor protection and market efficiency Jennings and others who share his view argue that the SEC’s emphasis on crypto enforcement created a climate of fear and uncertainty within the crypto industry. Companies were left guessing about the regulatory boundaries, potentially hindering innovation and driving businesses to jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks. Investor Protection : Did Enforcement Deliver? A central argument against the SEC’s enforcement-based approach is that it arguably failed to deliver on its promise of investor protection in the crypto space. While enforcement actions can punish wrongdoers after the fact, critics argue they are less effective at preventing harm in the first place. Consider these points regarding investor protection in the context of the SEC’s enforcement strategy: Reactive vs. Proactive Protection: Enforcement is inherently reactive. It addresses problems after they occur. Proactive measures, such as clear regulations and investor education, could potentially prevent issues before they arise. Complexity of Crypto: The crypto space is rapidly evolving and technically complex. Enforcement actions often lag behind innovation, and may not effectively address the nuances of new technologies and business models. Uncertainty Discourages Compliance: When regulations are unclear and enforcement is the primary communication tool, it can be difficult for businesses to understand how to comply. This uncertainty can inadvertently increase risks for investors. Focus on Securities Laws: The SEC primarily enforces securities laws, which may not be perfectly suited to address all the risks inherent in the crypto ecosystem. A broader, more tailored regulatory framework might be needed for comprehensive investor protection . Jennings’ assertion suggests that a more balanced approach, combining clear regulatory guidelines with targeted enforcement, might be more effective in achieving genuine investor protection in the long run. Capital Formation and Market Efficiency: The Chilling Effect? Beyond investor protection , Jennings also argues that the SEC’s approach failed to foster capital formation and efficient markets within the crypto industry. The argument here is that regulatory uncertainty and the fear of enforcement actions can stifle innovation and investment. Here’s how the enforcement-heavy approach might have negatively impacted capital formation and market efficiency: Discouraging Innovation: Startups and entrepreneurs may be hesitant to build and innovate in the crypto space if they face a high risk of facing SEC enforcement actions due to unclear rules. Driving Capital Offshore: Companies seeking to raise capital in the crypto space might choose to incorporate and operate in jurisdictions with more crypto-friendly regulations, leading to a loss of potential economic benefits for the US. Increased Compliance Costs: Navigating regulatory uncertainty and preparing for potential enforcement actions can be expensive and time-consuming for businesses, diverting resources away from innovation and growth. Market Inefficiency: Regulatory uncertainty can lead to market fragmentation and inefficiencies. For example, different exchanges and platforms might adopt varying compliance standards due to a lack of clear regulatory guidance. By creating a less welcoming environment for crypto innovation, the SEC’s enforcement-focused strategy, according to critics, may have inadvertently hindered capital formation and the development of truly efficient markets in the digital asset space. What’s Next? Moving Beyond Enforcement-Only Miles Jennings’ comments, delivered at an SEC roundtable, highlight a growing sentiment within the crypto industry: a shift away from a purely enforcement-based regulatory approach is needed. The call is for a more proactive, clear, and balanced framework that fosters innovation while still ensuring investor protection and market integrity. What could a more effective approach look like? Clear Regulatory Guidelines: Providing clear rules and frameworks for different types of crypto assets and activities is crucial. This would reduce uncertainty and allow businesses to operate with greater clarity and confidence. Dialogue and Collaboration: Open communication and collaboration between regulators and the crypto industry are essential. Roundtables like the one Jennings attended are a step in the right direction, but ongoing dialogue is needed. Tailored Regulation: Recognizing the diversity within the crypto space is important. Regulations should be tailored to different types of crypto assets and activities, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. Focus on Education and Guidance: In addition to enforcement, regulators should also focus on educating investors and providing guidance to businesses on how to comply with regulations. The criticism from a prominent figure like a16z’s general counsel underscores the urgency for a re-evaluation of the SEC’s crypto regulatory strategy. The future of the crypto industry, particularly in the US, may depend on finding a more effective and balanced path forward – one that encourages innovation, fosters capital formation , ensures efficient markets , and genuinely protects investors. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto Regulation Miles Jennings’ remarks serve as a stark reminder that the debate around crypto regulation is far from settled. His assessment that the SEC’s enforcement-based approach has “failed” is a powerful statement from a key player in the crypto investment world. It highlights the need for a more nuanced and effective regulatory strategy – one that moves beyond solely relying on enforcement and embraces clarity, collaboration, and a genuine understanding of the unique characteristics of the crypto industry. The path forward requires a delicate balance, fostering innovation while safeguarding investors and ensuring market integrity. The coming years will be crucial in determining whether regulators and the crypto industry can forge a constructive path that unlocks the potential of digital assets while mitigating their risks.

While the move may have sparked optimism, many investors’ reactions toward BTC were negative as they continued to bet on a sustained decline, creating a bearish outlook for the asset. Whale Shorting Activity On The Rise As Bitcoin’s price struggles to break through key resistance levels, a worrying shift has been cited among big investors or whales. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data platform reveals rising pessimism among these investors as they bet on an extension of the ongoing correction. BTC recently saw a brief surge to the $87,000 level even as volatility grows in the broader crypto market. However, the upward move was met with strong resistance as whale holders massively opened short positions after the upswing. “Whales Enter Short Positions on Bitcoin as Leverage Increases,” the platform stated. Despite the brief move to the $87,000 mark, these big investors have chosen to close their long positions and open more shorts. Given the ongoing volatility of the market , this shift has raised questions about BTC’s prospects in the short term. Whale participation often influences price trajectory, which could cause Bitcoin to continue dropping in the upcoming weeks. However, if buying pressure intensifies at critical support zones and creates a strong defense, BTC may move in an upward direction. Furthermore, Alphractal points to a rise in market leverage. After examining the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest/Market Cap Ratio, the platform noted that the metric is rising again, reflecting growing leverage. According to the platform, this increase in market leverage might set off a fresh round of volatility, resulting in further mass liquidations. On-chain data have also revealed substantial sell pressure among Bitcoin large investors, triggering concerns about potential downside risks . Leading market intelligence and data analytics platform IntoTheBlock, outlined a decrease in whale balances as the market fluctuates. Looking at the chart, BTC whales seem to have been trending downward for almost a year. However, data from March suggests a potential reversal as whales now hold about 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, signaling renewed accumulation. BTC’s Price Trading Within Key Chart Pattern The renewed accumulation by BTC whales raises the likelihood of a price reversal from the ongoing downtrend. This price reversal could be part of a larger trend as Captain Faibik, a crypto analyst and investor predicts an impending surge to its current all-time high. His prediction is supported by a key chart pattern, particularly the Falling Wedge formation. Captain Faibik believes that BTC could consolidate within the key pattern for the next 10 to 15 days before undergoing a huge bullish breakout. When this breakout happens, Bitcoin’s price will rally significantly to the $109,000 mark, reigniting the bull market.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest/Market Cap Ratio|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Captain Faibik|Falling Wedge Pattern|IntoTheBlock,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-22 05:00:14

Notably, Coinbase (COIN), a leading U.S. exchange, is in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, a major global derivatives exchange, according to Bloomberg report. The companies have already informed Dubai regulators, where Deribit is licensed, about the ongoing discussions. Deal Not Finalised Yet If Coinbase successfully acquires Deribit, it would take over Deribit’s operating license. While talks are still happening, no deal has been finalized yet. Earlier this year, Deribit’s value was estimated between $4 billion and $5 billion. This move would enhance Coinbase’s existing derivatives platform, which currently focuses on futures. In 2024, Deribit saw nearly $1.2 trillion in trading volume—almost double the previous year’s total. Coinbase recently announced plans to offer 24/7 futures trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum to attract more investors to its platform. Coinbase (COIN), known for spot trading, aims to expand into the lucrative crypto derivatives market by acquiring Deribit, the largest platform for trading Bitcoin and Ether options. The ongoing talks align with Kraken, a competitor, which recently announced plans to acquire the derivatives platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, enabling it to offer U.S. crypto derivatives. Kraken also plans to go public by Q1 2026, according to Bloomberg. Coinbase Seeks To Expand Its Derivatives Business Coinbase is also expanding its derivatives business while it explores the acquisition of Deribit. On March 15, it filed with the CFTC to offer futures for Cardano (ADA) and Natural Gas (NGS). If approved, trading could begin by March 31. This comes after launching Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR) futures. Coinbase offers derivatives for 92 assets globally, with fewer available in the U.S., according to its 2024 report. In January, Robinhood jumped into the crypto futures game, aiming to challenge Coinbase. Meanwhile, CME Group, the world’s biggest derivatives exchange, saw a massive 300% surge in crypto derivatives trading, reaching around $10 billion in daily volume during Q4 2024. .",News|Crypto news|Exchange News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-22 05:10:04

Here is the list of altcoins that have seen an increase in whale activity compared to a week ago, according to analysts, and the increase in whale activity in the last week: PancakeSwap (CAKE) – 439.71% USD Coin (USDC) – 407.55% HEX (HEX) – 275% Mantle (MNT) – 144.44% Dai [on BNB network] (DAI) – 142.86% WETH [On Optimism Network] (WETH) – 130.17% WhiteBIT Token (WBT) – 100% USD Coin (USDC) – 100% Dai [on Avalanche network] (DAI) – 100% UNUS SED LEO (LEO) – 100% Related News: Clear Date Set in the Cryptocurrency Development That Donald Trump Issued a Strict Order Remarkably, CAKE, which has the lowest market value among these 10 altcoins, has recently attracted whales in terms of activity. In addition, CAKE was the only altcoin on the list to gain value in the last day. However, only altcoins with a total market value of $500 million were evaluated in this list.

While giants like Solana and XRP battle regulatory uncertainty and market saturation, a lesser-known project, Remittix is quickly gaining traction. Offering instant crypto-to-fiat transfers and targeting a trillion-dollar remittance market, Remittix is drawing serious investor attention. Could this viral PayFi token be the breakout star of 2025? Many traders think so. Institutional Interest Rises as Solana Joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in ETF Listings Solana continues to make headlines with fresh momentum, currently trading at $126.36 with a 24-hour volume of $2.13 billion and a market cap of $64.47 billion. While the Solana price has inched down about 2.4% in the past day, traders are closely watching what could be a breakout moment. The buzz centers on the launch of two Solana ETFs in the U.S. , a move that could elevate SOL’s standing among institutional investors. Volatility Shares LLC is preparing to release both a standard and leveraged Solana ETF—SOLZ and SOLT, respectively. These funds will track Solana futures, offering traditional investors exposure to SOL without direct ownership. With expense ratios of 0.95% and 1.85%, the ETFs position Solana alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as ETF-recognized digital assets. This could fuel long-term adoption and bring in significant new capital. Still, despite the bullish backdrop, some traders are looking elsewhere for steeper returns. The interest is shifting toward altcoins that are still early in their cycle—assets with low caps but big real-world relevance. XRP Gains Momentum After SEC Case Closure XRP has also been making headlines again , not just for its price swings but for the strong rebound in sentiment following the conclusion of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC . With the case now officially closed, confidence is returning to the XRP ecosystem. Analysts point to a head-and-shoulders pattern forming on higher time frames, often seen as a signal of consolidation before a bigger move. At the time of writing, XRP trades near $2.38 and appears to be holding steady at this critical level. Another catalyst for XRP’s renewed momentum is its inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve. For many investors, this shows institutional trust in Ripple, especially as financial markets continue to adopt tokenized payments and blockchain-powered settlements. The door now opens wider for developments like spot ETFs and stablecoin integration, giving XRP more utility and reach than ever before. However, this has not been enough to deter investors from seeking maximum gains from projects like RTX. Remittix Steals Attention Away From Crypto Heavyweights Solana and XRP While Solana and XRP continue to dominate headlines, a quieter contender is catching the attention of seasoned crypto traders— Remittix (RTX) . Unlike other projects chasing hype, Remittix has locked in on solving a very real problem: the high cost and frustrating delays of cross-border payments. With its utility-focused approach, this ERC-20 token is bridging traditional finance and blockchain by allowing users to convert crypto into fiat instantly, all while maintaining privacy and full control over their funds. What makes Remittix stand out is its focus on accessibility. In regions where banks are scarce or unreliable, Remittix steps in to offer users a way to receive crypto, convert it at local points, and use it as cash for everyday needs. The platform’s low transaction costs and real-time transfers make it a game-changer, especially for unbanked populations around the world. It’s more than a token—it’s a financial access point for millions. With over 521 million tokens sold and $14 million raised during its ICO, Remittix is proving that investor confidence is more than just speculation. Its current price of $0.0734 signals an attractive entry point for those seeking value with upside. And with locked liquidity for three years and smart contract audits already complete, Remittix shows that it’s just as serious about long-term stability as it is about innovation. Remittix Attracts Capital as Investors Seek Real Value While Solana price benefits from speed and XRP from institutional traction, Remittix is going after a massive $190 trillion remittance market—untapped by most crypto projects. Its PayFi system delivers seamless conversions and bypasses traditional banking limitations, giving it a rare edge in functionality. In a market of tokens chasing hype, Remittix is delivering something crypto desperately needs: usability with impact. For traders eyeing 2025 gains, that’s a formula too compelling to ignore.

42135678,https://invezz.com/?p=2630861,1742621114,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Can Ethereum (ETH) charge toward $3000 this week amid whale activity spike?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/22/can-ethereum-eth-charge-toward-3000-this-week-amid-whale-activity-spike/,"With a rise in whale activity inspiring investor hope, Ethereum (ETH) is about to undergo a notable price breakthrough. As the cryptocurrency market shows more instability, ETH is looking at the crucial $3,000 milestone as its next main opposition. Will the biggest Ethereum investors maintain the upward momentum, or will a market drop cause a reversal of its increasing trend? Can Ethereum break $3,000 this week? Whales, big investors with substantial ETH balances, have mixed signals about Ethereum’s recent price fluctuation. Recently, 13 fresh super whales with more than 10,000 ETH have entered the market. This flood of institutional investors shows ongoing interest in Ethereum, thereby supporting its dominance in the crypto market. Simultaneously, some whales have been unloading their stocks, leaving short-term price action unpredictable. Ethereum’s constant transaction volume and rising whale accumulation point to robust underlying demand, which may lay the groundwork for a long-running climb. Ethereum rules the decentralized finance (DeFi) market despite its price swings. Currently the network is ranked as the biggest DeFi ecosystem worldwide, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $51.4 billion. Moreover, Ethereum’s stablecoin market value exceeds $272 billion, underscoring its fundamental pillar status in the crypto economy. Increased acceptance of Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions—Arbitrum and Optimism—helps to lower transaction costs and enhance network efficiency. These events support ETH’s long-term positive prognosis even if short-term resistance levels still have influence. Market analysts differ on Ethereum’s capacity to surpass $3,000 in the coming days. Some suggest that ETH might spike toward $3,200, creating fresh support before moving more significantly toward $3,870 to $4,000. Others warn that failing to remove opposition of around $3,000 could cause a retest with less support of around $2,750. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy fundamentally determines Ethereum’s price path. If the Fed adopts quantitative easing, liquid injections may propel ETH higher. Conversely, stricter monetary policy might restrict upward potential and postpone Ethereum’s next big surge. Rexas Finance (RXS): the rising alternative While Ethereum looks at the $3,000 breakout, Rexas Finance (RXS) is becoming a high-growth substitute, especially in the real estate market. Using blockchain technology, RXS allows fractional real estate ownership, opening retail investors access to property investment opportunities. With the global real estate market valued at $379.7 trillion, Rexas Finance removes conventional entrance restrictions so users may easily buy, sell, and trade tokenized real estate assets. Both crypto and institutional investors looking for exposure to blockchain-powered real estate investment find this invention appealing. Early investors in Rexas Finance (RXS) enjoyed an outstanding 6.67x ROI. Driven by growing usage and the platform’s real-world asset tokenizing approach, this increase indicates great market trust. Rexas Finance is in its last presale stage, with 90.83% of the tokens sold. As demand rises, the remaining supply is rapidly depleting. At a presale price of $0.20, RXS represents an attractive opportunity before its formal exchange listing, where analysts predict a 10x to 25x price increase. To heighten the buzz, the Rexas Finance team formally revealed that the much-awaited RXS coin would start trading on June 19, 2025. Investors and fans are excitedly counting down the days before RXS opens with a $0.25 listing price based on this confirmed launch date. Rexas Finance started a $1 million campaign for community involvement. This program gives early adopters an interesting chance to acquire significant ownership before the platform’s formal release by rewarding 20 lucky winners with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens apiece. Beyond real estate tokenization, the Rexas ecosystem comprises a strong DeFi infrastructure, AI-driven NFT manufacturing, and simple token creation tools. This all-encompassing strategy confirms RXS’s role as a game-changing tool with outstanding long-term promise. Conclusion Although Ethereum still rules the blockchain scene, emerging initiatives like Rexas Finance are showing their worth by tackling actual issues. Both assets provide intriguing investment prospects in 2025 as Ethereum’s price recovers around $3,000 and RXS gains traction in blockchain-powered real estate. Whether ETH breaks its resistance this week or experiences a brief retreat, its long-term direction remains positive. Meanwhile, RXS is rapidly becoming a top competitor in the crypto market, giving investors access to a high-growth industry with enormous upside.

In which, he explains the price could be forming a key demand zone that could be key in pushing BTC to $91K, a level last seen two weeks ago. As of Saturday, March 22, 2025, BTC’s value is up 0.22% today and stuck in the $84K to $85K region. Ethereum (ETH) is up 1.14% and is close to revisiting the $2,000 psychological level. Bitcoin Price Will Reach $91K if This Happens, Says Crypto Trader RektProof Rektproof, one of the most renowned crypto traders, posted his analysis on Bitcoin price. The recent telegram post shows BTC price hovering inside the $84K to $81.1K daily demand zone. Inside this daily demand, RektProof outlines a potential four-hour demand zone, stretching from $84.3K to $83.1K which could be the support zone that propels the crypto market higher. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart If the crypto trader’s outlook comes true, i.e., if Bitcoin price creates the four-hour demand zone, it could bounce 3.74% to the most recent swing high at $87,500, formed on March 19. Beyond this first target, the price could extend to $91,279, which is the key high-volume node formed in early March. In one of his early posts , crypto trader RektProof also notes $95K as the next key resistance level to watch, should the bullish momentum continue. Will Bitcoin Bounce Here? According to data from CoinGlass, there is a possibility of a potential dip before Bitcoin price can move higher. The $83.1K level contains nearly $1M worth of liquidity, which might be tapped before a sustained move to the upside. A high dense liquidity pool exists around $84K to $85K, which coincides with the levels noted by crypto trader RektProof. Other liquidity levels include $86.8K, $88K and $90K. BTC Liquidity Heatmap Long-term BTC Holders at Breakeven The 365-day MVRV ratio (Market Value to Realized Value) has hit zero level, suggesting that investors who purchased BTC in the past year are at breakeven. The last time this metric tagged this level was in August 2024, which was followed by more than 50% rally in Bitcoin price in the next five months. If history repeats, Bitcoin price prediction is on the verge of a bullish breakout. BTC 365-day MVRV RektProof’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin price could revisit $91K if it forms a four-hour demand zone, with potential targets at $87,500, $91,279, and $95K, supported by the 365-day MVRV ratio hitting zero The post Crypto Trader Provides Detailed Plan on How Bitcoin Price Will Revisit $91K appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Price Analysis|BTC price,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-22 05:26:21

It was not because of the option’s expiry but because the traders were uncertain of its adverse impact that made them prepare for bullish and bearish scenarios. However, BTC prices failed to reach either of the marked levels and remained constrained within a narrow range. Although this offers short-term relief from the volatility, from a wider perspective, such sluggish Bitcoin behaviour could be worrisome! After facing rejection from $86,800, the traders appear to have become pessimistic, which mirrors the volume that has slashed below $20 billion. Whenever the volume plunges to such lows, the prices usually remain lethargic by maintaining a range-bound consolidation. Now the question arises: will the Bitcoin price go up or crash in 2025? Before analyzing the price movements, let’s have a look at the factors impacting the upcoming BTC price action in 2025. Whale Accumulation at its Peak The recent price action of Bitcoin suggests a notable drop in the on-chain readings and also future data as well. Meanwhile, the whale accumulation remains at its peak, which suggests a substantial rise in the institutional investors. The data from the Glassnode suggests the BTC wallets holding over 1000 BTC have increased from 2040 to 2079 and are currently stabilized to 2077. Monitoring whale activity is extremely crucial, as they can influence the BTC price. The growing number of whales displays the growing confidence among the investors. New Investors Are On the Rise Apart from whales, first-time investors or new investors are also on the rise. The February 23 plunge that dragged the levels from $96,500 to $82,300 attracted huge investors to the platform. The investors appear to have utilized the buy-the-dip opportunity as it happened during the FTX collapse. The above data from Cryptoquant suggests that these new investors have accumulated nearly 172,705 BTC since then. This can be considered one of the bullish signals, as it also denotes a rise in the investor’s confidence in the token. These on-chain readings hint towards a significant rise in the confidence of whales and new investors, which is important to maintain the volatility within the markets. Besides, huge transfers of cl o se to 3000 BTC between unknown wallets may also shake up the volatility in the coming weekend, compelling the traders to believe a huge whale movement is underway. Therefore, the upcoming weekend could be pretty important for the Bitcoin price, as a rise above the pivotal range at $84,800 may help to close the quarterly close on a bullish note above $85,000. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analyst Outlines Key Bitcoin Level Following a slight uptick after the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) announcement to slow the pace of its balance sheet drawdown, Bitcoin is currently trading in the low $80,000 price range. However, according to Martinez, the leading cryptocurrency could reach a new all-time high (ATH), subject to certain conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says Using Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez pointed to two crucial price levels that could determine Bitcoin’s next major move. According to the analyst, if BTC breaks and holds above $94,000, it has a ‘high probability’ of rallying to $112,000. On the flip side, if BTC falls below $76,000, it risks plunging to $58,000 – or even $44,000 – if market conditions turn bearish. Notably, BTC previously hit $76,606 on March 10 before rebounding to its current range in the low $80,000s. For the uninitiated, MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands show whether an asset, like Bitcoin, is priced too high or too low compared to its past averages. It helps spot when the market might be overbought – potential market top – or oversold – potential buying opportunity. According to Martinez’s chart, BTC is currently trading between the mean – yellow band – and +0.5 standard deviation – orange band. A sustained breakout above or below these bands could indicate Bitcoin’s next significant price direction. Fellow crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin is re-testing the crucial $84,000 support level. A successful hold at this price could set BTC up to challenge the $94,000 resistance, potentially paving the way for a new ATH. The analyst stated: BTC has produced long wicks below this level before which is why a Daily Close above $84k is essential for this retest to be successful. Will BTC Witness A Short Squeeze? In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader suggested that widespread pessimism around BTC’s recent price action might fuel a powerful short squeeze. According to the analyst, roughly $2 billion worth of short positions could be liquidated if BTC reaches $87,000 – potentially driving the price even higher. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Undervalued? Crypto Sentiment Index Flashes “Massive Contrarian Buy Signal” Adding to the bullish outlook, crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes suggested that BTC’s March 10 drop to $77,000 may have marked the bottom of this market cycle. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $84,043, down 2% in the past 24 hours.

With liquidations piling up, trading volume surging, and market sentiment turning increasingly bearish, analysts are now speculating on an unsettling possibility—could DOGE lose so much value that it adds another zero to its price before March 2025 ends? How Dogecoin’s downtrend could wipe out its price stability Dogecoin’s decline has been steep and persistent. The meme coin has already lost 38% over the past month, with its price presently at $0.16 as of writing. DOGE is among the most severely damaged top cryptocurrencies in the current market downturn, losing 20% of its value within only one week. Dogecoin Price Chart (24-Hour), Mar. 11, 2025 | Source: CoinGecko The numbers depict a troubling picture. Over $21.94 million in Dogecoin positions have been liquidated in the previous 24 hours, with $18.51 million coming from long positions—a strong hint that traders expecting a rebound are being wiped out. Dogecoin’s market cap, which once rocketed beyond $60 billion, has since plummeted drastically to $23.86 billion. Meanwhile, trading volume remains at $2.6 billion, warning panic selling could accelerate. Is Dogecoin on the verge of adding another zero to its price? A few months ago, DOGE rocketed beyond $0.47 due to post-election euphoria and Elon Musk’s ongoing backing. However, with Bitcoin (BTC) failing to hold its $100,000 milestone, the entire market has hit, and meme currencies have suffered the most. Analysts fear that if the current decline persists, DOGE could drop below $0.10, reintroducing a zero to its price and causing significant market disruptions. While speculation about a prospective Dogecoin ETF from Bitwise or Grayscale continues, it may not be enough to rescue the meme coin from further fall. As Dogecoin investors explore alternatives, one project stands out for its excellent fundamentals, rapid usage, and zero VC risk: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): a real-world crypto powerhouse gaining market traction Rexas Finance (RXS) is built on actual financial use cases, unlike Dogecoin, which lives on speculation. Fundamentally, Rexas Finance specializes in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a growing industry expected to reach $30 trillion by 2030. The platform makes worldwide investing more possible by allowing fractional ownership of classic assets such as real estate, bonds, and commodities. Rexas Finance is positioned at the vanguard of this change as big financial firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have already delved into RWA tokenization. Rexas Finance recently reached 50,000 active holders, a key milestone in its rapid expansion. This rise in adoption demonstrates the project’s long-term viability and investor trust in its roadmap. Inside the Rexas Finance presale: a project with no VC sell-off risks With 91% of tokens already sold, the Rexas Finance (RXS) presale is now in its last stage (Stage 12). It is one of the most successful cryptocurrency launches of the year, with $47.2 million raised and 456 million tokens sold. One of the main worries with new crypto ventures is VC dumping. In this situation, venture capitalists buy early allocations cheaply to offload them to regular investors once the tokens are listed on exchanges. Rexas Finance guarantees a fair token distribution by rejecting VC money, removing this risk. Before the exchange launch, the presale price rose 567% from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12. Investor demand and project sustainability confidence drove this growth. Beyond tokenization: what makes Rexas Finance more than just a RWA platform While RWA tokenization is the foundation of Rexas Finance, the project also provides a diverse range of blockchain-powered financial services that appeal to institutional and retail investors. Here are some of its outstanding utilities: Rexas AI Shield: An AI-driven smart contract security technology that finds weaknesses before hackers can exploit them, protecting user funds. Rexas Treasury: A multi-chain staking and yield optimizer that maximizes Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon investment earnings. Rexas Launchpad: A decentralized platform for innovators to raise funds for their tokenization projects. These real-world utilities ensure that Rexas Finance is more than a speculative token; it is an ecosystem that transforms how financial assets are handled, exchanged, and secured on the blockchain. Rexas Finance exchange listing: what investors can expect Investors look forward to June 19, the official listing date for RXS on at least three of the world’s top ten cryptocurrency exchanges. Historically, high-profile exchange launches have resulted in significant price increases, and RXS will likely follow suit. The listing price is set at $0.25, and given the liquidity and exposure from tier-1 exchanges, industry analysts estimate 45,000% post-launch returns. Given its solid tokenomics, early investor demand, and real-world utility, Rexas Finance is poised to be one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025, mainly as investors shift away from speculative assets such as DOGE. Final thoughts: will Dogecoin collapse as Rexas Finance soars? Dogecoin’s failure to maintain crucial price levels is generating investor fears. If the current trend continues, DOGE might go below $0.10, adding another zero to its price by the end of March 2025. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is on a unique path. With a rapidly growing user base, solid financial support, and a varied ecosystem of real-world applications, Rexas Finance is emerging as a prominent cryptocurrency competitor in 2025. We are almost at the end of the final presale stage, providing an opportunity to buy RXS tokens before their listing on major exchanges.

According to Ripple, the past commission’s actions created confusion for the crypto industry, as the agency enforced standards that were not written into law. Ripple says the past SEC’s enforcement actions aroused confusion in the crypto industry Responding to a February 21, 2025, SEC statement titled “There must be some way out of here” (the “RFI”), Ripple insisted that the commission needs to prioritise providing law-first clarity for crypto companies. In its letter, the exchange referenced Bob Dylan’s lyric, “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief,” claiming the previous administration only generated confusion. It further argued that previous enforcement strategies were inconsistent with the Crypto Task Force’s goal of establishing clear criteria for determining whether an asset qualifies as a security or is part of an investment contract. Echoing this sentiment, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, even claimed the commission thrived on confusion to mask its failure to follow the law. Today, @Ripple submitted its response to Commissioner @HesterPeirce ’s Feb. 21 statement: “There must be some way out of here,” calling for public input on crypto taxonomy rules. That Dylan lyric continues: “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief.” The prior… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) March 21, 2025 The exchange now wants the SEC to provide more clarity and return to first principles. It commented: “As the Crypto Task Force appears to recognize, the SEC should return to first principles and, within the bounds of existing statutes, strive to provide straightforward market guidance that has been absent to date.” – Ripple Ripple even claimed that the SEC does not have jurisdiction over most digital assets and their transactions to date. It added that the agency can only regulate “securities” and their transactions as defined by the Securities Act. The crypto firm also argued that staking and yield on public networks differ from securities and asked them to clarify the policies. Additionally, the company reaffirmed its backing for safe harbor provisions and regulatory sandboxes, an approach that has worked well in the UK, Switzerland, and Singapore. The exchange believes the Token Safe Harbor Proposal could allow blockchain projects to grow without being too quickly tagged as securities. Ripple believes the SEC misused some legal definitions, including the Howey Test Ripple, however, accused the SEC of distorting some of the legal requirements for exchanges, including the application of the Howey Test. The crypto company claimed that the agency misused the test to classify digital assets as securities, even without binding agreements or profit participation requirements. Ripple claimed that this approach only created uncertainty and hindered blockchain projects from launching or expanding in the US. The exchange, however, agreed with the SEC’s decision to categorize meme coins as non-securities, claiming it’s a step toward clear regulation. Moving forward, the firm believes that all future regulation should be based on existing laws and not on arbitrary constructed norms that could unsettle the markets.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino reportedly said the audit process would be more straightforward under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump. It comes after rising industry concerns over a potential FTX-style liquidity crisis for Tether due to its lack of third-party audits. Tether to produce first full audit after scrutiny “If the President of the United States says this is top priority for the US, Big Four auditing firms will have to listen, so we are very happy with that,” Ardoino told Reuters on March 21. “It’s our top priority,” Ardoino said. It was reported that Tether is currently subject to quarterly reports but not a full independent annual audit, which is much more extensive and provides more assurance to investors and regulators. However, Ardoino did not specify which of the Big Four accounting firms — PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst & Young (EY), Deloitte, or KPMG — he plans to engage. Tether recorded a profit of $13.7 billion in 2024. Source: Paolo Ardoino Tether’s USDT maintains its stable value by claiming to be pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio . This means each USDT token is backed by reserves equivalent to its circulating supply. These reserves include traditional currency, cash equivalents and other assets. Earlier this month, Tether hired Simon McWilliams as chief financial officer in preparation for a full financial audit. Industry concerns over Tether’s lack of audits In September 2024, Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons was among those in the industry who voiced concerns about Tether’s lack of transparency. “[Tether is] one of the biggest existential threats to crypto. As we have to trust they hold $118B in collateral without proof! Even after the CFTC fined Tether for lying about their reserves in 2021,” Bons said. Related: Tether freezes $27M USDT on sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex Around the same time, Consumers’ Research, a consumer protection group , published a report criticizing Tether for its lack of transparency. Just three years prior, in 2021, the United States Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined Tether a $41 million civil monetary penalty for lying about USDT being fully backed by reserves. Meanwhile, more recently, Tether has voiced disappointment over new European regulations that have forced exchanges like Crypto.com to delist USDT and nine other tokens to comply with MiCA. “It is disappointing to see the rushed actions brought on by statements which do little to clarify the basis for such moves,” a spokesperson for Tether told Cointelegraph. Cointelegraph reached out to Tether but did not receive a response by time of publication.

His commentary focused on the significance of this decision and its implications for XRP. Van Code explained that the primary risk in the SEC’s appeal was the potential challenge to Judge Torres’ ruling, which determined that “XRP in and of itself, is not a security.” This ruling had left XRP in a state of uncertainty, particularly among financial institutions and large investors. Van Code stated that the appeal presented “the big RISK which left XRP in a state of limbo with big banks and institutions.” He also reminded readers that Ripple was fined $125 million for its institutional sales, which the court ruled violated securities laws. He clarified that “Ripple ALREADY PAID the fine and is sitting in a bank escrow ready to be released upon clarity of the appeal.” This means that Ripple had already accounted for this penalty, removing any further financial uncertainty related to the SEC’s claims. Van Code noted that while Ripple’s legal team has suggested they may appeal the ruling on institutional sales, this is a separate matter. He emphasized that, regardless of future legal actions, the fundamental outcome of the SEC’s dropped appeal is that “the UNDISPUTED RULE OF THE LAND IS: XRP IS NOT A SECURITY AND NEVER WILL BE, CASE CLOSED!” With this legal status confirmed, Van Code stated that Ripple and its extensive network of 1,500 partners no longer have to worry about regulatory threats from the SEC. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Market Reactions and Institutional Adoption Despite this legal clarity, Van Code addressed why XRP’s price had not significantly increased. He acknowledged his expectations, saying he thought the price would have “3x already” and admitted he was surprised by the lack of movement. He pointed to market dynamics as a key factor. According to Van Code, “there is STILL very little volume,” suggesting that major financial institutions are not yet actively accumulating. He stated that much of the current activity is “the usual market manipulation by Binance and their VIP trading bots.” He also explained that institutional investors often take time to react to legal developments. Large financial players “are not trigger happy” and may require board approval for significant purchases, which could slow down their decision-making process. He noted that such approvals are often granted during monthly meetings, further delaying potential buying pressure on XRP. Future Outlook and Investor Patience Van Code made it clear that, in his view, the risk associated with XRP has now been eliminated. He argued that there is now “nothing stopping its adoption” and that there are no foreseeable events that could significantly impact its price negatively. Looking ahead, he suggested that the market will see continued upward momentum, stating, “The rest of the journey Imho is all the way up.” However, he acknowledged the unpredictability of price movements, admitting, “I won’t pretend to know price, heck I humbly admit I have been wrong too many times.” Finally, he advised patience, warning that the biggest obstacle for investors now is “impatience.” He encouraged holders to “just sit tight, enjoy the victory and start to plan how you will manage your new fortunes.” Van Code’s analysis clearly shows the SEC’s decision and its impact on XRP and Ripple . The regulatory uncertainty that previously clouded XRP’s future has now been removed, confirming its legal status. Despite this, market reactions remain slow, with institutional investors likely accumulating XRP over time. He emphasizes patience, reinforcing his belief that XRP’s adoption will continue without regulatory obstacles.

IMF Adds Bitcoin to Global Economic Stats! In its latest seventh edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM7), IMF included cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) in the balance of payments. According to the IMF’s new standards, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are now non-productive assets in global economic statistics. The updated manual was released on March 20, marking the first time that the IMF has included detailed guidance on digital assets in its global statistical standards. The IMF’s new framework splits digital assets into fungible and non-fungible tokens and further classifies them based on whether they have associated liabilities. Bitcoin and similar tokens without liabilities are treated as capital assets, while stablecoins backed by liabilities are seen as financial instruments. According to the IMF, crypto assets like Bitcoin, which are not linked to liabilities and serve as a medium of exchange, are categorized as non-produced nonfinancial assets and recorded in the capital account. In practice, this would mean cross-border crypto transactions involving assets like Bitcoin will be tracked as acquisitions or sales of non-produced assets in the capital account. Meanwhile, tokens tied to a platform, like Ethereum or Solana (SOL), may be treated like equity holdings in the financial account if the owner is from a different country than the token’s origin. For instance, if a UK investor holds Solana tokens from the US, it would be treated like owning foreign stocks, recorded as “equity crypto assets.” The IMF highlights that, despite using cryptography, these assets are similar to standard equity when it comes to ownership rights. Staking and Crypto Yields Furthermore, the IMF acknowledges the complexity of staking and crypto yields, noting that rewards from holding tokens could be treated like equity dividends and recorded as income, based on the size and purpose of the holdings. Notably, this update helps countries better track the economic impact of digital assets. The IMF now treats activities like mining or staking, which help validate crypto transactions, as services. These will be included in computer services exports and imports. Created with input from over 160 countries, the BPM7 manual will guide global economic data.

XRP’s price continues to show a larger bearish divergence on the 3-day chart. Despite some short-term bullish movement, the overall momentum is still leaning toward the downside. For months, market analysts have been warning that major bullish movement is unlikely in the near future. Short-Term Bullish Action Amid Larger Bearish Trend XRP has seen brief bullish movements, with some positive price structure breaking above key levels. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, these moves have allowed XRP to flip previous resistance into support, giving traders hope for short-term price action. However, the overarching bearish divergence remains, signaling that larger price increases may still be unlikely for the near future. Key Support and Resistance Levels for XRP XRP currently holds support between $2.24 and $2.30, with major support around $1.95 to $2.50. On the flip side, resistance levels are observed at $2.60 to $2.65 and again near $2.80. A significant resistance zone is near the $3 mark, making it a key level for any possiblr upward movement. Sideways Price Action Likely to Continue Over the past month, XRP has primarily moved sideways within a price range between key support and resistance levels. With the larger bearish divergence in play, it’s likely that this trend will continue until more definitive market signals emerge. In the immediate term, XRP’s price is expected to fluctuate within this range, with a lack of strong directional momentum. XRP’s Long-Term Outlook: Waiting for a Breakout XRP’s long-term outlook remains uncertain, with market analysts suggesting the possibility of a “last hurrah” for bullish action. Some believe that XRP could experience a final euphoric surge before a more significant downtrend, driven by broader market forces. As the market is still in a corrective phase, it may take time before XRP can break out of its sideways movement and generate substantial price action. Conclusion: A Market at Crossroads Despite short-term price movements, XRP’s price is currently stuck within a range, waiting for a catalyst to drive the next price change. While the bearish divergence remains the dominant trend, the potential for short-term bullish action exists.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-22 06:02:39

South Korean exchange giant, Bithumb, has just announced a significant update that’s sure to pique the interest of traders. Prepare for the launch of the ACX/KRW spot trading pair, set to go live on March 22nd. This exciting development opens doors for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into new trading avenues. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. What’s the Buzz About the Bithumb Listing of ACX/KRW? Bithumb, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, has officially announced the upcoming listing of the ACX/KRW spot trading pair. This announcement, made on their official website, confirms that starting March 22nd at 09:00 UTC, users will be able to trade ACX directly against the Korean Won (KRW) on the Bithumb platform. This move is significant for several reasons, offering both opportunities and raising some questions for crypto enthusiasts. But first, let’s understand what exactly spot trading is and why this listing is generating attention. Understanding Spot Trading and Its Significance Spot trading is the most fundamental type of trading in any financial market, including cryptocurrencies. In spot trading, assets are exchanged for immediate delivery. When Bithumb lists the ACX/KRW spot trading pair , it means traders can buy or sell ACX using KRW directly, with the transaction settling ‘on the spot’ or very shortly after the order is filled. This is different from futures or margin trading, where you are trading contracts based on the asset’s price, not the asset itself. The introduction of a new crypto trading pair like ACX/KRW on a reputable exchange like Bithumb is important because: Increased Accessibility: It makes ACX more accessible to the South Korean market, allowing users who prefer to trade in their local currency (KRW) to easily participate in the ACX market. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing on Bithumb, a major exchange, typically increases the liquidity of the asset. Higher liquidity means it’s easier to buy and sell ACX without significant price slippage. Wider Market Exposure: It exposes ACX to a larger pool of traders and investors, potentially leading to increased trading volume and price discovery. Validation for ACX: Being listed on a prominent exchange like Bithumb can be seen as a form of validation for the ACX project, potentially boosting its credibility and appeal. Why Bithumb Chose to List the ACX/KRW Pair? While Bithumb’s official announcement is straightforward, it doesn’t explicitly state the reasons behind choosing to list the ACX/KRW pair now. However, we can infer some potential motivations: Market Demand: Bithumb likely assesses market demand before listing a new pair. If there’s a growing interest in ACX among their user base or in the South Korean crypto market generally, listing the ACX/KRW pair caters to this demand. Diversification of Trading Options: Exchanges constantly seek to diversify their offerings to attract and retain users. Adding new and potentially popular trading pairs like ACX/KRW expands the trading options available on Bithumb. Strategic Partnerships: Listings can sometimes be the result of strategic partnerships or agreements between the exchange and the project behind the cryptocurrency. While not confirmed in this announcement, it’s a possibility. Expanding the Crypto Ecosystem: Exchanges play a crucial role in expanding the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem. By listing new and promising projects, they contribute to the growth and diversification of the market. Benefits of Trading the ACX/KRW Pair on Bithumb For traders and investors, the launch of the ACX/KRW cryptocurrency exchange pair on Bithumb brings several potential benefits: Direct KRW Trading: South Korean users can now trade ACX directly using their local currency, eliminating the need to first convert KRW to another cryptocurrency like USDT or BTC. This simplifies the trading process and can potentially reduce trading fees. Access to Bithumb’s Platform: Traders gain access to Bithumb’s robust trading platform, known for its user-friendly interface, security features, and relatively high trading volumes. Potential for Price Discovery: The new listing can contribute to price discovery for ACX in the KRW market. Increased trading activity and liquidity can lead to a more efficient and transparent price for ACX against KRW. Portfolio Diversification: Adding ACX to a trading portfolio can offer diversification benefits. By trading different cryptocurrencies, investors can potentially spread risk and capitalize on different market opportunities. Bithumb to list ACX/KRW spot trading pair Navigating the Challenges and Risks While the Bithumb listing of ACX/KRW presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to be aware of the inherent challenges and risks associated with crypto trading, especially with new listings: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. New listings can sometimes experience even higher volatility in the initial trading days and weeks. Traders should be prepared for potential price swings. Liquidity Risks: While listing on Bithumb should improve liquidity, it’s still important to monitor the order book depth and trading volume, especially in the initial phase. Lower liquidity can lead to wider spreads and price slippage. Project Risks: Investing in any cryptocurrency carries project-specific risks. It’s essential to conduct thorough research on the ACX project, its fundamentals, team, technology, and roadmap before trading. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, particularly in South Korea. Traders should stay informed about any regulatory developments that could impact crypto trading. Actionable Insights for Traders So, how can traders make the most of this new listing? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Before trading ACX/KRW, thoroughly research the ACX project. Understand its use case, technology, tokenomics, and community. Monitor Trading Volumes: Keep an eye on the trading volume of the ACX/KRW pair on Bithumb after the listing. Volume can be an indicator of market interest and liquidity. Start Small: If you’re new to trading ACX or crypto in general, consider starting with smaller trades to manage risk and get comfortable with the market dynamics. Use Risk Management Tools: Utilize Bithumb’s risk management tools, such as stop-loss orders, to protect your capital and manage potential losses. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments related to ACX, Bithumb, and the broader crypto market to make informed trading decisions. Conclusion: A Promising Step for ACX and Bithumb The upcoming listing of the ACX/KRW spot trading pair on Bithumb is undoubtedly a positive development for both ACX and the Bithumb exchange. It provides increased accessibility, liquidity, and market exposure for ACX, while offering Bithumb users a new and potentially attractive trading option. As with any crypto investment, it’s crucial for traders to approach this new opportunity with informed caution, conduct thorough research, and manage risk effectively. The launch of ACX/KRW on Bithumb marks another step forward in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading, offering fresh avenues for engagement and growth within the digital asset ecosystem.
