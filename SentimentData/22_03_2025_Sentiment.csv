42120304,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61195,1742594446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CEO Makes End of 2025 Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-makes-end-of-2025-prediction/,"Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a popular crypto influencer on X, recently shared an interview featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. During the interview, he outlined an ambitious target for the company‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD. Garlinghouse stated that Ripple aims to position RLUSD among the top stablecoins by the end of 2025, reflecting confidence in both the asset and the broader market‚Äôs expansion. BREAKING: RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: ‚ÄûTHE GOAL IS BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR RLUSD, RIPPLE STABLECOIN, TO BE ONE OF THE TOP FIVE IN THE MARKET BY THE END OF THE YEAR. I THINK THE WHOLE MARKET IS GONNA GROW DRAMATICALLY THIS YEAR!‚Äú #XRP pic.twitter.com/NliNtSZYy4 ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) March 20, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Goal for 2025 In the interview, Garlinghouse highlighted that RLUSD, which was launched at the end of last year , is already exceeding Ripple‚Äôs internal forecasts. While acknowledging that Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin is still in its early stages, he emphasized its strong trajectory. Interestingly, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple‚Äôs goal for 2025 is to make RLUSD one of the top five stablecoins in the market by the end of the year. He also noted that the stablecoin sector, currently valued at around $230 billion, could grow tenfold over the next five years, and the company plans to dominate that market with its stablecoin. Market Growth and Competition Stablecoins remain a critical component of the crypto ecosystem, serving as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. The dominant players, USDT and USDC, continue to lead, but Garlinghouse believes the RLUSD will do well in the market. RLUSD is currently ranked #9 by 24-hour trading volume, and Ripple‚Äôs deep integration into global payment systems and established relationships with financial institutions may provide it with a competitive edge as the market grows. Expanding RLUSD‚Äôs Reach Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple is actively working to increase RLUSD‚Äôs market presence. The company recently took a significant step forward by integrating its systems with RWA.xyz , allowing aggregation of the stablecoin‚Äôs data alongside other tokenized assets. Garlinghouse mentioned that new exchange listings for RLUSD continue to go live, helping drive adoption. ‚ÄúAnytime you do something new, it takes a minute for the ripple effect to play out,‚Äù he said, referring to the stablecoin‚Äôs growing impact. If the company leverages its partnerships and connections on its existing network, it may have a strong chance of reaching its goal by year-end and making RLUSD a household name. A Bullish Outlook for Stablecoins Garlinghouse‚Äôs bullish stance on stablecoins shows the growing importance of this sector within the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory clarity improves in the U.S. and global adoption increases, stablecoins will play an even larger role in digital finance. Whether RLUSD can break into the top five remains to be seen, but its early success suggests that Ripple is making significant strides in the competitive stablecoin market.

The analysis report highlights technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which failed to reach past extremes, raising concerns about Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Bitcoin Indicators Fall Short Of Historical Peaks Bitcoin has historically exhibited strong indicator readings during major cycle tops, reflecting extreme market engagement and enthusiasm. However, in this bull cycle, the pioneer cryptocurrency‚Äôs RSI reading has failed to reach historical peaks despite Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days Tony Severino, a crypto market technician on X (formerly Twitter), has Bitcoin Price Risks Further Crash As S&P Monthly LMACD Turns Bearish, Why Bulls Have Only 20 Days a detailed analysis of Bitcoin, challenging the assumption that the cryptocurrency must reach the same overbought RSI levels as in previous cycles to confirm its market peak. The key argument here is that lower highs on oscillators like the RSI, combined with higher highs in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, can be a bearish signal, suggesting waning strength in the market. Severino shared an example comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs current bull cycle to past cycles. In the previous bull market, Bitcoin‚Äôs monthly RSI reached above 90, but its current cycle has not. The analyst posed a question about whether this inability to reach past extremes means that Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt reached a market top or simply lacked the same momentum to push its RSI to the highest level. The analyst has warned that believing that Bitcoin must reach past extremes on indicators before hitting a price peak is a dangerous way of thinking. Historical patterns do not always repeat in the same way, and relying too much on past indicator peaks could cause traders to miss warning signs of a top or underestimate the possibility of a bear market. Severino also pointed to historical data from the S&P 500 in the 1950s and 1960s, where similar RSI failure preceded a long market meltdown. During these times, cyclical peaks hit RSI readings of 77 or higher, but in 1969, the RSI failed to reach those highs, signaling underlying weakness. This market downturn ultimately led to the first lower low in over 20 years. While this historical behavior of the S&P 500 does not mean that Bitcoin is destined for a lower high, it does suggest that the cryptocurrency does not need to reach extreme RSI levels to confirm a cycle top and a subsequent bear market. Analyst Says BTC Has Hit Its Market Top In his analysis Severino confirmed that Bitcoin has already hit its market top for this bull cycle. Following his detailed analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI levels, a community member asked if Severino believes that Bitcoin reached a market top when its price surged above $109,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash From $91,000, Why It‚Äôs Far From Over The analyst responded positively, stating that current market data indicates that the cryptocurrency hit its highest price point for this bull cycle after Donald Trump‚Äôs US Inauguration Day. At the time, Bitcoin soared past $109,000, setting a new ATH and surpassing previous records.

42118601,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142350,1742594450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breaking: Fidelity‚Äôs Groundbreaking Solana ETF Filing Ignites Crypto Investment Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fidelity-solana-etf-registration/,"Get ready for a potential shake-up in the crypto investment world! News just dropped that Fidelity Investments, a financial behemoth, has officially registered a ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù as a statutory trust in Delaware. This exciting development, first highlighted by Wu Blockchain on X, has sent ripples of anticipation through the cryptocurrency community. Could this be the precursor to a spot Solana ETF ? Let‚Äôs dive into what this registration means and why it could be a game-changer for both Solana and the broader crypto market. Fidelity Solana Fund Registration: What‚Äôs the Buzz About? So, what exactly happened? Fidelity, a name synonymous with traditional finance and now increasingly embracing the digital asset space, has taken a significant step by registering a fund specifically tied to Solana. According to public records in Delaware, the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is now officially on the books. This isn‚Äôt just another registration; it‚Äôs a clear signal of intent. But what kind of intent? Let‚Äôs break it down: Registration as a Statutory Trust: This legal structure is often used for ETFs. Think about it ‚Äì ETFs need a trust to hold the underlying assets. Registering as a statutory trust is a common and crucial step in the ETF creation process. ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù Name: The name itself is incredibly telling. It‚Äôs not just a generic crypto fund; it‚Äôs explicitly linked to Solana. This specificity suggests a focused approach on providing investment exposure to SOL. Timing and Market Context: This news comes at a time when the crypto market is showing signs of renewed vigor, and there‚Äôs increasing demand for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and demonstrated the appetite for such offerings. While registration doesn‚Äôt guarantee the launch of a spot Solana ETF , it‚Äôs a very strong indication that Fidelity is seriously considering this move. It‚Äôs like laying the foundation for a house ‚Äì you wouldn‚Äôt go through the trouble unless you planned to build something significant. Why a Spot Solana ETF is a Monumental Leap for Crypto ETFs Let‚Äôs zoom out and understand why a potential spot Solana ETF is such a big deal, especially in the context of the evolving Crypto ETF landscape. We‚Äôve already seen the groundbreaking approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was a monumental victory, opening the doors for billions of dollars of institutional and retail investment to flow into Bitcoin through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. Now, Solana could be next in line, and here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs significant: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, the market is increasingly recognizing the potential of other cryptocurrencies like Solana. A spot Solana ETF would offer investors diversification within their crypto portfolio, moving beyond just Bitcoin exposure. Legitimizing Altcoins: The approval of a spot Solana ETF would further legitimize altcoins as a viable asset class. It signals to traditional investors that cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin are gaining institutional acceptance and regulatory consideration. Broader Market Access to Solana: Currently, investing directly in Solana requires navigating crypto exchanges, wallets, and understanding blockchain technology. A spot ETF removes these barriers, making Solana accessible to anyone with a brokerage account. This includes a vast pool of retail and institutional investors who may have been hesitant to directly engage with crypto. Institutional Interest in Solana: Fidelity‚Äôs move underscores growing institutional interest in Solana. Large financial players are recognizing Solana‚Äôs technology, ecosystem, and potential for future growth. An ETF would be a way for institutions to gain exposure to Solana in a regulated and compliant manner. The difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF is crucial here. A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset ‚Äì in this case, Solana. This is generally preferred by investors as it more accurately reflects the price movements of the cryptocurrency. Futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts, which can introduce complexities and tracking errors. The demand is clearly for spot crypto ETFs, and Fidelity seems to be listening. Unlocking Solana Investment: The Compelling Benefits of a Fidelity Solana ETF Imagine the doors that a Fidelity Solana Fund , potentially structured as a spot ETF, could open for investors. The benefits are numerous and compelling, spanning accessibility, legitimacy, and investment potential: Benefit Description Simplified Investment Access Investing in Solana becomes as easy as buying shares of a stock through a brokerage account. No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or private key management. Increased Liquidity ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity. This makes it easier for investors to buy and sell Solana exposure at market prices. Enhanced Security and Custody Fidelity, a regulated financial institution, would handle the custody and security of the underlying Solana, mitigating risks associated with self-custody or exchange custody. Tax Advantages (Potentially) Depending on jurisdiction, investing through an ETF might offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption Catalyst A Solana ETF from a reputable firm like Fidelity could further encourage institutional adoption of Solana and other cryptocurrencies. Price Appreciation Potential Increased demand for Solana through an ETF could potentially drive up its price, benefiting early investors and the Solana ecosystem as a whole. For retail investors who have been curious about Solana but intimidated by the technicalities of crypto, a Solana ETF could be the perfect on-ramp. For institutional investors, it provides a regulated and compliant way to allocate capital to a rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Considerations for a Spot Solana ETF While the registration of the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is undeniably exciting, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the path to a spot Solana ETF isn‚Äôt without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles, market volatility, and competition are all factors that need to be considered: SEC Approval: The biggest hurdle is, of course, obtaining approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC has approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, their stance on other cryptocurrencies remains to be fully seen. The SEC will need to be convinced that the Solana market is mature enough and resistant to manipulation for a spot ETF to be approved. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. This volatility could make a spot Crypto ETF a riskier investment compared to traditional ETFs. However, it also presents opportunities for high returns. Regulatory Landscape Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and viability of crypto ETFs. Competition: If Fidelity launches a Solana ETF, it‚Äôs likely to face competition from other asset managers who may also be eyeing the Solana ETF space. This competition could be beneficial for investors in the long run, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative products. Solana Network Risks: While Solana is a technologically advanced blockchain, it has faced challenges in the past, including network outages. Potential investors need to be aware of these risks associated with the underlying technology. Despite these challenges, the fact that Fidelity is moving forward with registration suggests a degree of optimism that these hurdles can be overcome. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has undoubtedly provided a blueprint and increased confidence in the possibility of spot altcoin ETFs. Solana‚Äôs Bright Future and the Expanding Horizons of Crypto Investment Why Solana? Why is Fidelity potentially betting on a Solana ETF ? The answer lies in Solana‚Äôs compelling technology and vibrant ecosystem. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and low transaction costs. It has attracted a thriving community of developers and users, building a diverse range of applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more. Here‚Äôs a quick look at Solana‚Äôs strengths: High Speed and Scalability: Solana is designed to handle a high volume of transactions at incredibly fast speeds, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time processing. Low Transaction Fees: Compared to some other blockchains, Solana‚Äôs transaction fees are remarkably low, making it attractive for users and developers. Growing Ecosystem: Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with a growing number of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other innovative projects being built on the network. Strong Community Support: Solana has a passionate and active community that is constantly contributing to its growth and development. A spot Solana ETF could be a significant catalyst for further growth and adoption of Solana. It would bring increased capital into the Solana ecosystem, potentially fueling innovation and development. More broadly, it signals the continued maturation of the crypto investment landscape. We are moving beyond the early days of crypto being a niche asset class to a point where mainstream financial institutions are offering regulated investment products linked to a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Solana and Crypto ETFs? Fidelity‚Äôs registration of the ‚ÄúFidelity Solana Fund‚Äù is more than just a procedural step; it‚Äôs a powerful statement about the future of Solana and the evolution of Crypto ETFs . While the launch of a spot Solana ETF is not yet guaranteed, this move significantly increases the likelihood and signals a growing confidence in Solana‚Äôs potential. For investors, it presents an exciting prospect ‚Äì the potential to access Solana investment through a familiar, regulated, and convenient ETF structure. Keep your eyes peeled ‚Äì this story is just beginning, and it could mark the start of a new chapter in crypto investment history.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase says its listing decentralized roll-up protocol AltLayer ( ALT ), decentralized finance network Pendle ( PENDLE ), and gamified learning platform Layer3 ( L3 ) to its listing roadmap. The crypto exchange‚Äôs listing roadmap is used to increase transparency and prevent the front-running of new tokens. Being added to it means Coinbase is considering adding support for the asset soon. News of the additions sprung the trio of assets to life as AltLayer ‚Äì a protocol that uses restaked rollups to enhance scalability ‚Äì went from a low of $0.0354 on March 20th to a peak of $0.0395 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.0376 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Pendle, a project that enables the trading and tokenization of yields, went from a price of $2.41 to a peak of $2.59 during the same time frame. However, the digital asset also retraced and is trading for $2.47 at time of writing, a gain of 1.2% on the day. Layer3, a web3 education program that teaches users through interaction and games, saw the biggest gains as it went from a low of $0.0577 on March 20th to a peak of $0.103 just a few hours later. It has since retraced and is moving for $0.0820, a gain of 38.6% during the last day.

CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the company is ‚Äúengaging with a Big Four accounting firm,‚Äù though he didn‚Äôt say which one or when the audit would happen. He said it‚Äôs now ‚Äúfeasible‚Äù thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly policies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our top priority,‚Äù Ardoino said. He claims the regulatory environment has changed completely, and that Trump‚Äôs crypto push makes it easier. Tether has been promising transparency forever, but so far, it only puts out quarterly attestations, not full audits. Tether seeks Trump-era support to push audit forward Ardoino didn‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs PwC, EY, KPMG, or Deloitte‚Äîbut said they‚Äôre talking to one of them. He pointed to Trump‚Äôs stance as a green light. ‚ÄúIf the President of the United States says this is top priority for the U.S., Big Four auditing firms will have to listen,‚Äù he said. This is all part of Tether‚Äôs latest push to prove it actually backs the $140 billion worth of stablecoins it has issued. It says every coin is supported by dollar-denominated assets. The goal now is to finally show the math. The firm recently hired Simon McWilliams as CFO to lead the audit effort. This isn‚Äôt coming out of nowhere. Trump has signed an executive order for a strategic crypto reserve and is promising new rules for digital assets. Ardoino took a shot at U.S. regulators under Biden, calling their actions ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù a phrase the crypto crowd uses to describe the government‚Äôs campaign to cut off crypto from the banking system. Meanwhile, Tether keeps stacking U.S. debt. In 2024, it bought more than $33.1 billion in Treasury bills, making it the seventh biggest buyer of U.S. government debt. As of December 31, it held over $94 billion in Treasurys and more than $108 million in bank deposits, based on numbers from BDO Italia. According to Ardoino, 99% of those Treasury bills are held with Cantor Fitzgerald. And now that former Cantor CEO Howard Lutnick is Trump‚Äôs commerce secretary, it all sounds like one big reunion. Tether gets bigger than BlackRock, keeps dodging rules Tether has $120 billion in assets. Most of it is in U.S. Treasurys. The rest is a mix of bitcoin and gold. It made $6.2 billion in profit last year, beating BlackRock by $700 million. Ardoino bragged that with less than 100 employees, the company makes more money per person than anyone. But it‚Äôs not all glory. According to a Wall Street Journal report , this unregulated coin is getting used to get around U.S. sanctions. Russian oligarchs, Venezuelan oil firms, and even terror groups like Hamas have used Tether to move money. ‚ÄúWe need a regulatory framework that doesn‚Äôt allow offshore dollar-backed stablecoin providers to play by a different set of rules,‚Äù said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo in his testimony to Congress. He called out Tether by name. The Journal dug through blockchain data, court records, and private messages. They found Venezuelan oil payments made in Tether, sanctioned groups laundering money, and a huge black market. Tether says it freezes wallets tied to criminals. Ardoino claimed, ‚ÄúWe have a proactive approach to safeguarding our ecosystem against illicit activities.‚Äù That sounds nice, but ChainArgos says that from 2018 to June 2024, Tether blacklisted 2,713 wallets holding $153 billion. Only $1.4 billion was frozen. The rest moved too fast to catch. The company says it can track everything on public blockchains and even destroy tokens held in wallets if needed. But it‚Äôs like a never-ending Whac-A-Mole game. Tether turns up everywhere‚Äîwar zones, scams, economies in collapse Back in 2014, Tether started with a weird founding team. One of them, Giancarlo Devasini, was a plastic surgeon. Another was William Quigley, who called the idea of profiting from billions in backing ‚Äúa fantasy.‚Äù Quigley and the others left early. Devasini stayed and still runs the company today. He lives in a luxury villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Ardoino has become the face of it all. Tether really took off during the 2020‚Äì2021 bull run. Its market cap went from $4 billion to $80 billion fast. Traders loved it for moving in and out of bets without touching banks. Now, it‚Äôs used in all kinds of places regular dollars can‚Äôt go. In Iran, a platform called TetherLand lets people swap their rials for Tether. In Argentina and Turkey, where inflation is out of control, people use Tether to save money and make everyday purchases. Over 300 million people use Tether, according to Ardoino. But criminals use it too. Southeast Asian money launderers love Tether, according to a 2024 UN report. The tokens bounce from one wallet to another so fast it‚Äôs hard to trace them. That same report said Tether is a ‚Äúpreferred choice‚Äù for bad actors in the region. The structure is simple. Direct customers wire dollars to Tether Holdings, and the company issues tokens backed by U.S. Treasurys. But once those tokens hit the open market, anything can happen. Exchanges and brokerages all over the world move the coins, and nobody watches the secondary market. In Venezuela, PdVSA, the state oil company, started demanding oil payments in Tether in 2020. Buyers were told to send coins to specific wallets. Others just swapped suitcases of cash for Tether, then spent it on prepaid crypto cards. That setup didn‚Äôt just help Maduro‚Äôs government dodge sanctions‚Äîit fueled corruption. Middlemen kept the money. The scandal blew up so badly that it forced the oil minister to step down. ‚ÄúThis cryptocurrency‚Äôs use only has served to perpetuate gigantic levels of corruption,‚Äù said former oil minister Rafael Ram√≠rez. Even so, for regular Venezuelans, Tether became survival. Inflation hit 2 million percent. Currency controls blocked overseas payments. A guy named Guillermo Goncalvez started a platform called El Dorado that connects users for peer-to-peer Tether trading. The platform has over 150,000 users. ‚ÄúUSDT is the digital dollar for all Venezuelans,‚Äù he said. In Russia, Tether is everywhere. A report from a Russian research group found that importers use it to swap rubles for foreign currencies. Rosbank, a major lender, helps clients send Tether to suppliers. A fixer named Ekaterina Zhdanova arranged deals worth hundreds of millions in Tether, according to Telegram chats and blockchain data. She‚Äôs from a Siberian town but built a luxury business helping rich Russians dodge sanctions. She handled so much cash they needed planes to move it. One client wanted to buy $10 million in Tether per month for a total of $300 million. The money was going to be handed over in Turkey or the UAE. ‚ÄúThey will use planes to pick up the cash,‚Äù she said. Zhdanova was later sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. French cops arrested her at an airport as part of a separate money laundering case. She‚Äôs still in custody. Now, Tether is investing in businesses that use its token for daily payments. More usage means more token issuance. More issuance means more dollars to manage. In Tbilisi, Georgia, shops show the Tether logo outside. ATMs let people buy the coin with cash. It‚Äôs become the go-to currency when real dollars are blocked. Tether has become the shadow dollar‚Äîmoving money anywhere, fast, without much oversight. And now it wants a Big Four audit. Maybe. Eventually. If the vibes are right. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Korea: Here‚Äôs Why",https://cryptopotato.com/bitmex-kucoin-among-exchanges-reportedly-facing-sanctions-in-s-korea-heres-why/,"South Korean financial authorities are considering imposing sanctions on several crypto exchanges that have failed to comply with local regulations. According to a report from local media Korea Economic Daily, the crypto exchanges include BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX. S. Korea to Sanction Crypto Exchanges The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission said these overseas crypto trading platforms are operating illegally in the country because they have failed to report as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act. The Special Financial Transactions Act states that entities engaging in crypto trading, storage, and management in South Korea must formally report their activities to the FIU. Failure to do so could attract criminal punishment and administrative sanctions because the firms will be considered illegal businesses. In addition, these exchanges have been operating Korean-language websites without providing marketing and customer support for South Korean investors. As a result, the FIU is now investigating their activities, evaluating appropriate procedures with relevant organizations, and strongly considering measures like blocking site access. ‚ÄúWe are currently reviewing blocking access to unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year,‚Äù stated an FIU official. A Continuous Crackdown on Crypto Platforms This is not the first time financial authorities in South Korea have made moves to sanction or block investor access to non-compliant crypto exchanges. In September 2021, the FIU asked more than 60 exchanges that could not meet up with the local anti-money laundering (AML) rules and registration requirements to shut down their services and exit the country. At the time, only four trading platforms, including Upbit, Bithumb , Coinone, and Korbit, were fully operational, while about 28 others, which obtained security certificates, could offer certain services without won settlements. Furthermore, in 2022, the FIU asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission to block access to 16 overseas exchanges that failed to report their operations as VASPs. The regulatory agency also joined forces with local card companies to block crypto purchases and payment services made from these platforms. Earlier this year, the FIU revealed there are only 31 registered crypto firms in South Korea, down 26% from 42 in 2024. With the latest crackdown, that number is bound to shrink even further.

This prediction aligns with growing industry speculation, including comments from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has suggested that XRP ETFs could launch in the second half of 2025 . The prediction market‚Äôs surge in confidence follows multiple ETF filings, and the possibility of approval has generated significant anticipation within the crypto community, with many seeing it as a pivotal moment for XRP‚Äôs institutional adoption.

Institutional interest in digital assets has grown substantially, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in 2024. This momentum has led investors to speculate that regulators may soon greenlight additional crypto ETFs, including those tied to XRP. 11 notable firms including Bitwise and Franklin Templeton , have applied for XRP ETFs, and if approved, they would provide institutional investors with a regulated and accessible vehicle to gain exposure to the digital asset. This could result in increased liquidity, heightened mainstream adoption, and further legitimization of XRP within the financial sector. One observer noted that an ETF approval could ‚Äúbring massive institutional inflows and solidify XRP‚Äôs place in the market.‚Äù We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Predictions The crypto community has reacted enthusiastically to the Polymarket prediction, with many believing approval is inevitable. One commenter expressed excitement for the ETFs, predicting that these could be approved by June or July. The growing number of filings suggests asset managers see potential in an XRP-based fund. Now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple, we could see more applications shortly. Outlook for 2025 The current sentiment surrounding an XRP ETF reflects broader expectations for regulatory advancements in the crypto space. As the year progresses, attention will be on the SEC‚Äôs approach to approving additional crypto-based financial products. The regulator has already acknowledged most of these filings. While this does not guarantee approval, it is a positive step that shows the SEC‚Äôs willingness to engage with the crypto industry and its offerings to consumers. With institutional demand rising and multiple filings already submitted, the approval of XRP ETF in 2025 appears increasingly likely. Polymarket‚Äôs prediction shows that the community is eager to see these products approved. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Calls for stablecoin regulation seek to establish uniform standards, easing compliance and reducing market uncertainty. These shifts may foster a clearer environment that encourages institutional participation and deeper market engagement. The evolving U.S. framework could set international benchmarks, prompting a broader rethinking of digital asset rules. Regulatory developments in cryptocurrency intensified this week, marked by two major U.S. events: the SEC ending its prominent legal dispute with Ripple over XRP, and President Donald Trump calling for clear stablecoin regulation . Additionally, the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash. Meanwhile, on the international stage, Germany‚Äôs BaFin intensified enforcement by cracking down on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token, while Pakistan actively considers legalizing cryptocurrency to stimulate economic growth. These events highlight the evolving global approach as nations seek clearer crypto regulation news, balancing innovation with oversight. SEC Ends Ripple Case, Shaping Crypto Regulation News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially ended its extended legal proceedings against Ripple, concluding the contentious debate over whether XRP qualifies as a security. Ripple‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the resolution on X, emphasizing that XRP was ultimately not classified as a security. This is it ‚Äì the moment we‚Äôve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal ‚Äì a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright. Let's build. pic.twitter.com/7WsD0C92Cm ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) March 19, 2025 Ripple maintained that XRP should not be regulated as a security, consistently challenging the SEC‚Äôs aggressive enforcement actions, which it claimed negatively impacted XRP investors. Legal experts view the case‚Äôs resolution as influential, potentially changing regulatory attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Legal expert Seth Goertz, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP and former federal prosecutor, indicated that the case‚Äôs outcome is key in establishing legal clarity for the crypto industry, particularly in defining when digital assets fall under securities regulations. Following the announcement, XRP experienced a sharp price increase, moving up to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and surpassing major stablecoins like Tether. This resolution is expected to encourage regulatory clarity and bolster investor confidence, especially among digital asset exchanges that previously operated under uncertain legal conditions. Daniel Stabile, from Winston & Strawn LLP, noted that the SEC‚Äôs decision to end the case may signal a broader shift toward allowing legislative and regulatory processes, rather than litigation, to set clear guidelines for crypto markets. As Ripple celebrates its legal win, another major political figure is stepping into the debate over cryptocurrency regulation . Trump Pushes for Stablecoin Regulation and U.S. Crypto Dominance In a virtual speech at the Digital Assets Summit in New York, Donald Trump urged Congress to pass stablecoin regulations with ‚Äúsimple, common-sense rules.‚Äù Today President Trump spoke at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit ‚Äî becoming the first sitting president in history to address a crypto conference. @blockworksDAS @POTUS pic.twitter.com/8aijMb1VcG ‚Äî David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 21, 2025 He also vowed to position the U.S. as a leading player in global cryptocurrency markets. This push for stablecoin regulation matches industry demands for clearer rules, balancing innovation and financial stability. If implemented, such legislation could clarify how stablecoins operate within the U.S. financial system, potentially attracting more institutional investors to the sector. Treasury Lifts Tornado Cash Sanctions, but Cautions Remain In a major reversal, the U.S. Treasury removed sanctions on Tornado Cash , the Ethereum-based mixer previously blacklisted for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions. You might also like US Treasury Removes Sanctions on Ethereum Mixer Tornado Cash This decision follows a reassessment of how financial sanctions apply to decentralized platforms, particularly as the crypto industry evolves. While the move marks a shift in the Treasury‚Äôs approach, officials stressed that they remain committed to combating financial crime. The agency highlights ongoing concerns over cyber threats, particularly state-sponsored hacking and money laundering linked to North Korea. U.S. residents and businesses were advised to be cautious when engaging with digital asset services that could be exploited for illicit purposes. The decision to lift sanctions suggests regulators may be moving toward a more nuanced approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) , recognizing both its risks and its potential. While the U.S. eases some crypto sanctions, European regulators are tightening oversight. Germany‚Äôs BaFin Cracks Down on Ethena‚Äôs USDe Token In Europe, Germany‚Äôs financial regulator BaFin took action against Ethena GmbH, freezing its asset reserves over concerns about the approval process for its USDe token. BaFin suspects that Ethena GmbH is offering unapproved securities, including USDe and sUSDe tokens, without proper authorization under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This move shows the increasing regulatory pressure in the European Union as authorities enforce the recently implemented MiCA framework. BaFin‚Äôs crackdown on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token highlights compliance challenges. Other crypto firms may also need to reassess their strategies to comply with MiCA. Not all countries share Europe‚Äôs caution‚ÄîPakistan is exploring crypto adoption as a growth strategy. Pakistan Considers Legalizing Crypto to Boost Economic Growth While some countries tighten restrictions, others are moving toward crypto adoption. Pakistan is exploring the legalization of cryptocurrency trading in an effort to attract international investment and stimulate economic growth. JUST IN: Pakistan to legalize cryptocurrency. ‚Äî Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 20, 2025 Bilal bin Saqib, chief advisor to Pakistan‚Äôs finance minister for digital assets, emphasized that the country wants to leverage its young, tech-savvy workforce to become a Web3 hub. With 60% of its population under the age of 30, Pakistan sees crypto as an opportunity for financial inclusion and technological advancement. If Pakistan successfully establishes a regulatory framework for crypto, it could position itself as a key player in the digital asset space, particularly in South Asia. However, uncertainty persists about how the government will balance oversight and innovation. The Future of Crypto Regulation: A Global Balancing Act This week‚Äôs developments highlight the complex and often contradictory nature of global crypto regulation news. The U.S. is showing signs of a more structured regulatory framework, while Europe is tightening enforcement. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Pakistan are looking to embrace crypto as a means of economic growth. As regulatory approaches evolve, governments worldwide recognize crypto‚Äôs lasting role in the financial sector. The challenge now is finding the right balance between oversight, innovation, and financial security. Whether through stablecoin regulations, sanctions revisions, or new frameworks for token approvals, the next few months could shape the future of crypto for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will the SEC‚Äôs withdrawal affect crypto enforcement? The SEC‚Äôs retreat signals a shift from heavy litigation to clear, consistent rules. This move aims to lower enforcement burdens and create a stable regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty for crypto operators. What benefits can clear stablecoin regulations offer? Defining stablecoin rules can standardize market practices and lower compliance costs. Clear guidelines boost investor confidence and spur innovation by cutting legal ambiguities that hinder institutional investment. How might these changes influence global crypto standards? U.S. policy shifts may set international benchmarks, encouraging other nations to streamline their frameworks. A unified approach can boost cross-border investments and harmonize digital asset practices globally. What impact could clearer crypto rules have on institutional investment? Clearer rules reduce legal risks and operational uncertainty, making the market more attractive to institutions. Predictable oversight can spur long-term investments and deepen overall market engagement. What further changes can we expect in the crypto regulatory landscape? We can expect incremental updates as regulators refine their approach through ongoing industry dialogue. Future measures will likely target major market players and clarify compliance standards for digital assets.

In the comment section of TON‚Äôs clarification post, many users praised the team for ending the confusion, while others reaffirmed their bullish sentiments, making it clear the little misunderstanding has not changed how they feel about Toncoin. Of course, there were also some who wanted to know who planted the rumor in the first place and also those who suspected foul play, as the clarification came about a day after the news had spread and caused a brief price surge for the TON token. One user implied the rumor was planted to ‚Äúhype‚Äù things up, while another implied that they waited for some time to retract the rumor so the token could pump. Whether this is true or not is up for speculation, but it is true that the TON token pumped almost 8% as a result of the VC investment rumors. At the time of this writing, the confusion has cleared up, and TON‚Äôs price is now worth $3.61, having fallen by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The fundraising confusion came days after Pavel Durov left France The confusion regarding TON receiving millions in funding from VCs comes days after Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the social messaging app Telegram, was allowed to fly home to Dubai. Telegram‚Äôs founder Pavel Durov shared a picture he claims is the new photo on his passport. Source: Pavel Durov (X/Twitter) The privilege does not mean he is free of all charges as the French authorities continue their unprecedented case against him. Durov was arrested in August after he was accused of not doing enough to properly moderate his app to curb criminality, even though Telegram has previously denied having insufficient moderation. The tech billionaire has denied not cooperating with law enforcement over drug trafficking, child sexual abuse content and fraud. The case has attracted a lot of attention as it marks the first time a tech leader has been arrested for the lawlessness taking place on their platform. In a post on his Telegram channel, Durov expressed happiness to finally be home, but clarified that the ‚Äúprocess is ongoing.‚Äù He also thanked the French judges for letting him go home and praised his lawyers for their ‚Äúrelentless efforts in demonstrating that, when it comes to moderation, cooperation, and fighting crime, for years Telegram not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.‚Äù His arrest happened in August 2024 as he arrived in Paris on his private jet, and French judges initially banned him from leaving France. As for the conditions of his release, all we have to go on is what the office of the Paris prosecutor told the BBC on Monday, which is that ‚Äúthe obligations of judicial supervision‚Äù had been suspended between 15 March and 7 April. Durov, who was born in Russia, resides in Dubai. He also has residences in France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis. Since his arrest, Telegram has significantly altered the way it operates to deal with allegations that have dubbed it a portable version of the dark web. It has joined the Internet Watch Foundation program, which aims to help find, remove and report child sexual abuse material being shared online. According to an announcement from the app, it will also disclose the IP addresses/phone numbers of those who violate its rules and hand them over to police in response to valid legal requests. Telegram has also published transparency reports about how much content is taken down ‚Äì a standard industry practice it previously refused to comply with. A Telegram spokesperson has said the company now actively moderates its platform to get rid of harmful content each day. However, despite their best efforts, criminal activity persists and will probably continue until harsher measures are considered. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The regulator‚Äôs intervention is seen not merely as a punitive measure but as a wake-up call to reassess operational resilience in the evolving digital asset landscape. Market observers believe that such rigorous enforcement might restore investor confidence and encourage clearer standards across synthetic token markets. BaFin, Germany‚Äôs financial regulator, banned all public sales of Ethena GmbH‚Äôs USDe token this week, citing flaws in the approval process and violations of the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR). The regulator outlined several immediate actions against Ethena GmbH to enforce the ban. According to BaFin, the synthetic dollar token had been offered as an unregistered security in Germany, prompting the authority to restrict its operations without delay. BaFin Orders Asset Freeze and Website Shutdown for USDe Token In its announcement , BaFin instructed Ethena GmbH to freeze the reserve assets backing the USDe token and halt all new customer registrations. The company must also shut down its website, and a special representative has been appointed to oversee compliance with these directives. ‚ÄúThe BaFin also has reasonable grounds to suspect that Ethena GmbH in Germany sells securities in the form of sUSDe tokens from Ethena OpCo. Ltd. without the required prospectus,‚Äù the regulator said. Breaking: The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority announced that it had found serious flaws in Ethena GmbH's approval process for USDe tokens and ordered immediate enforcement measures to prohibit Ethena GmbH from further offering its USDe tokens to the public and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 21, 2025 ‚ÄúThe USDe and sUSDe tokens are interconnected in such a way that investors can receive a sUSDe token in exchange for a USDe token,‚Äù it added. Despite the prohibition on primary sales and issuance, secondary market trading of USDe remains unaffected by the ban. BaFin identified ‚Äúserious deficiencies‚Äù in Ethena GmbH‚Äôs approval process, including noncompliance with MiCAR‚Äôs capital and asset reserve requirements. Ethena GmbH had been operating under a transitional provision that allows issuers of asset-referenced tokens to continue business while awaiting regulatory approval. The company applied for authorization on July 29, 2024, a day before the deadline, and has been issuing USDe in Germany since June 28, 2024. Currently, approximately 5.4 billion USDe tokens are in circulation, with a substantial portion issued outside Germany before MiCAR took effect. To safeguard customer interests, BaFin has ordered the company‚Äôs asset reserves to block and restrict the authority of its managing directors over those funds. Holders of USDe tokens cannot redeem them directly with Ethena GmbH, though trading on secondary markets continues as normal. BaFin‚Äôs statement also raised concerns about the company issuing sUSDe tokens, suggesting they could constitute unregistered securities. The tokens are linked to USDe, allowing investors to exchange them while receiving additional returns. The regulator is now considering further enforcement actions, which could include a complete ban on the public offering of these securities. BaFin is overseeing the authorization process in collaboration with the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Further details will be provided upon completion of the licensing process. Ethena Defends USDe Token Amid BaFin Ban Following BaFin‚Äôs ban on USDe in Germany, Ethena Labs reassured users that redemptions remain unaffected through its British Virgin Islands-based entity, Ethena BVI Limited. The company, addressing the situation on X, stated that while its German subsidiary‚Äôs MiCAR application was denied, USDe remains fully backed. ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by this decision but will continue evaluating alternative regulatory frameworks,‚Äù Ethena wrote. Since its inception, Ethena has been exploring various options and jurisdictions when it comes to regulatory frameworks globally that would be conducive to our business, and as a result we have multiple entities within our structure facilitating minting and redemption. A MiCAR‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) March 21, 2025 The firm also dismissed claims that its assets were frozen, clarifying that all funds remain accessible. It plans to update its terms in the coming week to reflect the regulatory developments. Ethena‚Äôs regulatory challenges come as institutional interest grows. Recent investments include a $20 million backing from MEXC and a 500,000 ENA token purchase by World Liberty Financial. BaFin Tightens Oversight on Synthetic Assets Across Europe BaFin‚Äôs decision reflects the regulator‚Äôs cautious approach towards crypto assets operating within Germany‚Äôs jurisdiction. Its ban on Ethena‚Äôs USDe token highlights the tightening regulatory grip on stablecoins and synthetic dollar tokens in Germany and across Europe. With MiCAR enforcement ramping up, stablecoin and synthetic asset issuers will face increased scrutiny over compliance with capital, reserve, and disclosure requirements. The outcome of BaFin‚Äôs assessment of Ethena GmbH could set a precedent for how synthetic dollar tokens are regulated under MiCAR across the EU. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is BaFin‚Äôs ban of USDe actually protecting German innovation rather than hindering it? Counterintuitively, yes. By enforcing strict compliance standards early, BaFin creates a more predictable environment where legitimate crypto projects can thrive without unfair competition from operators who bypass proper authorization channels. Does this ban reflect MiCAR‚Äôs flexibility or its rigidity? Neither‚Äîit demonstrates MiCAR‚Äôs intentional interpretative space. Germany‚Äôs interpretation reveals how the regulation creates room for national authorities to calibrate enforcement based on local market conditions and risk appetites. Is this primarily about USDe‚Äôs technology or about EU regulatory sovereignty? The latter. This action positions Europe as asserting regulatory independence from both American permissiveness and Chinese restriction, establishing a distinct ‚Äúthird way‚Äù in global crypto governance.

Key Metrics Show $200,000 Prediction Is Likely",https://coingape.com/is-bitcoin-price-bottom-in-key-metrics-show-rally-is-likely/,"Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility is slowing down as the coin‚Äôs capitulation continues. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs price was changing hands for $84,278.83 as it pared off the losses accrued in earlier trading. At this pace, the question now hinges on whether BTC can form sustainable support at the $84,000 price mark or whether further drawdown lies ahead. Core Bitcoin Price Metric to Watch According to Glassnode data , BTC Short-Term Holders (STH) are under increasing pressure. This group‚Äôs unrealized losses have surged, pushing many STH coins into losses. As revealed, their holdings are now nearing the two-standard deviation threshold. Despite this outlook, the data platform hinted that losses remain within historical bull market bounds. Specifically, it noted that these losses are less severe than the May 2021 sell-off from the all-time high. Glassnode said the rolling 30-day losses for STH have topped $7 billion. It confirmed that ‚Äúthis remains well below prior capitulation events, such as the $19.8B and $20.7B losses in 2021-22.‚Äù BTC price jumped to an ATH above $109,000 in January but has since dropped by 22.79%. While experts predicted a drop of over 35%, the limited loss from holders can form a good rebound basis. BTC Price Bottom In, Here Are Triggers for Rally Over the past week, Bitcoin has rallied within very tight price ranges, from a low of $81,300 to a high of $87,320. Some market observers believe the coin has attained its floor price and might be set for a rebound. While firms like Strategy have kept Bitcoin purchase plans alive with Strife‚Äôs perpetual stock offering , the Global Money Supply M2 also lays a positive basis for growth. With the current outlook, the projection that the $83,00 level is the BTC price floor is resounding among analysts. The shift in regulation and the backing of Bitcoin by President Donald Trump creates a tailwind for the coin‚Äôs proponents. At the Digital Asset Summit earlier this week, President Trump reiterated the plan to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Several government agencies have shifted their policies in this regard, which might attract investors in the long term. How High Can Bitcoin Valuation Rise? Despite the slowdown in growth in recent weeks, many market leaders are still confident in the coin‚Äôs prospects. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan maintained the price target of $1 million by 2029. He cited a longer-term reaction to macroeconomic uncertainties as the basis for his prediction. While this Bitcoin price prediction appears lofty, others believe Bitcoin may cross $200,000 once the bull rally returns. With spot Bitcoin ETF hype and other growing institutional adoption, BTC price has an arguably bright future. The post Is Bitcoin Price Bottom In?

The Financial Services panel will then review the bill on April 2. So far, the Trump administration has been very vocal about its crypto support and the need for a stablecoin bill. However, bipartisan support for crypto is growing significantly, increasing the likelihood that the stablecoin bill will be fully approved. The stablecoin bill has received support from both Republicans and Democrats A key House Committee is likely to vote in favour of the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) first proposed the bill, which has quickly earned the support of both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Genius Act, and five of the committee‚Äôs 11 Democrats joined the Republican majority to support the bill. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers will have the choice of both federal and state charters based on market capitalisation. Moreover, foreign issuers will be obligated to follow The nation‚Äôs protocols on reserves, anti-money laundering measures, sanctions compliance, and liquidity. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan, even commented, ‚ÄúThe reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.‚Äù Maxine Walters and Elizabeth Warren believe the bill fails to protect consumers adequately Like many other analysts and crypto enthusiasts, Chairman French Hill believes the stablecoin market should be regulated. Hill claimed that a regulated stablecoin environment would yield a stronger dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms that have presented their legislative agenda in the Capitol before have also consistently promoted stablecoins as a means to improving financial inclusion and a much cheaper and faster transaction option. However, Maxine Walters, the top Democrat on the House committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts believe the bill will not protect consumers adequately. They also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk‚Äôs X or Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins. Other critics have also raised concerns about the lack of stablecoin FDIC insurance, fearing huge losses for users if the token collapses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Natural gas‚Äôs importance in global markets could attract institutional traders beyond crypto. Beyond its latest futures filings, Coinbase is set to launch 24/7 Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures in the U.S., aligning domestic markets with global trading standards. Crypto derivatives account for 75% of global trading volumes, and Coinbase‚Äôs expansion seeks to attract more of this activity to U.S. markets while staying compliant with CFTC regulations. Coinbase ranks as the largest Ethereum staking operator , holding 11.42% of staked ETH. With 3.84 million ETH staked and near-perfect validator uptime, the exchange continues strengthening its influence across trading and staking sectors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What could this deal indicate about evolving trends in crypto derivatives? This potential acquisition hints at an industry shift. Exchanges are broadening their toolset to offer comprehensive trading options, reflecting rising investor interest and evolving regulatory norms in digital assets. How might a unified license structure impact crypto market compliance? Uniting licenses under a single operator may simplify compliance checks and encourage uniform oversight. This consolidation could ease regulatory processes and offer a steadier framework for digital asset trades. What long-term impacts could arise from integrating options trading with existing platforms? Merging options trading into established platforms may boost market engagement and broaden revenue streams. This integration supports legacy exchanges in adapting offerings to meet evolving investor demand and digital market shifts.

Based on recent data, around 8.97 million ETH are in their possession now. This shortage comes as the price of Ethereum has taken a precipitous decline. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin In New Whale Hands‚ÄîA Mega BTC Rally On The Horizon? Supply Tightens On Exchanges The declining volume of Ether on exchanges is an indication that the holders are taking their money elsewhere in growing numbers. One of the main reasons behind this is the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, according to a recent examination by Santiment. People are interacting with several DeFi protocols with their Ethereum to lend liquidity or earn rewards. Another principal element is the expansion of staking, whereby ETH owners ‚Äúlock up‚Äù their coins to help secure the network and be rewarded while doing so. Therefore, there is fewer Ethereum to sell on the exchanges. üëã Thanks to the many DeFi and staking options, Ethereum‚Äôs holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015). There is 16.4% less $ETH on exchanges compared to just 7 weeks ago. üòÆ pic.twitter.com/r5957wPhLi ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 20, 2025 Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Despite the lower supply of Ethereum on exchanges, which some would expect to drive prices up because of scarcity, the opposite has occurred. Based on latest figures, the price of Ethereum has dropped by about 45% from its December high. On March 21, the price was about $1,899. Ethereum has been among the worst-performing major cryptocurrencies over the past few years. The cause for such a decline in price is varied and can involve overall market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and increased competition from other blockchain systems. Experts Share Their Thoughts Financial analysts are giving their opinions regarding what this means for the future value of Ethereum. Standard Chartered, a well-known financial institution, has recently reduced its year-end price target for Ethereum. They now predict a price of $4,000 at the end of the year, a significant drop from their previous estimate of $10,000. The primary purpose of this revision is the rising competition from Ethereum‚Äôs competitor layer-2 networks, which aim to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum foundation blockchain. Users and traffic on such networks can be different from the central Ethereum network. Related Reading: XRP Turnaround Moment? Analyst Says It‚Äôs Lift-Off Time Upsides On The Horizon? Despite the current price hiccups, there are potential explanations why a recovery could be realized. One possibility is staking exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

In 2020, this so-called ‚ÄúDogecoin killer‚Äù launched with barely any fanfare. The entry price was so microscopic that even a hundred bucks could‚Äôve fetched millions of tokens. Fast forward to today, and those same early investors are sitting on insane profits‚Äîsome turning a few hundred dollars into millions. But let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîShiba Inu‚Äôs explosive moment has passed. The days of getting in at a rock-bottom price and riding a rocket to the moon are over. It‚Äôs already mainstream, and massive gains aren‚Äôt as easy. But here‚Äôs the thing about meme coins: there‚Äôs always a next big play. Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a brand-new meme coin that isn‚Äôt just another Shiba Inu wannabe‚Äîit‚Äôs rewriting the script. Arctic Pablo isn‚Äôt riding on the past success of other tokens. It‚Äôs carving out its own legacy with an immersive story, a lucrative staking system, and an insanely limited-time presale where early adopters can get in at a fraction of its potential worth. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Frontier in Meme Coins Arctic Pablo Coin invites investors on an adventurous journey alongside its eponymous explorer, Arctic Pablo. Set against the backdrop of icy terrains and mystical ice-covered islands, Pablo‚Äôs quest is not just about exploration but also about uncovering the enigmatic $APC coins. These tokens symbolize more than mere currency; they represent a gateway to prosperity, imbued with the magic of forgotten lands. This storytelling approach transforms the investment experience, making participants feel like integral parts of an unfolding legend. Departing from traditional presale models, Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is structured around Pablo‚Äôs journey through various mythical locations. Arctic Pablo Coin‚Äôs presale is in the Nippy Nook location, the 15th phase of its journey. The token is priced at $0.000079, with over $1.96 million raised so far. The launch price is $0.008, offering early investors a potential return on investment (ROI) of over 10,027.85% from the current presale price to the listing price. An investment of $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 12,656,860 APC tokens, which could be worth $101,254.88 upon reaching the listing price. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary mechanism to enhance token scarcity and value through weekly token burns. At the end of each presale phase, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens over time. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. Its one of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now . The Shiba Inu Phenomenon: A Missed Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene as a decentralized meme token, positioning itself as an experiment in community-driven cryptocurrency. Launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly gained traction, riding on the coattails of Dogecoin‚Äôs popularity. Its initial price was minuscule, allowing early investors to acquire large quantities with minimal capital. As the coin gained popularity, its value soared, creating substantial returns for those who got in early. However, as with many rapidly appreciating assets, the window for maximum gains was narrow. Many potential investors were on the sidelines, watching SHIB‚Äôs value escalate beyond their reach. This scenario underscores the importance of identifying and acting on emerging opportunities before they become mainstream. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities for investors. While the Shiba Inu moment may have passed, Arctic Pablo Coin is a compelling contender among the top new meme coins to invest in now. Its unique narrative, innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanisms, and attractive staking rewards position it as a project with significant potential. Investors seeking to capitalize on low entry points and participate in a community-driven adventure should join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now, before this opportunity, too, becomes a tale of missed chances.

Two established coins, Dogecoin and Cardano, are currently struggling, creating room for a new project like RCO Finance to shine. Investors are rapidly taking notice, shifting toward projects that can deliver real value alongside massive profits. Dogecoin Struggles as Miners Dump Millions of Tokens Dogecoin (DOGE), once touted as one of the top altcoins to watch, has been going through a rough patch lately. An analyst recently shared data revealing Dogecoin miners sold off over 65 million tokens in just 48 hours. Such significant selling pressure from miners usually signals trouble, potentially pushing the meme coin even lower. At the current price of $0.17, Dogecoin sits far below its peak of $0.431 from January. Analysts warn if this selling continues, DOGE could slip under $0.15 soon. However, some traders remain hopeful, believing past patterns could bring a major comeback. Notably, large-scale investors bought over 1.4 billion DOGE in a single day last week, hinting that ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù may expect a bullish turn. This mixed sentiment makes Dogecoin one of the key altcoins to watch closely. Source: Coinmarketcap Cardano Losing Investor Interest Amid Declining Volume Cardano (ADA), another top altcoin, isn‚Äôt faring much better. ADA is currently priced at $0.7086, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Even more concerning is that its trading volume dropped significantly by over 20% , hinting that investors might be losing interest in Cardano‚Äôs previously compelling story. With ADA down 1.58% this week and a declining volume, analysts see signs of a potential trend reversal. Cardano‚Äôs slow pace in delivering promised upgrades, coupled with current macroeconomic conditions, has investors reconsidering their holdings and seeking alternative altcoins with stronger growth potential. This cautious sentiment toward Cardano might encourage traders to explore other altcoins to watch‚Äîespecially those showing increased market excitement and rapid growth potential, like RCO Finance. Source: Coinmarketcap RCO Finance Emerges as the Most Promising Altcoin of 2025 While established coins like Dogecoin and Cardano struggle, investors are swiftly turning toward RCO Finance , recognizing it as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Currently priced at only $0.1 and boasting a modest market cap of $591,220, investors see a huge growth runway ahead. RCO Finance isn‚Äôt just another crypto platform; it‚Äôs a revolutionary decentralized financial ecosystem. Users can buy crypto, stocks, real estate, and numerous tokenized assets‚Äîall seamlessly from a single account, without cumbersome KYC processes. This simplicity makes investing hassle-free, attracting new users in droves. But what really sets RCO Finance apart from other altcoins is its advanced AI Robo Advisor. This innovative tool continuously monitors the crypto market, analyzing live data from reliable sources like Reuters and Bloomberg, along with comprehensive on-chain analytics. Imagine spotting opportunities early, like the recent surge in Immutable X (IMX), which exploded from $0.4 to $1.2‚Äîa +200% gain within just months. RCO Finance‚Äôs Robo Advisor could have caught such price moves well before mainstream traders noticed, helping investors get in early and maximize profits. Additionally, RCO Finance offers an extensive range of 120,000 assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, and tokenized real estate. Investors can conveniently diversify their portfolios without converting crypto into fiat first, all within one simple platform. Investor enthusiasm is evident, as RCO Finance has raised over $13 million already, showcasing robust community backing. Analysts expect a massive rally post-launch, with predictions suggesting gains of up to 20,000%. To put this into perspective, a modest $500 investment today could potentially grow to $100,000. It has also been audited by SolidProof , a popular auditor in the field, verifying its security, trustworthiness, and reliability. In addition to that, investors already get to experiment with its functionalities with the newly released Beta Platform . Why RCO Finance is a Must-Have Altcoin Before the Bull Market Returns Given the current crypto landscape, RCO Finance is perfectly positioned to become one of the most profitable altcoins this year. With features like its AI-powered Robo Advisor, no-KYC simplicity, and robust staking options, the platform offers unmatched potential. As the crypto market prepares for its next bullish phase, this might be the last chance to enter RCO Finance at its current presale price. The extraordinary profit potential and real-world functionality mean it‚Äôs a strong contender to outperform traditional favorites like Dogecoin and Cardano. When the market turns, you want to be holding the best-performing altcoins‚Äîthose with strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. RCO Finance is clearly leading the way, offering investors the tools to succeed in the next crypto boom.

Freysa AI‚Äôs native asset, FAI , is trading at $0.0226 at time of writing, up from around $0.0183 a day ago. The 298th-ranked crypto asset by market cap launched in late November. Freysa AI aims to be ‚Äúthe first truly sovereign AI agent.‚Äù The project‚Äôs AI agent has overseen a series of games designed to test human interaction with powerful artificial intelligence systems. For example, in November, entrants used prompts to ‚Äútrick‚Äù the Freysa AI into authorizing a transfer of prize pool funds. Each prompt cost a fee that in turn increased the prize. Being added to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering adding trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was created in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company‚Äôs standards. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like Amazon or something like that where a product might have three stars or it might have five stars, but if it starts to get one star consistently, it‚Äôs probably fraudulent or defective or something and maybe Amazon will remove it.

Hines suggested that the Trump administration would explore creative ways of funding the SBR without further burdening the American taxpayer. His sentiments seem to be an attempt to pacify Americans, many of whom, according to a recent survey, oppose the SBR. The Data for Progress advocacy group poll showed 51% of American voters disapprove of the idea, placing it last on the list of priority areas for federal funding. America‚Äôs budget-neutral means of financing its SBR Hines explained that his think tank had received countless ideas on how to fund the SBR. He, however, hinted that the one(s) it would settle on would have to be budget-neutral. On that account, the US could use the gains from its gold certificates to acquire more Bitcoin. The crypto council head honcho also held that the certificates were massively undervalued compared to actual gold values. Therefore, getting their correct valuation, as Senator Cynthia Lummins‚Äô Bitcoin Act 2025 proposes, would give America the finances it needs to build its BTC stash. He said, ‚ÄúIf we actually realize the gains on [these holdings], that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin.‚Äù How does revaluing the gold certificates work? Lummins‚Äô push and, therefore, Hines‚Äô stance have merit, too. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, the Fed banks holding gold certificates value them at $42.22 per troy ounce. That figure pales in comparison to the $3,037 , which is a similar unit of the precious metal fetches in the market. America owns about 8,133 metric tons of gold, which comes to 260.8 million troy ounces (using the formula, 1 metric ton = 32,150.7 troy ounces). Gold‚Äôs current price gives you a market value of roughly $792 billion ($3,037*260.8M). Meanwhile, the book value is slightly over $11 billion ($42.22*260.8M) , bringing potential gains to over $780 billion ($792B ‚Äì $11B). As we can see, revaluing these certificates to reflect gold‚Äôs prevailing prices could unlock plenty of dormant capital. Such a windfall would provide the US with enough liquidity to set up the SBR without tapping into taxpayers‚Äô funds. Overcoming challenges and exploring alternatives to revaluing gold certificates While the financial advantages are clear, questions remain about revalued gold certificates‚Äô scalability. Such a shift could induce pushback from the Federal Reserve and the‚ÄÇTreasury Department itself, since it would risk impacting monetary policy and inflation expectations. Additionally, changing the valuation of gold reserves might create legal and accounting complications that require congressional approval. Critics argue that revaluing gold does not generate new wealth but merely changes accounting metrics, making it a politically sensitive issue. Revaluing gold certificates‚ÄÇis a strong possibility, but other budget-neutral approaches are worth contemplating. The U.S. could, for instance, consider issuing Bitcoin-backed‚ÄÇbonds, as El Salvador has, or allocate some of the confiscated assets from criminal crypto activities toward funding the reserve. Other experts have proposed tokenizing segments of federal assets and allowing private investors to contribute to the SBR‚ÄÇvia decentralized finance (DeFi) methods.

Here‚Äôs how Coinbase latest $5 bilion acquisition deal could impact Bitcoin prices in the long-term . Bitcoin holds $84K as Coinbase moves to Acquire Deribit Bitcoin (BTC) closed trading around the $84,200 mark on Friday, March 22, as markets retreated from upwards volatility triggered by Trump‚Äôs appearance at Blockwork‚Äôs Digital Asset Summit. Following Trump‚Äôs speech advocating for Stablecoin regulations , and long-term BTC holding, BTC price raced to a weekly timeframe peak of $85,900 before returning 4% to close trading on Friday around $84,228. The impact of Trump‚Äôs BTC price was short-lived since his major talking points during speech had been relatively priced in during the previous market really. However, a recent media report surrounding Coinbase acquisition of derivatives-based crypto exchange could have far reaching longer-term impacts on Bitcoin price. Bitcoin price action | March 22, 2025 According to Bloomberg reports, Coinbase, the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange has entered advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the world‚Äôs leading bitcoin and ether options trading platform. Notably Bloomberg cited anonymous sources in the report , showing that the deal has not yet being made official. ‚ÄúThe companies have notified regulators in Dubai about the discussions as Deribit holds a license there, which would be taken over by any acquirer.‚Äù ‚Äì Bloomberg, March 21, 2025. Coinbase representatives were also coy on the rumours, declining to confirm any ongoing deal discussions. , ‚ÄúWe have a bold mission to increase economic freedom in the world, and are constantly exploring opportunities around the world to build, buy, partner and invest to accelerate our roadmap.‚Äù ‚Äì Coinbase. While official sources from Deribit and Coinbase keep mum, Bloomberg‚Äôs latest report suggests negotiations are progressing with the options trading platform reportedly valued between $4 billion and $5 billion. Coinbase (COIN) Traders See Mild Gains as Deribit acquisition hints Dubia Expansion Considering that Deribit holds an active license to operate in Dubai, Coinbase‚Äôs decision to pursue this acquisition appears to be a strategic move to expand into the Middle Eastern market. With increasing regulatory pressure from the U.S. and EU, regions such as the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore have emerged as key global hubs for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses. Coinbase (Coin) price surges 4.4% to hit $190 as Bloomberg reveals Deribit acquisition talks | March 21, 2025 The softening stance on crypto regulation in the U.S. could influence the trajectory of this deal. With growing institutional support and strategic reserve announcements expected, the industry could witness a shift in policy under former President Trump‚Äôs potential return. Trump recently reiterated his support for cryptocurrency at Blockworks‚Äô industry event this week. If finalized, Coinbase‚Äôs acquisition of Deribit could enhance its global footprint, broaden its derivatives offerings, and position the exchange to benefit from increasing institutional and sovereign adoption of cryptocurrencies‚Äîparticularly in the Middle East and Asia. Will Coinbase Acquisition of Deribit Impact Bitcoin Price? According to Bloomberg Deribit it‚Äôs the largest Options trading platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Options trading is an institution-dominated space. By acquiring Deribit, Coinbase can deploy options trading offerings, not only to US-based customers but also institutions with corporate headquarters in crypto hotbeds like Dubia, Singapore and Hong kong. Hence, the Coinbase acquisition deal for Deribit, could be yet another major catalyst that could spark increased institutional adoption of BTC in the months ahead. Notably, Donald Trump crypto strategic reserve heading for congressional approval could be a key determinant in Bitcoin global appeal as 2025 unfolds. Bitcoin price forecast: Double-bottom pattern hints at $114,000 rebound target Bitcoin price forecast signals on the BTCUSD daily chart shows a confirmed double-bottom reversal pattern, a historically bullish structure suggesting a potential move toward a long-term target of $114,000. The pattern formed with two distinct lows, at $78,000 and $76,000 followed by a breakout above the neckline resistance. At press time BTC Price is currently consolidating around $84,053, hovering near the middle Keltner Channel (KC) level of $85,392, indicating a neutral market trend as traders await the next major directional move. A bullish scenario could unfold if Bitcoin price can decisively reclaim the upper KC boundary at $93,252, especially if accompanied by increased trading volumes. More so, the BBP (Balanced Bull and Bear Power) indicator, while still negative at -859.38, has begun a reversal with green bars emerging‚Äîan early signal of bullish divergence. Conversely, failure to hold support at $77,533‚Äîthe lower KC band‚Äîcould invalidate the breakout structure, triggering renewed selling pressure. If bears regain control in the secenraio, BTC price risks retesting liquidity zones around $75,000, delaying the bullish trajectory. The next few sessions could be pivotal; as sustained price action above $85,000 strengthens could case for a continued uptrend toward the $114,00o target.

The Tron ecosystem is pushing a new proposal to implement a Bitcoin-like halving for TRX. In his post on X, Justin Sun revealed how the move will not disadvantage current validators in the ecosystem. Justin Sun and Advocacy for TRX Halving As explained on X by the Tron founder, Bitcoin developers had to evolve to limit their reward to users involved in crypto mining at the time. Going back memory lane, he noted that Bitcoin had to create an attractive 50 BTC per block reward to bootstrap the network. However, as the protocol grew, halving helped reduce the incentives to a sustainable level. Liking it to the Tron ecosystem, Justin Sun recounted that TRX is a deflationary asset that drops 1% per year. This made it the only deflationary asset among the top assets. As revealed, the massive rally in the price of TRX has pushed up the reward considerably. This, he believes, might make sense if a moderate slash is approved by the community. Per the analogy, he noted that the Tron ecosystem can achieve a 1.5% per year deflation by paying out about 1 million TRX in validator rewards daily. Notably, increasing this daily payout to 2 million TRX will increase deflation by 2% per year. To Sun, even if the community approved the halving reduction, Tron will remain an attractive chain for miners. The Tron Ecosystem Updates Beyond the TRX halving clarification, Justin Sun has been front-running many positive ecosystem updates. Over the past week, the Tron Founder has revealed the push for Tron integration on Solana . This partnership is poised to increase the transfer of native tokens across both chains. In addition, the ecosystem is also being increasingly embraced by top industry stakeholders. CoinGape reported that Justin Sun was appointed an advisor to President Trump-linked World Liberty Financial International (WLFi). Since then, TRX has remained a favorite for the coin in WLFi‚Äôs portfolio. Reports also show that TRX may bag an inclusion in the crypto reserve that the US government is putting together. TRX Price and Performance Outlook The price of TRX remains under the radar amid the growing shift in network supply and related trends. When writing, the coin changed hands for $0.2366, up by 0.13% in 24 hours. Amid the week-long fluctuations, the coin‚Äôs price rose from a low of $0.2305 to a high of $0.2373, showing a relatively mild volatility. However, earlier TRX price predictions from Sun teased the coin as hitting an all-time high soon. Analysts remain speculative about how the Tron halving proposal will shape out and its impact on price.

In response to an inquiry on professional orientation for all Gen Z high school graduates this year, Altman responded that studying AI tools is essential to succeed at work now. He argued that AI rapidly transforms work, and studying those skills makes sense. Altman drew an analogy by stating that during his high school days, when he studied how to program, it was the most stable route to decent-paying jobs. AI is already having‚ÄÇa huge influence in the tech world. According to Sam Altman, AI currently handles about half the coding at‚ÄÇmost companies. Some experts, like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, reckon AI will be capable of‚ÄÇ90% of coding in three to 6 months. That shift is leading companies to rethink‚ÄÇtheir hiring practices. Software engineers will not be extinct. However, businesses now need individuals who can work with and utilize AI‚ÄÇcapabilities. This is evident in job postings‚ÄÇat big employers like Apple, Amazon, and Meta, which recently offered seven-figure salaries for the best AI scientists. AI literacy has become the most sought-after skill According to a recent report by LinkedIn , AI literacy is the fastest emerging‚ÄÇskill for 2025. Companies‚ÄÇin all sectors want someone who understands AI and can wield it for problem-solving and innovation. The report describes AI literacy as a general skill covering knowledge and using tools like ChatGPT and other generative technologies. No one can deny it‚Äîit‚Äôs not just an inevitable part of the life of a‚ÄÇtech whiz anymore. Business, marketing, media, and communication professionals also use AI to enhance their work. Programmer engaged in coding: Source: Pixabay AI literacy allows people to leverage AI-powered tools, which can be applied without advanced‚ÄÇtechnical know-how for model building or data analysis. With artificial intelligence emerging as a powerful component in personal and professional workflows, engineers and tech professionals are adopting AI to automate processes, increase efficiency, and drive innovation. But getting one‚ÄÇof these lucrative AI jobs is no easy feat. As LinkedIn‚Äôs editor-in-chief, Dan Roth, reported today, while the fingertips attached to the dwindling hiring rate are at 3.4%,‚ÄÇpeople are applying in droves. He said companies are hiring less. It‚Äôs not a catastrophe, but it‚Äôs not good out there. AI skills are important, of course, but they are‚ÄÇnot the only way to future-proof yourself at work. Soft skills are‚ÄÇmore important than ever. Indeed‚Äôs chief executive, Chris Hyams, told Fortune that employers should focus on candidates with ‚Äúcuriosity and an openness‚Äù to learn. Adapting and bouncing‚ÄÇback will be crucial in navigating a shifting labour market. Soft skills remain important even with AI expertise While AI capabilities are an asset, technical skills alone will not be enough. Altman recommends Gen Z consider soft skills such as adaptability and resilience. As the employment landscape continues to shift, employees who can easily learn new technology will be sought after. Indeed chief executive Chris Hyams agrees. He recommends hiring managers seek out inquisitive applicants who will be adaptable. As AI automates more things, businesses still need people who can analyze, innovate and adapt. Despite formal education initiatives or self-instructing using AI tools‚ÄÇlike Google‚Äôs NotebookLM, younger professionals must stay ahead of the curve. According to Altman, as AI advances and the career sector is primed for disruption, Gen Z should use‚ÄÇsuch tools in their favour to stay at the forefront.

Rival Token Poised for Bigger Returns in the Next 3 Months,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ada-breakout-to-1-50-rival-token-poised-for-bigger-returns-in-the-next-3-months/,"As bullish momentum gathers steam behind a‚ÄÇpotential breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, Cardano (ADA) retires above $0.72. Analysts are forecasting a rally to $1.00 as buying pressure persists, though‚ÄÇwhale activity potentially undermines this trend. In the last few days, over 100 million ADA tokens have‚ÄÇbeen splashed on markets, and short-term stability is doubtful. As Cardano‚Äôs technical indicators suggest it may have hit‚ÄÇthe bottom, another project is stealing the limelight‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM), a recently launched presale that‚Äôs already blitzed past $4.1 million and is forecasting 10x+ gains after its token launch. Cardano‚Äôs Shaky Ascent The 4-hour chart of Cardano glooming a triple white soldier pattern with‚ÄÇthree consecutive green candles in the tug-of-war game between the bulls and bears. This usually indicates upward momentum, but ADA‚Äôs 2.82% intraday increase to $0.7246‚ÄÇis facing resistance. The MACD indicator approaches a bullish crossover, which‚ÄÇis complemented by RSI readings approaching neutrality. But according to data from Santiment, a grim truth is being unearthed:‚ÄÇwhales have dumped 100 million ADA in a week, cutting big holders balances to only 5.89 billion tokens. Such sell-offs could put a lid on gains at‚ÄÇ$1.00, well below the $1.50 that some optimists see. Key support comes in at $0.65; a break there threatens a drop to‚ÄÇ$0.60. Presale Momentum‚ÄÇof Mutuum Finance Builds As Cardano faces volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to forge ahead into phase 3 of its presale at‚ÄÇ$0.02 per token. More than 6,300‚ÄÇinvestors have already joined, driving a $4.1 million raise. Phase‚ÄÇ3 is nearly sold out before Phase 4, where prices will increase 25% to $0.025. Early investors securing their tokens now can already make 200% when the launch comes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will‚ÄÇhit the market at $0.06. After the initial jump, analysts predict $3.00 within months of exchanges (14,900%‚ÄÇabove current prices). Mutuum Finance‚Äôs tokenomics include a buy-and-distribute model with platform‚ÄÇrevenue redirected to buy back Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from open markets. These tokens go back to stakers, driving repeated buying pressure while‚ÄÇpreventing sell-offs. At the same time, the protocol‚Äôs lending infrastructure ‚Äî with overcollateralized loans and mtTokens that accrue interest‚ÄÇ‚Äî ensures utility. A Certik audit of its smart contracts is being finalized by developers ‚Äî an‚ÄÇachievement likely to lend credibility to the project once officially announced. The Window‚ÄÇfor Strategic Choice Reshapes Unlike whale pump and dump actions that mask any path to success, Mutuum Finance represents a‚ÄÇquantifiable opportunity. Its presale system offers early investors a 200% launch return and targets on post-listing price action dwarf‚ÄÇADA‚Äôs vague estimates. With Phase‚ÄÇ3 almost full, the time left to acquire token at $0.02 is narrowing down. Adventurous‚ÄÇinvestors have begun to lend an ear and stop shuffling deck chairs; through a systemic approach to demand generation and real-world DeFi utility, this prototype asset has proved itself to be valuable in its own right, and with it, those who prioritize measurable gains can find respite in the lovely new world of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This will soon be topped by the completion of its Certik audit, which can act as a catalyst for adoption, as confirmed via Mutuum Finance‚ÄÇsocial channel. For individuals looking for asymmetric results within a volatile crypto marketplace,‚ÄÇthe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is a deliberate point of entry‚Äî a convergence of tokenomics and timing. Fewer tokens are‚ÄÇavailable now and you can secure before Phase 3 is over making the tokens more expensive.

Unlike volatile price swings seen in other assets, TON‚Äôs consistent rise signals strong underlying demand and market stability. The cryptocurrency has successfully held key support levels, preventing major pullbacks and allowing buyers to take control of the trend. With momentum building, market participants are closely monitoring resistance levels that could determine the next phase of TON‚Äôs price action. Should buying pressure continue to increase, the cryptocurrency could be poised for further gains, potentially testing higher resistance zones. Can Toncoin Sustain Its Renewed Upswing? Toncoin recent price resurgence has strengthened bullish sentiment, but the sustainability of this uptrend remains a critical focus. The cryptocurrency has managed to establish solid footing above the $2.36 key support level. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on several technical and market factors. Related Reading: TON Price Jumps 20% Following Positive News On Telegram Founder The cryptocurrency is currently maintaining its upward momentum as it approaches the $4.34 resistance level and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This steady climb indicates growing bullish strength, with buyers continuing to push the price higher despite potential resistance. A decisive breakout above the $4.34 resistance level could strengthen the ongoing uptrend, setting the stage for Toncoin toward the $6.13 resistance mark. If buying momentum remains strong and the price clears this key level, it could open the door for a potential test of its all-time high of $7.29. Technical indicators such as the MACD suggest that momentum remains in favor of the bulls, but increasing resistance pressure might lead to volatility. Sustained buying pressure will confirm the uptrend and push the price beyond these critical technical barriers. Volume analysis further reinforces Toncoin‚Äôs upward momentum, with trading volume increasing by over 10%, indicating strong market participation. Should volume continue to rise alongside price movement, it could validate the strength of the uptrend and enhance the likelihood of further gains. Potential Downside Risk If Toncoin faces rejection at a key resistance level, monitoring critical support zones will be essential to assess the strength of its uptrend. The first major support level to watch is around $2.36, where buyers previously showed interest. A dip to this level is likely to attract fresh demand and stabilize the price. Related Reading: Toncoin Gears Up For A Fresh Rally With Bullish Momentum Building A breakdown below this level could indicate a shift in momentum, accelerating selling pressure and leading to a deeper decline. If buyers fail to defend critical support zones, the price may struggle to recover, increasing the risk of establishing new lows.

After a descending triangle trend from mid 2021 through early 2025, the ETH/BTC pair has now reached a level where it showed a buying range in late 2020. Such a technical development combined with increased open interest in the futures is fueling the debate on trend reversal. Ethereum Price Eyes Recovery: Key Support Level Could Spark Reversal According to a recent post on X , analyst AndrewCryptoHQ noted that ETH/BTC is now trading at a crucial technical level. This level previously acted as a launchpad for gains during Q4 2020. Since its peak in mid-2021, the pair has remained in a downtrend, posting consistent lower highs and lower lows. As of late March 2025, ETH/BTC is resting near a multi-year support zone. Market participants are watching closely to see whether this zone can hold and initiate an altcoin rebound. If supported, it could mark a key turning point in Ethereum price performance compared to Bitcoin. Source: X However, downside risks remain. A decline in Bitcoin could put pressure on Ethereum price action. ETH has shown sensitivity to Bitcoin‚Äôs market direction in previous cycles. Without a confirmed breakout or higher low formation, traders remain cautious about calling a full reversal. ETH Futures Open Interest Hits Record as Caution Lingers On March 21, Ether futures open interest reached a record high of 10.23 million ETH, according to data from CoinGlass . This figure represents a 15% increase over two weeks, signaling growing participation in derivative markets. Despite the rise in open interest, the futures premium dropped below 4%, down from 5% two weeks prior. This lower premium suggests subdued bullish sentiment, as traders are not aggressively pursuing leveraged long positions. Binance, Gate.io, and Bitget accounted for over half of the futures market, while CME captured 9%. The increased leverage does not automatically indicate upward price movement. Open interest simply reflects matched positions between buyers and sellers. The absence of a strong premium points to a neutral stance from investors regarding the altcoin price trajectory. Ethereum Network Fees Fall as On-Chain Activity Slows However, Ethereum network fees fell by 50% over the past seven days, according to IntoTheBlock . The reduction signals a decline in user activity and overall demand on the Ethereum mainnet. Total revenue for Ethereum‚Äôs base layer dropped to $605,000 as of March 17, compared to $2.5 million just two weeks earlier. Lower fees are partly due to the growing use of Layer 2 solutions, which move transactions off the mainnet to improve scalability. However, the shift has also reduced transaction volume on the core network. Users and protocols are increasingly exploring alternative chains such as Solana and Avalanche. This slowdown in network usage presents challenges for Ethereum price support. The downturn in activity may contribute to hesitancy around the altcoin‚Äôs near-term outlook. However, Ethereum whales have started to accumulate again as one of them bought nearly $270 million worth of ETH. This goes hand in hand with the increase in the daily active addresses by 26%, which may signal a reversal of the Ethereum price chart.

Disinterest among short-term traders puts ETH price as risk of another pull back towards $1,850. Ethereum (ETH) fails to hold $2,000 support despite Trump‚Äôs speech Ethereum (ETH) price showed promising price action earlier this week, but latest price action suggests the optimism may have already petered out in less than 24 hours. Ethereum price rallied 10% at the start of the week, rising from $1760, to hit $2,065 riding on positive tailwinds for successful deployment of its Hoodi update. Ethereum (ETH) price action , March 22, 2025 | CoinMarketCap Trump‚Äôs appearance at Blockwork‚Äôs Digital Asset Summit, boosted market momentum on Thursday, driving ETH price above the $2,067 mark on Friday, according CoinmarketCap data. Recent market trends show the majority of ETH bull traders failed to hold the gains for up-to 24 hours. Following Trump‚Äôs speech, Ethereum opened trading on Friday above the $2,000 for the first time in nearly two-weeks dating back to March 9. However, ETH bulls failed to build on the rebound, as ETH price rapidly plunged below the $2,000 mark and closed for the day around $1,965. However, as seen in the chart above, the persistent decline in ETH trading volumes suggests bears could struggle to drive major downward moves in the coming trading session. Ethereum Derivatives Markets Analysis: Open Interest Dips Below $20 Billion but Multiple Upside Signals Remain Ethereum‚Äôs derivatives market reflects mixed sentiment, with open interest holding at $19.94B, barely above the $20B threshold, despite a 26.7% drop in trading volume to $22.80B. Options open interest has also fallen 5.45% to $5.88B, indicating instutional speculators are also scaling down their exposure to Ethereum. Ethereum Derivatives Markets Analysis Beyond that, Conversely, Liquidation data also provides key insights into recent negative tilt in mark sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, total rekt positions reached $24.63M, with $17.18M in long liquidations and $7.45M in short liquidations, suggesting that bullish traders were over-leveraged before recent price correction. Additionally, $3.47M was wiped in the past 4 hours, further reflecting the market‚Äôs vulnerability to sudden price swings. Ethereum price outlook today: Failure to Hold $1,850 Exposes ETH to More Downside Risks ETH price is trading just above the $1,900 mark at press time. However, Ethereum price forecast signals on derivatives trends suggest caution is warranted if ETH stagnates near $2,000. The Coinglass derivatives chart shows ETH/USDT long/short ratios on Binance (3.42) and OKX (3.44) show bullish positioning from traders, with Binance‚Äôs top traders maintaining a 4.16 long/short ratio on accounts. This suggest that traders may be entering fresh bullish positions after the recent profit-taking phase that ensued after Trump‚Äôs speech on Thursday. A prolonged lack of directional momentum could deter speculative traders, and prompt existing holders to close ETH positions in search of more volatile assets. In this scenario, further declines in market participation could drive open interest below $20B, weakening key support levels around $1,850, and exposing ETH to potential downside risks.

Early investors are looking at a staggering 10,027.85% ROI, making it one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week before it surges to the anticipated listing price of $0.008. But the adventure doesn‚Äôt end there. Arctic Pablo Coin offers a generous 66% APY staking program, allowing investors to stake their $APC tokens and watch their holdings grow. With all staked coins vested for two months post-launch, this mechanism fosters a committed and engaged community‚Äîyet another reason why Arctic Pablo is among the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week. To enhance scarcity and value, Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary model by burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale. This strategy ensures a decreasing supply, potentially increasing the coin‚Äôs value over time. The token burns are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reinforcing trust within the community. In essence, Arctic Pablo Coin is more than just a meme token‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in This Week, blending a captivating narrative with innovative tokenomics.

A recent 857% spike in token burns indicates SHIB‚Äôs deflationary mechanics are in full swing, fueling speculation of a potential breakout. ‚Äã The community-driven approach, coupled with these developments, positions Shiba Inu as more than just a meme coin; it‚Äôs evolving into a multifaceted digital asset with real-world applications.‚Äã Dog (Bitcoin): Bridging Meme Culture with Bitcoin‚Äôs Robustness Dog (Bitcoin) ($DOG) is a decentralized meme coin built on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Runes Protocol. With a market cap of $193 million and a circulating supply of 100 billion DOG tokens, it has gained traction across centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and Bitcoin Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks. Despite a recent dip of 2.02%, DOG has seen a 24-hour trading volume surge to $7.09 million, reflecting strong market activity. Since its launch on April 24, 2024, through a volunteer-led airdrop, DOG has aimed to onboard millions to Bitcoin. While it hit an all-time high of $0.009947 in December 2024, it currently trades at $0.00193‚Äîdown 80.65% but up 28.08% from its all-time low on March 11, 2025. With growing community support and exchange listings, DOG continues to be a notable player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. ‚Äã The community-centric approach, combined with the robust foundation of the Bitcoin blockchain, makes Dog (Bitcoin) a compelling option for investors looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio.‚Äã Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, these three meme coins‚ÄîArctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Dog (Bitcoin)‚Äîeach bring something unique to the table.

42125340,https://coingape.com/?p=245367,1742606988,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Solana Price Eyes Rally To $200 As Network Adoption Hits New ATH,https://coingape.com/solana-price-eyes-rally-to-200-as-network-adoption-hits-new-ath/,"Solana (SOL) is gaining attention in the crypto market after hitting a new all-time high (ATH) in network adoption. The number of addresses holding SOL has surpassed 11 million, signaling increasing interest in the network. This surge in adoption comes amid recent developments, including the launch of Solana futures ETFs and rising institutional interest. With these factors, analysts are now eyeing a potential rally for Solana‚Äôs price, possibly pushing it towards the $200 mark. New Adoption Milestone for Solana On-chain analytics reveal that more than 11.09 million addresses currently hold the SOL token on the Solana network. This is the new ATH in terms of network adoption of Solana which is a signal in the context of its long-term development. The increase in address activity indicates that more users are participating in the Solana ecosystem, which is further expanding progressively as a decentralized network. From the statistics, this uptick is expected to compliment the Solana price in the coming months especially after the development of Network. Solana‚Äôs increase in the adoption rate can be attributed to the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The introduction of Solana futures ETFs, followed by the possibility of the spot Solana ETF, has attracted corporate investors/traders. Analysts see these as optimisms within the market that could lead to another push up in the price of Solana. The breakout from the current range and continued institutional participation could lead to new highs for Solana price. Solana Futures ETFs Spark New Interest In March 2025, Solana still saw one of the most important events in its existence by launching own futures ETFs. These include the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the leveraged Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT). These are funds that give investors direct access to Solana futures contracts and are present on Nasdaq. The listing of Solana‚Äôs futures ETFs is a sign that Solana is gradually gaining more recognition in mainstream finance, meaning that more investors can invest in Solana token. While the launch has brought Solana into the spotlight, some market analysts have noted mixed reactions. Despite this, the debut of these financial products has led to an increase in Solana‚Äôs price, with the token briefly rising above $136. Analysts believe that these products could provide long-term support for Solana‚Äôs price as they bring more liquidity and market visibility to the SOL price hitting $200 again. Institutional Support and Increased Market Confidence There is growing support by institutions such as Fidelity Investments with the latest accruing to Solana network. This new Fidelity Solana Fund was recently filed with the registry of Delaware shows that Solana might stand on the entity of mainstream finance. Given that Fidelity has a network of $4.9 trillion in assets, its entrance to the Solana ecosystem could be a major boost to the project. With a growing number of institutions seeking to invest in Solana to diversify their portfolio the future appears promising for the network. These institutional backs are encouraging by the increasing growing rate in the cryptocurrency market and for Solana in particular. Polymarket further reveals that the probability of Solana attaining an ETF has risen to 88% this year. With more institutions investing in Solana, it is perhaps only a matter of time before regulators change their stance and approve SOL spot ETFs boosting Solana price rally towards $200.

Open interest , which tracks the total number of outstanding derivative contracts at any time, declined from $57 billion when BTC hit its ATH to $24.5 billion today. This means‚ÄÇthat market movers are closing out uncertainty or unwinding leverage. The digital asset is now attempting to regain momentum after recent selling pressure. Despite hitting an ATH of over $109,000 in January, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $90,000 level. Bitcoin struggles to regain important price levels Bitcoin has been attempting to break above the $90,000 resistance level for the last two weeks. This follows its failure to remain upward after hitting‚ÄÇits all-time high. This put downward pressure on BTC, igniting speculation on whether the most recent bull run was complete‚ÄÇor if a second rally could see it soar higher than ever. According to on-chain data provider Glassnode, this fall in open interest comes amid an overall trend of falling‚ÄÇon-chain liquidity. The unwinding of long-side bias from cash-and-carry trade, where traders make money on the difference between spot and futures prices, has also contributed to downward pressure. Adding to the strain, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also under pressure and recorded outflows, while some CME futures contracts are terminating, which further pressures the price of Bitcoin. Another notable shift is the decline in BTC‚Äôs ‚ÄúHot Supply‚Äù‚Äîcoins held for one week or less. In the last‚ÄÇthree months, the hot supply dropped from 5.9% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply to a mere 2.8%, a decline of more than 50%. This suggests fewer newly acquired Bitcoins are being actively traded, reducing market liquidity. Bitcoin exchange inflows have also dramatically declined, going from 58,600 BTC / day‚ÄÇto 26,900 BTC / day ‚Äî a 54% decrease. While that‚ÄÇmay signal less selling pressure, it also means that demand is weaker, as fewer coins are being sent to exchanges to be traded. Bitcoin prepares to test crucial support levels BTC is currently trading at $84,001, holding above the important support at $85,000. Industry analyst ‚ÄúUnknown‚ÄÇTrader‚Äù stressed that the Bitcoin uptrend is only intact above this level, and BTC only closed recently. Additionally, the asset remains above the 200-day moving average, a historically bullish indicator for long-term price momentum. BTC is back up to the retest of around‚ÄÇ$85,000 again. If it soars, analysts anticipate a move to the resistance‚ÄÇzone of $90,500‚Äì$92,441. Yet, this solid rejection level can keep fine-tuning a swoop back up until another retest at $85,000. CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu, for his part, reported potential‚ÄÇinstitutional accumulation. He pointed out how the 30-day EMA of the Coinbase Premium Index is struggling to cross above‚ÄÇthe one-hundred-day EMA. This crossover‚ÄÇhappened before BTC‚Äôs price rallies typically; therefore, institutional players could be accumulating Bitcoin. As institutional demand continues to pour in, BTC‚Äôs price could still‚ÄÇrise, prolonging this bull market instead of signalling its top. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

More on Dogecoin Market Cap & ADA Price Forecast,https://thecoinrise.com/will-blockdag-reach-1-after-2380-growth-more-on-dogecoin-market-cap-ada-price-forecast/,"The latest market activity has reignited discussions about Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap, with some analysts suggesting DOGE could rise to $2.3 if it ever equaled Elon Musk‚Äôs net worth. Meanwhile, Cardano price prediction remains under scrutiny as ADA struggles to break the $0.80 resistance level, which continues to challenge traders. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is not waiting for the market to dictate its path‚Äîit‚Äôs creating its own momentum. Its presale has already amassed $205 million, and BDAG‚Äôs price has soared 2,380% since batch 1. Forecasts indicate BDAG could reach $1 in 2025 and climb to $30 by 2030, making it a strong contender for the next crypto to explode. Dogecoin Market Cap Needs a 1,083% Jump for $2.3‚ÄîIs It Feasible? Dogecoin‚Äôs price speculation continues, with many questioning whether it can hit $2.3 per coin. Achieving this milestone would require the Dogecoin market cap to jump 1,083% to match Elon Musk‚Äôs estimated $342.4 billion net worth. DOGE is currently trading at $0.1951, struggling to regain traction after falling from its 2021 peak of $0.7376. Unlike other assets with structured development roadmaps, Dogecoin heavily depends on community enthusiasm and external endorsements. Even if another price surge happens, its long-term sustainability remains uncertain. Cardano Price Prediction: Can ADA Surpass the $0.80 Mark? Cardano continues to test the $0.80 resistance level, a price it has struggled to overcome multiple times. If ADA successfully breaks through, it could target $0.95 or even $1.15. However, its future trajectory remains unclear as maintaining an upward trend has proven difficult. Trading at $0.72, ADA has yet to reclaim its former highs after reaching $1.15. Weak buying momentum, coupled with an RSI reading of 42.54, indicates hesitancy among market participants. If ADA fails to stay above $0.70, a dip toward $0.63 or lower could be possible. BlockDAG‚Äôs Rapid Rise‚Äî Early Holders Gained 2,380% Returns! Securing a high-growth cryptocurrency at a low price is an opportunity few want to miss. With an overwhelming number of options available, identifying the right project can be difficult. However, BlockDAG has emerged as a standout in 2025. Raising over $205 million and selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG is gaining recognition as a leading cryptocurrency. Its presale has seen rapid expansion, with BDAG‚Äôs value skyrocketing 2,380% from its initial $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27, showing growing demand. What‚Äôs driving this momentum? Accessibility. BlockDAG is designed for broad adoption, enabling seamless participation in its ecosystem. Over 500,000 individuals are already mining BDAG effortlessly through the X1 Miner App . Additionally, developers benefit from BlockDAG‚Äôs WASM compatibility, allowing for smooth smart contract deployment using widely used programming languages. The growing engagement from miners and developers is not only increasing adoption but also strengthening BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem. Projects with real expansion potential tend to attract sustained interest, and BlockDAG is consistently demonstrating its capacity for long-term growth. With a mainnet launch and 10 major CEX listings approaching, BDAG‚Äôs price trajectory remains strong. Predictions suggest $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and a projected $30 by 2030. For those considering entering this growing project, the timing might be right. BDAG coins are currently priced at $0.0248, but demand is pushing batch sales to sell out quickly. As each batch closes, prices are expected to climb even further. Which Cryptocurrency Will Be the Next to Explode? As speculation intensifies over Dogecoin‚Äôs market cap potentially reaching new heights and Cardano price prediction hovering near critical resistance, market participants are evaluating their choices. While DOGE‚Äôs path to $2.3 remains unclear and ADA continues to struggle at $0.80, BlockDAG is making notable progress through its expanding ecosystem and strong presale performance.

If successful, $500 million will be allocated to early-stage crypto investments, while the remaining $500 million will go toward late-stage crypto investments, people familiar with the matter told Fortune Crypto on March 21. Different market conditions to 2022 led to lowered expectations The VC firm, founded by former Coinbase board member and federal prosecutor Katie Haun in 2022, reportedly did not aim for the $1.5 billion it raised in its highly praised funding round in 2022. It cited different market conditions as the reason for the lower target. However, Haun reportedly expects the two new funds will be ‚Äúoversubscribed.‚Äù In March 2022, Haun secured $1.5 billion in the company‚Äôs first funding round, shortly after its launch. Haun had also recruited former executives from Airbnb, Coinbase and Google tech incubator Jigsaw . The firm‚Äôs latest fundraising round is set to close in June and is expected to be one of the largest in crypto funding in the past two years. Venture capital firm Paradigm and digital asset investment manager Pantera Capital both sought similar amounts in 2024. 137 crypto companies raised a combined $1.11 billion in funding in February 2025.¬†Source: The TIE In June 2024, Paradigm closed an $850 million investment fund , while in April, digital asset investment manager Pantera Capital sought to raise over $1 billion for a new blockchain-focused fund. VCs predict that stablecoins will continue to be a focus in 2025 More recently, Haun Ventures participated in crypto asset management firm Bitwise‚Äôs $70 million funding round alongside investors such as Electric Capital, MassMutual, MIT Investment Management Company, and Highland Capital. While the specific focus of Haun's upcoming crypto funds is not publicly known yet, other venture capitalists have recently predicted that stablecoin interest will continue into 2025. Related: Venture capital firms invest $400M in TON blockchain Deng Chao, CEO of institutional asset manager HashKey Capital , recently told Cointelegraph that stablecoins were the strongest proven use case for crypto in 2024. Meanwhile, market analyst Infinity Hedge predicted that crypto VC investment in 2025 would surpass last year‚Äôs levels but wouldn‚Äôt approach the peak recorded during the 2021 bull market. VC crypto funding in 2021 reached $33.8 billion, while in 2024 it reached $13.6 billion . Cointelegraph reached out to Haun Ventures but did not receive a response by time of publication.

With new developments rolling out daily, staying ahead means knowing where the action is. This week, Sonic and Solana are making serious waves, each shaking up the market in its own way. Sonic‚Äôs recent momentum suggests it could be gearing up for a significant rally, while Solana‚Äôs latest integration with Tron is opening up fresh opportunities in DeFi and NFTs. Both are making headlines, but are they the best opportunities right now? Qubetics ($TICS), a game-changing Web3 aggregator, is taking center stage among the top cryptos to join this week by solving one of crypto‚Äôs biggest headaches‚Äîinteroperability. Unlike the rest, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain; it‚Äôs a bridge uniting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more into one cohesive ecosystem. Plus, its Qubetics presale is turning heads with mind-blowing ROI projections. Could this be the one move that makes all the difference for early adopters? Let‚Äôs break it all down. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Changing the Game Blockchain has a serious communication problem. Most networks operate in silos, making it frustratingly difficult for assets, data, and applications to move across different chains. This is where Qubetics comes in. As the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, it creates a seamless bridge between major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. That means businesses, developers, and everyday users can finally interact across networks without jumping through hoops. Picture this: A business wants to accept payments from different blockchains, but compatibility issues slow everything down. With Qubetics, transactions happen instantly, no matter which network the customer is using. The same applies to NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, and data-sharing services. No more being locked into a single ecosystem‚ÄîQubetics makes everything flow effortlessly. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not just another blockchain project; it‚Äôs a long-overdue solution to one of crypto‚Äôs biggest bottlenecks. top cryptos to join this week don‚Äôt just promise big gains‚Äîthey solve real problems, and Qubetics is leading the charge. Crypto Presales Are Where Fortunes Are Made‚ÄîQubetics Presale Leads the Top Cryptos to Join This Week Crypto presales are where fortunes are made, and Qubetics presale is shaping up to be one of the most rewarding yet. With each stage lasting only seven days before the price jumps 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, early buyers are locking in before the next increase. Right now, Qubetics is in Stage 26, with a price of $0.1181 per $TICS token. Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: Over $15.3 million already raised. More than 502 million $TICS tokens sold. Over 23,500 holders and counting. Mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025. Now, let‚Äôs talk numbers. If $TICS hits just $1, that‚Äôs a 746.04% ROI from today‚Äôs price. But analysts are eyeing much bigger milestones: $5 per $TICS = 4,130.23% ROI $6 per $TICS = 4,976.27% ROI $10 per $TICS = 8,360.26% ROI $15 per $TICS = 12,590.69% ROI For perspective, a $100 investment today could turn into $8,360 if $TICS reaches $10 after the mainnet launch. That‚Äôs the kind of upside that has the crypto community buzzing. With best crypto presale opportunities dwindling fast, this one is on a serious watchlist. Sonic‚Äôs $S Rally: Could It Hit $0.70? Sonic has been one of the most talked-about projects this week, and for good reason. According to recent reports, $S is showing strong upward momentum and could be primed for a surge towards $0.70. Analysts are closely watching key resistance levels, and if it breaks through the current price barriers, a substantial rally could be on the way. Adding to the hype, on-chain metrics suggest increasing whale accumulation, signaling confidence among major players. The trading volume has seen a sharp uptick, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. However, while Sonic is riding this wave, the big question remains‚Äîwill this momentum hold, or is this just another short-term spike? With speculation running high, Sonic is undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to join this week if the rally continues. But as always, the volatility of the crypto market means timing is everything. Solana‚Äôs Latest Move: Tron Integration Expands DeFi and NFTs Solana has been making major headlines with its new integration with Tron, announced by Justin Sun. This move aims to increase access to TRX across Solana‚Äôs ecosystem, unlocking new possibilities for DeFi and NFT applications. By bridging the two ecosystems, users can now seamlessly interact with Tron-based assets on Solana, boosting liquidity and cross-chain functionality. This isn‚Äôt just a technical update‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic move that could further cement Solana‚Äôs dominance in the DeFi space. Over the past year, Solana has consistently ranked among the most widely adopted blockchains, and this integration only strengthens its position. If this development attracts more developers and protocols to build within its ecosystem, Solana could see another wave of growth. For those looking to capitalize on major network expansions, Solana‚Äôs latest move puts it high on the list of top cryptos to join this week. With DeFi and NFTs continuing to thrive, this update could be a game-changer for the ecosystem. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Stands Out the Most? Sonic and Solana are both making impressive strides‚Äîone riding an anticipated price rally, the other expanding its ecosystem with a major integration. Both are strong contenders in their own right, but neither offers the kind of early-stage opportunity seen in Qubetics presale. With its Web3 aggregation model and mind-blowing ROI projections, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just competing‚Äîit‚Äôs redefining what blockchain networks can do, making it one of the top cryptos to join this week. For those looking at crypto presale opportunities, few match the potential of Qubetics right now. As the best crypto presale, it offers both a practical solution to blockchain‚Äôs interoperability problem and a presale model designed for exponential growth. While Sonic and Solana remain top-tier projects, Qubetics is the one early buyers are watching closely. The countdown to the next price hike is on‚Äîjoin this crypto presale before the next jump.

This move expands TRX‚Äôs access to DeFi and NFT applications on Solana, increasing cross-chain functionality and boosting liquidity. What is Sonic‚Äôs price prediction? Analysts predict $S could rally to $0.70 if it breaks key resistance levels, with increased whale accumulation signaling bullish momentum.

From ecosystems expanding into AI and real-world assets to Layer 1 chains redefining cross-chain communication, 2025 has already begun to separate the trendsetters from the crowd. The market‚Äôs buzz is louder than ever, and if you‚Äôre wondering which names are breaking the mold, you‚Äôre in the right place. Among all the noise, Qubetics is emerging as a serious contender‚Äîand arguably the one making the most headlines right now. With a laser focus on interoperability and a visionary decentralized toolkit, it‚Äôs staking its claim among the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025. If you‚Äôre scouting the space for strong plays, get ready. These are the crypto powerhouses that deserve your full attention right now. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Interoperable Superchain of Web3 When it comes to the most popular cryptocurrencies redefining the Web3 landscape, Qubetics tops the list‚Äîno questions asked. It‚Äôs not just another Layer 1; it‚Äôs the first Web3 aggregator blockchain designed to unify ecosystems across Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and beyond. Qubetics‚Äô decentralized architecture is all about one thing‚Äîfreedom. And that freedom shines most in its interoperability framework. With the QubeQode IDE at its core, developers now have a no-brainer solution to build cross-chain apps without the usual chaos. Think of QubeQode as a one-stop powerhouse where builders can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts, test AI integrations, and make multichain functionality the default. It‚Äôs not just innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs Web3 without borders. For everyday users and businesses, Qubetics is solving real pain points. Imagine a fintech startup in Canada being able to settle payments, run DeFi protocols, and push NFTs across three different chains‚Äîall from one dashboard. That‚Äôs what Qubetics is doing. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet plugs directly into this system, letting users interact with multiple networks securely and simultaneously. No more chain-switching. No more confusion. It‚Äôs seamless crypto like it always should‚Äôve been. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dominating every ‚Äúmost popular cryptocurrencies‚Äù list in 2025‚Äîand it‚Äôs just getting warmed up. Currently in Stage 26 of its crypto presale with a token price of $0.1181, Qubetics is on fire. With over 502 million $TICS sold, 23,500+ token holders, and $15.3M already raised, the hype isn‚Äôt slowing down. And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîanalysts are buzzing over its ROI potential. At $1, early buyers stand to gain 746.05%. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet launch? That‚Äôs a 8,360.47% return. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, it‚Äôs clear why this is the best time to grab hold. Among the most popular cryptocurrencies, Qubetics is leading the charge‚Äîand making the case for why it‚Äôs the Best Crypto to Watch Now. 2. SUI: Speed-Obsessed and Developer-Friendly SUI continues to make headlines in 2025 as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 chains on the market. Built by Mysten Labs, the SUI blockchain leverages the Move programming language, known for its parallel transaction processing. This setup gives it ultra-low latency and insane throughput. In fact, SUI has routinely achieved over 300,000 transactions per second in controlled environments, making it a darling among developers building dApps for gaming and real-time financial services. SUI isn‚Äôt just fast‚Äîit‚Äôs intuitive for devs. It offers programmable object ownership and easy composability, setting it apart from Ethereum‚Äôs account-based system. More than just a tech upgrade, SUI is enabling Web3 use cases that feel Web2-smooth. In 2025, as dApps prioritize UX as much as decentralization, SUI‚Äôs tech stack is hitting all the right notes. On the adoption front, SUI has also inked partnerships with gaming studios, DeFi projects, and infrastructure providers, positioning itself for long-term relevance. While it‚Äôs not new to the scene, its consistent evolution and performance upgrades have made sure it remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market right now. 3. Cardano: Slow and Steady Is Starting to Win Cardano is one of those projects that people love to underestimate‚Äîuntil it surprises everyone. In 2025, the ADA ecosystem has matured into a bustling platform, housing a robust DeFi sector, growing NFT presence, and smart contract capabilities that are finally seeing wide adoption. Cardano‚Äôs emphasis on academic research and peer-reviewed development has often made it a slow mover‚Äîbut that slow burn is paying off. This year, we‚Äôve seen a major uptick in Cardano‚Äôs on-chain activity, with a 27% increase in active wallets and a 42% boost in DeFi TVL since the start of Q1. Projects like Indigo Protocol and Minswap are thriving, while the Hydra scaling solution is helping the chain push transaction costs lower than most competitors. That‚Äôs helping ADA re-enter top crypto lists‚Äîand rightly so. For participants looking to avoid overhyped meme tokens and bet on long-term value, Cardano offers that patient power play. It‚Äôs not making explosive moves, but it‚Äôs making the right ones. With global partnerships in education, governance, and finance, Cardano continues to prove it belongs on any list of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025. 4. XRP: A Comeback Fueled by Regulation Relief XRP is back‚Äîand it‚Äôs back with a vengeance. After years of legal limbo with the SEC, Ripple Labs recently scored a huge win with the dismissal of key charges. That cleared the fog hanging over XRP and triggered a rally that pushed the token back above the $0.75 mark. Community sentiment is strong again, and global remittance firms are returning to test RippleNet for cross-border payments. Beyond the court wins, Ripple is focused on growing its footprint in CBDC development. Several central banks are currently piloting digital currencies using Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure, further solidifying XRP‚Äôs place in the Web3 finance ecosystem. That makes it more than just a speculative token‚Äîit‚Äôs a serious utility play. As XRP climbs back into the top ten by market cap, it‚Äôs reclaiming its title as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies of this cycle. With regulatory clarity, expanding use cases, and renewed momentum, XRP‚Äôs comeback story might just be one of 2025‚Äôs best narratives. 5. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Finds Its Moment Cosmos is finally getting the recognition it deserves. In 2025, its vision of interoperable blockchains is no longer just theory‚Äîit‚Äôs reality. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is now widely adopted, and dozens of sovereign blockchains are operating within the Cosmos Hub. As DeFi and NFT apps go multichain, Cosmos is the quiet backbone making everything connect. This isn‚Äôt just about tech‚Äîit‚Äôs about experience. For users and devs, Cosmos provides seamless cross-chain transactions without relying on wrapped tokens or sketchy bridges. That‚Äôs a massive deal in a post-bridge-hack world, and it‚Äôs why developers are flocking to the ecosystem. With ATOM now serving as both a governance token and staking asset across several zones, its utility is stronger than ever. As more chains plug into Cosmos, its influence will only grow. For anyone tracking the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2025, Cosmos is one name that deserves serious attention. 6. Polkadot: Cross-Chain Connectivity Done Right Polkadot was built for a future where blockchains talk to each other‚Äîand that future is now. Its relay chain and parachain structure are proving to be incredibly efficient for hosting niche projects with specific needs. In 2025, we‚Äôre seeing an influx of real-world applications launching on Polkadot, from identity verification platforms to supply chain tracking dApps. What‚Äôs most exciting is how flexible the parachain model has become. It allows developers to experiment with different consensus algorithms and fee structures while still enjoying the shared security of the Polkadot network. This makes DOT a serious contender in the cross-chain infrastructure space. Though DOT hasn‚Äôt had the wild pumps of meme coins, its consistency, developer activity, and scalability potential make it a cornerstone of Web3 infrastructure. That‚Äôs why Polkadot remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies being watched by serious players this year. Conclusion: The Decentralized Wallet That Could Define Your Crypto Future If you‚Äôre tracking the most popular cryptocurrencies with long-term upside, it‚Äôs impossible to overlook the consistent dominance of Qubetics. Its ability to unify chains, streamline decentralized development, and provide unmatched user experience through its non-custodial multi-chain wallet makes it more than just another altcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs a next-gen infrastructure layer. And the fact that it‚Äôs still in presale makes it the best crypto to watch now. Backed by a powerful suite of interoperable tools, Qubetics is rapidly becoming the go-to ecosystem for developers and users alike. Its real-time wallet integration across multiple networks eliminates the friction that‚Äôs plagued DeFi, making it ideal for both retail and enterprise adoption. With over $15.2M already raised and more than 501M $TICS sold, the market‚Äôs confidence is already showing. At $0.1181 per $TICS, the numbers speak for themselves. A $1 price tag brings 746.05% ROI. At $10? Over 8,360.47%. With a mainnet launch coming in Q2 2025, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better. If you‚Äôve been scanning for the most popular cryptocurrencies that still offer ground-floor access, this is your cue to dive in. And if you‚Äôre serious about gains? It‚Äôs time to join the Qubetics presale before this rocket leaves the launchpad. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other altcoins in 2025? Qubetics stands out due to its Web3 aggregator model, which lets it unify multiple leading blockchains under one ecosystem. Its focus on real-world usability‚Äîespecially with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet and QubeQode IDE‚Äîoffers developers and users unmatched flexibility and scalability. Is Qubetics still in presale? Yes, Qubetics is currently in Stage 26 of its presale with a token price of $0.1181. With over 502 million $TICS sold and $15.3 million raised, the project is gaining massive momentum. Each presale stage lasts 7 days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at 12 AM. Why is Qubetics considered one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2025? Qubetics is earning that title by solving some of Web3‚Äôs most persistent problems‚Äîfragmented chains, clunky UX, and limited scalability. Its real-time interoperability, wallet simplicity, and presale value have made it a standout among altcoins gaining serious traction in 2025.

He describes the cryptocurrency‚Äôs current price action as a ‚Äú Bermuda Triangle or boredom phase‚Äù ‚Äî a period where the market moves slowly or sideways, fuelling doubt and uncertainty among traders and investors before a price rally. XRP Price Boredom Phase To Trigger $27 Surge Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned that the XRP price is in a Bermuda Triangle, a boredom phase characterized by price stagnation and market uncertainty designed to shake out weak hands before a significant price move. According to his prediction, while traders and investors are growing impatient and questioning why XRP has not experienced any notable price increases, this phase is merely a set-up for a strong rally toward $27. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reignites $100 XRP Price Target, What You Should Know Following a predicted downturn in mid-March, XRP has struggled to recover its bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency was one of the top-performing altcoins in this bull cycle, jumping from a $0.5 low to over $3 for the first time in seven years. Due to the current market decline, Egrag Crypto revealed that many traders are now wondering why ‚ÄúXRP hasn‚Äôt mooned.‚Äù The analyst explained that this price decline was intentional, forcing investors to second-guess themselves and make emotional trading decisions. He also disclosed that the XRP market is now filled with ‚ÄòWhat ifs‚Äô, as Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) cloud traders‚Äô minds. Moreover, concerns over potential dips to $1.60 or $1.30 could push investors to panic-sell or attempt risky trades. The analyst also revealed that the XRP market is currently controlled by sharks and larger players, also called Whales. These large holders tend to influence price movements, triggering stop-losses and shaking out weak hands before a major rally. Egrag Crypto warns that new investors and traders are especially vulnerable, as frustration and boredom can lead to making financial mistakes. He disclosed that the best strategy to implement during this current market phase is to do nothing. He suggested investors stay disciplined and patient, recognizing that boredom phases are normal in crypto market cycles. The analyst also urged investors to remain vigilant and hold their positions while accumulating at ideal prices rather than react impulsively to rapid changes in the market. XRP Breakout Point Hints At New ATH In other analyses, market expert ‚ÄòSteph Is Crypto‚Äô has announced that XRP is currently retesting breakout levels to trigger a surge to a fresh ATH. The analyst‚Äôs price chart shows a Falling Wedge pattern which has been broken above the resistance at the upper trend line. Related Reading: XRP Threatens Death Cross On 4-Hour Chart, Is Another Crash Coming? After breaking out, XRP now retests this level to confirm a larger upward move. The large green arrow on the chart points to the cryptocurrency‚Äôs projected price target, suggesting a bullish continuation if the Falling Wedge breakout holds. XRP‚Äôs upside potential is predicted to be $4 or higher if its bullish momentum is maintained. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $2.4, reflecting a 3.5% decline in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. If its price rises to $4, it would represent a significant 66.7% increase from current levels.

But now, bipartisan support for cryptocurrency is growing, boosting the chances of the stablecoin bill passing. As per a latest Bloomberg report, the Financial Services Committee will review the stablecoin bill on April 2. This development highlights the growing influence of the cryptocurrency industry in Washington, D.C., bolstered by bipartisan support from figures like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and significant campaign contributions that have strengthened industry allies. ‚Äã GENIUS Act Gets Bipartisan Support The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and enhance consumer protections, has garnered support from both Republicans and Democrats. A key House Committee is expected to vote in favor of the bill, signaling strong momentum for its approval. The act aims to regulate stablecoins and add more consumer protection policies. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the bill, which has quickly gained support from both Republicans and Democrats. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee voted to move the Genius Act forward, with five Democrats joining the Republican majority in backing it. If the House approves the bill, stablecoin issuers can choose between federal or state charters, depending on their market size. Foreign issuers will also need to follow U.S. rules on reserves, anti-money laundering, and sanctions compliance and liwuiduty. Jeremy Hogan, partner at the law firm Hogan & Hogan noted, ‚ÄúThe reserve requirements and anti-money laundering requirements all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.‚Äù Chairman French Hill, along with many analysts and crypto supporters, believes the stablecoin market needs regulation. He argues that regulating stablecoins would strengthen the dollar and improve payment systems. Crypto firms have also pushed for stablecoins as a way to boost financial inclusion and offer cheaper, faster transactions. Criticisms Prevail However, Top Democrat Maxine Waters and Senator Elizabeth Warren worry that the bill doesn‚Äôt do enough to protect consumers. Besides, they also wanted a ban on tech companies like Elon Musk‚Äôs X or Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, preventing them from issuing their own stablecoins.

Stablecoin Supply Is Displaying A Different Pattern In This Bitcoin Downturn In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has shared about how the latest trend in the stablecoin circulating supply has been looking. ‚ÄúStablecoins‚Äù are cryptocurrencies that track the price of a fiat currency, with USD being by far the most popular choice. These tokens run on multiple networks, but in the context of the current topic, only the Ethereum-based ones are of interest. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 7% After Surge In Network Activity & Whale Buying Stablecoins are, by nature, relatively ‚Äòstable‚Äô in value, so the investors generally buy into these coins whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Holders who invest into stables, though, usually plan to eventually go back into the volatile side of the sector. For if they didn‚Äôt, they would have exited into fiat instead. Once these traders feel the time is right, they use their stablecoins to swap into Bitcoin or whatever desired coin. This shift naturally applies a buying pressure to the price of the asset. Due to the potential of the stablecoins to act as dry powder for the volatile cryptocurrencies, these assets are often looked at as the ‚Äòavailable‚Äô buy supply of the sector. As such, an increase in its value may be considered as a bullish sign. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant, which shows the trend in the supply of the ERC-20 stablecoins over the last year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoin supply has been on the rise during the last few months, which suggests capital has been flowing into these fiat-tied tokens. This rise in the metric has come as Bitcoin has been going through a phase of bearish momentum. In the chart, the analyst has also highlighted the trend that the indicator followed during BTC‚Äôs bearish period from last year. It would seem that the stablecoin supply was moving sideways back then. This would imply that as BTC corrected in 2024, a net amount of capital flowed out of the sector as if the capital was rotating into the stablecoins instead, their supply would have registered an increase. This time around, however, a rotation of capital has indeed been occurring, with these stablecoin buyers potentially waiting on the sidelines for a profitable entry point. Of course, this current setup isn‚Äôt the most bullish one, either; that would have been the case if both the Bitcoin market cap and the stablecoin supply rose simultaneously. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Where Support & Resistance Lies For Solana, Based On On-Chain Data Nonetheless, the fact that the stablecoins haven‚Äôt been shrinking during this market downturn could still be taken as an optimistic sign for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen yet another failed recovery rally as its price has dropped back to $84,000, after having broken above $87,000 just earlier.

33767162,[object Object],1742616055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Popular Analyst PlanB Expects Bitcoin Price To Double In 2025 As Bear Market Is Not Here,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-to-double-in-2025/,"Recent Bitcoin price analyses from analysts have been mostly centred on the notion of whether the leading cryptocurrency has already reached its peak this cycle. Bearish sentiment is already creeping in among investors, and the outlook is now whether BTC and the entire crypto industry have transitioned into a bear market. Interestingly, crypto analyst PlanB, widely followed for his stock-to-flow model and long-standing BTC forecasts, has pushed back against growing speculation that the market is transitioning into a bearish phase. PlanB Dismisses Bear Market Calls, Says Bear Market Has Not Arrived Taking to social media platform X, crypto analyst PlanB laid out a compelling argument for why he believes Bitcoin is still in the middle of a sustainable uptrend, one that could see the price doubling once again by 2025. His interesting argument comes alongside other new outlooks from analysts, who are now noting key bullish signals for Bitcoin. PlanB‚Äôs latest analysis is based on Bitcoin‚Äôs 200-week arithmetic and geometric moving averages , which are two long-term trend indicators analysts use to distinguish between bull and bear market phases. According to him, these two averages have been close together for over a year. The close movement of these moving averages goes against a downward trend but rather a steady uptrend with reduced volatility. He explained that a real bear market usually comes after a true bull run, which is characterized by a sharp divergence between the two averages. Since that divergence has yet to happen in the current cycle, PlanB argues that the market has not experienced a real bull phase, let alone entered a bear phase. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin Price To Double In 2025 Expanding on this theme, PlanB pointed to Bitcoin‚Äôs performance over the past two years, noting a steady and predictable doubling of the price. Bitcoin rose from around $20,000 in 2022 to approximately $40,000 in 2023 and first moved to the $80,000 range in early 2024. If this pattern holds, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin could reach $160,000 by the end of 2025. PlanB acknowledged that this trajectory if it continues, could be the end to the traditional four-year cycle theory that has predicted Bitcoin‚Äôs market psychology since its launch. Nonetheless, such a change would be more fitting for a maturing asset class like BTC, which has pierced into the institutional market in the past year. If PlanB‚Äôs projection of a price-doubling trend holds, BTC could be on track for not just $160,000 in 2025. According to the analyst‚Äôs prediction, the rate of uptrend means that Bitcoin has the chance to trade at $320,000 in 2026 and $640,000 sometime in 2027. These long-term bullish targets are very optimistic, but the current focus is on short-term price movement where there‚Äôs so much work for bull traders to do. The first step is to break above the current price range between $80,000 and $90,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,000, having rejected again at $86,500.",Bitcoin News|Bear Phase|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|moving average|PlanB,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-22 04:00:55
