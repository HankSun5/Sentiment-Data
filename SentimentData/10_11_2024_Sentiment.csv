With the crypto market leader recording new all-time highs each day, analyst Ali Martinez has dropped a new price target that hinges on a certain condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Enters Danger Zone: Investors Now Extremely Greedy Bitcoin Must Stay Above $71,480 – Here’s Why Amidst the current Bitcoin price rally, Ali Martinez predicts the digital asset could reach a local price peak of $85,360. However, this price action can only occur if BTC’s value does not decline below $71,480 based on data from the MVRV Deviation Pricing Bands, a trading tool used to identify extreme bullish and bearish market conditions based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). Martinez’s latest insight on Bitcoin’s trajectory follows a previous prediction in which the analyst forecasted the premier cryptocurrency to retrace to around $71,500 after hitting the $78,000 price mark. With Bitcoin within range of this price target following its recent tourney across $77,000, it is imperative that the market bulls prevent any potential retracement below $71,480, which may result in a further decline to $66,000 at which lies its next major resistance. Alternatively, Bitcoin is also well poised to push beyond $78,000, reaching Martinez’s target of $85,360 without experiencing any projected price pullback as market sentiments remain highly bullish due to multiple factors. Aside from Donald Trump’s resounding electoral victory which signals an incoming crypto-friendly approach by the US Government, high inflows into the Bitcoin Spot ETFs over the past weeks have also boosted investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s continuous profitability. Nevertheless, all investors are admonished to remain vigilant as the crypto market is subject to high levels of volatility and sudden price movements.

Sounds ‘Bearish’: Expert Hints At Even Greater Heights Ahead BTC Social Narrative Backs Potential Retrace In other news, data from analytics firm Santiment shows that Bitcoin’s rise above $77,000 has induced a change in the social narrative as the general crypto community is anticipating a continuous rise to $80,000. According to Santiment, whenever crypto enthusiasts have been overly eager about $80,000 in the past month, Bitcoin has experienced a price retrace. Therefore, there is a need to reduce growing notions around FOMO in order to allow Bitcoin to maintain its current price rally. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $76,395 reflecting a gain of 0.49% in the past 24 hours.

Interestingly, the market has already been given a taste of the possible effects. Related Reading: SEC Shake-Up: Robinhood Legal Boss On Shortlist For Top Spot—Report In fact, the mere news of Trump’s win has pushed the Bitcoin price into uncharted territory. Since the announcement, Bitcoin has surged, reaching a recent peak of $77,239. According to a crypto analyst, the Bitcoin price has always rallied after US elections, but the price surge tends to be even more pronounced after a Trump win. Can The Trump Win Continue To Push Bitcoin Price Upwards? Crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, recently took to social media platform X to highlight an intriguing historical pattern between Donald Trump’s presidential victories and Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Severino, while Bitcoin has consistently rallied following US elections, the price surge was especially pronounced when Trump was first elected in 2016. Severino backed up his analysis with data from Bitcoin’s November 2016 performance on the two-month candlestick chart. At that time, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $725. After that election, the Bitcoin price went on to create seven consecutive bullish candlesticks following Trump’s win, setting off a remarkable rally that continued into 2017 and laid the foundation for Bitcoin’s ascent to its then-record highs. Now, with Bitcoin currently trading around $76,000 in the wake of Trump’s latest victory, Severino speculates whether the cryptocurrency could replicate this historical pattern. Interestingly, the analyst believes a repeat of this run could happen with Trump’s win, and Bitcoin could now make its move toward $100,000 per coin. Will Bitcoin Soar To $170,000 This Cycle? Still in the spirit of a bullish crypto market after Trump’s win, Tony Severino mentioned the possibility of the Bitcoin price soaring to $170,000 in the coming months. In another technical analysis, Tony highlighted the Bitcoin price action from October 2023 using Elliott Waves. According to this outlook, Bitcoin is about to start a fifth impulse wave, which is known to be the third and last bullish wave. With this in mind, the analyst pointed to Bitcoin pushing to reach $170,000 in 2025. “Are you prepared?” he asked. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $76,450, having established a new all-time high of $77,239 in the past 12 hours. The streak of all-time highs seems like it isn’t stopping anytime soon, as the market continues to reel in bullish momentum.

This breakout is sparking fresh optimism among investors who have been waiting for ADA to demonstrate sustained strength. According to recent data from Coinglass, ADA’s funding rate has risen to levels not seen since June, indicating strong demand and suggesting that this rally could only be the beginning of a larger trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins? This rising funding rate points to increased leverage in the market as traders grow more bullish on ADA’s potential for further gains. If ADA holds above the $0.40 mark, it could establish a new support level, reinforcing its recent uptrend and opening the door for even higher targets. However, the next few days will be crucial as the crypto market continues to rise, with key resistance and support levels in play. As traders closely watch ADA’s price action, it remains to be seen if this surge can sustain the momentum and push Cardano toward new highs. Cardano Is Starting To Rise Cardano has staged a powerful rally after months of selling pressure, marking its first major bullish move recently. With a push above crucial resistance levels, ADA has not only shaken off its downward trend but has also set up a new bullish price structure. Recent data from Coinglass underscores this bullish sentiment, showing that the open interest (OI)-weighted funding rate for ADA has reached its highest level since June. This surge in funding rates is a strong indicator of increased optimism among investors, as traders are willing to pay a premium for long positions, betting on Cardano’s continued rise. The positive funding rate implies that ADA demand is on the rise, with market participants eager to enter bullish trades. This breakout above key levels is attracting substantial interest from both retail and institutional investors, who are now positioning themselves for potential further upside. Many analysts suggest that this pump could serve as the catalyst for a more extended bullish continuation if Cardano can maintain its momentum. While ADA will need to establish new support at its breakout levels to confirm this trend shift, the recent uptrend signals renewed confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows As ADA continues to push upward, traders are now watching closely for a consolidation phase, which could provide the fuel needed for the next leg of this rally. If support holds around these levels, Cardano could be on the brink of a broader uptrend, making it a key altcoin to watch as the market recovers and interest in high-potential assets resurges. ADA Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.43, following a strong surge that took it above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $0.39—a crucial level indicating long-term strength and trend reversal. This move above the 200-day MA suggests that bulls are in control, setting the stage for potential further gains. To sustain this momentum, it’s essential for ADA to hold above this moving average as support, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The recent price action remains very positive, with ADA consistently pushing to challenge new supply levels. The next key target is $0.458, a resistance level that, if broken, could open the door to even higher price marks. However, a brief retracement to lower demand levels around $0.415 would be a constructive move, allowing ADA to build a solid foundation before another potential rally. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target This controlled pullback could attract fresh buying interest and provide the necessary fuel for ADA to move further upward. Overall, with price action aligning with key technical indicators, ADA’s recent surge above the 200-day MA highlights a promising shift for the asset, with further bullish developments likely if critical support levels hold firm.

One of the biggest drivers of the current performance of Bitcoin is the election of Republican Donald Trump. Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Analyst Predicts $4 Milestone As Token Rallies 11% Trump’s rhetoric and friendly pronouncement on crypto helped propel the asset’s price past $76k, beating this year’s March record. Now, many market analysts remain bullish days after the US elections. Thomas Lee, CNBC contributor and the CIO of Fundstrat Capital, even pushed a bolder claim, saying that Bitcoin could trade in six digits by year’s end. Lee states that the current market and political environment favor the top coin and expects more upside for digital assets. Trump’s Election Boosts Crypto Industry This Friday, the Fundstrat Capital CIO shared his thoughts on Trump’s elections and BTC’s future at CNBC’s Squawk Box. In the same discussion, Lee shared that Bitcoin and most altcoins will have a price rally in the short term. “It’s going to be very difficult to fix the deficit with just changes in taxes and spending,” says @fundstrat‘s Tom Lee. He says bitcoin is “potentially a Treasury reserve asset. If Bitcoin rises in price, it actually helps offset the liabilities, which is the deficit.” pic.twitter.com/tVrnE37dhS — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) November 8, 2024 Lee shared that right before the elections, the global markets faced plenty of uncertainties. However, with Trump winning the US elections and his favorable proposed policies on Bitcoin, the crypto industry can expect better days. Lee added that changes in regulations and pro-crypto policies could power the digital asset’s short run. He also credits Trump for his experience as a former president, which can help him better navigate future challenges. With Trump’s support and a favorable market environment, Lee reflects on his initial target of $150k for BTC, saying this is possible. Bitcoin, Digital Assets Can Help Offset US Debt One of Trump’s campaign promises is to cut the country’s growing budget deficit, which now stands at more than $35 trillion. Lee explained that it’s difficult for Trump to cut taxes and spending to address the deficit. Instead, Lee sees Bitcoin as the key to solving the country’s growing budget deficit. He sees the potential in BTC as a future Treasury asset, noting its increasing market value over the years. Interestingly, Trump has also explored the idea, saying that as president, he can arrange the country’s budget woes by handing “a Bitcoin check.” Bitcoin Act Gaining Momentum After The US Elections Before Lee’s comments, there had been discussions on Bitcoin’s growing role in the country’s financial system. Senator Cynthia Lummis filed a bill, the Bitcoin Act, to legitimize the crypto asset as an economic asset. Related Reading: SEC Shake-Up: Robinhood Legal Boss On Shortlist For Top Spot—Report According to Senator Lummis, Trump’s win will favor the push to make Bitcoin an asset to help combat economic uncertainties.
