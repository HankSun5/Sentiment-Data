The project has raised $925,384 so far thanks to its presale and pre-launch phases, with the latter beginning on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) recovered some ground after plunging to $81,000 on Friday and reclaimed the $83,000 mark. The steady recovery has seen the flagship cryptocurrency move to $98,901, up over 1% in the past 24 hours. However, precious metals crashed as their rally lost steam, with gold down over 10% and Silver dropping more than 30%. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Moves To $0.00026031 Husky Inu AI (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00025539 to $0.00025636. The project’s much-talked-about pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $83,000 As Gold, Silver Lose Steam Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) steadied itself after crashing to a nine-month low and reclaimed the $83,000 mark, moving to its current level of $83,890. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% in the past 24 hours. The 10% correction, spread over Wednesday and Thursday, saw BTC come dangerously close to slipping below the $80,000 mark. The correction was the result of overly cautious traders following significant ETF outflows, rising geopolitical tensions, and market uncertainty. Besides geopolitical and market factors, the threat from quantum computers has added to investor anxiety. Coinbase recently announced an independent advisory board to evaluate the risks associated with quantum computing, with plans to publish its study by 2027. The quantum threat discussion intensified after Jeffries removed Bitcoin from its flagship portfolio, citing long-term security concerns. However, Blockstream co-founder Adam Beck dismissed concerns about an immediate quantum risk. A Feeble Recovery The cryptocurrency market also recovered after two days of intense downward pressure, registering a marginal 0.45% increase to $2.83 trillion. Trading was mixed as Ethereum (ETH) continued trading in bearish territory. The altcoin slipped below the $2,700 mark and is down 1.50% to $2,692. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 1% at $1.73, while Solana (SOL) made a strong recovery and moved to $118. Dogecoin (DOGE) is marginally up over the past 24 hours, but Cardano (ADA) is down over 3%, trading around $0.314. Chainlink (LINK) is down 1% while Stellar (XLM) is also down over 1%, trading around $0.190. Hedera (HBAR) and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in the red, but Litecoin (LTC) and Toncoin (TON) registered notable declines over the past 24 hours.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.1632 Price Change 24h -3.37% Market Cap $1.38B Circulating Supply 8.64B PI Trading Volume 24h $20.64M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.1632 Price Prediction $ 0.1363 (-25.05%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 2.62% (Medium) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2097 200-Day SMA $0.3032 14-Day RSI 24.88 (Oversold) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown : As of today, Pi has dropped to $0.1632 after breaking under the $0.17 zone. The end of January daily chart demonstrates a further bearish structure. RSI is over sold, and the MACD is negative and has no reversal signal. As of January 31, 2026, Pi Network fell once again, having not been able to maintain above the $0.17 zone. Traders kept focus on downside risk after a late selloff that pushed Pi toward fresh lows. Pi is trading near $0.1632, with 24-hour volume rising to $20.64M, suggesting active distribution during the drop. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis On the daily timeframe, Pi opened around $0.1689 and sold down into the session. Price reversed to lower after posting a high of $0.1751 and later Pi dropped to a low of about $0.1590, where it ended to a close of $0.1632, which is 3.37% fall. The candle structure shows continued lower highs and weak demand. The $0.17 level now acts as short-term resistance after the breakdown. Bulls will need a clean reclaim above $0.17 to reduce pressure. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The daily RSI (14) is at 24.88, keeping Pi in oversold territory. The RSI sat close to its average near 24.35, which showed weak bounce strength. As per Traders, usually this setup is seen as an exhaustion risk, not a reversal signal.MACD remained negative with the MACD line at -0.0109 while the signal line is at -0.0089. The histogram stayed below zero at-0.0020, which kept bearish momentum intact. Support now is between $0.160 and $0.159. A break below that zone can expose the next downside test quickly. Resistance stands at $0.167 and $0.170, then higher at $0.175 from today’s peak. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi has remained under pressure as the price could not maintain recent rebound levels. Pi started trading at approximately $0.1626, reached a high of $0.1643, and then fell to $0.1608. On the 4-hour chart pi closed at $0.1612. The structure reflects a rejection following the recent move towards the $0.17 and $0.175 region, and then resumed selling that restored price to the $0.16 handle. Momentum indicators remained weak but not stretched as the daily chart. The RSI (14) is currently at 36.49, sitting below its average of 39.83. This signals fading recovery strength after the bounce. The MACD stayed near the zero line but remained soft, with the MACD line around -0.0020 and the signal line near -0.0021, while the histogram moved slightly positive near 0.0001, pointing to slowing downside momentum without a clear bullish shift. Immediate support is forming at $0.1608 and $0.1610, matching the session low zone. A breakdown below this area can open the next downside test quickly. On the upside, near-term resistance sits at $0.164–$0.165, followed by the heavier supply region around $0.170 and $0.175, where sellers previously stepped back in. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1977 SELL SMA 5 $0.1995 SELL SMA 10 $0.2018 SELL SMA 21 $0.2058 SELL SMA 50 $0.2097 SELL SMA 100 $0.2196 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2062 SELL EMA 5 $0.2075 SELL EMA 10 $0.2077 SELL EMA 21 $0.2083 SELL EMA 50 $0.2160 SELL EMA 100 $0.2449 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to remain under pressure as long as price trades below the $0.165 and $0.17 resistance zone, with sellers still controlling short-term momentum. If the $0.160 support fails, the next downside test could occur near the $0.155 and $0.158 region, which is near the current all-time low. A recovery attempt would require a clean break and hold above $0.17, supported by rising volume, to signal any meaningful shift in trend. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is down today because ongoing token unlocks are increasing supply faster than demand, while the broader crypto market remains weak under “Fear” sentiment. Technicals also stay bearish, with PI trading below key moving averages and showing oversold RSI readings that reflect continued selling pressure. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth. On January 15, 2026, Pi traded around $0.205 and closed near $0.2046 after slipping from the $0.21 area, showing a controlled pullback with buyers still defending the low-$0.20 zone.

Santiment’s social-data read shows negative chatter spiking and the balance of bearish to bullish comments tilting heavily toward fear. That kind of panic has, at times, been followed by price rebounds in past cycles. What The Numbers Are Saying Right now the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits in “Extreme Fear,” with readings that fell into the teens this week. That scoring reflects widespread caution and a lot of people pulling back from risk. At the same time, Santiment’s metrics point to unusually negative sentiment on social platforms, which some analysts treat as a possible contrarian buy signal. Voices From Traders And Execs Not everyone is ready to call a bottom. Analyst Benjamin Cowen warned that a big shift of money from metals into crypto is not guaranteed in the short run, arguing that the expected rotation may not come. Company leaders are quieter but watchful. Coinbase’s chief business officer said the “signals are there if you’re paying attention,” pointing out that big legacy firms are still hiring for crypto-related roles. Bitcoin Price Action Appears Mixed Bitcoin has been swinging. It dropped back into the $82,000 level and has shown sharp moves tied to macro headlines and flows. Reports note a recent slide near $81,900 amid broader risk repricing, with traders shifting money around as geopolitics and markets change. At the same time, some traders see dips as buying chances. The nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair by US President Donald Trump was one such macro event that stirred markets and helped prompt short-term moves. How To Read This Moment Sentiment is a noisy signal. When fear runs high, downside often becomes limited for a spell. That said, a real, lasting rally usually needs more than sour social mood — it needs firmer liquidity, clearer macro direction, or steady flows from big investors. Still, Santiment highlighted that the current mood reading is among the rare positive signs for crypto. They added that one bright spot is the intense negativity on social media, where bearish comments far outnumber bullish ones. Santiment noted that crypto often moves against the crowd. When most investors expect prices to fall, it can create conditions for a potential rebound.

Total crypto liquidations exceeded $2 billion within 24 hours, marking one of the largest deleveraging events of the year. The majority of wiped positions were leveraged longs, caught offside as prices broke through key technical levels. The sudden unwind erased tens of billions of dollars from the total crypto market capitalization, which dropped more than 7% intraday before stabilizing. The rapid decline underscored how quickly sentiment can shift in a highly leveraged environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead the Liquidation Cascade Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the largest share of liquidations. Bitcoin saw roughly $700 million in positions wiped out as it slipped below short-term support, accelerating downside momentum. Ethereum followed with an estimated $300–$350 billionin liquidations after breaking under the $2,500 zone and sliding toward $2,400. The loss of this key level intensified long squeezes across derivatives platforms. Other major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, also experienced significant liquidations. In lower-liquidity tokens, volatility was amplified as cascading stop-loss orders triggered additional forced selling. What Triggered the January 31 Deleveraging Event Several factors combined to fuel the selloff. Technical breakdowns across major assets activated algorithmic trading systems and stop orders clustered below support zones. Elevated open interest in perpetual futures left the market vulnerable to a sharp long squeeze. As prices declined, margin calls forced traders to close positions, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of selling. At the same time, broader macro uncertainty weighed on risk assets, further pressuring crypto markets. While liquidation flushes often reflect panic-driven conditions, they can also reset overheated leverage and funding rates. Market participants are now watching whether the January 31 event signals the start of a deeper correction or a short-term reset before renewed consolidation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 21:32:17

In recent days, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Dragonfly Capital partner Haseeb Qureshi, and Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy have all pushed back strongly against the narrative, arguing that macroeconomic panic, liquidity stress, and market structure weaknesses, not a single platform’s product design, drove the crash. Their responses, widely shared across Crypto Twitter and industry forums, are now reshaping how the market revisits one of the most destructive liquidation events since the FTX era. CZ Attributes Crash To Macro Shock, Not Exchange Failures CZ addressed the controversy directly during a Binance Square AMA on January 31, 2026, where he emphasized that the October 10 sell-off was largely driven by tariff-related macroeconomic news that spooked global risk markets, not internal failures at Binance. According to CZ, Bitcoin’s current market depth and global liquidity make it extremely difficult for any single entity to manipulate prices through isolated dumping or localized dislocations. While Binance’s post-incident review did acknowledge two technical irregularities on the day of the crash, including temporary UI transfer issues and certain index price deviations, CZ firmly rejected the idea that these anomalies triggered the broader market collapse. Instead, he framed the sell-off as a classic panic-driven cascade amplified by high leverage, thin liquidity during volatility, and macro fear spilling into crypto. OKX’s founder also weighed in alongside the discussion, noting that product design choices, risk controls, and infrastructure behavior at major platforms can intensify stress during extreme market moments, but stopped short of blaming any single exchange as the primary cause. Haseeb Dismantles The USDe Leverage Theory Among the strongest critics of Star Xu’s narrative is Dragonfly Capital partner Haseeb Qureshi, who publicly rejected the claim that Binance’s USDe yield campaign triggered the October crash. In a detailed breakdown shared on X, Haseeb argued that the timeline, market data, and cross-exchange behavior simply do not support the idea that USDe caused, or even meaningfully amplified, the liquidation spiral. At the heart of Star Xu’s argument is the idea that Binance encouraged traders to loop USDe as collateral, building extreme leverage that eventually unraveled from a small price shock. But Haseeb says the numbers tell a very different story. Bitcoin, he pointed out, bottomed nearly 30 minutes before USDe experienced any meaningful price divergence on Binance. “That alone breaks the causal link,” he explained. “USDe could not have triggered the liquidation cascade if the cascade already happened.” In other words, the crash was already in motion before USDe showed stress. Isolated Depeg Fails To Explain Global Liquidations Haseeb further emphasized that USDe’s price dislocation occurred almost exclusively on Binance. On other exchanges and trading venues, USDe remained largely stable, while massive liquidations were simultaneously ripping through every major crypto platform worldwide. This, he argued, makes it impossible for USDe to be the systemic driver. When true systemic collapses occur, like Terra, Three Arrows Capital, or FTX, the damage propagates everywhere. Balance sheets implode across venues. Prices diverge globally. Liquidity disappears universally. That’s not what happened with USDe. “If a depeg doesn’t spread cross-exchange, it can’t explain a market-wide wipeout,” Haseeb noted. Even when giving Star Xu’s theory the benefit of the doubt, suggesting USDe might have amplified the crash rather than caused it, the argument still falls apart, according to Haseeb, because there was no evidence of global contagion from the asset. Instead, the data points to broader forces: tariff-driven fear, Binance API disruptions, forced liquidations, ADL mechanisms triggering, and the absence of stabilizing buffers common in traditional financial markets. Timing And Motives Come Under Scrutiny Haseeb also questioned why Star Xu is pushing this narrative months after the event, without presenting any new evidence. Order book data, liquidation flows, and price movements have been publicly available since October and thoroughly analyzed by traders, researchers, and on-chain analysts. Yet only now is OKX’s CEO framing the crash around Binance and Ethena. To Haseeb, the sudden reemergence of the theory feels less like a data-driven discovery and more like a strategic escalation between industry heavyweights. “This looks like picking a fight and using a simple story to make it sound like CZ caused 10/10 through irresponsibility,” he suggested. The implication is clear: the debate may now be as much about industry rivalry as it is about market mechanics. Wintermute Warns Against Scapegoating A Single Platform Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy added another layer of perspective, cautioning against the emotional tendency to pin complex market collapses on one company. In his view, attributing a multi-billion-dollar systemic sell-off to a single exchange oversimplifies how modern crypto markets function. Kind of wish public figures would pick words more carefully. 10/10 was very obviously not a “software glitch”. It was a flash crash on mega leveraged market on illiquid Friday night driven by macro news. And since we are here, I get that nobody likes being in bear market,… https://t.co/uUrwqrbS8t — wishful_cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) January 30, 2026 Gaevoy explained that in bearish environments, especially when other asset classes are rising while crypto struggles, investors naturally look for a villain. But markets driven by leverage, automated liquidations, global liquidity flows, and sentiment feedback loops rarely collapse from one isolated trigger. “Blaming one platform might feel emotionally satisfying,” he said, “but it’s logically weak.” Instead, he pointed to structural fragility across crypto: high leverage tolerance, thin order books during volatility, reflexive liquidations, and limited circuit-breaker mechanisms. In such conditions, any macro shock can spiral into a cascading collapse. A Broader Reckoning For Crypto Market Structure Taken together, the responses from CZ, Haseeb, and Gaevoy paint a picture far more complex than a single yield product gone wrong. Rather than one exchange creating a meltdown, the October 10 crash increasingly appears to reflect: • Macro-driven panic spilling into risk assets • Overleveraged trading across platforms • Automated liquidation systems accelerating sell-offs • Infrastructure strain during peak volatility • A lack of stabilizing market safeguards While product design and risk controls certainly matter, industry leaders now argue that focusing solely on Binance and USDe misses the deeper structural vulnerabilities that continue to haunt crypto markets. The renewed debate is forcing a hard truth back into the spotlight: until leverage culture, liquidity resilience, and systemic safeguards improve, crypto will remain vulnerable to violent cascades, regardless of which platform hosts the next popular yield product. And as this latest clash between top executives shows, the fight to define the narrative of October 10 is far from over. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Now, OKX CEO Star Xu is openly pointing to what he describes as a dangerous leverage cycle enabled by Binance, one that quietly transformed a yield product into a systemic risk engine. In a detailed public statement shared on X, Star Xu argued that the October 11 crash was not a random volatility event but the result of structural failures created by how USDe was promoted, treated, and repeatedly leveraged across the market. His comments, which can be found, are quickly reshaping industry conversations around risk management and exchange responsibility. No complexity. No accident. 10/10 was caused by irresponsible marketing campaigns by certain companies. On October 10, tens of billions of dollars were liquidated. As CEO of OKX, we observed clearly that the crypto market’s microstructure fundamentally changed after that day.… pic.twitter.com/N1VlY4F7rt — Star (@star_okx) January 31, 2026 According to Xu, the fallout has already altered the microstructure of crypto trading itself. “On October 10, tens of billions of dollars were liquidated. As CEO of OKX, we observed clearly that the crypto market’s microstructure fundamentally changed after that day,” he stated. Many market participants now believe the damage surpassed even the collapse of FTX, a claim that underscores just how deeply the shockwaves traveled. Binance’s USDe Yield Campaign Sparked A High-Risk Leverage Loop At the center of Xu’s criticism is a temporary user-acquisition campaign launched by Binance that offered an eye-catching 12% APY on USDe holdings. While high yields are nothing new in crypto, the issue, according to Xu, was how Binance allowed USDe to function almost identically to traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC, including being used as collateral with no meaningful restrictions. This effectively positioned USDe as a “safe” asset in traders’ eyes, despite carrying a much higher embedded risk profile. Users were encouraged to convert their USDT and USDC into USDe to chase returns, often without clear communication about the underlying exposure they were taking on. From the surface, it looked like a simple yield opportunity. Under the hood, it was something far more dangerous. USDe Operates Like A Tokenized Hedge Fund, Not A Stablecoin Star Xu emphasized that USDe is fundamentally different from standard stablecoins or low-risk tokenized funds. USDe is issued by Ethena, which raises capital through what it markets as a “stablecoin,” then deploys those funds into index arbitrage and algorithmic trading strategies, essentially running hedge-fund-style operations and tokenizing the resulting positions. The token can then be deposited on exchanges to earn yield. This structure, Xu explained, embeds hedge-fund-level risk directly into a product many users treated like digital cash. That’s where the danger emerged. He contrasted USDe with tokenized money market funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, which are designed around conservative, low-risk financial instruments. USDe, by comparison, carries structural trading exposure. “The difference is not cosmetic, it is fundamental,” Xu noted. Yet on major platforms, that distinction was barely visible to everyday traders. Repeated Collateral Cycling Pushed Leverage To Extreme Levels What turned risk into systemic instability was the feedback loop Binance’s collateral structure enabled. According to Xu, users began following a repeating strategy: They converted USDT and USDC into USDe to earn yield. They used USDe as collateral to borrow USDT. They converted the borrowed USDT back into USDe. They repeated the cycle again and again. Each loop stacked more leverage onto the system. On paper, traders saw APYs balloon to 24%, 36%, even above 70%. Because these opportunities existed on one of the world’s largest exchanges, many assumed the risk was minimal. In reality, leverage was quietly compounding across the entire market. Systemic exposure wasn’t isolated to one platform, it spread globally. And once enough pressure built up, all it took was a relatively small shock to bring the structure down. Depegging Triggered Liquidation Cascades Across The Market When volatility finally hit, the weakness of the system surfaced instantly. USDe began to depeg. That single break triggered massive forced liquidations as leveraged positions unraveled in rapid succession. Collateral values dropped, margin calls accelerated, and automated sell-offs flooded the market. Xu also pointed to risk management gaps around assets like WETH and BNSOL, which amplified price crashes even further. Some tokens briefly traded close to zero as liquidity vanished. The result was one of the most violent liquidation events in crypto history. “The damage to global users and companies, including OKX customers, was severe, and recovery will take time,” Xu said. What had started as a yield promotion ended as a systemic breakdown. Industry Leaders Face Growing Pressure Over Risk Transparency Despite the sharp critique, Xu stressed that his goal is not to attack Binance personally but to spotlight the deeper structural problems that allowed such risk to accumulate unnoticed. He warned that open discussion may trigger backlash and misinformation but insisted that transparency is essential if crypto is to mature into a trustworthy financial system. “As the largest global platform, Binance has outsized influence, and corresponding responsibility, as an industry leader,” he stated. In Xu’s view, long-term trust cannot be built on aggressive yield incentives, excessive leverage, or marketing that blurs real risk. Instead, exchanges must prioritize: • Clear risk disclosure • Responsible collateral frameworks • Limits on recursive leverage • Market stability over short-term user growth The industry, he added, needs leadership focused on sustainable innovation, not a winner-take-all mindset where criticism is treated as hostility. A Turning Point For Crypto Market Structure The October crash is increasingly being seen not as an isolated event, but as a structural wake-up call. Just as the 2022 collapses reshaped custody and proof-of-reserves practices, this latest meltdown is now forcing hard conversations around leverage design, yield products, and how exchanges present risk to users. Star Xu’s comments have already fueled broader debate among traders, analysts, and platform operators. If his assessment holds, the real lesson of October isn’t about one token depegging, it’s about how modern crypto infrastructure can quietly turn complex financial engineering into mass-market risk. And unless the industry corrects those feedback loops, the next crash may come even faster. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The former Chief Technology Officer of Ripple and one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger weighed in on claims that XRP could realistically reach price levels between $50 and $100. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Interestingly, Schwartz’s view wasn’t one of outright bullishness but on how markets actually price belief, probability, and conviction with a blunt reality check. Schwartz Refuses To Admit Or Dismiss A $100 XRP When asked whether to tell investors that XRP cannot realistically reach $50 or $100, Schwartz refused to give in to take that position. Instead, he began by explaining why he was uncomfortable making absolute statements about XRP’s future price. Drawing on personal experience, he pointed out that he once considered much lower milestones unrealistic, including XRP trading above $0.25 and Bitcoin reaching $100 as an impossible dream. However, personal disbelief was not the issue. His contention is based on how rational markets behave when participants genuinely believe in a specific outcome. According to Schwartz, if a meaningful number of rational investors truly believed there was even a modest chance of XRP reaching $100 within a few years, the market would already reflect that belief. In such a scenario, investors would be unwilling to sell XRP at prices far below $10, and buyers with that conviction would rapidly absorb available supply. At the time of writing, XRP is trading well below $10, and is yet to even establish $2 as a support floor. The fact that XRP continues to trade well under that level, in his view, shows that very few market participants actually assign a serious probability to a $100 outcome. According to Schwartz, cryptocurrency markets are more rational than they are often given credit for. However, he also noted his personal belief that most significant crypto bull runs were due to unpredictable external changes. This caveat still opens up the possibility that XRP would, in fact, trade at $100 one day. Comparing XRP And Bitcoin Through A Rational Market Lens In a follow-up exchange, Schwartz responded to a comparison between XRP reaching $100 and Bitcoin’s early journey to $1,000. The unlikelihood of XRP reaching $100 is dependent more on the multiple of the asset than anything else. A ten-fold increase in XRP, he said, is about as unlikely as a ten-fold increase in Bitcoin or Ethereum right now, regardless of whether that move occurred in the past or might happen in the future. The idea that XRP would one day trade at $100 has been a popular idea among bullish XRP enthusiasts. However, a few critics have always downplayed the idea, citing the enormous amount of inflow this would take and saying it would be best to target lower prices like $10 first.

A new report by TRM Labs estimates that fraudulent wallets received approximately $158 billion in incoming value during the year, which is the highest level recorded over the past five years. The increase is a dramatic reversal from 2024, when illicit inflows fell to $64.5 billion, following a steady multi-year decline from $85.9 billion in 2021 to $75.4 billion in 2022 and $73.3 billion in 2023. Sanctions, Stablecoins, and State Strategy TRM Labs attributed the 2025 surge not only to intensified enforcement actions but also to expanded use of cryptocurrency by nation-state actors and technological advances that enabled the identification of previously unattributed illicit volumes. The most significant shift was concentrated in sanctions-linked activity tied overwhelmingly to Russia, as volumes associated with sanctioned entities and jurisdictions rose sharply. The A7A5 token alone accounted for an estimated $72 billion in incoming value, followed by $39 billion linked to the A7 wallet cluster, with the majority of this activity connected to Russia-linked actors, including Garantex, Grinex, and A7. The blockchain intelligence firm stated that the increase does not reflect sanctions evasion growth alone, but rather the combination of new sanctions designations targeting large entities and improved attribution of cryptocurrency addresses to actors that had already been sanctioned. Among these, A7 emerged as a central node and functioned as a centrally coordinated sanctions evasion architecture tied to Russian state interests. On-chain activity analyzed by TRM indicates that A7 operates as a hub linking Russia-aligned actors with counterparties across China, Southeast Asia, and Iran-linked networks, in a major pivot toward crypto-enabled, state-aligned financial infrastructure. While the A7 wallet cluster is closely associated with sanctions evasion activity, the A7A5 token supports a wider push to reduce reliance on USD-based financial systems through the expansion of a ruble-pegged stablecoin. As a result, the high transaction volumes linked to A7A5 do not exclusively represent sanctions evasion, but sanctioned activity more broadly, including state-aligned economic flows. Fraudulent Crypto Grows Zooming out from sanctions-related activity, the firm also revealed that overall illicit crypto inflows rose to an all-time high in 2025, even as such activity accounted for a smaller share of the crypto ecosystem. Measured as a proportion of total attributed on-chain volume, illicit activity declined slightly to 1.2% in 2025 from 1.3% in 2024, and remained well below the 2.4% peak recorded in 2023. A similar pattern was observed when illicit activity was assessed relative to incoming liquidity, as illicit entities received 2.7% of incoming VASP flows in 2025, compared with 2.9% in 2024 and 6.0% in 2023. TRM Labs said these metrics indicate that while certain illicit categories expanded significantly in absolute terms, illicit actors absorbed a smaller proportion of new capital entering the crypto ecosystem.

This colossal movement, valued at approximately $470 million, originated from an enigmatic private wallet and terminated at the major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Consequently, this transaction immediately captured the attention of analysts and traders worldwide, prompting deep scrutiny into its potential market implications. Decoding the $470 Million Bitcoin Whale Transfer Blockchain explorers confirm the transaction’s details with cryptographic certainty. Whale Alert, a trusted aggregator of large blockchain movements, reported the transfer in real-time. The sending address, lacking any known public affiliation, classifies as a ‘private’ or ‘unknown’ wallet. This characteristic often indicates custody by a high-net-worth individual, a family office, or an institutional entity prioritizing privacy. The recipient address, however, is definitively tagged as belonging to Bitfinex, one of the world’s oldest and most liquid digital asset exchanges. To contextualize the scale, 5,999 BTC represents a significant portion of daily exchange flows. For instance, it equates to roughly 30% of the new Bitcoin mined in an entire month. Historically, such substantial inflows to exchanges can precede increased selling pressure, as holders move assets to trading platforms for liquidation. Alternatively, they may signal preparations for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, collateralization for loans, or strategic portfolio rebalancing. Historical Context and Whale Behavior Patterns Examining past data provides crucial perspective. Large Bitcoin movements are not uncommon, but their intent varies. A 2023 study by Chainalysis noted that exchange inflows exceeding 3,000 BTC often correlate with short-term price volatility. However, correlation does not equal causation. Furthermore, the current macroeconomic climate, with potential shifts in interest rate policies, adds another layer of analysis. Analysts typically cross-reference this data with other metrics: Exchange Net Flow: Monitoring if other exchanges see simultaneous outflows, indicating a mere platform transfer. Futures Market Data: Checking for corresponding changes in open interest and funding rates. OTC Desk Activity: Large sales are frequently executed off-exchange to minimize market impact. Notably, the Bitcoin market has matured significantly since earlier bull cycles. Therefore, a single transfer, while massive, may have a more muted immediate impact due to deeper overall liquidity. Expert Analysis on Potential Motivations Market strategists offer several evidence-based interpretations for such a move. Firstly, it could represent profit-taking by a long-term holder, especially if the wallet’s history shows accumulation at much lower price points. Secondly, institutional entities often use exchanges as gateways to access decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or for staking services, requiring an on-ramp. Thirdly, it might be collateral movement for institutional lending or margin requirements on derivative positions. “We must avoid speculative leaps,” advises Dr. Lena Schmidt, a blockchain forensics researcher. “Our analysis shows that between 40-50% of large exchange inflows in the last quarter were followed by OTC settlements, not open-market sells. The destination is a clue, but the full story is in the wallet’s history and broader chain activity.” This expert insight underscores the importance of comprehensive data review over reactionary assumptions. Implications for Bitcoin Market Structure and Liquidity The immediate effect of this transfer is a measurable change in exchange supply. Platforms like CryptoQuant track ‘Exchange Whale Ratio,’ which spiked following this deposit. An increased ratio can signal that whales are moving coins to sell, often viewed as a short-term bearish indicator. However, the long-term effect depends entirely on the holder’s subsequent actions. If the BTC is sold on the spot market, it could create localized resistance. Conversely, if it’s used as collateral or moved to cold storage from the exchange shortly after, the net effect on sell-side pressure is minimal. The transaction also highlights the transparency of public blockchains. Every move is auditable, providing a level of market intelligence absent in traditional finance. Conclusion The transfer of 5,999 BTC to Bitfinex stands as a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate within the digital asset ecosystem. This Bitcoin whale transfer provides a real-time case study in blockchain transparency and market microstructure analysis. While its arrival on an exchange warrants monitoring, definitive conclusions require observing the next on-chain steps. Ultimately, such events highlight the maturing yet dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets, where monumental value moves are visible to all but their intent remains encrypted until revealed by action. FAQs Q1: What does a large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange usually mean? It typically indicates the holder intends to trade, sell, or use the assets in financial products offered by the exchange. However, it can also be a preliminary step for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal or moving between custodial services. Q2: How does Whale Alert detect these transactions? Whale Alert monitors public blockchain data in real-time using node networks. It filters for transactions exceeding a certain value threshold (e.g., $1 million) and cross-references addresses with known exchange wallets and other tagged entities. Q3: Can the owner of the ‘unknown wallet’ be identified? While the address itself is pseudonymous, blockchain analysts can often uncover clues by studying its transaction history, interaction patterns with known entities, and timing relative to public market events. Absolute identification, however, is rarely possible without external data. Q4: Does this transaction automatically mean the price will drop? No. While large exchange inflows can increase available sell-side liquidity, price action depends on actual executed sell orders, overall market demand, and broader macroeconomic factors. A single deposit is one data point among many. Q5: What is the difference between an OTC trade and an exchange trade? An OTC (Over-The-Counter) trade is a private, bilateral agreement to buy or sell assets at an agreed price. It avoids the public order book, minimizing market impact. An exchange trade executes directly on the platform’s public order book, influencing the visible market price.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency traded in the low-to-mid $78,000 range during the session, marking one of its weakest daily performances in months. The breakdown below $80,000 triggered a wave of forced liquidations across derivatives platforms, accelerating the downside move. Within hours, more than $1 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out across the broader crypto market, with Bitcoin accounting for the largest share. Liquidations Amplify the Downside Move As BTC lost short-term support near $82,000-$80,000, stop-loss orders and margin calls cascaded through the market. Elevated open interest in perpetual futures left traders vulnerable to a long squeeze, intensifying volatility. The spike in liquidation volume suggests the selloff was driven not only by spot selling but also by aggressive deleveraging. Rapid forced closures added momentum to the drop, pushing Bitcoin to session lows before modest stabilization attempts emerged. Macro Pressure Beyond technical breakdowns, broader macro uncertainty contributed to risk aversion. Shifts in interest-rate expectations and cautious positioning across global markets weighed on speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies. The total crypto market capitalization fell sharply alongside Bitcoin, erasing tens of billions of dollars in value during the session. Ethereum and other major altcoins followed BTC lower, reflecting widespread market weakness. While intraday rebounds remain possible after such heavy liquidations, Bitcoin must reclaim the $80,000-$82,000 zone to signal short-term stabilization. Until then, traders are watching the mid-$70,000 area as the next potential support level if selling pressure persists.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 22:56:28

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark. In December, the price continued to move downwards ending the year at $$0.0122.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 23:00:00

While many had hoped for a repeat of past “to-the-moon” runs, the charts are telling a different story. The social momentum that once fueled viral rallies is fading, and investor sentiment is shifting. Speculation driven by jokes and trends is losing its appeal. Instead, capital is moving toward projects built on real code and functional tools. A quiet transition is underway as funds exit the old regime and reposition for what comes next. The industry is entering a new crypto phase of decentralized finance, one that is reshaping the market and casting a long shadow over outdated models. Projects that fail to adapt may find themselves anchored to a past that is no longer coming back. Dogecoin (DOGE) At around $0.11, Dogecoin (DOGE) has only been able to start the year in a stagnant position. The coin has been trapped in a narrow range although it made a short attempt to break higher in early January. Its market cap would be approximately at $19 billion though volume is shrinking. The initial rushes which used to transform millionaires into a far off dream. Analysts are even making somber warnings. Others anticipate that DOGE would fall to less than $0.08 by the close of 2026. This dumping is due to a mere reason. Investors are shifting their funds to utility producing projects. They have had enough of waiting to have a tweet to shift the price. They desire assets that produce value through borrowing and lending. The absence of a real ecosystem of Dogecoin is turning out to be a significant weakness. Big holders are redirecting to platforms that are actually utility backed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a specialized lending ecosystem on Ethereum that operates through a dual-market model. This structure allows you to access liquidity without selling your tokens, keeping your long-term investment strategy intact. The protocol develops two distinct methods for matching lenders and borrowers: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): This is an automated system where you interact directly with smart contract-run liquidity pools. For example, you can deposit USDT into a pool to earn an immediate 10–12% APY, or borrow from that same pool instantly without waiting for a specific person to approve your request. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): This model allows for direct, custom agreements between individuals. If you have a unique asset or want specific terms, such as borrowing 10,000 USDT at a fixed rate for exactly 30 days, you can find a lender willing to match those exact requirements. To keep the system stable, Mutuum Finance will use a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which dictates how much you can borrow against your deposited collateral. For instance, if the LTV for a stable asset like ETH is set at 75%, a user depositing $1,000 worth of ETH could borrow up to $750. Volatile assets typically have lower LTVs, such as 35%, to protect the protocol from sudden price drops. The MUTM Accelerated Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has entered its most active stage yet, having successfully raised over $20.1 million and established a robust community of more than 19,000 individual holders. This fundraising success places MUTM among the top-performing DeFi presales of the 2026 cycle. Currently in Phase 7, the token is priced at $0.04, which reflects a consistent 300% value increase for participants who joined during the initial offering at $0.01. This phased approach is designed to reward early support with built-in appreciation, as the price is scheduled to rise to $0.045 in Phase 8 before eventually reaching the confirmed official launch price of $0.06. Participation in the current phase remains high due to the significant gap between the current discounted price and the public listing value, offering a final opportunity for investors to secure a 50% discount compared to the launch tier. To maintain this momentum, the project features a 24-hour leaderboard that awards a $500 bonus in MUTM tokens to the top daily contributor. The distribution structure is highly transparent, with 1.82 billion tokens (45.5% of the total 4 billion supply) dedicated to the presale. Current data indicates that over 835 million tokens have already been sold, meaning nearly half of the available presale allocation has been claimed. Why MUTM Outperforms DOGE DOGE relies on viral social media trends and celebrity mentions to drive its value. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its value through technical progress. The project recently reached a major goal by launching its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This is a big step because it shows the code is real and ready to use. The testnet lets users try out the core lending and borrowing tools before the official launch. You can now test the mtToken system, where people who lend their crypto get yield-bearing receipts. These tokens grow in value as borrowers pay back their loans with interest. The system also includes an automated liquidator bot. This bot watches the “Health Factor” of every loan and closes risky positions to keep the platform safe. Analysts see DOGE as a high-risk asset that moves mostly on hype. For 2026, some experts predict it could grow by 1.2x, potentially reaching prices between $0.12-$0.14 if a new wave of social media interest hits. However, without new utility, it remains very volatile. Because MUTM is tied to a working lending platform, its outlook is different. It is currently in Phase 7 of its presale at $0.04. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06, it already offers a 50% jump. Long-term analysts predict it could reach $0.30 by late 2026 as long as mainnet follows as planned. This would be a 650% appreciation from today’s price.

57625024,660465,1769900401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57625024.jpeg,XRP About To Make A New Wave Of Multi-Millionaires As Capital Floods In,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-new-wave-of-millionaires/,"Capital is rotating back into high-potential crypto assets, and XRP is emerging as the primary beneficiary of the shift. As liquidity floods back into the market, many believe the altcoin is positioned for a powerful upside move that could dramatically reshape portfolios. Why This Capital Inflow Could Change XRP’s Price Forever XRP is about to make multi-millionaires. An analyst known as Dragon revealed a video on X that RealFi has officially approved Walmart as a vendor. Walmart, a global retail giant with a $800 billion market capitalization and responsible for approximately $680 billion in annual customer transactions, is now live in the RealFi ecosystem. This initiative now has the potential to onboard over 342 million Walmart customers annually to the RealFi ecosystem. The XRP Ledger and Real Token powers this RealFi infrastructure. The market narrative about XRP may be misleading, and the millionaire wallets are rising fast. Crypto trader Skipper has noted that while the token continues to trade below the $2.00 level, it is still attracting serious attention from large investors. The new on-chain data from Santiment shows that 42 new whale wallets holding more than 1 million XRP have been created since the start of the year. This steady rise in whale accumulation suggests that high-net-worth investors may be preparing for a major upside move. With smart money entering the market, this kind of accumulation trend could support a bullish XRP price prediction in the weeks ahead. On the technical side, the daily chart shows an interesting pattern that led to a strong recovery the last time this setup occurred. This could be what whales are seeing that most retail investors are missing. XRP’s price has been squeezed down into a key support zone, and buying interest is rising. Meanwhile, whales are aggressively accumulating at around $1.75, and if retail participants start to follow whale behavior , the setup could quickly evolve into a short squeeze. Retail And Institutions Are Watching The Same Asset According to Xfinancebull, while everyone is arguing over XRP price action and chart patterns, 2 million people are actively tracking the token on CoinMarketCap’s watchlist. That level of interest is not accidental; it reflects broad retail and institutional interest in the same asset. A high watchlist count typically signals positive sentiment and growing anticipation. Even traders and algorithms respond to this rising attention, which often influences short-term trends. However, the signal here is that the watchlists represent investors who are monitoring closely and waiting for opportunities. A steadily growing watcher base is an early indicator of future buying pressure. When clarity comes or momentum shifts, those 2 million are already positioned to move, rather than starting from scratch. This high visibility boosts the ecosystem, as increased attention attracts partnerships, adoption, and institutional interest. The feedback loop is real, and the altcoin is no longer a hidden opportunity, but has become one of the most-watched assets in crypto.",XRP|Coinmarketcap|DRAGON|REAL token|RealFi|ripple|RP Ledger|Skipper|Walmart|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Retailers|XRP Whales|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 23:00:01

The decision landed after a violent selloff that wiped out leveraged positions across metals. Gold and silver both collapsed on Friday as traders rushed to close positions, and margin calls spread fast. The change takes effect from Monday’s close and applies to gold, silver, platinum, and palladium futures. For traders, the message from CME is blunt. If you want to trade metals in this market, you need more cash upfront. Gold margins for non‑heightened risk profiles rise from 6% to 8% of contract value. For heightened risk profiles, margins rise from 6.6% to 8.8%. Silver margins jump harder. Non‑heightened risk margins rise from 11% to 15%, while heightened risk margins increase from 12.1% to 16.5%. Platinum and palladium margins also go up. Margin hikes raise collateral demands after extreme volatility The margin increase follows what CME described as a normal review of market volatility to ensure enough collateral coverage. The exchange often raises margins when prices swing hard, whether up or down. This time, the timing adds pressure. Smaller traders now face higher cash requirements just days after heavy losses. Earlier in the week, CME had already raised margins on silver, platinum, and palladium futures after prices ran higher. Friday’s update expands that tightening. Anyone trading futures in these metals must now post more collateral to keep positions open and meet obligations. For many smaller accounts, that extra cash may not be available. Gold and silver prices collapsed on Friday as markets reacted to political news from Washington.President Donald Trump, now serving as the 47th president, nominated Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. The nomination eased concerns about the Fed’s independence and sent the dollar higher. A stronger dollar made gold and silver more expensive for overseas buyers and added pressure to prices. Spot silver dropped 28% to $83.45 an ounce. Silver futures plunged 31.4% to settle at $78.53, the worst day since March 1980. Spot gold fell about 9% to $4,895.22 an ounce. Gold futures slid 11.4% to $4,745.10. “This is getting crazy,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. After that first reference, Matt said most of the selling looked forced. He said silver had become a favorite trade for short‑term traders and day traders, which built leverage. When prices collapsed, margin calls followed fast. Dollar rally and profit taking slam metals and related assets Selling pressure grew through U.S. trading hours as investors locked in profits after long rallies. Gold and silver had surged through 2025, with gold up 66% and silver up 135% for the year. The fast gains attracted heavy positioning. When prices turned, exits became crowded. The dollar index last traded about 0.8% higher, adding pressure. Metals also lost support from the idea that gold and silver could replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, had been seen as the favorite to replace Jerome Powell. But prediction markets shifted toward Warsh in recent days. Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, wrote that markets were trading Warsh as hawkish. After his first mention, Krishna said the pick could help stabilize the dollar and challenge debasement trades, which weighed on metals. He also warned against pushing that trade too far and said Warsh is a pragmatist, not an ideological hawk. Geopolitics had helped metals earlier in the year. Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said a perfect storm of tensions pushed prices higher. After his first mention, Claudio pointed to the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro and U.S. threats of military force in Greenland and Iran. He said recent speculation about the Fed chair had also influenced metals. The selloff spread beyond futures. Coeur Mining dropped 17%. The ProShares Ultra Silver ETF fell more than 62%. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 31%. Both funds headed for their worst days on record. Katy Stoves, investment manager at Mattioli Woods, said the drop looked like a market‑wide reassessment of concentration risk. After her first mention, Katy said crowded trades can unwind fast when everyone is positioned the same way. Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, said gold’s run toward $5,000 happened too easily.After his first mention, Toni said central bank buying had supported prices but slowed in recent months. Toni said reserve diversification remains a theme, especially as Trump’s trade policies and foreign actions make some countries uneasy about holding U.S. assets. Silver, he said, tends to follow gold. Get seen where it counts.

Price dropped fast after earnings and erased the recent bounce that pushed shares back toward the 200 day moving average.Traders see that line as a basic health check.Above it, stocks usually breathe easy. Testing it raises stress. Below it, things often get ugly. Right now, the stock is stuck in that danger zone with little room for error. Ahead of earnings, Microsoft had already done the hard part by climbing back to the 200 day level. That rally did not come out of nowhere. Warnings were clear on the charts and in the data. A death cross showed up two weeks earlier. That signal comes late, but it usually confirms a change in direction.Price also printed a clean double top and a rounding top. Those patterns pointed to exhaustion. The bounce into the moving average was a relief run, not a fresh breakout, and it lined the stock up for the drop that followed. Shares fall through $450 and stall near a key support band The selloff started with a gap below the first support around $450. From there, price slid straight into the $423 to $425 area. That zone matters for several reasons. It lines up with the upside gap and prior low from the April 30 earnings reaction. This is the first time price has come back to that level, which makes it a clean test. Buyers often show up on a first retest, especially when the drop shakes out weak positions. The same price area also matches a key Fibonacci retracement. Traders use those levels to spot pauses during pullbacks. For now, the level is holding. The selling pressure was heavy, but it already cleared out a lot of short term risk. Many traders are watching this area for a short leash trade. If the level holds, price could rebound toward $450. If it breaks, the chart opens the door to a fast slide under $400. Stops stay tight here. If price breaks and later gets back above $425, momentum traders usually step back in. Analyst tone is also shifting. Downgrades are expected over the next few days. Even so, 71 analysts still rate the stock a buy, and the average target sits at $611, which is about 43 percent above current prices. Zooming out changes the view but not the risk. On a five year weekly chart, Microsoft is testing a level that sits right inside the longer term uptrend. Fibonacci levels on that time frame line up with the peak to trough run from the 2022 lows to the recent highs. Holding this area keeps that trend alive. Losing it puts the next major level just below $400 back on the table. For long term holders, this is the cleanest risk setup the stock has offered in years. Some investors are adding small amounts here and leaving room to add more if price dips lower. The RSI is moving closer to oversold territory. In past cycles, that zone has lined up with longer term opportunities for Microsoft, especially after fast drops like this one. Earnings also kept the AI theme front and center. CEO Satya Nadella said the company is still in the early stages of adoption. “We are pushing the frontier across our entire AI stack to drive new value for our customers and partners,” Satya said.

He spoke during a media stop in Taipei, where he confirmed that Nvidia will be part of the upcoming round, which is still being finalized. “We will invest a great deal of money,” Jensen said. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.” But when asked how much, he dodged. “Let Sam announce how much he’s going to raise — it’s for him to decide,” he said, referring to Sam Altman, who is still working to close the round. “But we will definitely participate in the next round of financing because it’s such a good investment.” Nvidia cuts back from $100B OpenAI pledge after internal doubts Back in September, Nvidia said it might invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a massive infrastructure expansion plan. The idea was to support new AI data centers with power capacity of at least 10 gigawatts, the same electricity usage as all of New York City during peak demand, using Nvidia’s most advanced chips. But inside the company, doubts started building. Some execs didn’t like the size of the number. Jensen had called the $100 billion letter of intent nonbinding, and said OpenAI lacked business discipline. He also raised flags about competition in the space. That $100 billion is now off the table. Asked directly in Taipei whether he was unhappy with OpenAI, Jensen said, “That’s nonsense.” But he still confirmed that the new investment won’t come anywhere near the earlier amount. While OpenAI is a major buyer of Nvidia chips, the relationship is drawing questions. Investors have been worried that these kinds of setups, where big tech firms fund companies that also buy from them, could be propping up artificial demand. This isn’t Nvidia’s first time doing this either. The company just announced another $2 billion investment into CoreWeave, a cloud firm that also buys a lot of Nvidia hardware. Jensen defends Nvidia support for DeepSeek after US lawmaker complaint During the same trip, Jensen addressed a separate controversy. John Moolenaar, the top Republican on the House China committee, sent a letter accusing Nvidia of helping DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm, reach top performance with its R1 model. That model rattled markets after it launched last year, causing the Nasdaq 100 to fall 3% in a single day. Reporters asked about it. Jensen responded , “Whenever developers want to use our software, we openly support everyone. Every AI developer in the world works with Nvidia. And so I’m very proud of that.” DeepSeek’s R1 model was built with limited resources but still hit strong performance, raising more concerns about global AI race dynamics and access to US technology. The company’s fast rise spooked investors because it showed how much performance could be squeezed out even without top-end infrastructure. As for OpenAI’s ongoing raise, Sam has reportedly been meeting with investors from the Middle East to bring in more capital. The round may value OpenAI between $750 billion and $830 billion.

Back in November 2024, right after Donald Trump won the election, Kevin flew to Mar-a-Lago thinking he was being interviewed for Treasury Secretary. But Trump had other plans. “You’re my Fed chair,” Trump told him. For over a year, Kevin repeated that to everyone. And he was right. It took 14 months, one bitter fight inside the White House, and a criminal case against Jerome Powell, but by January 2026, Trump finally said it out loud. He picked Kevin to lead the Federal Reserve. How Kevin outplayed Hassett with Wall Street help The biggest obstacle in Kevin’s way was Kevin Hassett, Trump’s economic adviser. By late 2025, Hassett was convinced he had the job. Trump told his cabinet he’d made his pick. All other interviews were suddenly canceled. While Kevin was on vacation in the Bahamas, Trump was spending the holidays with Hassett in Florida. At that point, everyone assumed it was Hassett. Trump even hinted to reporters, “I know who I’m going to pick,” then just grinned. Inside the West Wing, officials started ignoring Kevin. One senior official said he was finished and mocked him like a man clinging to a sinking boat. The reason? Trump thought Kevin looked desperate. But Kevin had something Hassett didn’t; powerful friends. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he liked Kevin for the job. Stanley Druckenmiller made calls on his behalf. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was tight with Druckenmiller too. Ronald Lauder, Kevin’s father-in-law, is a Republican megadonor and close to Trump. That crew didn’t sit quiet. They got on the phone and told Trump’s team: Hassett was too close to Trump to be seen as independent by the markets. It was risky. Dimon had beef with Trump. Druckenmiller said he wouldn’t vote for either Trump or Kamala Harris in 2024. Still, their pitch landed. Hassett’s Wall Street credibility came under fire. He also said he might not even stay the full four years. People started wondering how badly he even wanted the job. Hassett said he was happy where he was. “This is my dream job,” he told reporters. Trump wanted a rate cutter, and Kevin said yes On December 10, just hours after the Fed cut rates by 0.25%, Kevin met with Trump. Trump had long regretted choosing Powell. He was looking for someone who’d work with him, not push back. He asked Kevin straight up if he would support more cuts. Kevin said yes. Trump told the Journal, “I asked him what he thinks. He thinks you have to lower interest rates.” During the holidays, Trump told aides he liked Kevin’s sharpness and how he looked. It was a change from 2017, when he’d passed on Kevin for looking too young and chose Powell instead. Back then, Powell was seen as more open to easy-money policies. Kevin was the hawk. He later told NYU professor Simon Bowmaker, “I did not put my ambitions ahead of my principles.” After the first term soured, Trump’s team asked Kevin if he’d replace Powell. He refused. “The position was not open,” he told Bowmaker. But in Trump’s second term, talks restarted. Trump even considered firing Powell. Again, Kevin said not yet. Then on January 11, Powell went public. He announced the DOJ was investigating him for lying to Congress. That set off chaos. Republicans like Senator Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski said they’d block any nominee until the case was over. The scandal crushed Hassett’s chances. He had spent months on TV trashing Powell. Now his loyalty looked dangerous. On January 16, Trump humiliated him in public. At a White House event, Trump said, “I actually want to keep you where you are,” with Hassett sitting in the front row. Kevin, on the other hand, had stayed quiet. He gave a few speeches last year, then disappeared from TV. Other finalists? They never had a shot. Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s meeting with Trump lasted 30 minutes. Trump was two and a half hours late. Rick Rieder’s meeting was longer, but he pitched a complex rate idea; 3% fed-funds, 4% on the 10-year Treasury, 5% mortgages. He’d also donated to Democrats and Nikki Haley. That didn’t help. Scott started the process last summer. He interviewed 11 people. He didn’t want to be blamed for the choice like Steven Mnuchin was back in 2017 when Powell was picked. He told friends Trump was making the call himself. The delay made some officials think the search might expand. On Monday before the announcement, Judy Shelton (known for backing Trump’s Fed views) met Scott. That added speculation. But the Fed held rates steady Wednesday, and Powell hinted they may not cut again soon. That night, Trump met Kevin one more time. The next morning at 6:48 a.m., he made it official. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time,” Trump wrote online, “and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Over the past 24 hours, the token had declined by 10.65% to a price of around $1.58 . This decline in price highlights broader ongoing difficulties for the asset, as it continues to mirror the negative performance from the previous year, recording a 43.39% decline in the past 12 months alone. Despite the price fluctuations, derivatives data suggest that many traders remain optimistic. Long-to-short ratios across several exchanges continue to favor bullish positioning, especially on Binance and OKX, where long positions are more than shorts by over 2.5 to one. Regardless, XRP’s price has yet to overcome key resistance areas, keeping market participants cautious as they weigh the likelihood of a rebound against the risk of additional downside.

Both would indicate that buying momentum is starting to outweigh selling pressure. On the commentary side, according to the chart posted on X by Amonyx, XRP is trading within a descending triangle, with a downward-sloping trendline forming resistance and support holding near the lower boundary. This consolidation zone suggests the token is being contained between these levels, preventing a decisive breakout in either direction. A move above the trendline could indicate the beginning of upward momentum, while a break below support might trigger increased selling pressure. Potential Price if Support Holds Amonyx believes that if the support holds, XRP’s price could increase. For this to happen, the price will have to break above the descending trendline. If all goes as expected, the token’s price could potentially rise above $4.60. XRP continues to experience downward pressure, but a break above the descending trendline could trigger a price surge above $4. Monitoring these levels will be critical for understanding the next phase of XRP’s price action. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With selling pressure still intact, traders are now watching key levels closely to see if a final flush toward lower support is imminent. Price Faces Another Rejection MakroVision Research shared on X that Bitcoin has once again met strong rejection, resulting in a decisive break below several key support levels. Price has now slipped back into the range of the previous low and continues to trade beneath the critical green resistance zone between $85,200 and $86,200, highlighting that bearish pressure remains in control for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns On the very short-term timeframe, there are early signs of an attempted rebound, but without a timely and sustainable reclaim of the $85,200–$86,200 zone, this move is best viewed as a technical counter-bounce rather than the start of a meaningful trend reversal. As long as the price remains capped below this area, the broader short-term downtrend remains intact. From a tactical perspective, the $85,200–$86,200 region has become the key battlefield. A clean reclaim and hold above this zone would be the first clear indication that selling pressure is beginning to fade, potentially allowing for price stabilization and a relief rally. If this reclaim attempt fails, the risk of continued downside acceleration increases. In that case, focus would turn to the $72,300–$75,300 range, a technically prominent support zone with historical significance. This zone may ultimately serve as a potential support and reversal region should the market experience another phase of capitulation. CME Gap Opens: What To Expect From Bitcoin This Weekend Crypto analyst MartyParty, in a recent Bitcoin Wyckoff Accumulation update, highlighted that a CME gap is opening, which is expected to be filled by Sunday evening. This sets the stage for potential short-term volatility, with traders closely watching key technical levels and liquidation activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Backs Off Resistance — Breakdown Or Brief Pause? Several scenarios are possible over the coming days. One possibility is the continued liquidation of remaining leveraged longs, with the lowest 25x Binance liquidation currently around $79,350, potentially completing the classic Wyckoff Spring pattern. Another scenario is a retest of secondary support at $81,800, which could act as a temporary floor for Bitcoin’s price action. If support at $81,800 holds, Bitcoin may trade sideways or attempt to push toward the primary support level, which has now turned into resistance at $84,800. The most probable scenario suggests a move up through $84,500 toward $86,463, followed by a retest of $84,500 on Sunday night as the CME gap is filled, completing the near-term Wyckoff accumulation setup.

57625755,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267566,1769902811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surpasses Monumental $79,000 Milestone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-surpasses-79000-milestone/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surpasses Monumental $79,000 Milestone In a significant market development observed globally on April 10, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) has convincingly broken through the $79,000 barrier, trading at $79,010.77 on the Binance USDT market. This pivotal movement marks a crucial psychological and technical level for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, reigniting discussions about its long-term trajectory and current market dynamics. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this ascent. Bitcoin Price Reaches New Heights According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the BTC price ascent above $79,000 represents a continuation of a bullish trend observed throughout the first quarter of 2025. This price point is particularly noteworthy as it sits comfortably above previous resistance levels that had capped gains for several weeks. Market depth charts from major exchanges show substantial buy-side liquidity supporting this move, indicating strong institutional and retail demand. Furthermore, trading volume has spiked by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average, underscoring the conviction behind this breakout. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced similar parabolic moves, often preceding periods of consolidation. For instance, the 2021 bull run saw BTC challenge its then-all-time high before a broader market correction. However, the current macroeconomic backdrop differs substantially, featuring wider institutional adoption and clearer regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions. This fundamental shift provides a potentially more stable foundation for price appreciation compared to previous cycles driven primarily by retail speculation. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market Surge The broader cryptocurrency market often moves in correlation with Bitcoin, and this event is no exception. Major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have also posted gains, though typically at a smaller percentage. This phenomenon, known as ‘Bitcoin dominance,’ highlights BTC’s role as the market bellwether. Several concurrent factors are contributing to the positive sentiment across digital asset markets. Institutional Inflows: Recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show increased activity from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, with net positive inflows recorded for 15 consecutive days. Macroeconomic Conditions: Shifting expectations regarding central bank interest rate policies have renewed interest in non-correlated and inflation-hedge assets. Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s hash rate, a measure of network security and miner commitment, remains near its all-time high, signaling robust underlying health. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in establishing clear digital asset legislation in major economies like the European Union and the United Kingdom has reduced market uncertainty. Market analysts point to the sustained buying pressure from long-term holders as a key differentiator in this cycle. Data from on-chain analytics firms indicates that the percentage of BTC supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains elevated, suggesting a ‘hodler’ mentality that reduces sell-side pressure. Expert Perspectives on the Milestone Financial experts and seasoned cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the technical and psychological importance of the $79,000 level. “This isn’t just another number on a chart,” notes a market strategist from a leading digital asset fund, citing publicly available research. “It represents a validation of the growing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. The sustained move above this key level could trigger algorithmic trading models and open the path toward testing previous all-time highs.” Risk management professionals, however, advise caution alongside optimism. Historical volatility data for Bitcoin remains high compared to traditional assets. They recommend that investors consider their risk tolerance and maintain a diversified portfolio. The volatility is often attributed to the market’s relative youth, evolving regulatory news, and large transactions by so-called ‘whale’ wallets, which can cause significant price slippage. The Road Ahead for Digital Assets The immediate technical outlook will depend on whether Bitcoin can consolidate above the $79,000 support zone. Resistance levels are now projected near the $82,000 and $85,000 marks, based on historical price action and Fibonacci extension levels. Meanwhile, the impact extends beyond pure price speculation. Payment processors and fintech companies are closely watching adoption metrics, as positive price action often correlates with increased usage of blockchain networks for transactions and smart contracts. Furthermore, this surge has tangible effects on the mining industry. With the price increase, mining profitability has improved, potentially leading to greater investment in energy-efficient mining technologies and a more decentralized network. This creates a positive feedback loop: a higher price supports network security, which in turn boosts investor confidence. The following table summarizes key comparative metrics before and after the $79,000 breakout: Metric Pre-Breakout (Avg. Previous Week) Post-Breakout (Current) Daily Trading Volume (Aggregate) $42 Billion $57 Billion BTC Dominance Index 52.5% 54.1% Fear & Greed Index Greed (68) Extreme Greed (78) Active Addresses (7d MA) 1.02 Million 1.15 Million Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $79,000 is a multifaceted event rooted in stronger institutional participation, improving fundamentals, and a shifting macro landscape. While the price milestone captures headlines, the underlying story is one of a maturing asset class gaining recognition. The Bitcoin price action serves as a critical indicator for the entire digital economy, influencing technology development, regulatory discussions, and investment strategies worldwide. Observers will now watch for sustained momentum and the market’s ability to build support at these elevated levels. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $79,010.77 mean for investors? It signifies a breakout above a major resistance level, which technical analysts view as bullish. For investors, it reflects increased market valuation but also heightened volatility, necessitating careful portfolio management. Q2: How does this BTC price compare to its all-time high? The current price is approaching its historical peak. Surpassing $79,000 places it within a critical range to challenge and potentially exceed the record high set in the previous market cycle. Q3: What are the main drivers behind this cryptocurrency market surge? Primary drivers include sustained institutional investment via ETFs, positive developments in global cryptocurrency regulation, strong Bitcoin network fundamentals, and macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets. Q4: Could the price fall back below $79,000 quickly? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are volatile. While the breakout is significant, prices can retest support levels. Market sentiment, macroeconomic news, or large sell orders can trigger short-term corrections. Q5: Does this price move affect other cryptocurrencies? Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader market. A strong BTC performance usually leads to increased capital flows into the overall crypto asset class, though individual altcoin performance varies based on their own project developments.

RLUSD currently circulates across both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, with a total market capitalization of approximately $1.45 billion. Most of this supply, over $1.11 billion, is on Ethereum, while roughly $337 million exists on the XRPL. The difference in distribution has led some observers to question whether Ripple prioritizes Ethereum over its own blockchain. These concerns were emphasized after Binance enabled RLUSD trading solely on Ethereum, though the exchange has confirmed that XRPL support is forthcoming. Nope. We have nothing to apologize for, it’s because I know there is a lot of noise out there. I want to give clarity to our strategy. It’s easy to see a post or a video and think, 'Wait, is that what they’re doing?' But third-party opinions do not reflect how our team think. — LJ (@luke_judges) January 29, 2026 Ripple’s Position on XRPL Luke Judges, Ripple’s Global Partner Success Lead, addressed these concerns in a statement on X. He clarified that XRPL remains a priority in all RLUSD exchange integrations. According to Judges, the faster rollout on Ethereum is a matter of technical readiness and existing exchange infrastructure, not a sign of reduced focus on XRPL. He emphasized that every exchange onboarding RLUSD either already supports XRPL or has formally committed to doing so. Judges stressed that misinformation had contributed to the misperceptions about the company’s strategy. Ripple intentionally designed RLUSD as a multi-chain asset to enhance liquidity and adoption across diverse blockchain networks. By launching on both Ethereum and XRPL, the company aims to provide broader access for institutional investors and everyday traders alike. Judges reiterated that the multi-chain approach does not diminish the importance of XRPL, but rather complements it by reaching more users efficiently while the XRPL infrastructure is fully prepared. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Not Shifting Focus The discussion over RLUSD follows broader rumors suggesting that Ripple may be shifting focus from XRP and the XRPL in favor of other initiatives. Ripple executives have consistently debunked such narratives. Last October, CEO Brad Garlinghouse reaffirmed that XRP remains integral to the company’s operations, while President Monica Long is scheduled to highlight XRP’s central role at this year’s XRP Community Day. Judges also noted that his comments were aimed at correcting the public misunderstandings, not to apologize for any perceived misstep. While Ethereum currently dominates RLUSD circulation, Ripple’s roadmap ensures that XRPL adoption continues to grow. By restating its commitment to XRPL, combined with a multi-chain deployment strategy, Ripple aims to balance technical readiness with long-term adoption goals, positioning the XRP Ledger as a vital component of its stablecoin ecosystem.

Reports say the ruling does not resolve guilt or innocence. It simply lets the case continue in court. Court Lets Case Move Forward According to filings and press reports, the suit — brought by a shareholder in 2023 — accuses CEO Brian Armstrong and board member Marc Andreessen, among others, of selling large blocks of Coinbase stock around the company’s 2021 direct listing. The complaint alleges those sales totaled close to $3 billion and that the insiders avoided more than $1 billion in losses by acting before negative information reached the market. The judge’s decision to deny a motion to dismiss rests less on the precise dollar numbers and more on questions about process. Reports note that a special litigation committee within Coinbase had already looked into the claims and cleared the directors. But the court flagged concerns over whether that committee was truly independent. Big Names, Big Stakes Many headlines have highlighted Andreessen’s name because of his profile and past business links. That attention isn’t just about personalities. Reports say the chief issue for the court was whether the committee’s ties—direct or indirect—might have skewed its review, making the committee’s blessing less persuasive as a legal shield. Coinbase has pushed back. The company and some defendants argue the sales were legitimate, part of normal liquidity and market mechanics tied to the direct listing, not secret profit-taking based on hidden problems. Those defenses were noted in the filings the judge considered. Still, the lawsuit will now proceed through discovery and other pretrial steps. Questions About Committee Independence Legal observers say this case highlights a recurring issue in corporate suits: when an internal review finds no wrongdoing, courts will still test how, and by whom, that review was done. If the review looks biased, the court may allow a suit to survive early challenges so the facts can be tested under oath.

However, holders may finally have something concrete to anticipate. Refreshing activity from Shytoshi Kusama, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead developer, has diverted attention to a key moment expected on Sunday. Lead Dev Breaks Silence, Teases Sunday That dynamic began to change when Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer and co-founder of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, resurfaced on X after a prolonged absence since early December. However, Kusama broke his silence this week with a thread on X explaining the reasons behind his inactivity and has since returned to regular posting and reposting activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction One post stood out more than the rest, in which Kusama hinted at a revelation scheduled for Sunday. In that message, he spoke about arriving at a discovery by pure chance and referenced what he described as an ancient marker older than time itself. Although the message was a bit cryptic, it immediately generated attention across the SHIB community, which has been hungry for direction and clarity amid recent challenges in Shiba Inu’s price action. The significance of Sunday became clearer following an interesting exchange between Kusama and a Shiba Inu community member who openly expressed concerns about transparency, reassurance, and leadership presence after recent ecosystem issues. The community member, known as RuggRat on X, noted how there has been no official statement or simple explanation of what happened from Kusama regarding the Shibarium exploit. This is in reference to the September 2025 Shibarim Bridge exploit, which saw attackers making off with $4.1 million worth of crypto assets. In response, Kusama acknowledged the concern, stating that silence can sometimes be strategic and framing Sunday as a moment for addressing issues step by step. “This is what Sunday is for. One at a time,” Kusama said. Fair. But sometimes silence is a weapon for quiet wars. This is what Sunday is for. One bandage. Take off. Fix. Put on. One at a time. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 29, 2026 Shiba Inu’s Challenging Phase Has Tested Holder Confidence Shiba Inu’s price action has struggled to gain any meaningful upside traction since the beginning of 2026, an extension of its late 2025 run. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.0000071, keeping it pinned down by 1.8% and 10.5% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Price structure during this period has been marked by a series of lower lows, with persistent selling pressure leaving little room for a meaningful higher high to form.

The trader has since suffered heavy losses after taking a large long position. The development came to light after blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence revealed that the whale had emptied its entire ETH treasury into Hyperliquid, resulting in estimated losses of around $250 million. The hyperunit whale’s loss incident sparks concerns in the crypto industry Concerning the hyperunit whale’s trending news, recent reports from reliable sources reveal that the Hyperliquid account has been reduced to just $53, wiping out months of profits. This loss was initially observed after the price of Ether drastically declined this week. Ethereum remains structurally bearish , with the price reacting to demand but lacking confirmation of a meaningful trend shift. The interaction between this demand zone, nearby supply levels, and persistent sell-side pressure will be critical in determining whether Ethereum stabilizes or continues lower in the coming sessions. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,418.31, down about 10.31% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Following this finding, on-chain analysts issued a warning alleging that the whale was moving into a more risky position at a time when the price of ETH declined across this month. They made this statement after recently released reports illustrated more than $130 million in unrealized losses. Initially, the trader drew attention in October of last year when on-chain analyst Eye connected wallet activity to Garrett Jin, the co-founder of WaveLabs and GroupFi, who previously served as the co-founder and vice president of BitForex. Notably, this move was made possible through the use of ENS domains “ereignis.eth” and “garrettjin.eth.” Seeing the situation grow intense, GroupFi’s co-founder refused to acknowledge ownership of the funds, claiming he was aware of the person responsible for the trades. To further clarify on this point, Jin argued that, “the fund isn’t mine – it’s my clients’.” Several crypto investors raise concerns about the Hyperunit whale’s move Earlier in October last year, the whale established short positions totaling more than $1 billion, specifically in BTC and ether. This scenario occurred just before Trump announced 100% tariffs on imports from China. The timing fueled speculation regarding potential insider knowledge, but no evidence of misconduct has emerged. Afterwards, a significant market crash occurred, resulting in more than $18 billion in liquidations across the crypto industry. Immediately after this substantial gain, the trader adopted long positions. Following this decision, data from Arkham published in mid-January demonstrated that the whale established a long position on Ethereum worth more than $730 million. At the same time, the total investments in ETH, SOL, and BTC exceeded $900 million. Nonetheless, the crypto market saw sharp price declines this week, prompting the Hyperunit whale to sell all their holdings. Following this decision, the whale was left with only $53 in their Hyperliquid account, even though data from Arkham showed that the account holds $2.7 billion in other cryptocurrencies. In the meantime, amid this significant loss in the crypto market, several crypto investors have raised concerns about the risks of leveraged trading, even among market experts.

The previous decade has seen the leaders in the industry manage to hold on to their momentum, but a new generation of capital is pouring in to make specialized utility protocols. On-chain data indicate a mass rotation of large-scale investor portfolios. They are abandoning old-school coins which have reached a limit and are shifting to new platforms with new technology and definite space to develop. This trend indicates that the forward cycle will not be hyped but functional decentralized finance systems. The old guard is undergoing structural challenges hence a new breed of protocols is poised to assume the lead. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is trading at an approximation of $0.32 with a market capitalization of about $12 billion. However, its price action has not been set on fire since the network has always worked on academic research and the consistent growth. ADA is also meeting a stiff resistance band between $0.35 and $0.40. The future remains bleak to many analysts in regard to ADA in 2026. Forecasts of the price indicate that it may fail to remain above $0.20 end-year. This is mostly because of the slow rate of ecosystem development in comparison to fast-paced ones. With newer networks being able to transact faster and provide more liquid DeFi instruments, Cardano is losing its share of active developers as well as total value locked. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin (BNB) is being traded close to $850 in a large market value of $118 billion. The token is in a state of consolidation despite its good history. It is fiercely resisted at the $880-$ \910 levels. Bearish trends are coming out in the short term as the 50-day moving average starts to decline. Analysts are making low price forecasts in 2026, and some project that prices would decline to the lower 650-700 range. The rationale of such a decline is two-fold. One, the network is subjected to constant regulatory reviews in various areas that restrict institutional inflows. Second, the market cap is so large that it is hard to provide BNB with the explosive gains as cheaper cryptocurrencies may offer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike the case of ADA and BNB, the interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging at an all-time high. The project is undergoing the presale phase and has already amassed above $20.1 million from more than 19,000 investors. Mutuum Finance is working on an advanced lending and borrowing protocol that is based on the Ethereum network. The protocol’s design operates a two-market mechanism that serves every category of a user. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model: with the use of the key assets such as ETH or USDT, one is able to borrow within seconds and deposit the assets back into the liquidity pool. The P2P (Peer-to-peer) market will allow direct loan agreements between users in case of more specific tokens. Such flexibility is precisely what the modern users of DeFi seek. V1 Launch and Revenue-Based Tokenomics This momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catalyzed by the recent activation of the V1 protocol . This pilot implementation enables users to test the mtToken system, where the lenders will be given yield-bearing receipts which will increase in value over time. The platform makes use of high-performance oracles to monitor prices and do liquidation equitably to be accurate. These solid fundamentals have led analysts to estimate the project could increase by 500% from its initial stages as the project heads to its official price of $0.06. The project has already passed a complete security audit with Halborn Security and this gives whales confidence to transfer large sums of capital into the protocol. Roadmap Expansion Mutuum Finance is not only limiting itself to borrowing and lending. It plans to move to Layer-2 networks and an over-collateralized stablecoin native to the roadmap. These measures are essential since they will reduce the cost of transacting and give the users a stable means through which they can work on their debt. The development of its own ecosystem of stable value and fast scaling are placing Mutuum Finance in an advantageous position in the cheap cryptocurrency arena. The final period of presale at $0.04 which is selling like hotcakes is Phase 7, and the time to join the entire repricing is rapidly ending.

Sustained trading above $2 may trigger a breakout, setting the stage for the next significant leg higher. SUI Reaches Stage For Major Money Entry Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent post, highlighted that SUI is at the same stage where big money typically enters the market, urging traders not to miss this opportunity. According to the weekly chart, the long-term ascending channel remains intact, and price is currently trading near a sell-side liquidity grab close to trendline support, signaling potential accumulation. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target? The chart also shows strong weekly demand and a bullish order block between $1.15 and $0.80, indicating that the market structure is poised to turn super bullish if SUI clears higher-timeframe resistance. The current compression phase is a classic setup for expansion, meaning the market is preparing for a potential breakout. Crypto Patel emphasized that smart money tends to buy during compression, while retail often enters after confirmation of the move. If the breakout confirms, projected targets for SUI are $5, $10, and $20, illustrating the potential scale of the next trend. As Crypto Patel puts it, “This is how big trends are built, slowly, then suddenly. Liquidity is cleared, demand is active, and patience gets rewarded.” Price Trading Around $1.28 Altcoinpedia outlined that SUI is currently trading around $1.28, which serves as the anchor for near-term market analysis. The price structure indicates ongoing consolidation above support near $1.50, while resistance is observed around $2.00. This setup reflects a tightening range as buyers and sellers balance, suggesting that a decisive move could be approaching. Related Reading: Sui Restores Service After Major 6-Hour Outage Shook Network Price oscillation within this range highlights that sustained volume expansion above $2.00 could drive the next leg of the trend toward $2.50. Conversely, failure to break this resistance, particularly with shrinking volume, increases the likelihood of a retest of support at $1.50. Should that level fail to hold, price could decline further toward $1.20. Momentum currently resides in a neutral state, reflecting indecision in the market. In a bullish scenario, a clean break above $2.00, confirmed by momentum indicators, would signal trend continuation. On the downside, a breach of support under heavy volume could accelerate selling pressure and confirm a bearish scenario. Traders are advised to use key range boundaries for entries and exits, managing risk around both support and resistance levels. For longer-term investors, it is prudent to wait for a decisive breakout from the current consolidation, which would provide a clearer signal for trend direction and reduce the risk of false moves within the neutral range.

The end of the nine-year ban of corporate crypto investment was announced on January 11 but excitement was short lived as industry players expressed disappointment in the allocation limit. South Korean corporate crypto adviser Rich O told Cryptopolitan that while the move is seen as an improvement, he believes the cap would restrict corporate participation. He said a 5% cap is impractical since price volatility and integrated cash and crypto accounting could push firms, unintentionally, over the limit. “If the price of bitcoin rises significantly, compliance with the limit could force a sale. It’s not a very good rule, given that the defining characteristic of crypto is its volatility and constant price fluctuation.” Rich O suspects authorities are fearful of publicly listed companies adopting a similar crypto playbook to MicroStrategy, which was rebranded to Strategy in 2025. The company has the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with a reported 650,000 bitcoins. He anticipates the government will increase the cap over the coming years. Crypto for corporate survival Iris (Sungyoun) Park, is co-founder of South Korean web3 consultancy firm DELV and an attorney specializing in crypto. She told Cryptopolitan that there is tremendous corporate interest in diversifying portfolios with digital assets. “Diversification is absolutely vital for the survival of companies these days. South Korea is experiencing ongoing disparities in the value of assets which you can see with house prices and gold skyrocketing while the price of bitcoin is not.” She said a lot of companies in Korea are not only interested in holding crypto but also holding stablecoins for settling international trade. “There is a common understanding that crypto is a way to keep up to date with global business.” But Park doesn’t necessarily agree that authorities are in a rush to increase the equity cap as the country is moving to establish spot bitcoin ETF trading as part of its economic growth strategy. Crypto infrastructure as a public good K orean authorities are cautiously integrating crypto into the financial system. However, there are concerns of a growing asymmetry over ownership of crypto infrastructure. The government’s controversial plan to limit major shareholders’ stakes in crypto exchanges to between 15 to 20%. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) have said a cap would help avoid conflicts of interest. FSC Chairman Eog Weon Lee explained that crypto exchanges have become a form of public infrastructure and the cap is needed to align governance standards on crypto exchanges in light of the public role they play. “As crypto exchanges are now officially recognised as part of the financial system, we must create a governance structure that befits their status,” stressed Lee at a press conference on January 28. Stablecoin turf war Rich O stressed the move is not concerned with user protection but rather control over the future distribution of KRW stablecoins. “Government agencies don’t want only a few crypto exchanges, such as Upbit and Bithumb, to have major control over the distribution of upcoming KRW stablecoins.” He said the policy is an attempt to weaken the influence of major shareholders. “They want to diversify ownership by breaking it into smaller shareholders, making crypto exchanges easier to negotiate with or control,” said Rich O. The proposal could force the co-founder of Dunamu and operator of Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Chi Hyung Song, to sell a 10% stake of his existing 25% ownership of Dunamu which equates to some 3 trillion KRW. The ownership cap could also thwart South Korean internet giant Naver’s plans to acquire Dunamu which would see it take control of 100% of Dunamu’s shares. Ownership limits defy global norms The shareholder cap has attracted fierce criticism from the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), which represents South Korea’s five largest cryptocurrency exchanges. They said the restriction would hinder the growth of the industry. At Korea’s National Assembly, a group of scholars argued against the cap, describing it as “excessive” and globally unprecedented. Professor Yoon Kyung Kim from Incheon National University said a diverse ownership base typically emerges as companies grow and raise capital, rather than being imposed at the outset. Innovation is at stake She said artificially ordering shareholder equity restrictions could increase management uncertainty, delay large investment decisions, and ultimately weaken national competitiveness and Korea’s fintech innovation ecosystem. Professor Cheol Woo Moon from Sungkyunkwan University added that forcing shareholders to sell equity could amount to an infringement of the rights of private entrepreneurs and could face legal disputes and constitutional appeals.

After this assertion was made public, analysts warned that the risk of inflation in the euro zone could push the rate further below the target level. Responding to this warning, officials gathered in Frankfurt, the central bank’s seat, raised concerns about this discovery. Despite interest rates remaining unchanged since June and no immediate adjustments expected, officials noted that several important issues still demand their attention. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the Federal Reserve, US President Donald Trump’s threats of new tariffs, and the recent decline of the dollar have all drawn scrutiny since the ECB last set rates on December 18 . ECB officials raise concerns about the fate of the dollar Earlier, Trump said the matter of the dollar’s status does not bother him. His remarks substantially contributed to the US currency’s recent major drop, driving the euro up to around $1.20 for a brief time and setting a new all-time high since 2021. Following this finding, officials from the ECB raised concerns that the change could spark mixed reactions among individuals. At this moment, François Villeroy de Galhau, a crucial member of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, stressed that the euro will be a key determinant of their future monetary policy. On the other hand, Martin Kocher, who also serves on the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, said they will closely monitor the currency for continued upward movement. While the euro became a hot topic of discussion, analysts conducted research and discovered that inflation in the country declined below 2% in December. After several considerations, they forecast that this level will decline further, arguing that the January figures will be approximately 1.7% when the Consumer Price Index data are released on Wednesday, February 11. The European Central Bank also predicted that price growth will naturally hit its target without additional action. However, if the euro continues to surge, it may spark a new round of rate-cut discussions. “Europe has started the year with many geopolitical issues, and the ECB will likely keep its focus on bigger problems instead of smaller ones. This means they will probably overlook the recent US trade conflict involving Greenland, the slight drop in inflation below 2%, and the rising euro. However, these changes highlight that there are growing risks to the economic outlook,” analysts said. The central banks’ decision on interest rates plays a crucial role in the country’s economy Sources pointed out that the ECB is expected to publish quarterly surveys on bank lending and expert economic forecasts soon. Additionally, it is among the central banks scheduled to announce interest-rate decisions this week. Regarding the central bank’s decision on interest rates, reports noted a high likelihood that the UK, Mexico, and the Czech Republic would keep their current rates unchanged. At the same time, India and Poland would reduce theirs. On the other hand, sources pointed to a unique approach by the Reserve Bank of Australia, suggesting it could be the first major central bank to hike rates this year. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that this month’s job report results in the United States will be compared with the Federal Reserve’s view that the labor market is stabilizing following a period of sluggish hiring activity late last year.

The forfeiture was finalized in late January 2026, concluding years of litigation against Helix’s operator, Larry Dean Harmon. Helix’s Illegal Activity and Harmon’s Case Helix, which operated from 2014 to 2017, was marketed as a tumbling service designed to anonymize Bitcoin transactions. Investigators found that it had become a major hub for laundering funds connected to drug trafficking, hacking, and other illegal activities. Court filings show that Helix processed more than 354,468 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $300 million at the time, for its users. Harmon, who also created the darknet search engine Grams, made the platform to integrate directly with major darknet markets. Its Application Programming Interface (API) allowed them to connect the service to their Bitcoin withdrawal systems, earning them a percentage of each transaction as commission and fees. Investigators also traced tens of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds from several darknet markets through the mixing service. The Ohio-based operator of Helix was first charged in 2020 with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. In August 2021, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and was sentenced in November 2024 to 36 months in prison, three years of supervised release, a monetary forfeiture judgment, and seized assets. On January 21, 2026, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a final forfeiture order, officially transferring the assets to the government. Regulators Ease Crackdown on Crypto Mixers The Helix case is part of a broader regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency mixers and privacy tools. Platforms such as Tornado Cash have also faced sanctions and enforcement actions in recent years. While crypto advocates maintain that these services can offer legitimate privacy protections, authorities continue to focus on their potential use in criminal activity. In a related development, blockchain entrepreneur and Coin Center fellow Michael Lewellen filed a lawsuit last year challenging the DOJ, seeking a ruling that his non-custodial crypto crowdfunding platform, Pharos, does not violate money transmission laws. The legal action argues that software developers creating non-custodial privacy tools are being unfairly targeted. The Justice Department later announced it would no longer pursue criminal cases against crypto exchanges, developers, or users for regulatory violations. This development follows the disbanding of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), the specialized unit responsible for investigating crypto-related criminal activity.

It was trading at $78,678 on Sunday, down sharply from its all-time high of $126,300. Ethereum price crashed to $2,400, while Binance Coin (BNB) fell to $770. The market capitalization of all tokens dropped by over 5.80% in the last 24 hours to $2.67 trillion. This article explores some of the top reasons behind the ongoing crypto crash. Crypto market crash happened after Trump nominated Kevin Warsh One of the main reasons behind the ongoing crypto market crash is that Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to become the next Federal Reserve Chair when Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. Warsh has recently supported the crypto industry. However, his support was likely because he really wanted the Federal Reserve Chairman job as he has previously blasted the industry. The same is true with his views on interest rates. In his recent interviews, he has come out in support of lower interest rates. In reality, however, Warsh has always been an interest rate and inflation hawk. He voted against interest rate cuts and quantitative easing policies in 2011. Most importantly, he has always maintained his opposition to quantitative easing. Therefore, analysts believe that Warsh will maintain a hawkish view when he moves to the Federal Reserve just as Jerome Powell did. Soaring liquidations fuelled the crypto crash The other main reason for the crypto market crash is the soaring liquidations and falling futures open interest. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the futures open interest dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours to $113 billion. At the same time, liquidations jumped by 348% in the last 24 hours to over $2.5 billion, the biggest increase in months. Ethereum liquidations jumped to over $1.1 billion, while Bitcoin rose to over $785 million. Solana positions worth over $197 million, while XRP positions worth $61 million were liquidated. These liquidations brought memories of October 10 when the crypto market experienced the biggest liquidation on record. Positions worth over $20 billion were wiped out on October 10 when Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China. Rising geopolitical tensions The crypto market crash is happening because of the rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. Trump has threatened to attack Iran soon because of the recent protests in the country. An attack on Iran would be bearish for the crypto market because of the impact on the energy market. Data shows that Brent, the global benchmark, has jumped to $70 for the first time in months. The crypto market crash is also happening because Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset has been debunked. Instead, investors have moved to other safe-haven assets like the Swiss franc and gold, which have soared in the past few months. Bitcoin price technicals have contributed to the crash BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals have also contributed to the ongoing crypto crash. The weekly timeframe chart above shows that the coin formed a rising wedge pattern. It also formed a bearish flag pattern, and moved below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Supertrend indicator. This pattern often leads to more downside, which will lead to more downside for Bitcoin and the crypto market.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-exchange-outflows-jump-330-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has highlighted a notable development in XRP’s on-chain data, reporting a 330% surge in exchange outflows in early January 2026. In a recent post, the analyst stated that the scale of XRP being removed from exchanges indicates substantial buying activity taking place behind the scenes. The chart attached to the post shows repeated spikes in outflows, suggesting that large holders are actively moving XRP into private custody. The timing of this movement is particularly notable given the recent volatility in XRP’s price. During the same period, when exchange outflows accelerated, XRP declined from levels near $2.40 to the $1.75 range. Despite the pullback, the pace of XRP leaving exchanges remained elevated, pointing to accumulation rather than distribution. $XRP OUTFLOWS SURGED +330%. SOMEONE IS BUYING LOADS! pic.twitter.com/cYuhrq5O5m — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 30, 2026 Price Volatility Contrasts With Holder Behavior The data shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO shows a clear divergence between short-term price action and wallet behavior. While prices saw sharp swings and failed to sustain earlier highs, exchange balances continued to fall. This pattern suggests that buyers were using price weakness to build positions instead of reacting to near-term market moves. An X user, Big Stack Bull, commented on the post by noting that exchanges are becoming lighter while individual wallets are growing heavier. This observation aligns with historical on-chain trends, in which sustained outflows often coincide with consolidation phases rather than immediate price rallies. Institutional Custody and ETF Influence One factor contributing to the persistent exchange outflows is the continued growth of spot XRP exchange-traded funds. Since their launch in late 2025, these products have required XRP to be held in custodial storage rather than left on trading platforms. As a result, ETF inflows naturally reduce exchange balances even when the price remains under pressure. This shift toward custody-based holding changes how XRP circulates in the market. Assets held for ETF exposure are less likely to re-enter exchanges quickly, reducing the amount of XRP readily available for active trading. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Outflow Surge While a 330 percent increase in exchange outflows is significant, it represents a sharp percentage change rather than a transformation of XRP’s total circulating supply. XRP remains one of the most liquid digital assets, with daily trading volumes still exceeding individual outflow events. However, declining exchange balances can increase market sensitivity over time. The data highlighted by STEPH IS CRYPTO suggests that ownership dynamics are shifting. As XRP continues to move off exchanges and into long-term custody, short-term price behavior may become less reflective of underlying accumulation trends.

Drawing on personal recollection, Schwartz noted that when XRP traded at approximately $0.006, the idea of reaching $0.25 appeared implausible to many participants. He recalled that the milestone was treated almost humorously at the time, with community members holding a “$0.25 party” and openly joking about how unrealistic a $1 valuation seemed. Schwartz suggested that price targets that once appeared extreme can later become historical footnotes, reframing how current expectations may eventually be viewed. His remarks did not include a prediction or timeline, but rather emphasized perspective. By pointing to how sentiment shifted as XRP appreciated from fractions of a cent to materially higher levels, Schwartz implied that disbelief has been a recurring feature throughout the asset’s market history. When XRP was $0.006, a price of $0.25 felt about as ridiculous as $100 does today. We had a $0.25 party and joked about how impossible $1 seemed. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 30, 2026 Debate Over Market Conditions Then and Now Schwartz’s reflection prompted varied responses, focusing on whether past comparisons remain valid in the present environment. Les Purves challenged the implied parallel, arguing that XRP’s earlier price increases occurred when the digital asset market was still emerging, and adoption was in its early stages. According to Purves, today’s market is shaped by deeper liquidity, clearer regulatory frameworks, increased competition, and a much larger overall scale. He maintained that these differences make direct comparisons between early price milestones and recent expectations inappropriate. This perspective reframed Schwartz’s historical account as informative but not necessarily predictive, highlighting that structural changes in the market may limit the rate at which past behavior can be used to assess future outcomes. Interpretations of Utility and Repricing Another response, from a commenter identified as Lea, focused on the underlying implication of Schwartz’s remarks rather than the numerical comparison itself. Lea interpreted the post as suggesting that XRP’s long-term repricing would not only be driven by belief or sentiment. Instead, she argued that meaningful price adjustment would occur only if the financial system reached a point at which it could not function without the asset. In her view, the market is currently operating as intended, and any eventual repricing would be abrupt rather than gradual once such dependency is established. This interpretation framed Schwartz’s comments as a broader observation about utility-driven valuation rather than market optimism. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Criticism From Early Supporters Not all reactions were supportive. Crypto Bitlord offered a sharply critical response, asserting that many holders genuinely believed in XRP during its early years. He stated that hearing skepticism from individuals involved in building the technology was troubling. He suggested that this disbelief explained why large amounts of XRP were sold as prices rose from around $0.10 to above $3. According to Crypto Bitlord, these sales occurred at the expense of long-term holders who maintained confidence in the asset. Together, the comments illustrate how a brief historical reflection from Schwartz reopened longstanding disagreements over belief, utility, and responsibility, underscoring how XRP’s past continues to shape interpretations of its future.
