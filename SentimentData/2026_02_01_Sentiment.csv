The project has raised $925,384 so far thanks to its presale and pre-launch phases, with the latter beginning on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) recovered some ground after plunging to $81,000 on Friday and reclaimed the $83,000 mark. The steady recovery has seen the flagship cryptocurrency move to $98,901, up over 1% in the past 24 hours. However, precious metals crashed as their rally lost steam, with gold down over 10% and Silver dropping more than 30%. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Moves To $0.00026031 Husky Inu AI (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00025539 to $0.00025636. The project’s much-talked-about pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $83,000 As Gold, Silver Lose Steam Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) steadied itself after crashing to a nine-month low and reclaimed the $83,000 mark, moving to its current level of $83,890. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% in the past 24 hours. The 10% correction, spread over Wednesday and Thursday, saw BTC come dangerously close to slipping below the $80,000 mark. The correction was the result of overly cautious traders following significant ETF outflows, rising geopolitical tensions, and market uncertainty. Besides geopolitical and market factors, the threat from quantum computers has added to investor anxiety. Coinbase recently announced an independent advisory board to evaluate the risks associated with quantum computing, with plans to publish its study by 2027. The quantum threat discussion intensified after Jeffries removed Bitcoin from its flagship portfolio, citing long-term security concerns. However, Blockstream co-founder Adam Beck dismissed concerns about an immediate quantum risk. A Feeble Recovery The cryptocurrency market also recovered after two days of intense downward pressure, registering a marginal 0.45% increase to $2.83 trillion. Trading was mixed as Ethereum (ETH) continued trading in bearish territory. The altcoin slipped below the $2,700 mark and is down 1.50% to $2,692. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 1% at $1.73, while Solana (SOL) made a strong recovery and moved to $118. Dogecoin (DOGE) is marginally up over the past 24 hours, but Cardano (ADA) is down over 3%, trading around $0.314. Chainlink (LINK) is down 1% while Stellar (XLM) is also down over 1%, trading around $0.190. Hedera (HBAR) and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in the red, but Litecoin (LTC) and Toncoin (TON) registered notable declines over the past 24 hours.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.1632 Price Change 24h -3.37% Market Cap $1.38B Circulating Supply 8.64B PI Trading Volume 24h $20.64M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.1632 Price Prediction $ 0.1363 (-25.05%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 2.62% (Medium) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2097 200-Day SMA $0.3032 14-Day RSI 24.88 (Oversold) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown : As of today, Pi has dropped to $0.1632 after breaking under the $0.17 zone. The end of January daily chart demonstrates a further bearish structure. RSI is over sold, and the MACD is negative and has no reversal signal. As of January 31, 2026, Pi Network fell once again, having not been able to maintain above the $0.17 zone. Traders kept focus on downside risk after a late selloff that pushed Pi toward fresh lows. Pi is trading near $0.1632, with 24-hour volume rising to $20.64M, suggesting active distribution during the drop. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis On the daily timeframe, Pi opened around $0.1689 and sold down into the session. Price reversed to lower after posting a high of $0.1751 and later Pi dropped to a low of about $0.1590, where it ended to a close of $0.1632, which is 3.37% fall. The candle structure shows continued lower highs and weak demand. The $0.17 level now acts as short-term resistance after the breakdown. Bulls will need a clean reclaim above $0.17 to reduce pressure. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The daily RSI (14) is at 24.88, keeping Pi in oversold territory. The RSI sat close to its average near 24.35, which showed weak bounce strength. As per Traders, usually this setup is seen as an exhaustion risk, not a reversal signal.MACD remained negative with the MACD line at -0.0109 while the signal line is at -0.0089. The histogram stayed below zero at-0.0020, which kept bearish momentum intact. Support now is between $0.160 and $0.159. A break below that zone can expose the next downside test quickly. Resistance stands at $0.167 and $0.170, then higher at $0.175 from today’s peak. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi has remained under pressure as the price could not maintain recent rebound levels. Pi started trading at approximately $0.1626, reached a high of $0.1643, and then fell to $0.1608. On the 4-hour chart pi closed at $0.1612. The structure reflects a rejection following the recent move towards the $0.17 and $0.175 region, and then resumed selling that restored price to the $0.16 handle. Momentum indicators remained weak but not stretched as the daily chart. The RSI (14) is currently at 36.49, sitting below its average of 39.83. This signals fading recovery strength after the bounce. The MACD stayed near the zero line but remained soft, with the MACD line around -0.0020 and the signal line near -0.0021, while the histogram moved slightly positive near 0.0001, pointing to slowing downside momentum without a clear bullish shift. Immediate support is forming at $0.1608 and $0.1610, matching the session low zone. A breakdown below this area can open the next downside test quickly. On the upside, near-term resistance sits at $0.164–$0.165, followed by the heavier supply region around $0.170 and $0.175, where sellers previously stepped back in. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1977 SELL SMA 5 $0.1995 SELL SMA 10 $0.2018 SELL SMA 21 $0.2058 SELL SMA 50 $0.2097 SELL SMA 100 $0.2196 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2062 SELL EMA 5 $0.2075 SELL EMA 10 $0.2077 SELL EMA 21 $0.2083 SELL EMA 50 $0.2160 SELL EMA 100 $0.2449 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to remain under pressure as long as price trades below the $0.165 and $0.17 resistance zone, with sellers still controlling short-term momentum. If the $0.160 support fails, the next downside test could occur near the $0.155 and $0.158 region, which is near the current all-time low. A recovery attempt would require a clean break and hold above $0.17, supported by rising volume, to signal any meaningful shift in trend. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is down today because ongoing token unlocks are increasing supply faster than demand, while the broader crypto market remains weak under “Fear” sentiment. Technicals also stay bearish, with PI trading below key moving averages and showing oversold RSI readings that reflect continued selling pressure. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth. On January 15, 2026, Pi traded around $0.205 and closed near $0.2046 after slipping from the $0.21 area, showing a controlled pullback with buyers still defending the low-$0.20 zone.

Santiment’s social-data read shows negative chatter spiking and the balance of bearish to bullish comments tilting heavily toward fear. That kind of panic has, at times, been followed by price rebounds in past cycles. What The Numbers Are Saying Right now the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits in “Extreme Fear,” with readings that fell into the teens this week. That scoring reflects widespread caution and a lot of people pulling back from risk. At the same time, Santiment’s metrics point to unusually negative sentiment on social platforms, which some analysts treat as a possible contrarian buy signal. Voices From Traders And Execs Not everyone is ready to call a bottom. Analyst Benjamin Cowen warned that a big shift of money from metals into crypto is not guaranteed in the short run, arguing that the expected rotation may not come. Company leaders are quieter but watchful. Coinbase’s chief business officer said the “signals are there if you’re paying attention,” pointing out that big legacy firms are still hiring for crypto-related roles. Bitcoin Price Action Appears Mixed Bitcoin has been swinging. It dropped back into the $82,000 level and has shown sharp moves tied to macro headlines and flows. Reports note a recent slide near $81,900 amid broader risk repricing, with traders shifting money around as geopolitics and markets change. At the same time, some traders see dips as buying chances. The nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair by US President Donald Trump was one such macro event that stirred markets and helped prompt short-term moves. How To Read This Moment Sentiment is a noisy signal. When fear runs high, downside often becomes limited for a spell. That said, a real, lasting rally usually needs more than sour social mood — it needs firmer liquidity, clearer macro direction, or steady flows from big investors. Still, Santiment highlighted that the current mood reading is among the rare positive signs for crypto. They added that one bright spot is the intense negativity on social media, where bearish comments far outnumber bullish ones. Santiment noted that crypto often moves against the crowd. When most investors expect prices to fall, it can create conditions for a potential rebound.

Total crypto liquidations exceeded $2 billion within 24 hours, marking one of the largest deleveraging events of the year. The majority of wiped positions were leveraged longs, caught offside as prices broke through key technical levels. The sudden unwind erased tens of billions of dollars from the total crypto market capitalization, which dropped more than 7% intraday before stabilizing. The rapid decline underscored how quickly sentiment can shift in a highly leveraged environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead the Liquidation Cascade Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the largest share of liquidations. Bitcoin saw roughly $700 million in positions wiped out as it slipped below short-term support, accelerating downside momentum. Ethereum followed with an estimated $300–$350 billionin liquidations after breaking under the $2,500 zone and sliding toward $2,400. The loss of this key level intensified long squeezes across derivatives platforms. Other major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, also experienced significant liquidations. In lower-liquidity tokens, volatility was amplified as cascading stop-loss orders triggered additional forced selling. What Triggered the January 31 Deleveraging Event Several factors combined to fuel the selloff. Technical breakdowns across major assets activated algorithmic trading systems and stop orders clustered below support zones. Elevated open interest in perpetual futures left the market vulnerable to a sharp long squeeze. As prices declined, margin calls forced traders to close positions, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of selling. At the same time, broader macro uncertainty weighed on risk assets, further pressuring crypto markets. While liquidation flushes often reflect panic-driven conditions, they can also reset overheated leverage and funding rates. Market participants are now watching whether the January 31 event signals the start of a deeper correction or a short-term reset before renewed consolidation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 21:32:17

In recent days, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Dragonfly Capital partner Haseeb Qureshi, and Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy have all pushed back strongly against the narrative, arguing that macroeconomic panic, liquidity stress, and market structure weaknesses, not a single platform’s product design, drove the crash. Their responses, widely shared across Crypto Twitter and industry forums, are now reshaping how the market revisits one of the most destructive liquidation events since the FTX era. CZ Attributes Crash To Macro Shock, Not Exchange Failures CZ addressed the controversy directly during a Binance Square AMA on January 31, 2026, where he emphasized that the October 10 sell-off was largely driven by tariff-related macroeconomic news that spooked global risk markets, not internal failures at Binance. According to CZ, Bitcoin’s current market depth and global liquidity make it extremely difficult for any single entity to manipulate prices through isolated dumping or localized dislocations. While Binance’s post-incident review did acknowledge two technical irregularities on the day of the crash, including temporary UI transfer issues and certain index price deviations, CZ firmly rejected the idea that these anomalies triggered the broader market collapse. Instead, he framed the sell-off as a classic panic-driven cascade amplified by high leverage, thin liquidity during volatility, and macro fear spilling into crypto. OKX’s founder also weighed in alongside the discussion, noting that product design choices, risk controls, and infrastructure behavior at major platforms can intensify stress during extreme market moments, but stopped short of blaming any single exchange as the primary cause. Haseeb Dismantles The USDe Leverage Theory Among the strongest critics of Star Xu’s narrative is Dragonfly Capital partner Haseeb Qureshi, who publicly rejected the claim that Binance’s USDe yield campaign triggered the October crash. In a detailed breakdown shared on X, Haseeb argued that the timeline, market data, and cross-exchange behavior simply do not support the idea that USDe caused, or even meaningfully amplified, the liquidation spiral. At the heart of Star Xu’s argument is the idea that Binance encouraged traders to loop USDe as collateral, building extreme leverage that eventually unraveled from a small price shock. But Haseeb says the numbers tell a very different story. Bitcoin, he pointed out, bottomed nearly 30 minutes before USDe experienced any meaningful price divergence on Binance. “That alone breaks the causal link,” he explained. “USDe could not have triggered the liquidation cascade if the cascade already happened.” In other words, the crash was already in motion before USDe showed stress. Isolated Depeg Fails To Explain Global Liquidations Haseeb further emphasized that USDe’s price dislocation occurred almost exclusively on Binance. On other exchanges and trading venues, USDe remained largely stable, while massive liquidations were simultaneously ripping through every major crypto platform worldwide. This, he argued, makes it impossible for USDe to be the systemic driver. When true systemic collapses occur, like Terra, Three Arrows Capital, or FTX, the damage propagates everywhere. Balance sheets implode across venues. Prices diverge globally. Liquidity disappears universally. That’s not what happened with USDe. “If a depeg doesn’t spread cross-exchange, it can’t explain a market-wide wipeout,” Haseeb noted. Even when giving Star Xu’s theory the benefit of the doubt, suggesting USDe might have amplified the crash rather than caused it, the argument still falls apart, according to Haseeb, because there was no evidence of global contagion from the asset. Instead, the data points to broader forces: tariff-driven fear, Binance API disruptions, forced liquidations, ADL mechanisms triggering, and the absence of stabilizing buffers common in traditional financial markets. Timing And Motives Come Under Scrutiny Haseeb also questioned why Star Xu is pushing this narrative months after the event, without presenting any new evidence. Order book data, liquidation flows, and price movements have been publicly available since October and thoroughly analyzed by traders, researchers, and on-chain analysts. Yet only now is OKX’s CEO framing the crash around Binance and Ethena. To Haseeb, the sudden reemergence of the theory feels less like a data-driven discovery and more like a strategic escalation between industry heavyweights. “This looks like picking a fight and using a simple story to make it sound like CZ caused 10/10 through irresponsibility,” he suggested. The implication is clear: the debate may now be as much about industry rivalry as it is about market mechanics. Wintermute Warns Against Scapegoating A Single Platform Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy added another layer of perspective, cautioning against the emotional tendency to pin complex market collapses on one company. In his view, attributing a multi-billion-dollar systemic sell-off to a single exchange oversimplifies how modern crypto markets function. Kind of wish public figures would pick words more carefully. 10/10 was very obviously not a “software glitch”. It was a flash crash on mega leveraged market on illiquid Friday night driven by macro news. And since we are here, I get that nobody likes being in bear market,… https://t.co/uUrwqrbS8t — wishful_cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) January 30, 2026 Gaevoy explained that in bearish environments, especially when other asset classes are rising while crypto struggles, investors naturally look for a villain. But markets driven by leverage, automated liquidations, global liquidity flows, and sentiment feedback loops rarely collapse from one isolated trigger. “Blaming one platform might feel emotionally satisfying,” he said, “but it’s logically weak.” Instead, he pointed to structural fragility across crypto: high leverage tolerance, thin order books during volatility, reflexive liquidations, and limited circuit-breaker mechanisms. In such conditions, any macro shock can spiral into a cascading collapse. A Broader Reckoning For Crypto Market Structure Taken together, the responses from CZ, Haseeb, and Gaevoy paint a picture far more complex than a single yield product gone wrong. Rather than one exchange creating a meltdown, the October 10 crash increasingly appears to reflect: • Macro-driven panic spilling into risk assets • Overleveraged trading across platforms • Automated liquidation systems accelerating sell-offs • Infrastructure strain during peak volatility • A lack of stabilizing market safeguards While product design and risk controls certainly matter, industry leaders now argue that focusing solely on Binance and USDe misses the deeper structural vulnerabilities that continue to haunt crypto markets. The renewed debate is forcing a hard truth back into the spotlight: until leverage culture, liquidity resilience, and systemic safeguards improve, crypto will remain vulnerable to violent cascades, regardless of which platform hosts the next popular yield product. And as this latest clash between top executives shows, the fight to define the narrative of October 10 is far from over. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Now, OKX CEO Star Xu is openly pointing to what he describes as a dangerous leverage cycle enabled by Binance, one that quietly transformed a yield product into a systemic risk engine. In a detailed public statement shared on X, Star Xu argued that the October 11 crash was not a random volatility event but the result of structural failures created by how USDe was promoted, treated, and repeatedly leveraged across the market. His comments, which can be found, are quickly reshaping industry conversations around risk management and exchange responsibility. No complexity. No accident. 10/10 was caused by irresponsible marketing campaigns by certain companies. On October 10, tens of billions of dollars were liquidated. As CEO of OKX, we observed clearly that the crypto market’s microstructure fundamentally changed after that day.… pic.twitter.com/N1VlY4F7rt — Star (@star_okx) January 31, 2026 According to Xu, the fallout has already altered the microstructure of crypto trading itself. “On October 10, tens of billions of dollars were liquidated. As CEO of OKX, we observed clearly that the crypto market’s microstructure fundamentally changed after that day,” he stated. Many market participants now believe the damage surpassed even the collapse of FTX, a claim that underscores just how deeply the shockwaves traveled. Binance’s USDe Yield Campaign Sparked A High-Risk Leverage Loop At the center of Xu’s criticism is a temporary user-acquisition campaign launched by Binance that offered an eye-catching 12% APY on USDe holdings. While high yields are nothing new in crypto, the issue, according to Xu, was how Binance allowed USDe to function almost identically to traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC, including being used as collateral with no meaningful restrictions. This effectively positioned USDe as a “safe” asset in traders’ eyes, despite carrying a much higher embedded risk profile. Users were encouraged to convert their USDT and USDC into USDe to chase returns, often without clear communication about the underlying exposure they were taking on. From the surface, it looked like a simple yield opportunity. Under the hood, it was something far more dangerous. USDe Operates Like A Tokenized Hedge Fund, Not A Stablecoin Star Xu emphasized that USDe is fundamentally different from standard stablecoins or low-risk tokenized funds. USDe is issued by Ethena, which raises capital through what it markets as a “stablecoin,” then deploys those funds into index arbitrage and algorithmic trading strategies, essentially running hedge-fund-style operations and tokenizing the resulting positions. The token can then be deposited on exchanges to earn yield. This structure, Xu explained, embeds hedge-fund-level risk directly into a product many users treated like digital cash. That’s where the danger emerged. He contrasted USDe with tokenized money market funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, which are designed around conservative, low-risk financial instruments. USDe, by comparison, carries structural trading exposure. “The difference is not cosmetic, it is fundamental,” Xu noted. Yet on major platforms, that distinction was barely visible to everyday traders. Repeated Collateral Cycling Pushed Leverage To Extreme Levels What turned risk into systemic instability was the feedback loop Binance’s collateral structure enabled. According to Xu, users began following a repeating strategy: They converted USDT and USDC into USDe to earn yield. They used USDe as collateral to borrow USDT. They converted the borrowed USDT back into USDe. They repeated the cycle again and again. Each loop stacked more leverage onto the system. On paper, traders saw APYs balloon to 24%, 36%, even above 70%. Because these opportunities existed on one of the world’s largest exchanges, many assumed the risk was minimal. In reality, leverage was quietly compounding across the entire market. Systemic exposure wasn’t isolated to one platform, it spread globally. And once enough pressure built up, all it took was a relatively small shock to bring the structure down. Depegging Triggered Liquidation Cascades Across The Market When volatility finally hit, the weakness of the system surfaced instantly. USDe began to depeg. That single break triggered massive forced liquidations as leveraged positions unraveled in rapid succession. Collateral values dropped, margin calls accelerated, and automated sell-offs flooded the market. Xu also pointed to risk management gaps around assets like WETH and BNSOL, which amplified price crashes even further. Some tokens briefly traded close to zero as liquidity vanished. The result was one of the most violent liquidation events in crypto history. “The damage to global users and companies, including OKX customers, was severe, and recovery will take time,” Xu said. What had started as a yield promotion ended as a systemic breakdown. Industry Leaders Face Growing Pressure Over Risk Transparency Despite the sharp critique, Xu stressed that his goal is not to attack Binance personally but to spotlight the deeper structural problems that allowed such risk to accumulate unnoticed. He warned that open discussion may trigger backlash and misinformation but insisted that transparency is essential if crypto is to mature into a trustworthy financial system. “As the largest global platform, Binance has outsized influence, and corresponding responsibility, as an industry leader,” he stated. In Xu’s view, long-term trust cannot be built on aggressive yield incentives, excessive leverage, or marketing that blurs real risk. Instead, exchanges must prioritize: • Clear risk disclosure • Responsible collateral frameworks • Limits on recursive leverage • Market stability over short-term user growth The industry, he added, needs leadership focused on sustainable innovation, not a winner-take-all mindset where criticism is treated as hostility. A Turning Point For Crypto Market Structure The October crash is increasingly being seen not as an isolated event, but as a structural wake-up call. Just as the 2022 collapses reshaped custody and proof-of-reserves practices, this latest meltdown is now forcing hard conversations around leverage design, yield products, and how exchanges present risk to users. Star Xu’s comments have already fueled broader debate among traders, analysts, and platform operators. If his assessment holds, the real lesson of October isn’t about one token depegging, it’s about how modern crypto infrastructure can quietly turn complex financial engineering into mass-market risk. And unless the industry corrects those feedback loops, the next crash may come even faster. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The former Chief Technology Officer of Ripple and one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger weighed in on claims that XRP could realistically reach price levels between $50 and $100. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Interestingly, Schwartz’s view wasn’t one of outright bullishness but on how markets actually price belief, probability, and conviction with a blunt reality check. Schwartz Refuses To Admit Or Dismiss A $100 XRP When asked whether to tell investors that XRP cannot realistically reach $50 or $100, Schwartz refused to give in to take that position. Instead, he began by explaining why he was uncomfortable making absolute statements about XRP’s future price. Drawing on personal experience, he pointed out that he once considered much lower milestones unrealistic, including XRP trading above $0.25 and Bitcoin reaching $100 as an impossible dream. However, personal disbelief was not the issue. His contention is based on how rational markets behave when participants genuinely believe in a specific outcome. According to Schwartz, if a meaningful number of rational investors truly believed there was even a modest chance of XRP reaching $100 within a few years, the market would already reflect that belief. In such a scenario, investors would be unwilling to sell XRP at prices far below $10, and buyers with that conviction would rapidly absorb available supply. At the time of writing, XRP is trading well below $10, and is yet to even establish $2 as a support floor. The fact that XRP continues to trade well under that level, in his view, shows that very few market participants actually assign a serious probability to a $100 outcome. According to Schwartz, cryptocurrency markets are more rational than they are often given credit for. However, he also noted his personal belief that most significant crypto bull runs were due to unpredictable external changes. This caveat still opens up the possibility that XRP would, in fact, trade at $100 one day. Comparing XRP And Bitcoin Through A Rational Market Lens In a follow-up exchange, Schwartz responded to a comparison between XRP reaching $100 and Bitcoin’s early journey to $1,000. The unlikelihood of XRP reaching $100 is dependent more on the multiple of the asset than anything else. A ten-fold increase in XRP, he said, is about as unlikely as a ten-fold increase in Bitcoin or Ethereum right now, regardless of whether that move occurred in the past or might happen in the future. The idea that XRP would one day trade at $100 has been a popular idea among bullish XRP enthusiasts. However, a few critics have always downplayed the idea, citing the enormous amount of inflow this would take and saying it would be best to target lower prices like $10 first.

A new report by TRM Labs estimates that fraudulent wallets received approximately $158 billion in incoming value during the year, which is the highest level recorded over the past five years. The increase is a dramatic reversal from 2024, when illicit inflows fell to $64.5 billion, following a steady multi-year decline from $85.9 billion in 2021 to $75.4 billion in 2022 and $73.3 billion in 2023. Sanctions, Stablecoins, and State Strategy TRM Labs attributed the 2025 surge not only to intensified enforcement actions but also to expanded use of cryptocurrency by nation-state actors and technological advances that enabled the identification of previously unattributed illicit volumes. The most significant shift was concentrated in sanctions-linked activity tied overwhelmingly to Russia, as volumes associated with sanctioned entities and jurisdictions rose sharply. The A7A5 token alone accounted for an estimated $72 billion in incoming value, followed by $39 billion linked to the A7 wallet cluster, with the majority of this activity connected to Russia-linked actors, including Garantex, Grinex, and A7. The blockchain intelligence firm stated that the increase does not reflect sanctions evasion growth alone, but rather the combination of new sanctions designations targeting large entities and improved attribution of cryptocurrency addresses to actors that had already been sanctioned. Among these, A7 emerged as a central node and functioned as a centrally coordinated sanctions evasion architecture tied to Russian state interests. On-chain activity analyzed by TRM indicates that A7 operates as a hub linking Russia-aligned actors with counterparties across China, Southeast Asia, and Iran-linked networks, in a major pivot toward crypto-enabled, state-aligned financial infrastructure. While the A7 wallet cluster is closely associated with sanctions evasion activity, the A7A5 token supports a wider push to reduce reliance on USD-based financial systems through the expansion of a ruble-pegged stablecoin. As a result, the high transaction volumes linked to A7A5 do not exclusively represent sanctions evasion, but sanctioned activity more broadly, including state-aligned economic flows. Fraudulent Crypto Grows Zooming out from sanctions-related activity, the firm also revealed that overall illicit crypto inflows rose to an all-time high in 2025, even as such activity accounted for a smaller share of the crypto ecosystem. Measured as a proportion of total attributed on-chain volume, illicit activity declined slightly to 1.2% in 2025 from 1.3% in 2024, and remained well below the 2.4% peak recorded in 2023. A similar pattern was observed when illicit activity was assessed relative to incoming liquidity, as illicit entities received 2.7% of incoming VASP flows in 2025, compared with 2.9% in 2024 and 6.0% in 2023. TRM Labs said these metrics indicate that while certain illicit categories expanded significantly in absolute terms, illicit actors absorbed a smaller proportion of new capital entering the crypto ecosystem.

This colossal movement, valued at approximately $470 million, originated from an enigmatic private wallet and terminated at the major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Consequently, this transaction immediately captured the attention of analysts and traders worldwide, prompting deep scrutiny into its potential market implications. Decoding the $470 Million Bitcoin Whale Transfer Blockchain explorers confirm the transaction’s details with cryptographic certainty. Whale Alert, a trusted aggregator of large blockchain movements, reported the transfer in real-time. The sending address, lacking any known public affiliation, classifies as a ‘private’ or ‘unknown’ wallet. This characteristic often indicates custody by a high-net-worth individual, a family office, or an institutional entity prioritizing privacy. The recipient address, however, is definitively tagged as belonging to Bitfinex, one of the world’s oldest and most liquid digital asset exchanges. To contextualize the scale, 5,999 BTC represents a significant portion of daily exchange flows. For instance, it equates to roughly 30% of the new Bitcoin mined in an entire month. Historically, such substantial inflows to exchanges can precede increased selling pressure, as holders move assets to trading platforms for liquidation. Alternatively, they may signal preparations for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, collateralization for loans, or strategic portfolio rebalancing. Historical Context and Whale Behavior Patterns Examining past data provides crucial perspective. Large Bitcoin movements are not uncommon, but their intent varies. A 2023 study by Chainalysis noted that exchange inflows exceeding 3,000 BTC often correlate with short-term price volatility. However, correlation does not equal causation. Furthermore, the current macroeconomic climate, with potential shifts in interest rate policies, adds another layer of analysis. Analysts typically cross-reference this data with other metrics: Exchange Net Flow: Monitoring if other exchanges see simultaneous outflows, indicating a mere platform transfer. Futures Market Data: Checking for corresponding changes in open interest and funding rates. OTC Desk Activity: Large sales are frequently executed off-exchange to minimize market impact. Notably, the Bitcoin market has matured significantly since earlier bull cycles. Therefore, a single transfer, while massive, may have a more muted immediate impact due to deeper overall liquidity. Expert Analysis on Potential Motivations Market strategists offer several evidence-based interpretations for such a move. Firstly, it could represent profit-taking by a long-term holder, especially if the wallet’s history shows accumulation at much lower price points. Secondly, institutional entities often use exchanges as gateways to access decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or for staking services, requiring an on-ramp. Thirdly, it might be collateral movement for institutional lending or margin requirements on derivative positions. “We must avoid speculative leaps,” advises Dr. Lena Schmidt, a blockchain forensics researcher. “Our analysis shows that between 40-50% of large exchange inflows in the last quarter were followed by OTC settlements, not open-market sells. The destination is a clue, but the full story is in the wallet’s history and broader chain activity.” This expert insight underscores the importance of comprehensive data review over reactionary assumptions. Implications for Bitcoin Market Structure and Liquidity The immediate effect of this transfer is a measurable change in exchange supply. Platforms like CryptoQuant track ‘Exchange Whale Ratio,’ which spiked following this deposit. An increased ratio can signal that whales are moving coins to sell, often viewed as a short-term bearish indicator. However, the long-term effect depends entirely on the holder’s subsequent actions. If the BTC is sold on the spot market, it could create localized resistance. Conversely, if it’s used as collateral or moved to cold storage from the exchange shortly after, the net effect on sell-side pressure is minimal. The transaction also highlights the transparency of public blockchains. Every move is auditable, providing a level of market intelligence absent in traditional finance. Conclusion The transfer of 5,999 BTC to Bitfinex stands as a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate within the digital asset ecosystem. This Bitcoin whale transfer provides a real-time case study in blockchain transparency and market microstructure analysis. While its arrival on an exchange warrants monitoring, definitive conclusions require observing the next on-chain steps. Ultimately, such events highlight the maturing yet dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets, where monumental value moves are visible to all but their intent remains encrypted until revealed by action. FAQs Q1: What does a large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange usually mean? It typically indicates the holder intends to trade, sell, or use the assets in financial products offered by the exchange. However, it can also be a preliminary step for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal or moving between custodial services. Q2: How does Whale Alert detect these transactions? Whale Alert monitors public blockchain data in real-time using node networks. It filters for transactions exceeding a certain value threshold (e.g., $1 million) and cross-references addresses with known exchange wallets and other tagged entities. Q3: Can the owner of the ‘unknown wallet’ be identified? While the address itself is pseudonymous, blockchain analysts can often uncover clues by studying its transaction history, interaction patterns with known entities, and timing relative to public market events. Absolute identification, however, is rarely possible without external data. Q4: Does this transaction automatically mean the price will drop? No. While large exchange inflows can increase available sell-side liquidity, price action depends on actual executed sell orders, overall market demand, and broader macroeconomic factors. A single deposit is one data point among many. Q5: What is the difference between an OTC trade and an exchange trade? An OTC (Over-The-Counter) trade is a private, bilateral agreement to buy or sell assets at an agreed price. It avoids the public order book, minimizing market impact. An exchange trade executes directly on the platform’s public order book, influencing the visible market price.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency traded in the low-to-mid $78,000 range during the session, marking one of its weakest daily performances in months. The breakdown below $80,000 triggered a wave of forced liquidations across derivatives platforms, accelerating the downside move. Within hours, more than $1 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out across the broader crypto market, with Bitcoin accounting for the largest share. Liquidations Amplify the Downside Move As BTC lost short-term support near $82,000-$80,000, stop-loss orders and margin calls cascaded through the market. Elevated open interest in perpetual futures left traders vulnerable to a long squeeze, intensifying volatility. The spike in liquidation volume suggests the selloff was driven not only by spot selling but also by aggressive deleveraging. Rapid forced closures added momentum to the drop, pushing Bitcoin to session lows before modest stabilization attempts emerged. Macro Pressure Beyond technical breakdowns, broader macro uncertainty contributed to risk aversion. Shifts in interest-rate expectations and cautious positioning across global markets weighed on speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies. The total crypto market capitalization fell sharply alongside Bitcoin, erasing tens of billions of dollars in value during the session. Ethereum and other major altcoins followed BTC lower, reflecting widespread market weakness. While intraday rebounds remain possible after such heavy liquidations, Bitcoin must reclaim the $80,000-$82,000 zone to signal short-term stabilization. Until then, traders are watching the mid-$70,000 area as the next potential support level if selling pressure persists.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 22:56:28

While many had hoped for a repeat of past “to-the-moon” runs, the charts are telling a different story. The social momentum that once fueled viral rallies is fading, and investor sentiment is shifting. Speculation driven by jokes and trends is losing its appeal. Instead, capital is moving toward projects built on real code and functional tools. A quiet transition is underway as funds exit the old regime and reposition for what comes next. The industry is entering a new crypto phase of decentralized finance, one that is reshaping the market and casting a long shadow over outdated models. Projects that fail to adapt may find themselves anchored to a past that is no longer coming back. Dogecoin (DOGE) At around $0.11, Dogecoin (DOGE) has only been able to start the year in a stagnant position. The coin has been trapped in a narrow range although it made a short attempt to break higher in early January. Its market cap would be approximately at $19 billion though volume is shrinking. The initial rushes which used to transform millionaires into a far off dream. Analysts are even making somber warnings. Others anticipate that DOGE would fall to less than $0.08 by the close of 2026. This dumping is due to a mere reason. Investors are shifting their funds to utility producing projects. They have had enough of waiting to have a tweet to shift the price. They desire assets that produce value through borrowing and lending. The absence of a real ecosystem of Dogecoin is turning out to be a significant weakness. Big holders are redirecting to platforms that are actually utility backed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a specialized lending ecosystem on Ethereum that operates through a dual-market model. This structure allows you to access liquidity without selling your tokens, keeping your long-term investment strategy intact. The protocol develops two distinct methods for matching lenders and borrowers: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): This is an automated system where you interact directly with smart contract-run liquidity pools. For example, you can deposit USDT into a pool to earn an immediate 10–12% APY, or borrow from that same pool instantly without waiting for a specific person to approve your request. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): This model allows for direct, custom agreements between individuals. If you have a unique asset or want specific terms, such as borrowing 10,000 USDT at a fixed rate for exactly 30 days, you can find a lender willing to match those exact requirements. To keep the system stable, Mutuum Finance will use a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which dictates how much you can borrow against your deposited collateral. For instance, if the LTV for a stable asset like ETH is set at 75%, a user depositing $1,000 worth of ETH could borrow up to $750. Volatile assets typically have lower LTVs, such as 35%, to protect the protocol from sudden price drops. The MUTM Accelerated Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has entered its most active stage yet, having successfully raised over $20.1 million and established a robust community of more than 19,000 individual holders. This fundraising success places MUTM among the top-performing DeFi presales of the 2026 cycle. Currently in Phase 7, the token is priced at $0.04, which reflects a consistent 300% value increase for participants who joined during the initial offering at $0.01. This phased approach is designed to reward early support with built-in appreciation, as the price is scheduled to rise to $0.045 in Phase 8 before eventually reaching the confirmed official launch price of $0.06. Participation in the current phase remains high due to the significant gap between the current discounted price and the public listing value, offering a final opportunity for investors to secure a 50% discount compared to the launch tier. To maintain this momentum, the project features a 24-hour leaderboard that awards a $500 bonus in MUTM tokens to the top daily contributor. The distribution structure is highly transparent, with 1.82 billion tokens (45.5% of the total 4 billion supply) dedicated to the presale. Current data indicates that over 835 million tokens have already been sold, meaning nearly half of the available presale allocation has been claimed. Why MUTM Outperforms DOGE DOGE relies on viral social media trends and celebrity mentions to drive its value. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building its value through technical progress. The project recently reached a major goal by launching its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This is a big step because it shows the code is real and ready to use. The testnet lets users try out the core lending and borrowing tools before the official launch. You can now test the mtToken system, where people who lend their crypto get yield-bearing receipts. These tokens grow in value as borrowers pay back their loans with interest. The system also includes an automated liquidator bot. This bot watches the “Health Factor” of every loan and closes risky positions to keep the platform safe. Analysts see DOGE as a high-risk asset that moves mostly on hype. For 2026, some experts predict it could grow by 1.2x, potentially reaching prices between $0.12-$0.14 if a new wave of social media interest hits. However, without new utility, it remains very volatile. Because MUTM is tied to a working lending platform, its outlook is different. It is currently in Phase 7 of its presale at $0.04. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06, it already offers a 50% jump. Long-term analysts predict it could reach $0.30 by late 2026 as long as mainnet follows as planned. This would be a 650% appreciation from today’s price.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark. In December, the price continued to move downwards ending the year at $$0.0122.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 23:00:00
57625024,660465,1769900401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57625024.jpeg,XRP About To Make A New Wave Of Multi-Millionaires As Capital Floods In,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-new-wave-of-millionaires/,"Capital is rotating back into high-potential crypto assets, and XRP is emerging as the primary beneficiary of the shift. As liquidity floods back into the market, many believe the altcoin is positioned for a powerful upside move that could dramatically reshape portfolios. Why This Capital Inflow Could Change XRP’s Price Forever XRP is about to make multi-millionaires. An analyst known as Dragon revealed a video on X that RealFi has officially approved Walmart as a vendor. Walmart, a global retail giant with a $800 billion market capitalization and responsible for approximately $680 billion in annual customer transactions, is now live in the RealFi ecosystem. This initiative now has the potential to onboard over 342 million Walmart customers annually to the RealFi ecosystem. The XRP Ledger and Real Token powers this RealFi infrastructure. The market narrative about XRP may be misleading, and the millionaire wallets are rising fast. Crypto trader Skipper has noted that while the token continues to trade below the $2.00 level, it is still attracting serious attention from large investors. The new on-chain data from Santiment shows that 42 new whale wallets holding more than 1 million XRP have been created since the start of the year. This steady rise in whale accumulation suggests that high-net-worth investors may be preparing for a major upside move. With smart money entering the market, this kind of accumulation trend could support a bullish XRP price prediction in the weeks ahead. On the technical side, the daily chart shows an interesting pattern that led to a strong recovery the last time this setup occurred. This could be what whales are seeing that most retail investors are missing. XRP’s price has been squeezed down into a key support zone, and buying interest is rising. Meanwhile, whales are aggressively accumulating at around $1.75, and if retail participants start to follow whale behavior , the setup could quickly evolve into a short squeeze. Retail And Institutions Are Watching The Same Asset According to Xfinancebull, while everyone is arguing over XRP price action and chart patterns, 2 million people are actively tracking the token on CoinMarketCap’s watchlist. That level of interest is not accidental; it reflects broad retail and institutional interest in the same asset. A high watchlist count typically signals positive sentiment and growing anticipation. Even traders and algorithms respond to this rising attention, which often influences short-term trends. However, the signal here is that the watchlists represent investors who are monitoring closely and waiting for opportunities. A steadily growing watcher base is an early indicator of future buying pressure. When clarity comes or momentum shifts, those 2 million are already positioned to move, rather than starting from scratch. This high visibility boosts the ecosystem, as increased attention attracts partnerships, adoption, and institutional interest. The feedback loop is real, and the altcoin is no longer a hidden opportunity, but has become one of the most-watched assets in crypto.",XRP|Coinmarketcap|DRAGON|REAL token|RealFi|ripple|RP Ledger|Skipper|Walmart|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Retailers|XRP Whales|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 23:00:01

The decision landed after a violent selloff that wiped out leveraged positions across metals. Gold and silver both collapsed on Friday as traders rushed to close positions, and margin calls spread fast. The change takes effect from Monday’s close and applies to gold, silver, platinum, and palladium futures. For traders, the message from CME is blunt. If you want to trade metals in this market, you need more cash upfront. Gold margins for non‑heightened risk profiles rise from 6% to 8% of contract value. For heightened risk profiles, margins rise from 6.6% to 8.8%. Silver margins jump harder. Non‑heightened risk margins rise from 11% to 15%, while heightened risk margins increase from 12.1% to 16.5%. Platinum and palladium margins also go up. Margin hikes raise collateral demands after extreme volatility The margin increase follows what CME described as a normal review of market volatility to ensure enough collateral coverage. The exchange often raises margins when prices swing hard, whether up or down. This time, the timing adds pressure. Smaller traders now face higher cash requirements just days after heavy losses. Earlier in the week, CME had already raised margins on silver, platinum, and palladium futures after prices ran higher. Friday’s update expands that tightening. Anyone trading futures in these metals must now post more collateral to keep positions open and meet obligations. For many smaller accounts, that extra cash may not be available. Gold and silver prices collapsed on Friday as markets reacted to political news from Washington.President Donald Trump, now serving as the 47th president, nominated Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. The nomination eased concerns about the Fed’s independence and sent the dollar higher. A stronger dollar made gold and silver more expensive for overseas buyers and added pressure to prices. Spot silver dropped 28% to $83.45 an ounce. Silver futures plunged 31.4% to settle at $78.53, the worst day since March 1980. Spot gold fell about 9% to $4,895.22 an ounce. Gold futures slid 11.4% to $4,745.10. “This is getting crazy,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. After that first reference, Matt said most of the selling looked forced. He said silver had become a favorite trade for short‑term traders and day traders, which built leverage. When prices collapsed, margin calls followed fast. Dollar rally and profit taking slam metals and related assets Selling pressure grew through U.S. trading hours as investors locked in profits after long rallies. Gold and silver had surged through 2025, with gold up 66% and silver up 135% for the year. The fast gains attracted heavy positioning. When prices turned, exits became crowded. The dollar index last traded about 0.8% higher, adding pressure. Metals also lost support from the idea that gold and silver could replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, had been seen as the favorite to replace Jerome Powell. But prediction markets shifted toward Warsh in recent days. Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, wrote that markets were trading Warsh as hawkish. After his first mention, Krishna said the pick could help stabilize the dollar and challenge debasement trades, which weighed on metals. He also warned against pushing that trade too far and said Warsh is a pragmatist, not an ideological hawk. Geopolitics had helped metals earlier in the year. Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said a perfect storm of tensions pushed prices higher. After his first mention, Claudio pointed to the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro and U.S. threats of military force in Greenland and Iran. He said recent speculation about the Fed chair had also influenced metals. The selloff spread beyond futures. Coeur Mining dropped 17%. The ProShares Ultra Silver ETF fell more than 62%. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 31%. Both funds headed for their worst days on record. Katy Stoves, investment manager at Mattioli Woods, said the drop looked like a market‑wide reassessment of concentration risk. After her first mention, Katy said crowded trades can unwind fast when everyone is positioned the same way. Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, said gold’s run toward $5,000 happened too easily.After his first mention, Toni said central bank buying had supported prices but slowed in recent months. Toni said reserve diversification remains a theme, especially as Trump’s trade policies and foreign actions make some countries uneasy about holding U.S. assets. Silver, he said, tends to follow gold. Get seen where it counts.

Price dropped fast after earnings and erased the recent bounce that pushed shares back toward the 200 day moving average.Traders see that line as a basic health check.Above it, stocks usually breathe easy. Testing it raises stress. Below it, things often get ugly. Right now, the stock is stuck in that danger zone with little room for error. Ahead of earnings, Microsoft had already done the hard part by climbing back to the 200 day level. That rally did not come out of nowhere. Warnings were clear on the charts and in the data. A death cross showed up two weeks earlier. That signal comes late, but it usually confirms a change in direction.Price also printed a clean double top and a rounding top. Those patterns pointed to exhaustion. The bounce into the moving average was a relief run, not a fresh breakout, and it lined the stock up for the drop that followed. Shares fall through $450 and stall near a key support band The selloff started with a gap below the first support around $450. From there, price slid straight into the $423 to $425 area. That zone matters for several reasons. It lines up with the upside gap and prior low from the April 30 earnings reaction. This is the first time price has come back to that level, which makes it a clean test. Buyers often show up on a first retest, especially when the drop shakes out weak positions. The same price area also matches a key Fibonacci retracement. Traders use those levels to spot pauses during pullbacks. For now, the level is holding. The selling pressure was heavy, but it already cleared out a lot of short term risk. Many traders are watching this area for a short leash trade. If the level holds, price could rebound toward $450. If it breaks, the chart opens the door to a fast slide under $400. Stops stay tight here. If price breaks and later gets back above $425, momentum traders usually step back in. Analyst tone is also shifting. Downgrades are expected over the next few days. Even so, 71 analysts still rate the stock a buy, and the average target sits at $611, which is about 43 percent above current prices. Zooming out changes the view but not the risk. On a five year weekly chart, Microsoft is testing a level that sits right inside the longer term uptrend. Fibonacci levels on that time frame line up with the peak to trough run from the 2022 lows to the recent highs. Holding this area keeps that trend alive. Losing it puts the next major level just below $400 back on the table. For long term holders, this is the cleanest risk setup the stock has offered in years. Some investors are adding small amounts here and leaving room to add more if price dips lower. The RSI is moving closer to oversold territory. In past cycles, that zone has lined up with longer term opportunities for Microsoft, especially after fast drops like this one. Earnings also kept the AI theme front and center. CEO Satya Nadella said the company is still in the early stages of adoption. “We are pushing the frontier across our entire AI stack to drive new value for our customers and partners,” Satya said.

He spoke during a media stop in Taipei, where he confirmed that Nvidia will be part of the upcoming round, which is still being finalized. “We will invest a great deal of money,” Jensen said. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.” But when asked how much, he dodged. “Let Sam announce how much he’s going to raise — it’s for him to decide,” he said, referring to Sam Altman, who is still working to close the round. “But we will definitely participate in the next round of financing because it’s such a good investment.” Nvidia cuts back from $100B OpenAI pledge after internal doubts Back in September, Nvidia said it might invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a massive infrastructure expansion plan. The idea was to support new AI data centers with power capacity of at least 10 gigawatts, the same electricity usage as all of New York City during peak demand, using Nvidia’s most advanced chips. But inside the company, doubts started building. Some execs didn’t like the size of the number. Jensen had called the $100 billion letter of intent nonbinding, and said OpenAI lacked business discipline. He also raised flags about competition in the space. That $100 billion is now off the table. Asked directly in Taipei whether he was unhappy with OpenAI, Jensen said, “That’s nonsense.” But he still confirmed that the new investment won’t come anywhere near the earlier amount. While OpenAI is a major buyer of Nvidia chips, the relationship is drawing questions. Investors have been worried that these kinds of setups, where big tech firms fund companies that also buy from them, could be propping up artificial demand. This isn’t Nvidia’s first time doing this either. The company just announced another $2 billion investment into CoreWeave, a cloud firm that also buys a lot of Nvidia hardware. Jensen defends Nvidia support for DeepSeek after US lawmaker complaint During the same trip, Jensen addressed a separate controversy. John Moolenaar, the top Republican on the House China committee, sent a letter accusing Nvidia of helping DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm, reach top performance with its R1 model. That model rattled markets after it launched last year, causing the Nasdaq 100 to fall 3% in a single day. Reporters asked about it. Jensen responded , “Whenever developers want to use our software, we openly support everyone. Every AI developer in the world works with Nvidia. And so I’m very proud of that.” DeepSeek’s R1 model was built with limited resources but still hit strong performance, raising more concerns about global AI race dynamics and access to US technology. The company’s fast rise spooked investors because it showed how much performance could be squeezed out even without top-end infrastructure. As for OpenAI’s ongoing raise, Sam has reportedly been meeting with investors from the Middle East to bring in more capital. The round may value OpenAI between $750 billion and $830 billion.

Back in November 2024, right after Donald Trump won the election, Kevin flew to Mar-a-Lago thinking he was being interviewed for Treasury Secretary. But Trump had other plans. “You’re my Fed chair,” Trump told him. For over a year, Kevin repeated that to everyone. And he was right. It took 14 months, one bitter fight inside the White House, and a criminal case against Jerome Powell, but by January 2026, Trump finally said it out loud. He picked Kevin to lead the Federal Reserve. How Kevin outplayed Hassett with Wall Street help The biggest obstacle in Kevin’s way was Kevin Hassett, Trump’s economic adviser. By late 2025, Hassett was convinced he had the job. Trump told his cabinet he’d made his pick. All other interviews were suddenly canceled. While Kevin was on vacation in the Bahamas, Trump was spending the holidays with Hassett in Florida. At that point, everyone assumed it was Hassett. Trump even hinted to reporters, “I know who I’m going to pick,” then just grinned. Inside the West Wing, officials started ignoring Kevin. One senior official said he was finished and mocked him like a man clinging to a sinking boat. The reason? Trump thought Kevin looked desperate. But Kevin had something Hassett didn’t; powerful friends. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he liked Kevin for the job. Stanley Druckenmiller made calls on his behalf. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was tight with Druckenmiller too. Ronald Lauder, Kevin’s father-in-law, is a Republican megadonor and close to Trump. That crew didn’t sit quiet. They got on the phone and told Trump’s team: Hassett was too close to Trump to be seen as independent by the markets. It was risky. Dimon had beef with Trump. Druckenmiller said he wouldn’t vote for either Trump or Kamala Harris in 2024. Still, their pitch landed. Hassett’s Wall Street credibility came under fire. He also said he might not even stay the full four years. People started wondering how badly he even wanted the job. Hassett said he was happy where he was. “This is my dream job,” he told reporters. Trump wanted a rate cutter, and Kevin said yes On December 10, just hours after the Fed cut rates by 0.25%, Kevin met with Trump. Trump had long regretted choosing Powell. He was looking for someone who’d work with him, not push back. He asked Kevin straight up if he would support more cuts. Kevin said yes. Trump told the Journal, “I asked him what he thinks. He thinks you have to lower interest rates.” During the holidays, Trump told aides he liked Kevin’s sharpness and how he looked. It was a change from 2017, when he’d passed on Kevin for looking too young and chose Powell instead. Back then, Powell was seen as more open to easy-money policies. Kevin was the hawk. He later told NYU professor Simon Bowmaker, “I did not put my ambitions ahead of my principles.” After the first term soured, Trump’s team asked Kevin if he’d replace Powell. He refused. “The position was not open,” he told Bowmaker. But in Trump’s second term, talks restarted. Trump even considered firing Powell. Again, Kevin said not yet. Then on January 11, Powell went public. He announced the DOJ was investigating him for lying to Congress. That set off chaos. Republicans like Senator Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski said they’d block any nominee until the case was over. The scandal crushed Hassett’s chances. He had spent months on TV trashing Powell. Now his loyalty looked dangerous. On January 16, Trump humiliated him in public. At a White House event, Trump said, “I actually want to keep you where you are,” with Hassett sitting in the front row. Kevin, on the other hand, had stayed quiet. He gave a few speeches last year, then disappeared from TV. Other finalists? They never had a shot. Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s meeting with Trump lasted 30 minutes. Trump was two and a half hours late. Rick Rieder’s meeting was longer, but he pitched a complex rate idea; 3% fed-funds, 4% on the 10-year Treasury, 5% mortgages. He’d also donated to Democrats and Nikki Haley. That didn’t help. Scott started the process last summer. He interviewed 11 people. He didn’t want to be blamed for the choice like Steven Mnuchin was back in 2017 when Powell was picked. He told friends Trump was making the call himself. The delay made some officials think the search might expand. On Monday before the announcement, Judy Shelton (known for backing Trump’s Fed views) met Scott. That added speculation. But the Fed held rates steady Wednesday, and Powell hinted they may not cut again soon. That night, Trump met Kevin one more time. The next morning at 6:48 a.m., he made it official. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time,” Trump wrote online, “and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

With selling pressure still intact, traders are now watching key levels closely to see if a final flush toward lower support is imminent. Price Faces Another Rejection MakroVision Research shared on X that Bitcoin has once again met strong rejection, resulting in a decisive break below several key support levels. Price has now slipped back into the range of the previous low and continues to trade beneath the critical green resistance zone between $85,200 and $86,200, highlighting that bearish pressure remains in control for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns On the very short-term timeframe, there are early signs of an attempted rebound, but without a timely and sustainable reclaim of the $85,200–$86,200 zone, this move is best viewed as a technical counter-bounce rather than the start of a meaningful trend reversal. As long as the price remains capped below this area, the broader short-term downtrend remains intact. From a tactical perspective, the $85,200–$86,200 region has become the key battlefield. A clean reclaim and hold above this zone would be the first clear indication that selling pressure is beginning to fade, potentially allowing for price stabilization and a relief rally. If this reclaim attempt fails, the risk of continued downside acceleration increases. In that case, focus would turn to the $72,300–$75,300 range, a technically prominent support zone with historical significance. This zone may ultimately serve as a potential support and reversal region should the market experience another phase of capitulation. CME Gap Opens: What To Expect From Bitcoin This Weekend Crypto analyst MartyParty, in a recent Bitcoin Wyckoff Accumulation update, highlighted that a CME gap is opening, which is expected to be filled by Sunday evening. This sets the stage for potential short-term volatility, with traders closely watching key technical levels and liquidation activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Backs Off Resistance — Breakdown Or Brief Pause? Several scenarios are possible over the coming days. One possibility is the continued liquidation of remaining leveraged longs, with the lowest 25x Binance liquidation currently around $79,350, potentially completing the classic Wyckoff Spring pattern. Another scenario is a retest of secondary support at $81,800, which could act as a temporary floor for Bitcoin’s price action. If support at $81,800 holds, Bitcoin may trade sideways or attempt to push toward the primary support level, which has now turned into resistance at $84,800. The most probable scenario suggests a move up through $84,500 toward $86,463, followed by a retest of $84,500 on Sunday night as the CME gap is filled, completing the near-term Wyckoff accumulation setup.

57625755,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267566,1769902811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surpasses Monumental $79,000 Milestone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-surpasses-79000-milestone/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: BTC Price Surpasses Monumental $79,000 Milestone In a significant market development observed globally on April 10, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) has convincingly broken through the $79,000 barrier, trading at $79,010.77 on the Binance USDT market. This pivotal movement marks a crucial psychological and technical level for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, reigniting discussions about its long-term trajectory and current market dynamics. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this ascent. Bitcoin Price Reaches New Heights According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the BTC price ascent above $79,000 represents a continuation of a bullish trend observed throughout the first quarter of 2025. This price point is particularly noteworthy as it sits comfortably above previous resistance levels that had capped gains for several weeks. Market depth charts from major exchanges show substantial buy-side liquidity supporting this move, indicating strong institutional and retail demand. Furthermore, trading volume has spiked by approximately 35% compared to the weekly average, underscoring the conviction behind this breakout. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced similar parabolic moves, often preceding periods of consolidation. For instance, the 2021 bull run saw BTC challenge its then-all-time high before a broader market correction. However, the current macroeconomic backdrop differs substantially, featuring wider institutional adoption and clearer regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions. This fundamental shift provides a potentially more stable foundation for price appreciation compared to previous cycles driven primarily by retail speculation. Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market Surge The broader cryptocurrency market often moves in correlation with Bitcoin, and this event is no exception. Major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have also posted gains, though typically at a smaller percentage. This phenomenon, known as ‘Bitcoin dominance,’ highlights BTC’s role as the market bellwether. Several concurrent factors are contributing to the positive sentiment across digital asset markets. Institutional Inflows: Recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show increased activity from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, with net positive inflows recorded for 15 consecutive days. Macroeconomic Conditions: Shifting expectations regarding central bank interest rate policies have renewed interest in non-correlated and inflation-hedge assets. Network Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s hash rate, a measure of network security and miner commitment, remains near its all-time high, signaling robust underlying health. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in establishing clear digital asset legislation in major economies like the European Union and the United Kingdom has reduced market uncertainty. Market analysts point to the sustained buying pressure from long-term holders as a key differentiator in this cycle. Data from on-chain analytics firms indicates that the percentage of BTC supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains elevated, suggesting a ‘hodler’ mentality that reduces sell-side pressure. Expert Perspectives on the Milestone Financial experts and seasoned cryptocurrency analysts emphasize the technical and psychological importance of the $79,000 level. “This isn’t just another number on a chart,” notes a market strategist from a leading digital asset fund, citing publicly available research. “It represents a validation of the growing integration of digital assets into the global financial system. The sustained move above this key level could trigger algorithmic trading models and open the path toward testing previous all-time highs.” Risk management professionals, however, advise caution alongside optimism. Historical volatility data for Bitcoin remains high compared to traditional assets. They recommend that investors consider their risk tolerance and maintain a diversified portfolio. The volatility is often attributed to the market’s relative youth, evolving regulatory news, and large transactions by so-called ‘whale’ wallets, which can cause significant price slippage. The Road Ahead for Digital Assets The immediate technical outlook will depend on whether Bitcoin can consolidate above the $79,000 support zone. Resistance levels are now projected near the $82,000 and $85,000 marks, based on historical price action and Fibonacci extension levels. Meanwhile, the impact extends beyond pure price speculation. Payment processors and fintech companies are closely watching adoption metrics, as positive price action often correlates with increased usage of blockchain networks for transactions and smart contracts. Furthermore, this surge has tangible effects on the mining industry. With the price increase, mining profitability has improved, potentially leading to greater investment in energy-efficient mining technologies and a more decentralized network. This creates a positive feedback loop: a higher price supports network security, which in turn boosts investor confidence. The following table summarizes key comparative metrics before and after the $79,000 breakout: Metric Pre-Breakout (Avg. Previous Week) Post-Breakout (Current) Daily Trading Volume (Aggregate) $42 Billion $57 Billion BTC Dominance Index 52.5% 54.1% Fear & Greed Index Greed (68) Extreme Greed (78) Active Addresses (7d MA) 1.02 Million 1.15 Million Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $79,000 is a multifaceted event rooted in stronger institutional participation, improving fundamentals, and a shifting macro landscape. While the price milestone captures headlines, the underlying story is one of a maturing asset class gaining recognition. The Bitcoin price action serves as a critical indicator for the entire digital economy, influencing technology development, regulatory discussions, and investment strategies worldwide. Observers will now watch for sustained momentum and the market’s ability to build support at these elevated levels. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $79,010.77 mean for investors? It signifies a breakout above a major resistance level, which technical analysts view as bullish. For investors, it reflects increased market valuation but also heightened volatility, necessitating careful portfolio management. Q2: How does this BTC price compare to its all-time high? The current price is approaching its historical peak. Surpassing $79,000 places it within a critical range to challenge and potentially exceed the record high set in the previous market cycle. Q3: What are the main drivers behind this cryptocurrency market surge? Primary drivers include sustained institutional investment via ETFs, positive developments in global cryptocurrency regulation, strong Bitcoin network fundamentals, and macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets. Q4: Could the price fall back below $79,000 quickly? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are volatile. While the breakout is significant, prices can retest support levels. Market sentiment, macroeconomic news, or large sell orders can trigger short-term corrections. Q5: Does this price move affect other cryptocurrencies? Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader market. A strong BTC performance usually leads to increased capital flows into the overall crypto asset class, though individual altcoin performance varies based on their own project developments.

RLUSD currently circulates across both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, with a total market capitalization of approximately $1.45 billion. Most of this supply, over $1.11 billion, is on Ethereum, while roughly $337 million exists on the XRPL. The difference in distribution has led some observers to question whether Ripple prioritizes Ethereum over its own blockchain. These concerns were emphasized after Binance enabled RLUSD trading solely on Ethereum, though the exchange has confirmed that XRPL support is forthcoming. Nope. We have nothing to apologize for, it’s because I know there is a lot of noise out there. I want to give clarity to our strategy. It’s easy to see a post or a video and think, 'Wait, is that what they’re doing?' But third-party opinions do not reflect how our team think. — LJ (@luke_judges) January 29, 2026 Ripple’s Position on XRPL Luke Judges, Ripple’s Global Partner Success Lead, addressed these concerns in a statement on X. He clarified that XRPL remains a priority in all RLUSD exchange integrations. According to Judges, the faster rollout on Ethereum is a matter of technical readiness and existing exchange infrastructure, not a sign of reduced focus on XRPL. He emphasized that every exchange onboarding RLUSD either already supports XRPL or has formally committed to doing so. Judges stressed that misinformation had contributed to the misperceptions about the company’s strategy. Ripple intentionally designed RLUSD as a multi-chain asset to enhance liquidity and adoption across diverse blockchain networks. By launching on both Ethereum and XRPL, the company aims to provide broader access for institutional investors and everyday traders alike. Judges reiterated that the multi-chain approach does not diminish the importance of XRPL, but rather complements it by reaching more users efficiently while the XRPL infrastructure is fully prepared. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Not Shifting Focus The discussion over RLUSD follows broader rumors suggesting that Ripple may be shifting focus from XRP and the XRPL in favor of other initiatives. Ripple executives have consistently debunked such narratives. Last October, CEO Brad Garlinghouse reaffirmed that XRP remains integral to the company’s operations, while President Monica Long is scheduled to highlight XRP’s central role at this year’s XRP Community Day. Judges also noted that his comments were aimed at correcting the public misunderstandings, not to apologize for any perceived misstep. While Ethereum currently dominates RLUSD circulation, Ripple’s roadmap ensures that XRPL adoption continues to grow. By restating its commitment to XRPL, combined with a multi-chain deployment strategy, Ripple aims to balance technical readiness with long-term adoption goals, positioning the XRP Ledger as a vital component of its stablecoin ecosystem.

Reports say the ruling does not resolve guilt or innocence. It simply lets the case continue in court. Court Lets Case Move Forward According to filings and press reports, the suit — brought by a shareholder in 2023 — accuses CEO Brian Armstrong and board member Marc Andreessen, among others, of selling large blocks of Coinbase stock around the company’s 2021 direct listing. The complaint alleges those sales totaled close to $3 billion and that the insiders avoided more than $1 billion in losses by acting before negative information reached the market. The judge’s decision to deny a motion to dismiss rests less on the precise dollar numbers and more on questions about process. Reports note that a special litigation committee within Coinbase had already looked into the claims and cleared the directors. But the court flagged concerns over whether that committee was truly independent. Big Names, Big Stakes Many headlines have highlighted Andreessen’s name because of his profile and past business links. That attention isn’t just about personalities. Reports say the chief issue for the court was whether the committee’s ties—direct or indirect—might have skewed its review, making the committee’s blessing less persuasive as a legal shield. Coinbase has pushed back. The company and some defendants argue the sales were legitimate, part of normal liquidity and market mechanics tied to the direct listing, not secret profit-taking based on hidden problems. Those defenses were noted in the filings the judge considered. Still, the lawsuit will now proceed through discovery and other pretrial steps. Questions About Committee Independence Legal observers say this case highlights a recurring issue in corporate suits: when an internal review finds no wrongdoing, courts will still test how, and by whom, that review was done. If the review looks biased, the court may allow a suit to survive early challenges so the facts can be tested under oath.

However, holders may finally have something concrete to anticipate. Refreshing activity from Shytoshi Kusama, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead developer, has diverted attention to a key moment expected on Sunday. Lead Dev Breaks Silence, Teases Sunday That dynamic began to change when Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer and co-founder of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, resurfaced on X after a prolonged absence since early December. However, Kusama broke his silence this week with a thread on X explaining the reasons behind his inactivity and has since returned to regular posting and reposting activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction One post stood out more than the rest, in which Kusama hinted at a revelation scheduled for Sunday. In that message, he spoke about arriving at a discovery by pure chance and referenced what he described as an ancient marker older than time itself. Although the message was a bit cryptic, it immediately generated attention across the SHIB community, which has been hungry for direction and clarity amid recent challenges in Shiba Inu’s price action. The significance of Sunday became clearer following an interesting exchange between Kusama and a Shiba Inu community member who openly expressed concerns about transparency, reassurance, and leadership presence after recent ecosystem issues. The community member, known as RuggRat on X, noted how there has been no official statement or simple explanation of what happened from Kusama regarding the Shibarium exploit. This is in reference to the September 2025 Shibarim Bridge exploit, which saw attackers making off with $4.1 million worth of crypto assets. In response, Kusama acknowledged the concern, stating that silence can sometimes be strategic and framing Sunday as a moment for addressing issues step by step. “This is what Sunday is for. One at a time,” Kusama said. Fair. But sometimes silence is a weapon for quiet wars. This is what Sunday is for. One bandage. Take off. Fix. Put on. One at a time. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) January 29, 2026 Shiba Inu’s Challenging Phase Has Tested Holder Confidence Shiba Inu’s price action has struggled to gain any meaningful upside traction since the beginning of 2026, an extension of its late 2025 run. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading around $0.0000071, keeping it pinned down by 1.8% and 10.5% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. Price structure during this period has been marked by a series of lower lows, with persistent selling pressure leaving little room for a meaningful higher high to form.

57627974,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=905970,1769910287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57627974.jpeg,Hyperunit whale’s $200M Trump-Tariff windfall turns into $250M Ether loss,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hyperunit-whales-gain-turn-to-250m-loss/,"The crypto trader known as the “Hyperunit whale” rose to prominence after reportedly making about $200 million by shorting major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, just ahead of US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement that triggered the October market crash. The trader has since suffered heavy losses after taking a large long position. The development came to light after blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence revealed that the whale had emptied its entire ETH treasury into Hyperliquid, resulting in estimated losses of around $250 million. The hyperunit whale’s loss incident sparks concerns in the crypto industry Concerning the hyperunit whale’s trending news, recent reports from reliable sources reveal that the Hyperliquid account has been reduced to just $53, wiping out months of profits. This loss was initially observed after the price of Ether drastically declined this week. Ethereum remains structurally bearish , with the price reacting to demand but lacking confirmation of a meaningful trend shift. The interaction between this demand zone, nearby supply levels, and persistent sell-side pressure will be critical in determining whether Ethereum stabilizes or continues lower in the coming sessions. Currently, ETH is trading at $2,418.31, down about 10.31% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Following this finding, on-chain analysts issued a warning alleging that the whale was moving into a more risky position at a time when the price of ETH declined across this month. They made this statement after recently released reports illustrated more than $130 million in unrealized losses. Initially, the trader drew attention in October of last year when on-chain analyst Eye connected wallet activity to Garrett Jin, the co-founder of WaveLabs and GroupFi, who previously served as the co-founder and vice president of BitForex. Notably, this move was made possible through the use of ENS domains “ereignis.eth” and “garrettjin.eth.” Seeing the situation grow intense, GroupFi’s co-founder refused to acknowledge ownership of the funds, claiming he was aware of the person responsible for the trades. To further clarify on this point, Jin argued that, “the fund isn’t mine – it’s my clients’.” Several crypto investors raise concerns about the Hyperunit whale’s move Earlier in October last year, the whale established short positions totaling more than $1 billion, specifically in BTC and ether. This scenario occurred just before Trump announced 100% tariffs on imports from China. The timing fueled speculation regarding potential insider knowledge, but no evidence of misconduct has emerged. Afterwards, a significant market crash occurred, resulting in more than $18 billion in liquidations across the crypto industry. Immediately after this substantial gain, the trader adopted long positions. Following this decision, data from Arkham published in mid-January demonstrated that the whale established a long position on Ethereum worth more than $730 million. At the same time, the total investments in ETH, SOL, and BTC exceeded $900 million. Nonetheless, the crypto market saw sharp price declines this week, prompting the Hyperunit whale to sell all their holdings. Following this decision, the whale was left with only $53 in their Hyperliquid account, even though data from Arkham showed that the account holds $2.7 billion in other cryptocurrencies. In the meantime, amid this significant loss in the crypto market, several crypto investors have raised concerns about the risks of leveraged trading, even among market experts.

The previous decade has seen the leaders in the industry manage to hold on to their momentum, but a new generation of capital is pouring in to make specialized utility protocols. On-chain data indicate a mass rotation of large-scale investor portfolios. They are abandoning old-school coins which have reached a limit and are shifting to new platforms with new technology and definite space to develop. This trend indicates that the forward cycle will not be hyped but functional decentralized finance systems. The old guard is undergoing structural challenges hence a new breed of protocols is poised to assume the lead. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is trading at an approximation of $0.32 with a market capitalization of about $12 billion. However, its price action has not been set on fire since the network has always worked on academic research and the consistent growth. ADA is also meeting a stiff resistance band between $0.35 and $0.40. The future remains bleak to many analysts in regard to ADA in 2026. Forecasts of the price indicate that it may fail to remain above $0.20 end-year. This is mostly because of the slow rate of ecosystem development in comparison to fast-paced ones. With newer networks being able to transact faster and provide more liquid DeFi instruments, Cardano is losing its share of active developers as well as total value locked. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin (BNB) is being traded close to $850 in a large market value of $118 billion. The token is in a state of consolidation despite its good history. It is fiercely resisted at the $880-$ \910 levels. Bearish trends are coming out in the short term as the 50-day moving average starts to decline. Analysts are making low price forecasts in 2026, and some project that prices would decline to the lower 650-700 range. The rationale of such a decline is two-fold. One, the network is subjected to constant regulatory reviews in various areas that restrict institutional inflows. Second, the market cap is so large that it is hard to provide BNB with the explosive gains as cheaper cryptocurrencies may offer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike the case of ADA and BNB, the interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging at an all-time high. The project is undergoing the presale phase and has already amassed above $20.1 million from more than 19,000 investors. Mutuum Finance is working on an advanced lending and borrowing protocol that is based on the Ethereum network. The protocol’s design operates a two-market mechanism that serves every category of a user. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model: with the use of the key assets such as ETH or USDT, one is able to borrow within seconds and deposit the assets back into the liquidity pool. The P2P (Peer-to-peer) market will allow direct loan agreements between users in case of more specific tokens. Such flexibility is precisely what the modern users of DeFi seek. V1 Launch and Revenue-Based Tokenomics This momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catalyzed by the recent activation of the V1 protocol . This pilot implementation enables users to test the mtToken system, where the lenders will be given yield-bearing receipts which will increase in value over time. The platform makes use of high-performance oracles to monitor prices and do liquidation equitably to be accurate. These solid fundamentals have led analysts to estimate the project could increase by 500% from its initial stages as the project heads to its official price of $0.06. The project has already passed a complete security audit with Halborn Security and this gives whales confidence to transfer large sums of capital into the protocol. Roadmap Expansion Mutuum Finance is not only limiting itself to borrowing and lending. It plans to move to Layer-2 networks and an over-collateralized stablecoin native to the roadmap. These measures are essential since they will reduce the cost of transacting and give the users a stable means through which they can work on their debt. The development of its own ecosystem of stable value and fast scaling are placing Mutuum Finance in an advantageous position in the cheap cryptocurrency arena. The final period of presale at $0.04 which is selling like hotcakes is Phase 7, and the time to join the entire repricing is rapidly ending.

Sustained trading above $2 may trigger a breakout, setting the stage for the next significant leg higher. SUI Reaches Stage For Major Money Entry Crypto analyst Crypto Patel, in a recent post, highlighted that SUI is at the same stage where big money typically enters the market, urging traders not to miss this opportunity. According to the weekly chart, the long-term ascending channel remains intact, and price is currently trading near a sell-side liquidity grab close to trendline support, signaling potential accumulation. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Key Support With Strength — Is $2.35 The Next Target? The chart also shows strong weekly demand and a bullish order block between $1.15 and $0.80, indicating that the market structure is poised to turn super bullish if SUI clears higher-timeframe resistance. The current compression phase is a classic setup for expansion, meaning the market is preparing for a potential breakout. Crypto Patel emphasized that smart money tends to buy during compression, while retail often enters after confirmation of the move. If the breakout confirms, projected targets for SUI are $5, $10, and $20, illustrating the potential scale of the next trend. As Crypto Patel puts it, “This is how big trends are built, slowly, then suddenly. Liquidity is cleared, demand is active, and patience gets rewarded.” Price Trading Around $1.28 Altcoinpedia outlined that SUI is currently trading around $1.28, which serves as the anchor for near-term market analysis. The price structure indicates ongoing consolidation above support near $1.50, while resistance is observed around $2.00. This setup reflects a tightening range as buyers and sellers balance, suggesting that a decisive move could be approaching. Related Reading: Sui Restores Service After Major 6-Hour Outage Shook Network Price oscillation within this range highlights that sustained volume expansion above $2.00 could drive the next leg of the trend toward $2.50. Conversely, failure to break this resistance, particularly with shrinking volume, increases the likelihood of a retest of support at $1.50. Should that level fail to hold, price could decline further toward $1.20. Momentum currently resides in a neutral state, reflecting indecision in the market. In a bullish scenario, a clean break above $2.00, confirmed by momentum indicators, would signal trend continuation. On the downside, a breach of support under heavy volume could accelerate selling pressure and confirm a bearish scenario. Traders are advised to use key range boundaries for entries and exits, managing risk around both support and resistance levels. For longer-term investors, it is prudent to wait for a decisive breakout from the current consolidation, which would provide a clearer signal for trend direction and reduce the risk of false moves within the neutral range.

The end of the nine-year ban of corporate crypto investment was announced on January 11 but excitement was short lived as industry players expressed disappointment in the allocation limit. South Korean corporate crypto adviser Rich O told Cryptopolitan that while the move is seen as an improvement, he believes the cap would restrict corporate participation. He said a 5% cap is impractical since price volatility and integrated cash and crypto accounting could push firms, unintentionally, over the limit. “If the price of bitcoin rises significantly, compliance with the limit could force a sale. It’s not a very good rule, given that the defining characteristic of crypto is its volatility and constant price fluctuation.” Rich O suspects authorities are fearful of publicly listed companies adopting a similar crypto playbook to MicroStrategy, which was rebranded to Strategy in 2025. The company has the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with a reported 650,000 bitcoins. He anticipates the government will increase the cap over the coming years. Crypto for corporate survival Iris (Sungyoun) Park, is co-founder of South Korean web3 consultancy firm DELV and an attorney specializing in crypto. She told Cryptopolitan that there is tremendous corporate interest in diversifying portfolios with digital assets. “Diversification is absolutely vital for the survival of companies these days. South Korea is experiencing ongoing disparities in the value of assets which you can see with house prices and gold skyrocketing while the price of bitcoin is not.” She said a lot of companies in Korea are not only interested in holding crypto but also holding stablecoins for settling international trade. “There is a common understanding that crypto is a way to keep up to date with global business.” But Park doesn’t necessarily agree that authorities are in a rush to increase the equity cap as the country is moving to establish spot bitcoin ETF trading as part of its economic growth strategy. Crypto infrastructure as a public good K orean authorities are cautiously integrating crypto into the financial system. However, there are concerns of a growing asymmetry over ownership of crypto infrastructure. The government’s controversial plan to limit major shareholders’ stakes in crypto exchanges to between 15 to 20%. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) have said a cap would help avoid conflicts of interest. FSC Chairman Eog Weon Lee explained that crypto exchanges have become a form of public infrastructure and the cap is needed to align governance standards on crypto exchanges in light of the public role they play. “As crypto exchanges are now officially recognised as part of the financial system, we must create a governance structure that befits their status,” stressed Lee at a press conference on January 28. Stablecoin turf war Rich O stressed the move is not concerned with user protection but rather control over the future distribution of KRW stablecoins. “Government agencies don’t want only a few crypto exchanges, such as Upbit and Bithumb, to have major control over the distribution of upcoming KRW stablecoins.” He said the policy is an attempt to weaken the influence of major shareholders. “They want to diversify ownership by breaking it into smaller shareholders, making crypto exchanges easier to negotiate with or control,” said Rich O. The proposal could force the co-founder of Dunamu and operator of Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Chi Hyung Song, to sell a 10% stake of his existing 25% ownership of Dunamu which equates to some 3 trillion KRW. The ownership cap could also thwart South Korean internet giant Naver’s plans to acquire Dunamu which would see it take control of 100% of Dunamu’s shares. Ownership limits defy global norms The shareholder cap has attracted fierce criticism from the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), which represents South Korea’s five largest cryptocurrency exchanges. They said the restriction would hinder the growth of the industry. At Korea’s National Assembly, a group of scholars argued against the cap, describing it as “excessive” and globally unprecedented. Professor Yoon Kyung Kim from Incheon National University said a diverse ownership base typically emerges as companies grow and raise capital, rather than being imposed at the outset. Innovation is at stake She said artificially ordering shareholder equity restrictions could increase management uncertainty, delay large investment decisions, and ultimately weaken national competitiveness and Korea’s fintech innovation ecosystem. Professor Cheol Woo Moon from Sungkyunkwan University added that forcing shareholders to sell equity could amount to an infringement of the rights of private entrepreneurs and could face legal disputes and constitutional appeals. Corporate crypto analyst Rich O doesn’t believe the proposal will gain momentum. But FSC Chairperson Eok Won Lee said he was committed to implementing the crypto exchange shareholder cap.

After this assertion was made public, analysts warned that the risk of inflation in the euro zone could push the rate further below the target level. Responding to this warning, officials gathered in Frankfurt, the central bank’s seat, raised concerns about this discovery. Despite interest rates remaining unchanged since June and no immediate adjustments expected, officials noted that several important issues still demand their attention. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the Federal Reserve, US President Donald Trump’s threats of new tariffs, and the recent decline of the dollar have all drawn scrutiny since the ECB last set rates on December 18 . ECB officials raise concerns about the fate of the dollar Earlier, Trump said the matter of the dollar’s status does not bother him. His remarks substantially contributed to the US currency’s recent major drop, driving the euro up to around $1.20 for a brief time and setting a new all-time high since 2021. Following this finding, officials from the ECB raised concerns that the change could spark mixed reactions among individuals. At this moment, François Villeroy de Galhau, a crucial member of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, stressed that the euro will be a key determinant of their future monetary policy. On the other hand, Martin Kocher, who also serves on the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, said they will closely monitor the currency for continued upward movement. While the euro became a hot topic of discussion, analysts conducted research and discovered that inflation in the country declined below 2% in December. After several considerations, they forecast that this level will decline further, arguing that the January figures will be approximately 1.7% when the Consumer Price Index data are released on Wednesday, February 11. The European Central Bank also predicted that price growth will naturally hit its target without additional action. However, if the euro continues to surge, it may spark a new round of rate-cut discussions. “Europe has started the year with many geopolitical issues, and the ECB will likely keep its focus on bigger problems instead of smaller ones. This means they will probably overlook the recent US trade conflict involving Greenland, the slight drop in inflation below 2%, and the rising euro. However, these changes highlight that there are growing risks to the economic outlook,” analysts said. The central banks’ decision on interest rates plays a crucial role in the country’s economy Sources pointed out that the ECB is expected to publish quarterly surveys on bank lending and expert economic forecasts soon. Additionally, it is among the central banks scheduled to announce interest-rate decisions this week. Regarding the central bank’s decision on interest rates, reports noted a high likelihood that the UK, Mexico, and the Czech Republic would keep their current rates unchanged. At the same time, India and Poland would reduce theirs. On the other hand, sources pointed to a unique approach by the Reserve Bank of Australia, suggesting it could be the first major central bank to hike rates this year. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that this month’s job report results in the United States will be compared with the Federal Reserve’s view that the labor market is stabilizing following a period of sluggish hiring activity late last year.

The forfeiture was finalized in late January 2026, concluding years of litigation against Helix’s operator, Larry Dean Harmon. Helix’s Illegal Activity and Harmon’s Case Helix, which operated from 2014 to 2017, was marketed as a tumbling service designed to anonymize Bitcoin transactions. Investigators found that it had become a major hub for laundering funds connected to drug trafficking, hacking, and other illegal activities. Court filings show that Helix processed more than 354,468 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $300 million at the time, for its users. Harmon, who also created the darknet search engine Grams, made the platform to integrate directly with major darknet markets. Its Application Programming Interface (API) allowed them to connect the service to their Bitcoin withdrawal systems, earning them a percentage of each transaction as commission and fees. Investigators also traced tens of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds from several darknet markets through the mixing service. The Ohio-based operator of Helix was first charged in 2020 with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. In August 2021, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and was sentenced in November 2024 to 36 months in prison, three years of supervised release, a monetary forfeiture judgment, and seized assets. On January 21, 2026, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a final forfeiture order, officially transferring the assets to the government. Regulators Ease Crackdown on Crypto Mixers The Helix case is part of a broader regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency mixers and privacy tools. Platforms such as Tornado Cash have also faced sanctions and enforcement actions in recent years. While crypto advocates maintain that these services can offer legitimate privacy protections, authorities continue to focus on their potential use in criminal activity. In a related development, blockchain entrepreneur and Coin Center fellow Michael Lewellen filed a lawsuit last year challenging the DOJ, seeking a ruling that his non-custodial crypto crowdfunding platform, Pharos, does not violate money transmission laws. The legal action argues that software developers creating non-custodial privacy tools are being unfairly targeted. The Justice Department later announced it would no longer pursue criminal cases against crypto exchanges, developers, or users for regulatory violations. This development follows the disbanding of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), the specialized unit responsible for investigating crypto-related criminal activity.

It was trading at $78,678 on Sunday, down sharply from its all-time high of $126,300. Ethereum price crashed to $2,400, while Binance Coin (BNB) fell to $770. The market capitalization of all tokens dropped by over 5.80% in the last 24 hours to $2.67 trillion. This article explores some of the top reasons behind the ongoing crypto crash. Crypto market crash happened after Trump nominated Kevin Warsh One of the main reasons behind the ongoing crypto market crash is that Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to become the next Federal Reserve Chair when Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. Warsh has recently supported the crypto industry. However, his support was likely because he really wanted the Federal Reserve Chairman job as he has previously blasted the industry. The same is true with his views on interest rates. In his recent interviews, he has come out in support of lower interest rates. In reality, however, Warsh has always been an interest rate and inflation hawk. He voted against interest rate cuts and quantitative easing policies in 2011. Most importantly, he has always maintained his opposition to quantitative easing. Therefore, analysts believe that Warsh will maintain a hawkish view when he moves to the Federal Reserve just as Jerome Powell did. Soaring liquidations fuelled the crypto crash The other main reason for the crypto market crash is the soaring liquidations and falling futures open interest. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the futures open interest dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours to $113 billion. At the same time, liquidations jumped by 348% in the last 24 hours to over $2.5 billion, the biggest increase in months. Ethereum liquidations jumped to over $1.1 billion, while Bitcoin rose to over $785 million. Solana positions worth over $197 million, while XRP positions worth $61 million were liquidated. These liquidations brought memories of October 10 when the crypto market experienced the biggest liquidation on record. Positions worth over $20 billion were wiped out on October 10 when Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China. Rising geopolitical tensions The crypto market crash is happening because of the rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. Trump has threatened to attack Iran soon because of the recent protests in the country. An attack on Iran would be bearish for the crypto market because of the impact on the energy market. Data shows that Brent, the global benchmark, has jumped to $70 for the first time in months. The crypto market crash is also happening because Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset has been debunked. Instead, investors have moved to other safe-haven assets like the Swiss franc and gold, which have soared in the past few months. Bitcoin price technicals have contributed to the crash BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals have also contributed to the ongoing crypto crash. The weekly timeframe chart above shows that the coin formed a rising wedge pattern. It also formed a bearish flag pattern, and moved below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Supertrend indicator. This pattern often leads to more downside, which will lead to more downside for Bitcoin and the crypto market.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-exchange-outflows-jump-330-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has highlighted a notable development in XRP’s on-chain data, reporting a 330% surge in exchange outflows in early January 2026. In a recent post, the analyst stated that the scale of XRP being removed from exchanges indicates substantial buying activity taking place behind the scenes. The chart attached to the post shows repeated spikes in outflows, suggesting that large holders are actively moving XRP into private custody. The timing of this movement is particularly notable given the recent volatility in XRP’s price. During the same period, when exchange outflows accelerated, XRP declined from levels near $2.40 to the $1.75 range. Despite the pullback, the pace of XRP leaving exchanges remained elevated, pointing to accumulation rather than distribution. $XRP OUTFLOWS SURGED +330%. SOMEONE IS BUYING LOADS! pic.twitter.com/cYuhrq5O5m — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 30, 2026 Price Volatility Contrasts With Holder Behavior The data shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO shows a clear divergence between short-term price action and wallet behavior. While prices saw sharp swings and failed to sustain earlier highs, exchange balances continued to fall. This pattern suggests that buyers were using price weakness to build positions instead of reacting to near-term market moves. An X user, Big Stack Bull, commented on the post by noting that exchanges are becoming lighter while individual wallets are growing heavier. This observation aligns with historical on-chain trends, in which sustained outflows often coincide with consolidation phases rather than immediate price rallies. Institutional Custody and ETF Influence One factor contributing to the persistent exchange outflows is the continued growth of spot XRP exchange-traded funds. Since their launch in late 2025, these products have required XRP to be held in custodial storage rather than left on trading platforms. As a result, ETF inflows naturally reduce exchange balances even when the price remains under pressure. This shift toward custody-based holding changes how XRP circulates in the market. Assets held for ETF exposure are less likely to re-enter exchanges quickly, reducing the amount of XRP readily available for active trading. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Outflow Surge While a 330 percent increase in exchange outflows is significant, it represents a sharp percentage change rather than a transformation of XRP’s total circulating supply. XRP remains one of the most liquid digital assets, with daily trading volumes still exceeding individual outflow events. However, declining exchange balances can increase market sensitivity over time. The data highlighted by STEPH IS CRYPTO suggests that ownership dynamics are shifting. As XRP continues to move off exchanges and into long-term custody, short-term price behavior may become less reflective of underlying accumulation trends.

Drawing on personal recollection, Schwartz noted that when XRP traded at approximately $0.006, the idea of reaching $0.25 appeared implausible to many participants. He recalled that the milestone was treated almost humorously at the time, with community members holding a “$0.25 party” and openly joking about how unrealistic a $1 valuation seemed. Schwartz suggested that price targets that once appeared extreme can later become historical footnotes, reframing how current expectations may eventually be viewed. His remarks did not include a prediction or timeline, but rather emphasized perspective. By pointing to how sentiment shifted as XRP appreciated from fractions of a cent to materially higher levels, Schwartz implied that disbelief has been a recurring feature throughout the asset’s market history. When XRP was $0.006, a price of $0.25 felt about as ridiculous as $100 does today. We had a $0.25 party and joked about how impossible $1 seemed. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 30, 2026 Debate Over Market Conditions Then and Now Schwartz’s reflection prompted varied responses, focusing on whether past comparisons remain valid in the present environment. Les Purves challenged the implied parallel, arguing that XRP’s earlier price increases occurred when the digital asset market was still emerging, and adoption was in its early stages. According to Purves, today’s market is shaped by deeper liquidity, clearer regulatory frameworks, increased competition, and a much larger overall scale. He maintained that these differences make direct comparisons between early price milestones and recent expectations inappropriate. This perspective reframed Schwartz’s historical account as informative but not necessarily predictive, highlighting that structural changes in the market may limit the rate at which past behavior can be used to assess future outcomes. Interpretations of Utility and Repricing Another response, from a commenter identified as Lea, focused on the underlying implication of Schwartz’s remarks rather than the numerical comparison itself. Lea interpreted the post as suggesting that XRP’s long-term repricing would not only be driven by belief or sentiment. Instead, she argued that meaningful price adjustment would occur only if the financial system reached a point at which it could not function without the asset. In her view, the market is currently operating as intended, and any eventual repricing would be abrupt rather than gradual once such dependency is established. This interpretation framed Schwartz’s comments as a broader observation about utility-driven valuation rather than market optimism.

Crypto Bitlord offered a sharply critical response, asserting that many holders genuinely believed in XRP during its early years. He stated that hearing skepticism from individuals involved in building the technology was troubling. He suggested that this disbelief explained why large amounts of XRP were sold as prices rose from around $0.10 to above $3. According to Crypto Bitlord, these sales occurred at the expense of long-term holders who maintained confidence in the asset. Together, the comments illustrate how a brief historical reflection from Schwartz reopened longstanding disagreements over belief, utility, and responsibility, underscoring how XRP’s past continues to shape interpretations of its future.

The project at the center of the reporting is World Liberty Financial, a crypto initiative associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump and his family. While the company has promoted itself as a private-sector crypto venture, recent disclosures suggest a significant portion of its backing may trace to the United Arab Emirates. According to multiple media reports ,the investments do not represent an official position of the UAE government. Instead, they involve private entities and networks linked to influential figures within Abu Dhabi’s ruling elite. Still, the scale of the funding has intensified debate in Washington over transparency and foreign participation in politically connected crypto projects. Abu Dhabi Links Emerge Through Private Vehicles The Wall Street Journal reported that a vehicle connected to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a senior Abu Dhabi royal, secretly acquired a large stake in World Liberty Financial. The report said the investment amounted to roughly $500 million and gave the affiliated entity close to half of the project’s equity. Separately, Reuters earlier reported that the Aqua 1 Foundation, based in the UAE, purchased $100 million worth of World Liberty’s governance tokens, known as WLFI. At the time, the tokens were described as non-tradable and designed to provide voting rights rather than immediate financial returns. Together, the reports fueled headlines describing “UAE royal family” involvement. However, coverage has emphasized that the investments appear tied to individual royals or private foundations, not sovereign wealth funds acting in an official capacity. Political Scrutiny and Crypto Implications The disclosures have prompted concern among U.S. lawmakers, particularly Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, who warned that politically linked crypto ventures could become channels for foreign influence. In a July 2025 memo, committee staff cited World Liberty Financial as an example of how opaque token structures could complicate oversight. World Liberty Financial has not publicly detailed the full list of its investors. However, the project has said it complies with U.S. laws and rejects claims that foreign participation creates political leverage. The episode underscores a broader shift in crypto markets, where digital assets increasingly intersect with global power, private capital, and politics. As stablecoins and governance tokens attract large international investors, regulators face mounting pressure to clarify disclosure standards, especially when political figures sit close to the center of the transaction.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-01 07:02:40

The timing stands out because all three assets are falling together in a clear risk-off market, pushed by a stronger US dollar, unwinding of leveraged positions, and changing expectations for US monetary policy. Bitcoin’s drop comes after a volatile January. Gold and silver are also falling after historic rallies that accelerated at the end of the year. This synchronized decline points to broad de-risking, not just weakness in one asset. Bitcoin News: Liquidations and Policy Shifts Pressure BTC Bitcoin has dropped about 6 to 7% in the last 24 hours, briefly reaching the $76,000 to $77,000 range during low weekend trading. Over $1 billion in leveraged positions have been liquidated across crypto markets, speeding up the decline. Several factors are hurting market sentiment: Reduced expectations for ultra-loose US policy following President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair A firmer US dollar pressuring risk assets Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, including US-Iran developments Continued ETF outflows and institutional de-risking Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” is being questioned because it is falling along with traditional safe havens, rather than moving differently from them. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Can BTC Hold $78K Support? Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is strongly bearish as BTC is at a key turning point. The daily chart shows BTC dropping below a long-term downward trendline, which means sellers are still in control. The recent attempt to rebound toward $98,000 was firmly stopped below the 100-day and 200-day EMAs, starting a new downward move. The price is now back in the $80,400 to $78,300 range, which was previously a double-bottom base. Returning to this area increases the risk that the pattern will fail instead of moving higher. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is still weak. The RSI has dropped below 30, which means the market is oversold, but there is no sign of a bullish reversal. In trending markets, this usually means the trend will continue instead of reversing. There are two main possible scenarios: A relief bounce toward $84,000–$86,000, where broken support and the descending trendline now act as resistance Failure to reclaim that zone, opening downside toward $75,800, then $71,600 if selling accelerates For a positive recovery, Bitcoin would need to stay above $78,000, then form a higher low and move back above $86,000. This could open the way to $94,000 later on. Gold and Silver: Record Rallies Meet Violent Reversals Gold and silver have also dropped sharply after big gains. Gold went above $5,500 per ounce but has now fallen back to the $4,800 to $4,900 range because of profit-taking and a stronger dollar. Silver, which rose past $120, has dropped even more, falling to the $80 to $85 range as traders closed out speculative positions. While both metals remain well above early-2025 levels, the speed of the reversal highlights how crowded the trade had become. Outlook: Volatility First, Opportunity Later Right now, Bitcoin is resetting its structure, clearing out leverage and testing long-term demand. If it stays above $78,000, a broader recovery could start. If not, lower prices may come before confidence returns. In markets this volatile, patience is often more valuable than trying to predict what will happen next. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $31.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013665 before the next increase.

In a recent post, Aljarrah stated that the next global payment system will be digital and that XRP will be used to move gold-backed value in real time. He emphasized that his commentary is based on observable developments rather than popular belief, urging readers to continue preparing for structural change. The statement was accompanied by a detailed article outlining why Aljarrah believes the world is approaching a new Bretton Woods-style reset, driven by unsustainable debt levels, financial instability, and declining confidence in fiat-based systems. Gold already killed the dollar. People just haven’t realized it. The next payment system will be digital, and $XRP will move gold in real time. I report what’s happening, not what people believe. Keep preparing. https://t.co/hU5SuZZLw9 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 30, 2026 Debt, Asset Inflation, and Structural Fragility In the article, Aljarrah explains that global debt has reached a level that cannot be fully repaid under the current credit-based monetary structure. He argues that every unit of currency in circulation represents someone else’s liability, making it mathematically impossible for all obligations to be settled at once. According to Aljarrah, this creates a system that depends on constant expansion of debt to remain functional. Any attempt to halt that expansion without a reset would result in widespread defaults, bank failures, and systemic collapse. He further contends that authorities have relied on asset inflation to preserve the appearance of stability. Rising prices in equities, bonds, and real estate, he argues, are not evidence of economic strength but a mechanism to keep collateral values high enough to prevent failures across the financial system. In his view, central bank interventions and bailouts are aimed primarily at sustaining this illusion of solvency. Gold as Trust and XRP as Liquidity Aljarrah positions gold as the anchor of trust in countries where fiat currencies face devaluation. He notes that gold’s scarcity and resistance to debasement make it a suitable neutral reference point during a monetary reset. He points to increasing central bank gold accumulation as a signal that institutions are preparing for such a transition. At the same time, he argues that trust alone is insufficient for a modern global system. Efficient, instant movement of capital is required to prevent market paralysis during periods of repricing or restructuring. Aljarrah identifies XRP as the mechanism designed to meet that need, describing it as infrastructure capable of transferring liquidity instantly and at a global scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Preparing for a Reset According to Aljarrah, the convergence of rising debt, asset inflation policies, gold accumulation, and the push toward digital settlement all indicate that the existing system cannot endure indefinitely. He maintains that a coordinated reset centered on gold for value stability and XRP for liquidity movement represents a logical response to a structural problem that cannot be solved through additional borrowing or monetary expansion. For those observing these developments, Aljarrah’s message is that the transition is already underway, and positioning depends on recognizing its underlying drivers.

Even so, the weekly chart still keeps price inside a rising channel, with key support now under pressure. Bitcoin Pullback Fits Long-Term Channel as Weekly Chart Tests Key Support Bitcoin's move back into the high-$70,000 range aligns with a broader technical correction visible on the weekly chart, rather than a breakdown of its long-term uptrend. The chart shows Bitcoin pulling back inside a rising price channel that has guided the market for several years. After peaking near the upper boundary of that channel, price rolled over and retraced toward the mid-range support area. This behavior mirrors earlier corrective phases marked on the chart, where sharp advances gave way to controlled pullbacks without breaking the dominant structure. Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar 1W Chart. Source: christophercolumbus via X The current decline also overlaps with a Fibonacci retracement cluster. Price has moved into the zone between the 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels of the latest advance, an area that previously acted as resistance before flipping into support. On the chart, this region sits near the lower half of the channel and aligns with the zone labeled “technical correction,” reinforcing its importance. Earlier cycles on the same chart show a similar pattern. During parabolic phases, Bitcoin corrected deeply but remained above the channel base, labeled as “parabolic correction.” In contrast, the present move appears more measured, staying well above the lower boundary and closer to the channel’s midpoint. That distinction suggests the market is digesting gains rather than unwinding the broader trend. If price stabilizes within this band, the structure supports a continuation scenario where Bitcoin resumes higher highs after consolidation. However, a sustained weekly close below the channel midpoint would shift focus toward the lower channel support, increasing the risk of a deeper retracement toward the 0.5 or 0.618 Fibonacci levels. For now, the weekly chart frames the decline as a technical reset inside a long-term growth channel. The next few weekly closes should clarify whether this zone holds as support or gives way to a more extended corrective phase. Bitcoin Drop Flushes Leverage as Liquidation Heatmap Shows Heavy Long Wipeout Bitcoin’s sharp move lower over the past 24 hours coincided with a broad liquidation event on Binance, as leveraged long positions were forced out across multiple price levels. The liquidation heatmap shows dense clusters of liquidations forming above price during the early phase of the move, particularly between the $82,000 and $84,000 zones. As Bitcoin failed to reclaim those levels, selling pressure intensified and triggered cascading liquidations, accelerating the downside move. The concentration of bright bands in that range suggests a large buildup of long leverage that became vulnerable once price broke lower. Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (24 Hour). Source: CoinGlass As Bitcoin slid through the $80,000 handle, liquidation activity shifted downward. The chart highlights another notable pocket of forced closures near the $78,000 to $79,000 area, where price briefly paused before continuing lower. This behavior reflects a typical deleveraging pattern, where initial liquidations weaken market structure and expose deeper levels to further stress. Following the flush, liquidation intensity dropped sharply. Below roughly $77,000, the heatmap shows thinner bands, indicating that a significant portion of excess leverage had already been cleared. Price action also stabilized, with Bitcoin entering a narrower range and showing slower, more controlled movement compared with the earlier selloff. The remaining liquidity now appears more balanced, with fewer concentrated liquidation levels directly overhead. That shift suggests the market has reduced immediate downside pressure from forced selling. However, overhead zones near prior liquidation clusters may still act as resistance if price attempts to rebound, as traders who were liquidated often re-enter cautiously or sell into strength.

While Bitcoin and other major altcoins are also falling, Ethereum’s losses are steeper in percentage terms. ETH has dropped about 9 to 10% in the last 24 hours, and trading volume has jumped above $50 billion. This suggests panic selling rather than normal profit-taking. Low liquidity and high leverage have made the sell-off worse, speeding up losses as the weekend approaches. $2.5Billion Liquidations and Large Holder Selling Are Pushing Prices Down Aggressive forced liquidations have driven the sell-off. Over $2.5 billion in crypto positions were wiped out in one day, with Ethereum making up the biggest portion. Because many traders were betting on prices going up, ETH became vulnerable when key support levels broke, leading to a wave of margin calls. Cryptocurrency Liquidation History Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, large investors and institutions have added to the selling pressure. After months of buying, big holders are now reducing their positions. ETF flows and derivatives also show that investors are trying to lower their risk. As the total crypto market cap drops toward $2.6 trillion and fear levels stay high, market sentiment is still weak. Ethereum Price Outlook: ETH Drops to $2,400 as Downtrend Speeds Up Looking at the charts, Ethereum price prediction is clearly in a bearish phase. The daily chart shows ETH stuck in a downward channel that has shaped its price since late 2025. The price was rejected at the $3,200 to $3,300 area, just below the falling 100-day and 200-day moving averages, ending the last attempt to stabilize. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview When ETH fell below $2,800, which had been a key support level, it confirmed that the downtrend is continuing. Recent price bars show strong selling pressure, with little sign that sellers are running out of steam. Momentum indicators also show weakness. The RSI has fallen into the mid-20s, which means ETH is deeply oversold but there are no signs of a reversal yet. In strong downtrends, this usually means selling could continue for now. Important Price Levels and What to Expect Next Looking at possible price paths, there are two main scenarios. ETH could see a short-term bounce up to $2,600 to $2,700, where old support and the lower channel now act as resistance. If ETH can’t move above that area, prices could fall to $2,250 next, and possibly $2,100 if selling picks up. A more positive outlook will take time. Ethereum needs to hold above $2,400, set a higher low, and close above $2,800 to start a recovery toward $3,100 to $3,300 later on. For now, ETH seems to be going through a leverage reset, which is tough but often needed before a stronger recovery can happen. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

Ripple’s XRP was not spared as it plunged to its lowest position since November 2024 (on most exchanges) at just over $1.50. It has rebounded slightly since then and now sits above $1.60, but the overall sentiment continues to be highly bearish. CryptoWZRD, for example, outlined the token’s bearish closure against the greeback. However, the analyst with over 100,000 followers on X outlined the first positive news for XRP in a while – the closure against BTC. They noted that the XRP/BTC pair closed with a “dragonfly doji,” which is generally considered a bullish move.

They believe the flash crash on Saturday was likely a liquidity grab that could result in an immediate bounce. However, there’s also the chance for a dead-cat bounce that could lead to another retracement, which would be a second liquidity grab. If history rhymes, though, the analyst envisions a massive rally in the following months of up to 1,600% as it happened after a similar structure formed in the 2017 cycle. If such a run indeed transpires now, XRP could skyrocket to well within double-digit price territory, which appears rather unthinkable at the moment, but the asset has proven in the past that it’s capable of similar rallies. #XRP – 33 EMA Breakdown ≠ Game Over (UPDATE): On the monthly chart, #XRP just tagged the Central Line + 33 EMA around $1.60–$1.61 ( The Dip was to $1.50) It held the close above $1.60, swept liquidity near $1.64, and opened February at $1.66.

Now ETH sits in a high-activity trading band, where the next reaction should shape the short-term direction. Ethereum Pulls Back Toward Long Term Trendline as Volume Profile Marks Key Trading Zone Ethereum extended its pullback on the daily chart, trading near $2,535 after a sharp red candle that showed a roughly 6% session drop on the Bitstamp feed. The chart still frames the move as a retracement from the August 2025 peak near $5,000, which some analysts label as the cycle’s latest higher high. Ethereum / U.S. Dollar 1D Chart (Bitstamp). Source: TradingView (Leo Lanza) Crypto analyst Leo Lanza argued that the decline since that $5,000 area can still fit an uptrend if price holds a higher low structure. On his chart, Ethereum is now approaching a rising long term trend channel that starts around March 2020. He noted the channel has only two major touch points so far, meaning it still needs confirmation before traders can treat it as a reliable boundary. The volume profile on the right side of the chart highlights where trading concentrated across price levels. Lanza described low volume nodes as zones where price often rejects quickly, because fewer trades occurred there historically. He described high volume nodes as acceptance areas, where heavier activity can slow price and create consolidation. On the current view, Ethereum sits inside a high volume node, suggesting the market has traded heavily in this region and may treat it as a decision zone rather than a clean air pocket. If price slips into the marked low volume area, moves can become faster in either direction, because liquidity thins and prior trading interest drops. For now, the chart signals a market testing support and structure, with confirmation depending on how Ethereum behaves around the long term trendline and the high volume band. Ethereum Slides to 200 Week Average as Traders Watch for a Bull Response Ethereum fell sharply after the latest weekly candle printed a steep drop on the chart. The move pushed ETH down to its 200 week moving average, a long watched level that often acts as a long term trend gauge during deep pullbacks. Ethereum / U.S. Dollar Weekly Chart. Source: TradingView (StockTrader Max) Market commentator StockTrader Max said this is the spot where bulls “have to show up,” arguing that a bounce from the 200 WMA would quickly improve the chart’s look. His view focuses on the idea that long term buyers often defend this average when the market tests it after extended declines. The chart also shows Ethereum slipping under shorter trend measures during the selloff. The 50 week moving average sits above current price, while the 200 week line sits closer to spot, tightening the area into a high pressure zone where momentum can either stabilize or extend lower. If Ethereum holds the 200 week average and reclaims nearby levels on follow through, the move would read as a support test rather than a trend break. However, if price fails to bounce and keeps closing below the long term average, the chart would signal that sellers still control the market and that prior support has weakened.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-02-01 07:41:28

Key Takeaways: Bitmine is sitting on over $6B in unrealized ETH losses after the market downturn. Thin liquidity and leverage drove Ether down toward $2,300. Analysts expect a slow reset before confidence returns to crypto markets. The losses widened after Bitmine acquired an additional 40,302 Ether last week, lifting its total holdings to over 4.24 million ETH. Data from Dropstab shows the firm’s Ether position is now valued at roughly $9.6 billion at current prices, down sharply from an estimated peak of $13.9 billion in October. Thin Liquidity and Leverage Pressure Push Ether Toward $2,300 The drawdown comes amid a broader market sell-off that has weighed heavily on major digital assets. Ether prices slid toward the $2,300 level over the weekend, a move that market observers linked to thinning liquidity and elevated leverage. Analysts at The Kobeissi Letter said fragile market depth left prices vulnerable to sudden gaps lower, with crowded positioning accelerating the decline once selling pressure emerged. The result has been a swift erosion of paper gains for firms holding large, concentrated crypto reserves. The setback marks a sharp contrast from the optimism that surrounded crypto markets earlier in the cycle. Lee, who has been a long-time advocate of digital assets, has recently cautioned that near-term conditions have deteriorated. He warned that 2026 could begin on a difficult footing as markets continue to digest the effects of deleveraging that followed October’s $19 billion liquidation event, which reset risk appetite across the sector. Despite the losses, Lee has maintained that longer-term fundamentals for crypto remain intact, arguing that the current phase represents a painful adjustment rather than a structural breakdown. 2026 is shaping up to be similar to 2025: – good fundamentals – tariff escalations and White House picking “winners and losers” – political divisiveness – tailwinds from AI and blockchain BUT: dovish Fed now and QT over And so a painful decline may lie ahead but we would… https://t.co/7Mp3rcOcP1 — Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) January 20, 2026 That view was echoed in a recent market outlook from Wintermute , which said a durable recovery will require renewed momentum in Bitcoin and Ether, broader participation from exchange-traded funds and expanded corporate treasury adoption. Wintermute also pointed to the absence of retail inflows as a key constraint. With many investors drawn to faster-growing themes such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, crypto markets may struggle to regain their previous wealth effect until confidence and liquidity return. Ethereum Foundation Makes Quantum-Resistant Security a Strategic Priority As reported, the Ethereum Foundation has elevated post-quantum security to a core strategic focus, forming a dedicated Post Quantum team and committing $2 million to the effort. Announced by Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, the initiative will be led by Thomas Coratger alongside Emile, a contributor to leanVM. Drake said the foundation has been working on quantum-resilience research quietly for years, dating back to early discussions in 2019, before formally making it a top-level priority. The foundation’s plan spans research, development, and ecosystem coordination. This includes new developer calls focused on user-facing security, two $1 million cryptography prize programs, active multi-client post-quantum testing networks, and a series of global workshops aimed at accelerating collaboration and readiness across the Ethereum ecosystem.

Bitcoin Closes 4 Consecutive Months in the Red,https://cryptopotato.com/what-bull-market-bitcoin-closes-4-consecutive-months-in-the-red/,"It’s hard to imagine now that just a few months ago, bitcoin was riding high, investors were hopeful about ‘Uptober,’ and the bulls dominated the market. In that not-so-distant past, the cryptocurrency was trading confidently within a six-digit price territory, and had just printed a new all-time high above $126,000. The community was full of new predictions about $150,000 or $200,000 by the end of the year, based on historical performances. The Monthly Closures in Red The reality, though, was different. And brutal. Instead of going to those levels, BTC nosedived on October 10/11 in a $19B-wipeout, and the trend turned for the worse as the cryptocurrency was never actually able to recover from that crash. In fact, bitcoin ended 2025 in the red for the first time in a post-halving year. 2026 began with more hopes of a rebound and a renewed run, but they were halted mid-month when BTC was stopped at $95,000 and driven south hard. It was first pushed below $90,000, but that was just the beginning as the losses kept coming. It dumped to $81,000 during last week, bounced off to $84,000, only to be rejected on Saturday. In the span of just several hours, bitcoin’s calamity worsened , and it slumped to roughly $75,000, leaving billions worth of liquidations. This meant that it had lost $20,000 in less than two weeks. Data from CoinGlass shows that bitcoin closed January with a 10.17% loss, even though it rebounded slightly from that low. This made it the fourth consecutive month closed in the red and the worst since November. Bitcoin Monthly Performance. Source: CoinGlass What Bull Market? Most crypto analysts have been split since October on whether the ongoing market phase is actually a bull market. But the data from above clearly demonstrates that BTC’s behavior is more in line with how it performs during bear cycles. After all, the last time it had four or more consecutive months in the red was at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. At the time, BTC was digging new lows time and time again, before it finally bottomed in January after the sixth month in the red in a row. If history is to repeat itself now, the cryptocurrency has more room for losses before it finally stages a notable recovery as it did seven years ago. Nevertheless, the light at the end of the tunnel shows that bitcoin might be due for a more favorable Q2 and Q3 if we rely on history. If we don’t, good news could come as soon as February, as most analysts agree that the four-year cycle has been broken and BTC now operates in a different manner. The post What Bull Market?

Analysts at Kobeissi note there have been three notable liquidation events in the past 12 hours, resulting in a combined loss of $1.3 billion. Such developments, coupled with a very fearful market after last week’s price slump, have pushed Bitcoin below a key price level. According to the renowned market expert Burak Kesmeci, Bitcoin’s behavior towards this $80,000 price zone holds significant consequences for the market trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Spikes To New High — Fresh Volatility Ahead? Bitcoin Slips Under ETF Realized Price As Downside Risk Grows In a recent X post, Burak Kesmeci outlines the technical and on-chain importance of the $80,000 price level to the Bitcoin market. Before Bitcoin’s recent breakdown below $80,000, the asset had twice retested this zone following the correction phase that began in early October 2025. Each successful rebound from these retests reinforced $80,000 as a critical support level, with certain chart formations even hinting at potential trend reversal. This underscored the market’s technical sensitivity to this level before the recent loss. However, Kesmeci highlights an on-chain importance of the $80,000 price point in that it also functions as the cost basis of the Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Therefore, the recent price fall below $80,000 places a large cohort of institutional investors at risk of entering unrealized losses. In January 2026 alone, the Bitcoin ETFs already witnessed massive levels of withdrawals, resulting in a total net outflow of $1.61 billion. However, these figures are likely to surge higher as sustained price decline below the ETF cost basis is expected to trigger a wide-scale, panic-driven redemption among investors. In addition to its on-chain and technical importance, Kesmeci also notes that $80,000 presently functions as the True Market Mean. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy Signal For XRP On Key Price Condition – Analyst What Next For Bitcoin? According to Burak Kesmeci, a bearish scenario would require a weekly close below the $80,000 support level. If confirmed, the analyst warns that bearish momentum could intensify, potentially driving Bitcoin lower toward $72,000, $68,000, and eventually $62,000 in sequence. This is because these levels align with notable volume profile clusters, representing potential areas where liquidity could accumulate, and the price may temporarily stabilize. Conversely, in a bullish scenario, Kesmeci notes that a sustained rebound from current levels could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. The first major upside hurdle lies at $90,000, followed by the 111-period Simple Moving Average (SMA111) near $95,000, which is described as a critical level for confirming a medium-term trend reversal. A decisive break above the psychological $100,000 resistance would further strengthen the bullish case and signal a potential resumption of the broader uptrend. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $77,832, reflecting a 7.1% loss in the past day.

JUST IN: Dave Portnoy buys another $1,000,000 of $XRP and $500,000 of $BTC , says ""crypto is crashing, blood in the streets, that's when you buy."" pic.twitter.com/nEF9lMpoBO — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) January 30, 2026 Portnoy’s On-Camera Explanation In a video attached to the post, Portnoy explained his reasoning in direct terms. He stated repeatedly that crypto markets were falling and described this environment as the point at which he prefers to buy. Portnoy said he accessed his Kraken account and purchased what he described as another $1 million worth of XRP, clarifying that it was an addition to an existing position. He also disclosed buying $500,000 of Bitcoin at $82,000. Portnoy went on to describe short-term price movements following the purchase. He noted that XRP moved from around 1.79 to approximately 1.74 shortly after his buy, a development he acknowledged was not ideal. Despite this, he said he retained additional capital and expressed readiness to continue adding to his positions if prices continued to fall. His remarks suggested a willingness to tolerate volatility in pursuit of longer-term positioning. Positioning as a Risk-Taking Investor The tone of Portnoy’s remarks solidified his position as a contrarian investor who regards abrupt sell-offs as potential entry points. He emphasized the importance of having capital and deploying it incrementally during downturns, rather than concentrating on immediate price reactions. The video emphasized his conviction that investors willing to endure additional losses should not refrain from investing solely due to declining prices. This method is consistent with a general philosophy that is frequently associated with risk-tolerant market participants who prioritize accumulation during periods of pessimism, even when short-term outcomes remain uncertain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Reaction and Commentary The post also included a response from BFM Times, which characterized Portnoy’s move as a classic contrarian stance. The outlet noted that when overall sentiment becomes deeply negative, long-term participants often begin to step in, while also cautioning that accurately identifying market bottoms remains difficult. The comment placed Portnoy’s actions within a wider context of investor behavior during market stress, highlighting both the rationale and the risks associated with such timing-based decisions. Together, the tweet, video, and commentary present a clear picture of Portnoy’s current outlook: a willingness to commit significant capital to XRP and Bitcoin during a period of market weakness, based on the idea that sell-offs caused by fear might create opportunities rather than stopping them.

The sudden drop wiped out more than $2 billion from the overall crypto market, leaving investors scratching their heads about whether the worst is behind them or still coming. The digital currency has crept back up a bit since then, sitting at $78,690 as of publication, according to CoinMarketCap . However, it is still way down from where it was. Bitcoin topped out at $126,100 on Oct. 5, which means it’s lost about 38% from that record high. Factors behind the weekend slide Market observers noted that a “perfect storm” of geopolitical and macroeconomic events exacerbated the volatility. Sentiment swiftly shifted after President Donald Trump selected former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell. Traders were concerned that Warsh could attempt to shrink the Fed’s balance sheet , which might limit the liquidity that has historically fueled increases in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, risk-on assets were rocked by reports of an explosion at Iran’s Bandar Abbas port, a vital international shipping gateway. Because the port manages a significant amount of the world’s oil traffic, the ensuing uncertainty drove investors to gold and other safe-haven assets, making Bitcoin susceptible to the massive sell-off that led to widespread liquidations. Analyst sees potential market bottom PlanC, a Bitcoin analyst, thinks Saturday’s drop might actually be the low point for this market cycle. “Decent chance this will be the deepest pullback opportunity this Bitcoin bull run,” PlanC wrote on X Saturday . He’s seen this kind of thing before, pointing to the 2018 bear market when Bitcoin fell to $3,000, the March 2020 crash that brought it down to around $5,100, and the FTX and Luna meltdowns that sent prices to roughly $15,500 and $17,500. “There is a decent chance we are going through another major capitulation low as we speak,” PlanC said. He figures the bottom will land somewhere between $75,000 and $80,000. But Rajat Soni, a Bitcoin advocate and financial accountant, isn’t buying into weekend panic. “Never trust a weekend pump OR dump,” Soni posted on X Saturday. Crypto markets get pretty wild on weekends, he noted, and traders shouldn’t read too much into it. “Bitcoin will make a comeback when you least expect it,” he added. Some predict further declines ahead Not everyone’s convinced we’ve seen the worst of it. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, recently predicted Bitcoin could drop to $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said the market cycle’s lowest point will probably show up in early October, though he “anticipates plenty of rallies will occur between now and then.” Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity’s director of global macroeconomic research, suggested 2026 might be a “year off” for Bitcoin, with prices potentially sliding to $65,000. The split opinions show just how uncertain things are right now, leaving traders to figure out their next moves in what’s shaping up to be a bumpy ride.

The breach sent shockwaves through the Solana ecosystem as blockchain security firm CertiK flagged that the stolen SOL “ has been withdrawn after stake authorization had been transferred ” to an unknown wallet address. The incident triggered immediate market panic, with the platform’s native STEP token plummeting over 90% within 24 hours. Source: CoinGecko While the team insists user funds remained unaffected, questions swirl over whether the breach represents a genuine security failure or a disguised exit scam, particularly given that the attacker appeared to have direct wallet access rather than exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities.

According to CertiK’s comprehensive January 2026 security report , “ combining all the incidents in January, we’ve confirmed ~$370.3M lost to exploits ” across multiple attack vectors. Major January incidents included Truebit’s $26.6 million smart contract exploit , SwapNet’s $13.3 million breach affecting Matcha Meta users, Saga’s $6.2 million exploit that forced the Layer-1 protocol to pause its SagaEVM chain, and Makina Finance’s $4.2 million loss through flash loan manipulation. CertiK’s analysis revealed that phishing incidents accounted for $311.3 million of January’s losses, while code vulnerability attacks totaled $51.5 million. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in January we’ve confirmed ~$370.3M lost to exploits. ~$311.3M of the total is attributed to phishing with one victim losing ~$284M due to a social engineering scam. More details below pic.twitter.com/uXhi0P6dl5 — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) January 31, 2026 Notably, the Step Finance breach continues a troubling pattern affecting Solana-based protocols. Swiss crypto platform SwissBorg lost $41.5 million worth of SOL tokens in September 2025 after hackers compromised partner API provider Kiln, while South Korea’s Upbit exchange suffered a $36 million Solana exploit in November 2025, exactly six years after its 2019 hack attributed to North Korean actors. Beyond individual protocol failures, January also witnessed the largest single crypto theft of 2026, when a victim lost over $282 million in Bitcoin and Litecoin through a hardware wallet social engineering scam, as blockchain investigator ZachXBT described it, surpassing the previous record of $243 million set in August 2024. The attacker “ immediately began converting the stolen assets into Monero through multiple instant exchanges, ” obscuring the trail across multiple blockchain networks. CertiK’s data shows that despite these massive losses, less than 2-5% has been recovered so far , as investigations into many cases have only recently begun. Even government-held crypto assets came under scrutiny, as the US Marshals Service confirmed it is investigating a possible hack of federal digital-asset accounts. Patrick Witt, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, acknowledged that the government seizure addresses were among the wallets from which hackers stole more than $60 million in late 2025.

While still a very popular token held by many investors, many are now looking to invest in other coins that have potential for growth as well as utility. One of the new crypto coins that has caught people’s attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto currently valued at $0.04. Due to its decentralized lending and borrowing system as well as revenue-based tokenomics and growing presale numbers, MUTM has gained retail as well as whale interest. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Trades in a Measured Consolidation Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading around $0.00000726. It is still trading well below its key resistance level of $0.00000840-$0.00000939. The price movement of the token has been steady as it continues to consolidate. The price has been making lower highs as it continues to move forward. The current support level of the token is at $0.00000682. The major support level of the token is at $0.00000532. While it still has some trading interest, the token’s movement has been steady as it continues to consolidate. MUTM: Poised for Significant Growth The Mutuum Finance presale provides an attractive investment opportunity for investors to reap substantial returns on investment. During Phase 7, the price of the MUTM token is $0.04, which will increase to $0.045 in Phase 8. Assuming an investor invests $3,000, he would receive 75,000 MUTM tokens, which would translate to $3,375 when the price increases to $0.045, giving the investor an instant profit of $375 before the token goes live on the market. With the expected launch price of $0.06, the returns on investment on a $3,000 buy will be a $1,500 profit. Post-launch growth is set to carry the token even higher, with analysts predicting 10x returns within the first few weeks. This makes MUTM one of the most promising new crypto coins in the market. Safety and Stability in Action The reserve factor is an important component of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token, which seeks to ensure stability and security of the platform for both borrowers and lenders. It can be defined as an automated risk management tool where the reserve factor receives a fraction of the interest generated by borrowers on the Mutuum Finance platform. This reserve factor is crucial to the solvency of the Mutuum Finance DeFi crypto platform. For instance, an individual borrowing the stablecoin USDC may borrow an amount of 10,000 USDC with an APY of 5%. Assuming the reserve factor of the USDC on the Mutuum Finance platform is 10%, the lender would receive 4.5% of the interest generated on the borrowed capital, with 0.5% going to the reserve factor. However, in the case of a more volatile asset, a higher reserve factor is used in order to mitigate the risks. For instance, a user might borrow a crypto asset at an APY of 12%. In such a case, the lender might receive an APY of 9%, while 3% will go to the reserve pool. During volatile market periods, the protocol will tap into this reserve to ensure lenders always get their fair share of yield. This system ensures that Mutuum Finance remains a stable and secure DeFi crypto platform. Giveaway and V1 Protocol Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100,000 giveaway to help the platform grow and invigorate the community. Through the giveaway, ten different investors will have the opportunity to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The giveaway is more than just a platform to attract new members; it shows the commitment that Mutuum Finance has toward developing a loyal base that will last over time. The Mutuum Finance Protocol is live on the Sepolia testnet. This will enable all users to have the opportunity to experience the full range of features that the platform provides. The platform includes the use of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Users will be able to interact with the platform using USDT, ETH, LINK, and WBTC. With the ability to enable cryptocurrency holders to earn while still holding their assets, the Mutuum Finance Protocol is a major player in the race to become the next big DeFi crypto. As Shiba Inu slows down, investors are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This new crypto coin, priced at $0.04, is the next big investment opportunity and a standout contender among emerging new crypto coins in the market.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-those-who-understand-xrp-have-an-advantage-heres-why/,"Crypto expert Jake Claver recently highlighted the significance of Ripple’s technology in global finance. He emphasized that XRP is not merely another digital asset. According to Claver, “Ripple’s technology isn’t just another crypto project. It’s the infrastructure that will unlock trillions in previously frozen assets.” This positions XRP uniquely among cryptocurrencies, as it directly addresses liquidity and efficiency challenges in financial systems. Major banks and institutions are integrating systems built on the XRP Ledger. Claver noted that this adoption is accelerating quietly. These integrations are designed to move assets more efficiently across borders. Once fully implemented, they could permanently change how institutions access and deploy capital. Most of the financial world is still blind to what's happening. Ripple's technology isn't just another crypto project. It's the infrastructure that will unlock trillions in previously frozen assets. Major banks and financial institutions are implementing systems that will use… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 29, 2026 Institutional Adoption Driving Change Claver stressed that financial organizations are recognizing XRP’s potential. He highlighted that major banks are already testing and deploying XRP-based solutions. This trend indicates confidence in the XRP Ledger as a reliable settlement system. By enabling faster transfers and lower costs, XRP provides a practical alternative to legacy banking infrastructure. The adoption of XRP technology goes beyond simple payment transfers. Claver pointed out that these systems allow institutions to unlock previously stagnant assets. This capability could increase liquidity across markets. In practical terms, trillions in assets could be moved and utilized more effectively, reshaping institutional operations. XRP’s Advantages in Modern Finance Claver has consistently advocated for XRP due to its scalability and speed. He notes that XRP transactions settle in seconds , with minimal fees. Unlike other digital assets, XRP supports high-volume transfers without bottlenecks. For financial institutions, this makes it ideal for cross-border payments and large-scale asset management. Security and transparency also play a key role. The XRP Ledger maintains a decentralized verification process. This reduces reliance on centralized intermediaries while ensuring transactions remain auditable. These features strengthen trust for banks and institutional users. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Timing and Opportunity According to Claver, understanding XRP’s role now provides a strategic advantage. Those who recognize its capabilities early can anticipate changes in financial flows before they become widely apparent. Institutions will continue deploying XRP solutions, and liquidity will increase. This will also decrease operational and global finance will adjust to a more efficient model . Claver’s perspective reinforces the narrative that XRP is more than a speculative asset . It serves as a functional infrastructure component in modern banking. Those who see the value now will benefit the most when the asset takes over global finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to official updates from Base engineers, the network experienced intermittent delays in transaction packaging, which in some cases caused users to wait longer than usual for confirmations or to see their transactions dropped during periods of heightened network congestion. The Ethereum L2 blockchain shared an X post stressing that, “Sometimes, busy times on the network can cause transactions to be delayed or even lost. We are working on long-term solutions to fix this issue and will keep you updated as we make progress.” Base encounters a major problem with its operation Earlier, Base released a statement notifying its clients that the mainnet was experiencing temporary delays in its operations, particularly affecting transaction processing. This delay frustrated users, as it led to network congestion that increased their wait times. At this time, the Ethereum L2 blockchain executives explained that block creation will continue as usual and transactions will be processed; however, some may experience delays or even be dropped during peak traffic hours. While individuals await an official statement from Base on the precise cause of the incident, reports indicate this is not the first time the network has experienced operational delays. Late last year, Base experienced a 19-minute disruption in block creation. The Ethereum L2 blockchain reported this incident at 6:15 UTC, igniting tension among its clients. In attempts to calm their fears, the Base shared on its official status page that the problem was resolved by 6:44 UTC. Notably, this incident represented the network’s initial major outage. During the interruption, Coinbase’s network faced delays with withdrawals, block production, deposits, and Flashblocks functionality. The problem was fixed within 30 minutes while the team stayed on the lookout for other issues. Nonetheless, they did not disclose the reason for the delays. Some sources alleged that this outage may have occurred as the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain experienced a substantial increase in token creation. To support this claim, they pointed out that a scenario in which the network launched more than 54,000 new tokens in a day. Meanwhile, seeing the recurring delays, with the recent one being the second incident, and that Base has not yet provided the root cause of the two incidents, users have expressed worries about financial risks and loss of trust in blockchain networks. Sui faces a disruption in its network Just like Base, Sui , a high-performance layer-1 blockchain, reported an outage on January 14 that significantly impacted its mainnet activity. This disruption temporarily halted transaction processing and checkpoint certification on the blockchain, sparking tension in the crypto industry. The team shared an X post dated January 16 that elaborated on the main cause of this issue. In the post, they said a disagreement among validators over internal consensus led to the outage. According to their investigation, high network traffic, external attacks, or security issues were not the cause of the interruption. Afterwards, the team reassured users that their assets remained secure throughout the incident. In the meantime, reporters reached out to the layer-1 blockchain to ask how they identified the outage. Responding to this question, Sui highlighted that they identified a rare bug in how consensus commits were handled, which led validators to reach divergent conclusions when managing specific conflicting transactions. Because of this impact, Validators began to develop different checkpoint candidates, hindering the required agreement to certify a new stake-weighted checkpoint, they added.

Indeed, as of press time, the total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $2.65 trillion, representing a drop of $200 billion from the $2.85 trillion recorded 24 hours ago. Crypto market 30-day chart. Source: CoinMarketCap In this context, major cryptocurrencies were firmly in the red. Bitcoin, the market’s largest asset, slid more than 6% over the period, trading near the mid-$78,000 area after breaking below several key technical levels. Ethereum ( ETH ) posted even steeper losses, dropping over 10% to around $2,400, while Solana ( SOL ) shed more than 11% as it slipped toward the low-$100 range. Binance Coin ( BNB ) and XRP also recorded notable declines, reinforcing the sense that the sell-off spared few corners of the market. Top cryptocurrencies’ performance. Source: Finbold Why crypto market is crashing The latest downturn has been driven by macroeconomic and policy concerns, notably reports that former Fed official Kevin Warsh may be nominated as Fed Chair under Donald Trump. In this case, Warsh is seen as favoring tighter monetary policy and a smaller Fed balance sheet, fueling expectations of higher-for-longer rates and reduced liquidity. These conditions typically pressure risk assets such as cryptocurrencies while supporting a stronger U.S. dollar. Beyond monetary policy, the broader market has turned risk-averse. Investors are cutting exposure to volatile assets amid tighter liquidity concerns, a partial U.S. government shutdown, and rising geopolitical tensions, including renewed U.S.–Iran friction following reports of an explosion at a major Iranian port. Sharp declines in traditional safe havens like gold and silver further signal broad deleveraging. Market sentiment has also deteriorated sharply, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index plunging into extreme fear, reflecting elevated anxiety. While such levels have sometimes preceded market bottoms, in the current environment, they appear to be amplifying selling pressure rather than attracting buyers. The Bitcoin liquidity factor On the other hand, analysis from The Kobeissi Letter shared on January 31 pointed to a liquidity-driven liquidation cascade as the primary driver of the sell-off. In this line, Bitcoin’s drop below $79,000 was largely the result of market structure rather than new fundamental shocks. Why is crypto crashing today? Here's exactly why: Crypto's downturn is being blamed on just about every possible thing, ranging from Iran to the Fed. However, the answer to this question is actually quite simple when you look at the flow data.

Bitcoin first consolidated near $84,000 before forced selling broke support, with subsequent waves pushing prices lower as overleveraged longs were flushed out. Therefore, thin liquidity and excessive leverage created sharp price “air pockets,” while rapidly shifting sentiment from extreme optimism to fear intensified the decline.

Moreover, the asset closed January with a 10% decline, becoming the fourth consecutive month to end in the red – something that more aligned with bear market performances. Now, though, analysts are rushing to offer their views on the matter, and Merlijn The Trader believes there’s a silver lining in the multi-billion-dollar wipeout that occurred on Saturday. EVERY MAJOR BITCOIN RALLY BEGINS THE SAME WAY: Brutal flush. Broken confidence. Quiet accumulation. That’s when smart money steps in. Pain builds the launchpad. Bitcoin is following the script again. pic.twitter.com/fYa0GQLY73 — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) January 31, 2026 The popular analyst outlined BTC’s different nature from other asset classes, reminding of its intense volatility. He explained that every major bitcoin rally has begun in a similar manner – a brutal flush that was succeeded by a broken confidence, and quiet accumulation. The flush took place (again) yesterday, when BTC crashed and took down the rest of the market with it. The confidence is definitely broken, which is evident from the Fear and Greed Index, showing ‘extreme fear.’ Recent reports claimed that whales have begun reaccumulating the asset. He added that “pain builds the launchpad,” and noted that BTC is now following the aforementioned script again. In a separate post, the analyst outlined the significance of the $78,000 level, which could determine the next short-term big move – either a “healthy correction,” or a deeper sell-off toward the recent low.

As the flagship cryptocurrency tests its $77,000 price support, data from recent on-chain analysis has been put out, which suggests that investors might have more concerns in the near-term. Network Activity Collapses To 2020 Lows Despite Relatively Higher Prices In a recent QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain hypothesizes that the Bitcoin price currently stands very little chance of recuperating. On the contrary, the analyst implies that the flagship cryptocurrency could endure a sustained downturn, especially considering other on-chain conditions. The market quant’s post revolves around the Bitcoin Active Addresses metric, which reveals how much network activity is ongoing within the Bitcoin market by measuring the amount of unique wallet addresses that are either sending or receiving BTC, over a period of time (in this case, over the past seven days). According to CryptoOnchain, the active addresses count recently fell to 720,000, marking the lowest levels seen since April 2020. For context, the active addresses were as high as 1.126 million as of November 2024. Hence, the 36% contraction from the November 2024 peak to current readings reflects a significant reduction in on-chain activity. From the chart shared by the analyst, it is apparent that network participation among retailers significantly declined in the latter half of 2025 and reached 2020 lows early in 2026. Notably, the current downtrend in network activity comes with a growing divergence. CryptoOnchain points out that the Bitcoin price still retains levels significantly higher than those seen in April 2020. But the network usage is still at that low level, reflecting a schism between network activity and price action. The analyst concludes that this is a sign of insufficient support (i.e organic demand) from network users. In this case, losing the $83,000 support may have been a fatal blow for the Bitcoin price. The analyst explains that this worsened the risk of further downward movement, as Bitcoin’s growth was already without underlying network support. For any recovery attempts to hold, and not end in “bull traps”, there has to be a reversal in the relative inactivity within the Bitcoin network currently unfolding. Better still, CryptoOnchain prescribes the “renewed influx of users on-chain” for a sustainable upside move to gain feasibility.

Key Takeaways: An analyst says Bitcoin’s drop to $77,000 may mark a capitulation-style cycle low. The pullback mirrors past crashes that preceded major recoveries, though losses remain deep. Other analysts warn further downside is still possible despite the recent bounce. In a post on X on Saturday , PlanC said there is a “decent chance” the latest drop represents a capitulation-style low rather than the start of a prolonged downturn. Bitcoin briefly touched the $77,000 level before stabilizing and rebounding modestly to around $78,600, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Bitcoin Drawdown Echoes Past Capitulations That Led to Recoveries Despite the bounce, the asset remains down more than 11% over the past month and roughly 38% below its October all-time high of $126,100. PlanC compared the current price action to several historic drawdowns that ultimately preceded major recoveries. He pointed to the 2018 bear market capitulation near $3,000, the March 2020 COVID-driven crash to around $5,100, and the sharp declines following the FTX and Terra-Luna collapses, when Bitcoin briefly traded in the $15,500–$17,500 range. “There is a decent chance we are going through another major capitulation low as we speak,” PlanC wrote, adding that his estimated range for a cycle bottom sits between $75,000 and $80,000. In his view, the recent sell-off may represent a final shakeout rather than a structural shift in the broader trend. Others urged caution but echoed the view that weekend moves can exaggerate market sentiment. Bitcoin advocate and financial accountant Rajat Soni noted that the drop occurred during one of crypto’s most volatile trading windows. FYI: 35%-40% corrections are historically not unheard of for a Bitcoin bull run. Also, the Binance 'glitch' black swan brought us down much lower than we would have gone otherwise. — Plan C (@TheRealPlanC) February 1, 2026 “Never trust a weekend pump or dump,” he said, warning traders against drawing firm conclusions from short-term price swings. Still, not all market watchers are convinced the downside is over. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has suggested Bitcoin could slide as low as $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen also expects the cycle low to arrive later this year, potentially around October, though he anticipates multiple relief rallies before then. Adding to the cautious outlook, Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity said 2026 could prove to be a “year off” for Bitcoin, with prices potentially revisiting the mid-$60,000 range before a more durable recovery takes hold. Bitcoin Slides as Fed Caution, Geopolitics Sap Risk Appetite Bitcoin has fallen back below $89,000 after a short-lived rebound, pressured by tighter financial conditions and rising geopolitical stress that have weighed on risk assets. According to XS.com analyst Samer Hasn, a Federal Reserve stance that remains neutral to hawkish, combined with tensions in the Middle East, has reduced demand for speculative investments across crypto markets. Market data points to weakening conviction among traders. CoinGlass figures show crypto futures open interest is down 42% from record highs, with attempted breakouts quickly reversed by sharp sell-offs. At the same time, capital has rotated toward traditional havens such as gold and silver, leaving digital assets struggling to attract fresh inflows as volatility persists. With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaling little urgency to cut rates and geopolitical risks pushing investors toward tangible assets, analysts say Bitcoin remains a higher-risk trade until either policy eases or global tensions cool.

Jury selection began this week in Santa Fe, marking the first independent trial by state officials in a growing wave of legal action against the company for Feb. 9, with proceedings expected to stretch nearly two months. State builds case o n un dercover investigation State Attorney General Raúl Torrez brought the lawsuit in 2023 after investigators went undercover, setting up fake accounts pretending to be minors. The operation documented various advances directed at these accounts and tracked how Meta handled reports of inappropriate behavior. According to Torrez, the company put profits before protecting young users. The accusations center on Meta allegedly building a space where adults seeking to exploit children can operate, while hiding what the company understood about these dangers. “So many regulators are keyed up looking for any evidence of a legal theory that would punish social media that a victory in that case could have ripple effects throughout the country, and the globe,” Eric Goldman said. Goldman works as co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law. “Whatever the jury says will be of substantial interest.” Meta has pushed back hard against these claims, calling the state’s case “sensationalist” and arguin g of ficials are cherry-picking documents. Though CEO Mark Zuckerberg is no longer named as a defendant, he sat for a deposition and court filings reference him. A different legal strategy New Mexico prosecutors say they are not holding Meta responsible for what users post. Instead, they point to the company’s algorithms, claiming these systems spread material that hooks kids and causes harm. This approach might get aroun d le gal shields that typically protect social media companies. Section 230, a part of the Communications Decency Act, has historically prevented tech firms from being held liable for user-posted content. The undercover work involved creating multiple accounts for supposed children aged 14 and under. Investigators watched as various advances, then monitored what Meta did when alerted. Torrez has pushed Meta to use better age verification systems and kick bad actors off the platform. He also wants changes to algorithms that can deliver harmful content and has criticized privacy encryption that makes it harder to monitor conversations with minors. In a related move, Torrez filed felony criminal charges against three men in 2024 for electronically soliciting children. Meta released a statement sayin g la wsuits across the country wrongly blame social media for teen mental health problems. The company highlighted new account settings and safety tools, including features that give teenagers more information about who they are chatting with. Goldman note d Me ta is throwing massive resources into courtroom fights this year. “If they lose this,” he said, “it becomes another beachhead that might erode their basic business.” More than 40 states have filed similar lawsuits More than 40 state attorneys general have sued Meta with claims the company harms young people and fuels a youth mental health crisis by intentionally creating features that get children addicted to its platforms. Most of these lawsuit s la nded in federal court. A separate trial is happening this week in California. That case in Los Angeles County Superior Court involves personal injury claims and could shape how thousands of similar lawsuits proceed. A 19-year-old woman claim s ea rly social media use got her hooked on technology and made her depression and suicidal thoughts worse. The case initially included Meta’s Instagram, Google’s YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat, though TikTok and Snap Inc. settled. New Mexico also sued Snap Inc., allegin g it s platform enables child exploitation. Snap says i t bu ilt safety protections and “deliberate design choices to make it difficult for strangers to discover minors.” A jury drawn from Santa Fe County residents will decide if Meta engaged in unfair business practices and to what degree. However, a judge will make the final call on civil penalties and other consequences. Under the state’s Unfair Practices Act, penaltie s re ach $5,000 per violation, thoug h ho w violations will be counted. “The reason the damage potential is so great here is because of how Facebook works,” said Mollie McGraw, a plaintiff’s attorney based in Las Cruces. “Meta keeps track of everyone who sees a post. …The damages here could be significant. “ Don’t just read crypto news.

According to government data that was released on Sunday, exports climbed to a record high in the month, with shipments jumping more than 30% to nearly $66 billion in January. The development was announced by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Resources, which said outbound shipments from Korea hit $65.85 billion in January, a rise of 34% from a year ago. It also marked the eighth consecutive month of growth registered by the country. The daily average value of exports also hit a new all-time high, rising by 14% year-on-year to $2.8 billion, the ministry added. South Korea registers surge in chip demand According to the statement , semiconductors led the rally, with outbound shipments amounting to more than double from a year earlier to $20.5 billion. The result was closer to hitting the 420.8 billion registered in December. The ministry noted that the rise was a result of the rise in global demand for artificial intelligence servers and a sustained recovery in memory chip prices that started late last year. The development means that Korea has now posted record-high chip export numbers for the month for 10 consecutive months. Automobile shipments also registered a rise, surging 22% on-year to $6.07 billion. The price mark was the second-highest registered in January on record. The ministry noted the larger number of working days, with the Lunar New Year holiday falling in February this year, as well as demand for hybrid and electric vehicles. Records show that 13 of the 15 key export items of the country posted growth in January, including wireless communication devices, displays, petroleum products, and bio-health. Agro-fisheries and cosmetics also stood out, rising 19% and 36%, respectively, to about $1 billion each. Both items also recorded highs for the month. Exports to the US rose by 30% In terms of destination, exports to the United States surged by 30% from a year ago, with the figure climbing to $12 billion. The figure was also the highest January figure on record and is coming amid a lingering trade policy agreement. Car and machinery shipments, sectors that are most exposed to the tariffs, registered a 13% and 34% drop, respectively. Meanwhile, Shipments to China rose 47% to $13.5 billion, with the figure pushed by the increase in chip exports. Exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also rose by 41% to $12.1 billion, reaching the highest January level on record and the third highest monthly tally overall, while shipments to the European Union rose 7% to $5.4 billion. Imports also climbed 12% from a year ago to $57.1 billion, resulting in a trade balance of $8.7 billion and extending the surplus streak to a 12th consecutive month. Kim Jung-kwan, Trade Minister for Korea, highlighted the rising uncertainty in the global trade environment as a result of the recent United States tariff policies and the spread of protectionism. Jung-kwan said that the government is preparing to press ahead with consultations with the United States, with the national interests as its top priority. In addition, the trade minister noted that the country expects to build a resilient trade structure that can withstand external shocks through diversification of products, markets, and participants.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying to Mar-a-Lago that China could get into the Venezuelan market and land good deals on oil. “China is welcome to come in and will make a great deal on oil,” the president said. India seeks alternative oil sources amid tariff pressure Trump also talked about ongoing discussions with India over Venezuelan crude purchases. “India’s coming in and they’re going to be buying Venezuelan oil , as opposed to buying it from Iran,” he said. “We’ve already made the deal, the concept of that deal.” The India arrangement follows weeks of talks between officials in Washington, New Delhi, and Caracas. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call with Acting President Delcy Rodríguez on January 30 about expanding energy cooperation. India is the world’s third-biggest oil consumer and wants this deal as a way to rely less on Middle Eastern and Russian suppliers. The timing looks intentional. The Trump administration recently threatened India with tariffs between 25% and 50% if it keeps buying oil from Russia and Iran. The Venezuelan oil offer works as an incentive to shift India’s energy purchases toward sources that fit American interests in the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela’s acting president signed off on major reforms to the country’s oil regulations earlier this week. That was less than a month after U.S. forces took Maduro into custody. The changes flip the socialist framework that ran the industry under the previous government. The new law scraps the 33% extraction tax and puts in an “integrated hydrocarbon tax” capped at 15%. Royalty rates, which were locked at 33.33%, now work on a sliding scale that starts at 15%. The exact rate depends on what each project needs and how competitive it is. After these legislative changes, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license letting American companie s ex port, sell, and refine crude from the sanctioned country. There are strict financial control s to stop oil revenues from getting to Maduro supporters or funding resistance movements. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that money from these sales is sitting in a blocked account in Qatar. The funds get carefully monitored and will move to the U.S. Treasury before going out for humanitarian projects and rebuilding efforts that Venezuela’s interim government approves. US emerges as top buyer as China shipments halt American imports of Venezuelan oil are getting close to their highest level in a year. The Trump administration took control of the country’s energy operations and pushed oil companies to put in $100 billion toward rebuilding Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. The United States has become the main destination for Venezuelan oil after Maduro’s removal, but shipments to China have stopped completely. Chinese imports averaged 400,000 barrels daily last year but dropped to zero in January because of U.S. naval operations going after vessels used to move sanctioned oil to China. Chevron Corp. supplies most Venezuelan crude coming into the United States under a U.S. license that allows sales of sanctioned oil. Commodity trading firms Trafigura Group and Vitol Group provide about 20% of these supplies. The Trump administration picked these traders to help sell up to 50 million barrels after Maduro’s January ouster. Bloomberg data shows Vitol and Trafigura are on track to handle 14 million barrels of Venezuelan crude. A lot of this oil was already loaded on ships heading to China before January. The traders have put around 9 million barrels in Caribbean storage facilities. The rest is going to American and European markets.

57636184,https://finbold.com/?p=261590,1769939708,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"AI predicts XRP price for February 28, 2026",https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-xrp-price-for-february-28-2026/,"With XRP currently in a massive sell-off that has seen the asset face the threat of dropping below the $1.50 support level, insights from an artificial intelligence (AI) model suggest that the token is likely to reclaim the $2 mark by the end of the month. Indeed, XRP’s sell-off has been triggered by broader market sentiment, with leading assets such as Bitcoin continuing to record capital outflows. The market is amid waning interest in risk assets, driven by political uncertainty and mounting macroeconomic pressures. As of press time, XRP was trading at $1.66, having plunged over 4% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset has declined by more than 12.5%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, the price is trading well below both its 50-day SMA near $1.96 and the 200-day SMA around $2.46, confirming a firmly bearish trend structure with no clear signs of reversal. The gap between price and these averages underscores persistent downside pressure. At the same time, the 14-day RSI sits around 30, signaling oversold conditions. This suggests selling momentum is stretched, and a short-term bounce is possible. However, as long as XRP remains below its key moving averages, any rebound is likely corrective rather than trend-changing. XRP price prediction Regarding the price outlook, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which forecast that XRP could rebound and find support by February 28, 2026, based on the current market structure, momentum, and broader crypto conditions. The model noted that XRP is in a post-volatility compression phase following a sharp move. Such transitions typically resolve through either a slow continuation or a range-bound recovery. In this case, the lack of a decisive bearish breakdown points to a gradual move higher within a defined range rather than a sharp sell-off. At the same time, XRP’s relative behavior also supports this view. While it often lags Bitcoin ( BTC ) during strong rallies, it has shown resilience during consolidation phases. If the broader cryptocurrency market remains neutral to mildly positive, XRP is more likely to drift higher than materially underperform. With less than a month until February 28, the model ruled out extreme outcomes, favoring mean reversion and modest trend continuation over a parabolic rally or deep decline. XRP price scenarios for February 28 Under its base-case scenario, viewed as the most likely outcome, ChatGPT expects XRP to oscillate while slowly trending higher, settling in a zone between $2.10 and $2.25, where buying and selling pressure are more evenly balanced. A bearish scenario, assigned a lower probability, would see a broader risk-off move across crypto markets, with XRP testing support but holding in the $1.80 to $1.90 range. A bullish scenario would require a strong market-wide catalyst, allowing momentum to expand and pushing XRP toward $2.40 to $2.45, though the model considers a move beyond that range unlikely without a new narrative driver. XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Taking all factors into account, ChatGPT assigned a single-point estimate of $2.15 for XRP on February 28, 2026, characterizing the outlook as one of controlled upside driven by consolidation dynamics rather than speculative excess.

According to NYT , the effort, which began with $5 million checks from each founder in September, represents one of the most significant financial commitments from the tech and crypto sectors to reshape California politics. The ballot measure that triggered this response, backed by Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, would impose a one-time 5% tax on net worth exceeding $1 billion, including unrealized gains on assets not yet sold. “ Whoever designed that wealth tax in the unions — wow, ” Larsen said. “ They woke up the sleeping giant like I have never seen. “ Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. | Source: Bloomberg Tech Billionaires Challenge Union Influence With Business-Friendly Candidates Larsen, whose net worth is nearly $15 billion from Ripple holdings and crypto assets, said he expects to personally commit $30 million to the organization. “ If it takes a couple of cycles, fine — that’s what we’re here for, ” he told The New York Times when asked about potential November losses. The group plans to target about a dozen state legislative seats this year, focusing on public safety, homelessness, and budget discipline, according to Shaudi Fulp, the former Sacramento lobbyist leading daily operations. While Democrats control more than two-thirds of seats in both legislative chambers, Grow California will not engage in the 2026 gubernatorial race or expensive ballot proposition campaigns. Both founders come from the crypto industry, though they stress that the initiative does not represent the interests of the crypto sector specifically. Larsen acknowledged learning lessons from Fairshake, the crypto super PAC backed by Ripple that spent over $100 million shaping the current Congress. Draper, known for Bitcoin-themed accessories and his persistent campaign to split California into multiple states, did not respond to requests for comment. “ The government unions do a great job, ” Larsen said, adding with a laugh, “I have respect for the job that they’ve done. They show up, and they’re there consistently. But that’s going to clash with a lot of the things that are going to make California successful if there’s no counterforce. “ Crypto and tech leaders warn California’s proposed 5% billionaire tax on unrealized gains could trigger capital flight and an exodus of high-net-worth residents ahead of the 2026 ballot vote. #CaliforniaTax #CryptoBillionaires https://t.co/Sl1SR9z6Gw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 29, 2025 California Crypto Politics Intensifies Amid Governor Race And Regulatory Expansion The wealth tax debate coincides with former Assembly member Ian Calderon’s entry into the 2026 gubernatorial race on a pro-Bitcoin platform. Calderon, 39, who served as Assembly Majority Leader from 2016 to 2020, declared his vision for California to become “ the undisputed leader on Bitcoin ” in his campaign announcement video. Meanwhile, Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified criticism of President Donald Trump’s crypto-related pardons , launching a state-backed website tracking what his office calls “ criminal cronies. “ The site prominently features Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who received a full pardon in October after serving four months for Bank Secrecy Act violations, and Ross Ulbricht, whose life sentence for Silk Road operations was commuted. California Governor Newsom slams Trump’s crypto pardons, calling @binance 's CZ and Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht “criminal cronies” in a new state tracker highlighting controversial pardons. #GavinNewsom #TrumpPardons https://t.co/j9Sac1g4Th — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 Beyond political battles, California continues advancing digital asset infrastructure through the Digital Financial Assets Law, which takes effect in July 2025 and requires all crypto service providers to obtain state licenses. The Assembly also unanimously passed AB 1180 in June , creating a pilot program for state fee payments using digital assets that runs through 2031. Global Tax Frameworks Contrast California’s Uncertain Trajectory While California debates wealth taxation, other jurisdictions are implementing clearer crypto tax structures. Japan’s 2026 tax reform blueprint reduces crypto taxation from up to 55% to a flat 20% for specified digital assets handled by registered businesses, though the exact qualifying criteria remain undefined. Similarly, the European Union’s DAC8 tax transparency law took effect on January 1, requiring crypto exchanges and service providers to collect and report user information to national tax authorities, with data sharing between EU countries beginning July 1. “ Tax authorities now have an automated dashboard tracking your digital assets, ” wrote Bitcoin educator Heidi Chakos. DAC8 took effect on Jan. 1, giving the EU power to seize crypto linked to unpaid taxes, while negating privacy for individual holders. #Crypto #Tax #DAC8 #EU https://t.co/JWKHNvbA3C — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 19, 2026 However, just like California, South Korea faces mounting uncertainty over its repeatedly delayed crypto tax regime, now scheduled for January 2027 despite lacking essential infrastructure. Switzerland also postponed the automatic exchange of crypto account information with foreign tax authorities until at least 2027, though legal frameworks take effect in January 2026.

Why Mutuum Finance Is The Best Crypto To Buy For Long Term,https://timestabloid.com/could-mutm-outpace-solana-sol-in-2026-why-mutuum-finance/,"As the crypto market seeks resilient projects with tangible utility, a significant divergence is emerging between established giants and innovative newcomers. While some networks face structural challenges, others are building sustainable ecosystems from the ground up. For instance, a modest $250 investment in a promising project today could potentially transform into $10,000 by mid-year, illustrating the profound opportunity present in strategic early participation. This dynamic sets the stage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol nearing its mainnet launch, to potentially outperform legacy chains like Solana (SOL) through superior fundamentals and direct value accrual. Solana’s Growing Centralization Problem Recent data reveals a concerning trend for Solana, as its validator count has plummeted to a four-year low. This decline directly challenges the network’s decentralization, a core tenet of blockchain integrity. Analysts attribute this exodus to an unsustainable rewards model that disproportionately benefits large operators, squeezing out smaller validators. Consequently, the network’s consensus mechanism grows more concentrated, increasing systemic risk and undermining long-term security promises. Compared to Ethereum’s vast and distributed validator set, Solana’s architecture appears increasingly vulnerable. Furthermore, SOL’s price has breached a critical multi-year trendline support, suggesting waning investor confidence. These fundamental and technical weaknesses contrast with the fortified, user-centric model being deployed by newer entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM’s Presale: The Final Chance At A Ground-Floor Price Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates overwhelming demand, having raised over $20,250,000 from more than 18,930 holders in its ongoing presale. The project is currently in Phase 7, offering tokens at $0.04, a 300% increase from the Phase 1 price. This phase is selling out rapidly, representing the last opportunity to buy before the price climbs to $0.045 in Phase 8. The launch price is set at $0.06, offering profitability long before deployment. Given its fixed supply of 4 billion tokens and robust tokenomics, where 45% is allocated to the presale, analysts project significant post-launch appreciation. A $500 investment today could see exponential growth, potentially reaching 20x its value as exchange listings and protocol adoption drive demand against a shrinking available supply. Peer-to-Contract Lending: Generating Passive Yield Beyond token appreciation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides direct income generation through its core lending protocol. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows users to earn yield on idle assets. For example, a user depositing $10,000 in ETH into a liquidity pool could earn an estimated 12% APY. This strategy generates approximately $1,200 in annual passive income without requiring the seller to relinquish their underlying asset position. This practical utility transforms the token from a mere speculative asset into a gateway for consistent cash flow for this best cryptocurrency to invest in. The protocol’s automated pools adjust rates based on market utilization, ensuring competitive returns for lenders and attracting sustained capital, which in turn fuels ecosystem growth and token demand. The Buyback Mechanism: A Path to Passive Dividends Another feature making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the best crypto to buy now is its buy-and-distribute model. A portion of all protocol revenue is used to automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then distributed as dividends to users who stake their mtTokens within the ecosystem. This creates direct wealth-sharing mechanism. For instance, if a user stakes $2,000 in mtTokens, they become eligible for regular dividend distributions from these buybacks, effectively earning a secondary income stream on top of their lending yields. This model links the platform’s financial success directly to token holder rewards, fostering long-term commitment and value growth. A Strong Case for Long-Term Investment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a multifaceted opportunity lacking in many older cryptocurrencies. It combines the immediate advantage of presale with the long-term engines of a revenue-generating DeFi protocol and a tokenomic model designed for scarcity and reward. While other assets may rely on hype or diluted networks, MUTM is built on tangible utility, security verified by independent audits like Halborn, and a clear vision for scalable growth. For investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in for substantial, sustained returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a high-potential pathway. The window for entry at this level is closing fast, making immediate consideration imperative.

57636442,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=906038,1769940148,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57636442.jpeg,Deepfake video lures Singapore national into fraudulent investment scheme,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/singapore-falls-deepfake-loses-funds/,"A Singaporean national has lost funds to scammers after falling for a deepfake video featuring a local minister endorsing cryptocurrency investments. According to reports, the victim, 75-year-old Victor, stumbled upon an advertisement created by a local minister promoting a crypto investment and believed it was a sign of credibility. According to the victim, he had plans to stretch his retirement fund and thought he could do it by investing in a cryptocurrency investment scheme that was endorsed by the minister. However, the video turned out to be an AI-generated deepfake, and the crypto investment scheme was indeed a scam carried out by bad actors looking to take advantage of unsuspecting victims. Singapore retiree loses funds to fake investment In the statement given by the Singapore national, he mentioned that he was added to a WhatsApp group by an unknown number in January. After being added to the group, he discovered that its members were discussing a high-return crypto investment scheme. One of the members went ahead to share a video, which was apparently a deepfake, of a minister endorsing the crypto investment. After seeing the video, the man clicked on the link. The new investor mentioned that after he clicked on the link, he was asked to fill out a registration form where he entered his personal details and accompanied it with a $250 registration fee via bank transfer. A while after his registration, he received a call from someone claiming to be from Coinbase, a crypto exchange that he had come to know as a legitimate United States-based exchange after his research into digital assets. They conversed in English, and the caller told him about the benefits of trading on Coinbase. He added that a colleague would be in touch later to put Victor through the remaining process. Days later, the colleague video-called him and asked him to share his smartphone screen. He also ordered the Singaporean retiree to log into his Central Provident Fund (CPF) and bank accounts, and withdraw $4,400 from his CPF Ordinary account to his bank accounts to fund the investment. The withdrawal was completed after the CPF’s daily withdrawal limit was increased. The limit increase was subject to a 12-hour cooling period. A week later, Victor told authorities that he received an SMS alert of a $3,999 withdrawal from his account, a transaction he claims he didn’t authorize. The caller called again after a while, sending the Singaporean more links, but he grew suspicious and wouldn’t have it. He refused to click on the link and started questioning him. Authorities warn users about the rising rate of crypto scams Victor claimed that he asked about the investment, but the caller was unable to give a response, choosing to hang up abruptly after promising to give an update on the trading outcome in three days. Suspecting it was a scam, he contacted the bank to report the incident and block his account. He also contacted the police to make a report. Although he lost $4,249, the Singaporean was relieved that he detected the scam early enough to prevent further losses. According to a statement by Police Superintendent Rosie Ann McIntyre, assistant director of the Scam Public Education Office’s operations department, losses from investment scams have increased greatly. She noted that the victims are often enticed by the fake testimonies and endorsements, as in the case of the Singaporean. McIntyre noted that most times, the scammers take months to cultivate their victims till they are ready to deal a huge blow, then they move in for the kill. She also added that the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of digital assets makes it easy for criminals to adopt the assets, while noting that it makes recovery efforts challenging.

He posted an image of a letter from Teresa Goody Guillén, former SEC litigation counsel and current partner at BakerHostetler. He emphasized the letter as a massive victory for the XRP army, noting that it clarifies key legal points about digital assets. The letter directly addresses the SEC Crypto Task Force. It responds to a Ripple communication dated January 9, 2026 . Goody Guillén confirms her agreement with Ripple’s position regarding the legal status of XRP. BankXRP highlighted her statement, showing clear alignment with Ripple’s arguments on speculative interest versus securities law. Big Moves for $XRP The latest from Teresa Goody Guillen (Partner at BakerHostetler and former SEC litigation counsel) is a massive win for the #XRPCommunity ! In her letter to the SEC Crypto Task Force, she makes it crystal clear: Speculation is not a security. Why this… pic.twitter.com/icb8ymuhTy — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) January 29, 2026 Clarifying the Legal Position In her correspondence, Goody Guillén challenges the SEC’s “passive economic interest” argument. She specifies that holding XRP does not create an investment contract with Ripple simply because investors anticipate price appreciation. This distinction is central to Ripple’s defense strategy and has been a point of contention in previous SEC assessments. Her letter provides context from her prior research on digital asset market structures. She explains that her work was cited in the Ripple letter to clarify misunderstandings and emphasizes that no single factor should determine regulatory outcomes. Her analysis focuses on economic abstraction factors, supporting the view that XRP ownership alone does not constitute a security transaction. Support for Digital Value Instruments Goody Guillén references the Digital Value Instruments (DVI) framework, which Ripple has been promoting as a regulatory approach for digital assets. By agreeing with Ripple’s assertion, she reinforces the legal position that XRP holders are not automatically participants in a security contract . The letter also includes supporting documents. These contain proposed market structure legislation, a summary of her evolving methodology, and a speech delivered at Carnegie Mellon explaining her approach. The materials illustrate the historical context of regulatory frameworks and their application to digital assets like XRP.

By confirming that speculation alone does not trigger securities regulation, Goody Guillén provides legal clarity. BankXRP notes that this signals a shift toward clearer regulatory standards in digital asset markets. Outlook for XRP XRP supporters have welcomed the letter as confirmation of the asset’s legal standing . The community sees this as a reinforcement of Ripple’s ongoing efforts to distinguish XRP from securities. BankXRP noted that major legal voices are siding with clear definitions and structured frameworks. The letter marks a crucial moment for the XRP ecosystem. BankXRP stated, “The era of regulation by enforcement is crumbling.” Legal clarification from recognized experts helps solidify market confidence and supports ongoing XRP adoption efforts.

Key Takeaways: US winter storms forced miners offline, driving a 12% drop in Bitcoin’s network hashrate. Mining revenues and output fell sharply as power disruptions hit major operators. The slowdown marks the steepest production decline since the post-halving period in 2024. Total network hashrate has fallen by roughly 12% since Nov. 11, marking the steepest drawdown since October 2021, when the network was still stabilizing after China’s sweeping mining ban. Data from CryptoQuant shows the hashrate now sits near 970 exahashes per second, its lowest level since September 2025. US Winter Storms Force Miners Offline, Deepening Hashrate Slump The decline accelerated this week as extreme cold disrupted power supply in several US mining hubs. Publicly listed miners temporarily shut down machines to protect infrastructure and comply with grid curtailment requests, amplifying a slowdown that had already begun as Bitcoin retreated from its $126,000 all-time high toward the $100,000 level late last year. The hashrate shock quickly fed through to miner economics. Daily Bitcoin mining revenue slid from around $45 million on Jan. 22 to a yearly low near $28 million just two days later. Although revenue has since recovered modestly to about $34 million, it remains well below recent averages, reflecting both reduced network activity and weaker prices. Production data points to an equally sharp contraction. Output from the largest publicly traded miners fell from roughly 77 Bitcoin per day to just 28 Bitcoin over the same period. Bitcoin hashrate just saw its biggest drawdown since Oct 2021. US winter storms forced miners offline, pushing hashrate down 12% since Nov 11 to 970 EH/s, the lowest since Sept 2025. The decline had already started as BTC corrected from $126K to ~$100K. pic.twitter.com/LudRmBO0lv — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 29, 2026 Production from other miners declined from about 403 bitcoin to 209 bitcoin, pulling total network output sharply lower. Looking at a 30-day rolling basis, publicly listed miners recorded a 48-Bitcoin drop in production, the steepest decline since May 2024, shortly after the most recent halving event. Output from privately held miners fell by 215 Bitcoin, the largest decrease since July 2024, underscoring the broad impact of the disruption. Bitcoin Miner Profitability Hits Lowest Level Since November 2024 Profitability has deteriorated alongside falling output. CryptoQuant’s Miner Profit and Loss Sustainability Index has dropped to 21, its lowest reading since November 2024. The level signals deep stress across the sector, with revenues failing to cover operating costs for a growing share of the network, despite multiple downward difficulty adjustments over recent epochs. While mining difficulty has eased as machines went offline, the relief has not been sufficient to offset declining prices and operational disruptions tied to extreme weather. If hashrate remains depressed, further difficulty cuts could follow in the coming weeks, offering some margin relief to operators that remain online. According to a recent analysis by independent researcher Daniel Batten, Bitcoin mining can strengthen electrical grids and lower consumer electricity costs rather than strain power systems. His research challenges common claims that mining destabilizes grids or drives up energy prices, drawing on peer-reviewed studies and operational data to argue that the industry’s flexible power usage can provide measurable system benefits.

Though it is good to have size, it is also good to have the potential for huge percentage gain, which is not the case with Bitcoin (BTC). This makes investors look for the next big cryptocurrency, and one such crypto to buy is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This coin is priced at $0.04 and offers a decentralized finance platform with a dual lending and borrowing system and a strong focus on revenue-driven tokenomics and incentives. The presale is in full swing with more than $20.25 million already raised. Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidates Under Key Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is trading under key resistance, with repeated failures to sustain above the upper trendline and key EMAs, which indicates that the upward potential is still low. The recent upswings have not been strong, but the RSI is also moving up, though the price is not yet reflecting the same. The asset can either attempt to rise towards the resistance levels or can start falling towards the $80,000 zone. Amidst this consolidation, investors looking for the next big crypto instead may find better upside in emerging DeFi tokens. MUTM Presale Highlights Strong Investor Interest Since its introduction in early 2025, the Mutuum Finance token presale has shown promising signs, garnering significant interest from investors. The token price has risen from an initial $0.01 to its current price of $0.04 in Phase 7, providing a 4x return for early investors in Phase 1. In total, the token has raised $20.25 million from over 18,930 investors. This strong performance confirms why MUTM is considered the best crypto to buy for those seeking growth beyond Bitcoin. Investors who have invested in the token at the current price have a chance to earn significant returns when the token price appreciates in the future. For instance, an investment of $800 at the current price could reach $1,200 at the time of the official token launch, providing an instant profit of $400. In the future, as the token becomes increasingly popular and its ecosystem grows, the investment could reach $8,000, as analysts predict a 10x rally to $0.40. Smart investors consider MUTM the best crypto to buy in 2026. Earn Yield While Retaining Liquidity Mutuum Finance provides investors with an opportunity to earn yields from their crypto assets while at the same time maintaining liquidity. For instance, a deposit of 5 ETH could earn an APY between 7-10% in MUTM’s lending pools, while at the same time it could be used as collateral to access MUTM’s native stablecoin. The interest earned from the lent ETH could be used to pay some of the MUTM stablecoin loan. The system provides peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. In the peer-to-contract system, users deposit their assets into liquidity pools and earn interest depending on the utilization of the pool. In the peer-to-peer system, borrowers and investors engage in a negotiation to form a contract. For example, a user can borrow a $5,500 USDT loan and use $8,250 of their SHIB as collateral. This system provides an opportunity for users to explore the options that are most suitable to their needs and requirements. This makes MUTM an attractive option for investors who are seeking the best crypto to buy. Robust Risk Management: A Reason to Invest in MUTM Risk and security are the most critical factors that any investor looks for before investing in any cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance provides the most secure and robust system to its users. All loans are over-collateralized, and the loan-to-value ratio of the assets could go as high as 80% for coins like Ethereum. This means that $10,000 worth of Ethereum can be used to borrow $8,000. Using the services of Chainlink oracles, the price of the assets is updated in real-time. This helps to prevent any volatility effects that may affect the protocol. For example, the price of Ethereum may fall from $3,000 to $2,800. The oracle will immediately update the price to the new rate, which helps to prevent any unfair liquidations. Although Bitcoin remains the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it has limited explosive growth potential due to its large market capitalization. This has encouraged investors to explore the next big crypto. This cryptocurrency that investors have been waiting for is Mutuum Finance. The presale of MUTM has already managed to raise $20 million. This cryptocurrency also provides a live DeFi lending system and robust security, making it a strong contender for anyone hunting the next big crypto.

The clip illustrates how digital assets are becoming a practical option for everyday transactions, even in locations where major international payment systems are unavailable. In the video, Speed browses a selection of earrings. He asks the shopkeeper about the price, and the cost is given in local currency and USD. When Speed inquires about Apple Pay, the shopkeeper confirms that he cannot accept payments through that channel. Speed then suggests USDT, which the shopkeeper accepts. LATEST: Paolo Ardoino shared a video showing iShowSpeed using USDT for shopping in Nigeria. pic.twitter.com/w43xR3qHKA — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 30, 2026 Crypto as a Practical Payment Tool The transaction demonstrates that cryptocurrencies can function effectively in real-world commerce. Cryptocurrencies allow buyers to transact without relying on traditional banking infrastructure or digital wallets linked to major credit card systems. In regions like Nigeria, where global payment solutions are limited, crypto payments offer flexibility for both consumers and businesses. Speed’s interaction with the shopkeeper highlights that some merchants are ready to accept digital currencies. The shop’s willingness to process a USDT payment indicates a growing comfort with cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. This aligns with broader trends in the region, where merchants are increasingly integrating crypto payment solutions to meet demand. Visibility and Influence The video has brought additional visibility to the use of USDT in practical settings. Assets like XRP are dominating the global payment space , and this video highlights the reach cryptocurrencies now have. The video reinforces the narrative that digital assets are not limited to trading and investment but can be applied in everyday life. The video also highlights the contrast between traditional payment systems and the adoption of cryptocurrencies. While Apple Pay and card payments remain inaccessible in many cases, cryptocurrencies provide a seamless alternative. The transaction emphasizes that crypto can bridge gaps where traditional infrastructure is unavailable, making it a reliable option for global commerce. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Crypto Adoption Transactions like the one captured in the video contribute to wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies. By demonstrating usability in a real-world setting, they encourage more merchants to consider digital currencies as legitimate payment options. USDT, and other notable stablecoins like RLUSD and USDC, provide predictability, addressing concerns about volatility and making them suitable for routine purchases. Speed’s purchase shows that cryptocurrencies are not limited to niche markets or speculative trading. Instead, they function as a tangible tool for everyday commerce. Banks are already using XRP , and other prominent assets are entering the mainstream financial space. This example from Nigeria demonstrates that adoption is spreading beyond investment circles into ordinary transactions, providing a model for how crypto can integrate with local economies.

The arrest and charges follow an investigation into a large-scale scam operation that targeted victims across several states. Following their arrest, the suspects are facing three counts of money laundering each. The suspects, Tejas Patel and Navya Bhatt, were part of a network of scammers terrorizing residents across several states. Authorities mentioned that the duo allegedly played several roles in a series of scams that saw them steal thousands of dollars from victims in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Investigators claimed that the scam included PayPal fraud, fake Microsoft computer repair schemes, and other Bitcoin and digital assets-related schemes. The United States arrests Indians targeting Americans in scam activities According to authorities, the Indian scammers usually instruct their victims to make payments using unusual methods. Some forms of payment include gold bars, cryptocurrency, and large amounts of cash at different locations. Court documents revealed how one woman in Toledo was deceived into handing over more than $40,000 in cash after the suspects falsely claimed they were representatives of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Federal authorities mentioned that the money laundering operation was tied to a bigger network involving the concealing and moving of funds obtained through illicit activities. The investigation was led by the FBI’s Cleveland Division Cyber Squad, which focuses primarily on computer-related and financial crimes. Both men were present at a federal court on Friday, where they waived their preliminary hearing. The court documents showed that Bhat was a student at the University of Toledo. Patel is scheduled to return to court on February 6 for a detention hearing. Bhat is presently under an ICE detainer and has not been given another date to appear in court. Other suspects who had already been apprehended before the court received the affidavit were also named in the complaint as being part of the scheme. The affidavit revealed that they played strategic roles to help the network carry out their operations, listing Vedantkumar Patel and Visweswarayya Kunuku as couriers. ED busts illegal call centers in India In a related event, the Enforcement Directorate of India, Jalandhar Zonal Office, announced that it conducted search operations at nine locations across Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana. The search was conducted in connection with a money laundering investigation against individuals involved in operating a financial crime network. The individuals operate illegal call centers, targeting foreign citizens in a bid to scam them out of their cash and digital assets. In the statement issued by the ED, the search operation covered the residential property of Money, Gaurav Verma, and Dakshay Sethi. The ED investigation, which was carried out on intel supplied by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), revealed that the illegal call center had more than 36 employees. The Indian agency claimed that the suspects cheated US victims by acting as technical call support centers. They also falsely claimed to be associated with the IRS on some other occasions. The Indian ED claimed that the criminals were able to convince their victims to transfer funds into their crypto wallets in some cases, while moving the funds to a wallet that they controlled in other cases. The ED claimed that the investigations revealed that some of the criminal proceeds have been moved into real estate by the accused persons. The search operation resulted in the recovery and seizure of several digital devices, cash, and records linking the apprehended individuals to the operation. Get seen where it counts.

The alternative coins bled out heavily as well, with the likes of ETH, XRP, SOL, and many others plunging by double digits at one point. The total crypto market cap erased around $200 billion in hours. BTC Dumped to $75K It was already a painful week for BTC, which began with a nosedive last Sunday and Monday when the asset fell from $89,000 to a five-month low at the time of $86,000. It recovered in the following days to over $90,000 before the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, but started to drop in the hours after the Fed paused the interest rate cuts. The situation worsened on Thursday when some of the US Navy moved closer to Iran as the tension in the Middle East skyrocketed. Bitcoin lost $9,000 in hours and fell to $81,000 for the first time since last July. It recovered some ground on Friday while the precious metal market crumbled . However, the bears took control once again on Saturday. BTC traded sideways around $83,000 and $84,000 when it suddenly initiated a massive leg down , resulting in a crash to just over $75,000. Thus, the cryptocurrency had lost roughly $20,000 in less than two weeks. Despite recovering to $79,000 as of now, BTC is still 5% down on the day. Its market cap has plunged below $1.6 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 57.4% on CG. BTCUSD Feb 1. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out Ethereum was among the worst performers yesterday when it plummeted from roughly $2,800 to $2,250. Ripple’s XRP plunged to a 14-month low at $1.50. Most other altcoins followed a similar trajectory with massive declines, and have managed to post only modest rebounds in the past 12 hours or so. The 24-hour scale now shows a clear and painful picture, with a 9% drop for SOL, a 10% decline for XMR, while LTC, SUI, LINK, and DOGE are down by about 5%.

This substantial transaction, valued at approximately $243 million based on prevailing market rates, immediately triggered widespread analysis among market observers and institutional investors. The movement represents one of the most significant single transfers to a centralized exchange this quarter, potentially signaling important market developments. Ethereum Whale Transfer Analysis: Breaking Down the $243 Million Movement Blockchain analysts immediately began examining the transaction details following the Whale Alert notification. The transfer originated from a wallet address with no publicly identifiable owner, a common characteristic of institutional or sophisticated private holdings. Transaction data reveals the movement occurred in a single block confirmation, suggesting the sender prioritized speed over cost optimization. Furthermore, the precise amount of 99,998 ETH rather than a round 100,000 indicates possible consideration of exchange withdrawal limits or tax implications. Market data from the transaction period shows Ethereum trading between $2,425 and $2,435 per token, placing the total value between $242.5 million and $243.5 million. This substantial movement represents approximately 0.08% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, a significant concentration for a single transaction. Historical comparison reveals this ranks among the top 20 largest single transfers to exchanges since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Cryptocurrency Market Context and Historical Precedents The cryptocurrency market has witnessed similar substantial movements throughout its history, often preceding notable price volatility. For instance, in January 2024, a transfer of 85,000 ETH to another major exchange preceded a 12% price correction over the following week. Conversely, in July 2023, large exchange inflows coincided with accumulation periods before significant rallies. Market analysts therefore scrutinize such movements for potential signals about investor sentiment and strategic positioning. Current market conditions add particular significance to this transfer. Ethereum has demonstrated relative stability throughout early 2025, trading within a 15% range for the past three months. The network continues to process approximately 1.2 million transactions daily, with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols locking over $45 billion in value. This transaction occurs against a backdrop of increasing institutional adoption, with spot Ethereum ETF trading volumes reaching record levels in traditional finance markets. Expert Perspectives on Large Cryptocurrency Movements Financial analysts specializing in blockchain data interpretation emphasize multiple possible explanations for such substantial transfers. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a cryptocurrency market researcher at Stanford University, notes: “Large movements to exchanges typically suggest one of several scenarios: portfolio rebalancing by institutional holders, preparation for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, or potential selling pressure. However, without additional context about the wallet’s history, we cannot definitively determine intent.” Blockchain forensic firms employ sophisticated techniques to analyze such transactions. Chainalysis and similar companies track wallet patterns, historical behavior, and connection networks to provide insights. Their methodologies include analyzing transaction timing relative to market events, examining gas fee patterns for urgency indicators, and reviewing historical wallet activity for behavioral patterns. These analytical approaches help market participants interpret the potential implications of substantial movements. Technical Implications for Ethereum Network and Exchange Operations The technical execution of this transfer provides insights into current network conditions and sender sophistication. The transaction utilized a gas fee of approximately 0.003 ETH ($7.30), indicating moderate network congestion at the time of execution. The single-transaction approach rather than batched transfers suggests either urgency or simplicity of execution. Exchange deposit procedures for such substantial amounts typically involve multiple security confirmations and compliance checks before funds become available for trading or withdrawal. Binance’s handling of large deposits follows established protocols developed through years of high-volume operations. The exchange employs automated monitoring systems that flag unusually large movements for additional review. These systems help prevent market manipulation while ensuring regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. For deposits exceeding certain thresholds, exchanges often coordinate with the depositor to ensure smooth processing and minimize market impact. Market Impact Analysis and Trader Sentiment Indicators Following the transaction disclosure, market data reveals several notable developments. Ethereum’s price experienced a brief 1.8% decline in the hour following the Whale Alert report, though it recovered most losses within the subsequent trading session. Derivatives markets showed increased put option volume, indicating some traders positioned for potential downside. However, overall funding rates across major exchanges remained neutral, suggesting balanced sentiment among leveraged traders. Historical analysis of similar events provides context for potential outcomes. The table below compares this transfer with three notable historical precedents: Date Amount (ETH) Destination Subsequent 7-Day Price Change Nov 2023 75,000 Coinbase -8.2% Mar 2024 120,000 Kraken +5.7% Aug 2024 95,500 Binance -3.1% Mar 2025 99,998 Binance TBD Market participants monitor several key indicators following such events: Exchange outflow patterns – Whether funds remain on exchange or move to private wallets Order book depth changes – Modifications to buy/sell wall structures on major exchanges Options market activity – Shifts in put/call ratios and implied volatility Network activity metrics – Changes in transaction volume and active address counts Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Substantial cryptocurrency transfers attract regulatory attention across multiple jurisdictions. Financial authorities increasingly focus on large movements as part of broader market surveillance efforts. In the United States, transactions exceeding $10,000 typically trigger reporting requirements under existing financial regulations. International frameworks like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines establish standards for virtual asset service providers monitoring substantial transactions. Exchanges implement sophisticated compliance systems to address regulatory requirements. These systems include: Transaction monitoring algorithms flagging unusual patterns Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for counterparties Anti-Money Laundering (AML) screening against watchlists Reporting mechanisms for suspicious activity These compliance measures help maintain market integrity while preventing illicit financial activities. The transparent nature of blockchain technology actually facilitates regulatory oversight compared to traditional financial systems. Conclusion The stunning Ethereum whale transfer of 99,998 ETH to Binance represents a significant market event worthy of careful analysis. This $243 million movement highlights the continued maturation of cryptocurrency markets, where substantial transactions occur within established regulatory and operational frameworks. While the immediate market impact appears limited, such events provide valuable insights into holder behavior and market structure. The Ethereum whale transfer ultimately demonstrates the scale and sophistication of contemporary cryptocurrency markets, where multi-million dollar movements represent routine operations within an increasingly institutional ecosystem. Market participants will continue monitoring subsequent wallet activity and exchange flows for additional signals about market direction and participant strategies. FAQs Q1: What does a large Ethereum transfer to an exchange typically indicate? Large transfers to exchanges often signal potential selling activity, portfolio rebalancing, or preparation for over-the-counter transactions. However, without additional context about the wallet’s history and subsequent movements, definitive conclusions remain speculative. Q2: How do exchanges handle such large cryptocurrency deposits? Exchanges employ automated systems that flag large deposits for additional review. These systems ensure regulatory compliance, prevent market manipulation, and coordinate with depositors when necessary to minimize market impact during processing. Q3: What analytical methods do experts use to interpret whale movements? Analysts examine transaction timing, gas fees, historical wallet behavior, market conditions, and subsequent fund movements. Blockchain forensic firms also analyze connection networks and pattern recognition to provide insights. Q4: How does this transfer compare to historical Ethereum movements? This transfer ranks among the top 20 largest single movements to exchanges since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. It exceeds most 2024 transfers but remains below the all-time record of 450,000 ETH moved in a single 2021 transaction. Q5: What regulatory considerations apply to large cryptocurrency transfers? Transactions typically trigger reporting requirements under financial regulations, with exchanges implementing KYC, AML, and transaction monitoring systems. International frameworks like FATF guidelines establish standards for monitoring substantial virtual asset movements.

On Friday, January 31, it seemed like the crypto market was gearing for another slow-action weekend as prices somewhat steadied after Thursday’s bloodbath . However, the market has completely gone against the trend this weekend, with Bitcoin and the other large-cap digital assets falling by almost double digits on Saturday. Here is a look at the factors behind this steep decline and the immediate outlook for crypto prices. Why Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Dropped This Weekend Following Bitcoin’s initial descent to $81,000, different reasons, ranging from geopolitical tensions to the FOMC’s decision to keep the interest rates unchanged, swirled around. However, the continuous decline of prices, even during the typically sluggish weekend, suggests that other factors are at play. In a new post on the social media platform X, prominent financial markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter weighed in on the possible reasons behind the market-wide downturn in recent days. According to the report, a look at the crypto flow data would shed more light on this market conundrum. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the recent price decline witnessed by the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is completely a liquidity situation. As shown in the highlighted chart, Bitcoin has witnessed three well-defined liquidation waves, summing up to over $1.3 billion over the past day. The financial markets commentator also mentioned that the crypto market liquidity has been choppy at best lately. However, sustained levels of extreme leverage in the Bitcoin market have caused the formation of “air pockets” in price. The Kobeissi Letter added: Couple this with herd-like sentiment, constantly shifting from extreme bullishness to extreme bearishness, and the swings become even more aggressive. Unsurprisingly, the market-wide price correction saw the market hit with one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history. Market data shows that about $2.5 billion worth of levered longs have been liquidated in the digital asset market over the past 24 hours, the 10th-largest crypto liquidation event ever. More notably, over $1 billion worth of levered long positions were forcibly closed within 5 minutes, as the Bitcoin price fell to around $76,000 on Saturday. Total Crypto Market Cap Down By 7% As of this writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at around $2.725 trillion, reflecting a nearly 7% dip in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto liquidations,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-01 11:00:29

In the video, Trump indicated that the new Fed chair will be someone he believes will do a good job in leading the central bank. Challenges Under Powell This development comes as the crypto sector has faced challenges under current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump put pressure on Powell throughout 2025 and publicly criticized his policies. He recently took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing him, signaling a shift in approach toward the Federal Reserve. A new Fed chair aligned with pro-crypto policies could accelerate reforms in liquidity provision and settlement infrastructure. THIS IS IMPORTANT $XRP HOLDERS New Fed chair announcement next week Trump's new Fed chair could prioritize easier liquidity and faster settlement rails XRP operates in that exact space Growth agenda aligns with tokenization infrastructure Been here long enough to know https://t.co/3TQlSI1d47 pic.twitter.com/M2cOltWSOT — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 30, 2026 XRP’s Role in Modern Finance XRP operates directly in the areas a new Fed chair could influence. The token functions as a bridge for cross-border payments, enabling faster settlement and liquidity movement. X Finance Bull believes the new Fed Chair will focus on these areas, indirectly giving XRP an edge. The digital asset’s infrastructure aligns closely with a Federal Reserve that prioritizes efficient payment rails and tokenization. If the Fed adopts policies favoring faster liquidity and digital asset integration, XRP’s adoption could accelerate within traditional finance. Significance of the Announcement The timing of this announcement is significant. Crypto markets have long waited for regulatory clarity and infrastructure support from U.S. financial authorities. A Fed chair who supports digital assets could reshape the landscape for institutional use, making XRP’s network more relevant to major banks and financial institutions. Trump’s Policy Moves Trump’s recent moves demonstrate a clear focus on reforming the Fed’s current stance. After over a year of struggles with Powell, Trump is taking a major step to move the Federal Reserve forward. Subpoenaing Powell shows that the administration is willing to take action when monetary policy slows liquidity or limits crypto integration. This step may pave the way for leadership that prioritizes digital payment networks and tokenized assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Impact on XRP and Crypto Markets X Finance Bull emphasized that this new leadership aligns with the growth agenda for XRP. By facilitating faster settlements and increasing liquidity, a pro-crypto Fed chair could enhance the token’s practical utility . XRP’s network is already capable of supporting high-volume transactions and cross-border payments at scale. Federal support could increase adoption across banking infrastructure. The new Fed chair could also impact U.S. monetary policy in ways that benefit the broader crypto ecosystem. Easier liquidity and faster settlement rails would reduce friction for digital assets, potentially increasing institutional participation. XRP’s design directly supports these objectives, providing a bridge between legacy systems and emerging digital infrastructure.

Indeed, during the last week of January, the world’s largest asset manager recorded combined outflows of about $1.2 billion from its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Data from January 26 to January 30 shows that BlackRock offloaded approximately $947 million worth of Bitcoin through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), alongside about $264 million of Ethereum via its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The most intense Bitcoin selling occurred toward the end of the week. On January 29, IBIT recorded net outflows of roughly $318 million, followed by an even larger $528 million exit the next day. Earlier in the week, selling pressure was also persistent, with an additional $103 million in outflows on January 27, only partially offset by a modest inflow at the start of the period. These outflows have partly contributed to the continued plunge in Bitcoin, which has since lost the $80,000 support zone. Total Bitcoin spot ETF net inflow. Source: Coinglass By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $78,461, down more than 6% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, the cryptocurrency has corrected by over 11%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold BlackRock Ethereum outflows Ethereum mirrored this pattern, though on a smaller scale. ETHA experienced steady selling throughout the week, culminating in a significant $157 million outflow on January 30 after already shedding nearly $55 million the previous day. While January 28 briefly saw a $27 million inflow, it proved insufficient to counterbalance the broader trend, leaving Ethereum ETFs firmly in net outflow territory by week’s end. Total Ethereum spot ETF net inflow. Source: Coinglass Overall, BlackRock’s activity unfolded amid widespread weakness across U.S.-listed crypto ETFs. Bitcoin spot ETFs collectively posted multiple consecutive days of net outflows, including a nearly $818 million exit on January 29 alone, signaling that selling pressure extended well beyond a single issuer. Ethereum ETFs also recorded persistent withdrawals, pointing to a broader pullback from digital asset exposure among institutional investors. To this end, the Ethereum price is also under pressure, dropping over 10% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2,415 as of press time. The scale and timing of the outflows suggest that late January’s crypto ETF selling was not driven by isolated fund rebalancing, but rather by a broader reassessment of market conditions. With Bitcoin and Ethereum prices both under pressure during the period, ETF flows indicate that large investors opted to de-risk aggressively heading into February.

This is an important milestone. The self-driving car company is wrapping up a deal to bring in $16 billion from backers, sources with knowledge of the matter told reporters. This latest investment would more than double what the business was previously valued at. Major investors fuel expansion plans Alphabet, the tech giant that owns Google and originally developed the autonomous driving venture through its experimental X division, plans to put up most of the money being raised. Four individuals close to the financing said the parent company will cover over three-quarters of the total amount. Several prominent investment firms are joining the effort for the first time. These include Silicon Valley-based Dragoneer and Sequoia Capital, along with DST Global, which is backed by investor Yuri Milner. Current backer Andreessen Horowitz intends to invest additional funds, while Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi government’s investment arm that already holds a stake, will add several hundred million dollars more. People briefed on the deal said the company’s yearly subscription-based revenue projections have climbed past $350 million. In a statement, Waymo acknowledged its progress without discussing financial specifics. “While we don’t comment on private financial matters, our trajectory is clear: with over 20mn trips completed, we are focused on the safety-led operational excellence and technological leadership required to meet the vast demand for autonomous mobility,” the company said. Representatives from Andreessen, Dragoneer, DST, Mubadala and Sequoia all declined to provide comment. Leading the robotaxi market The autonomous taxi operator has cemented its position at the front of the industry, logging more than 125 million miles of fully self-directed driving on American streets with relatively few safety problems. The company project s it will provide 1 million trips weekly this year across multiple metropolitan areas, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Miami. While riders primarily book trips through Waymo’s own mobile application, the service has also teamed up with Uber to operate in additional cities such as Austin and Atlanta. Alphabet is gathering more resources to support its nationwide expansion, including plans for New York. The company began trials in international locations such as London and Tokyo last year as competition intensifies from Musk’s Tesla and China’s Baidu. The company’s fleet uses a mix of cameras, laser-based Lidar sensors and comprehensive street mapping systems. These vehicles qualify as level four autonomous, meaning they operate without any driver present or need for human oversight. Waymo is transitioning from Jaguar I-Pace SUVs to Hyundai Ioniq 5 models and larger vans manufactured b y Ch inese automaker Zeekr as part of efforts to reduce expenses. The main rival is Tesla , which introduced its own “robotaxi” product in Austin, Texas, last year. In the end, the electric vehicle manufacturer wants to allow millions of its owners to rent out their vehicles to the service while they are not in use. Tesla takes a very different strategy, using only cameras and no Lidar technology. This has led to persistent worries about safety regulations. Following a fatal collision involving its autopilot technology, the carmaker recently lost a Florida court battle and was sentenced to pay $243 million in damages. Tesla’s “full self-driving” capability only meets level two autonomy standards, requiring drivers to remain alert constantly. Its Austin robotaxi operations still mandate either a safety monitor inside the vehicle or following in a separate car. The autonomous driving firm previously secured $5.6 billion in funding during October 2024, which gave it a valuation exceeding $45 billion. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to the details shared by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the country did not deem it fit to make any revisions concerning taxes from crypto transactions. Since the beginning of the year, there have been numerous calls by participants in the crypto industry in India for a review of the current crypto tax framework. According to most people, the Budget 2026 provided an opportunity for the country to carry out a tax reform that would encourage local and international participation. At the time, industry experts expected the budget to focus on simplification and clarity as the crypto market matures. However, the country has chosen to stick with the current framework. India retains existing crypto framework despite calls for reform During the highly anticipated announcement, the Finance Minister did not announce any revisions to the 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) on crypto transactions or the restrictions on offsetting losses. According to industry experts, these policies have long since posed challenges to investors and traders in the country’s crypto sector. Edu Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said the decision to maintain the tax framework shows continuity. The CEO noted that the industry was expecting reforms that would improve market participation and onshore liquidity. Patel also said that while the sector has been growing despite the regulatory and tax challenges, a reform of transaction taxes and enabling loss offsets would have strengthened the country’s competitive edge in the global digital asset economy. However, he mentioned that he is confident that continued dialogue between policymakers and the industry will help shape the framework in the future. Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX , also shared a similar thought. Shetty noted that sticking to the existing framework means traders and investors are still faced with challenges in the crypto market. He noted that the decision means that aspects like liquidity, participation, and competitiveness on the global stage would be greatly affected. Like Patel, Shetty remains hopeful that dialogue with the right authorities would address all these issues when the time comes. Industry experts hail penalties for compliance In her Budget 2026, the Indian Finance Minister said that to ensure that traders comply with the provisions of Section 509 of the Income Tax Act, and create deterrence for non-reporting of statements or for reporting inaccurate information with respect to crypto assets, she is introducing a penalty provision. Under this provision, it will introduce a penalty of Rs. 200 per day for non-reporting of statements and Rs. 50,000 for reporting inaccurate statements and failure to correct the statement. The minister noted that the new amendment will take effect from April 1, 2026. Ashish Singhal, co-founder of CoinSwitch, mentioned that the introduction of specific penalties for not reporting crypto transactions is a right step for the crypto industry. He said that by mandating and enforcing the penalties for not reporting transactions and inaccurate reporting for tax purposes, the government has formalized a new standard of tax compliance and reporting for both users and crypto exchange platforms. While compliance and surveillance have grown, Singhal added that true growth requires economic moves that would keep Web3 companies and talents within India. The Income Tax Act contains provisions under Sections 115BBH and 194S, which govern the taxation of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) like crypto, NFTs, and other tokens in India. VDA gains will continue to be taxed at a flat rate of 30%, while 1% will be deducted at source on every transaction. In addition, non-trading income will also be taxed as per the individual’s income slab. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

On Saturday, January 31st, the world’s leading cryptocurrency seemingly led other crypto assets south of the charts, with its price falling from $84,350 to as low as $75,000 in a single swoop. As this unfolded, an inversely correlated shift also played out underneath the charts. A recent on-chain evaluation has pointed out that Bitcoin’s Long-term Holder behavior is changing, contrary to what its short-term holders are doing. Long-Term Holders Accumulate As Short-Term Supply Declines Pseudonymous on-chain analyst Darkfost recently took to CryptoQuant, via a Quicktake post, pointing out that Bitcoin’s long-term holders are racking up more BTC. The relevant indicator here is the LTH supply change (Coinbase fix). Related Reading: Rising Above The Ashes: XRP ETFs Set New Record Despite Market Crash For context, this metric tracks the net change in the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term holders (typically coins unmoved for ~155 days). According to the analyst, approximately 186,000 (on a monthly average) have been added to the Long-term holders’ supply. Seeing as more coins are aging past 155 days, Darkfost implied that short-term holder supply is, in turn, witnessing steady contraction. Notably, the analyst pointed out this kind of transition (between long-term and short-term investors) last happened in April, as the Bitcoin price retraced. As it is intuitively evident, a rising LTH supply is typically interpreted as growing conviction among Bitcoin’s long-term investors. By extension, this means that long-term holders are distributing less of their holdings and stowing away more. In theory, this behavior is bullish news for the cryptocurrency. This is because, as LTHs absorb supply, the amount of available Bitcoin for sale reduces. Historically, it is also a bullish signal for the BTC price, as it has often appeared during the early stages of accumulation periods or late into correction stages. However, the broader market implications in the current context might not be so favorable. Darkfost highlighted that there is very weak demand available to cushion the falling BTC price. At the same time, the Bitcoin market appears to be entering a bearish phase; hence, it is not far-fetched to see major capitulation events in the near-term. If this happens, the Bitcoin price would likely plummet, as weaker investors may sell off their holdings in fear or as victims of liquidation events. For a bullish outlook to be truly relevant, there has to be a clear recovery in demand, alongside continued long-term holder accumulation. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of press time, the Bitcoin price stands at approximately $78,060, reflecting a 6.9% loss in the past day.

Crypto analyst and developer Bird (@Bird_XRPL) highlighted the asset’s current performance with a chart signaling potential for a strong upward move. The chart shows XRP consolidating within a triangle pattern against Ethereum for several months, with its price compressing toward the apex. Bird’s post suggests that XRP could break out of this consolidation phase, which has captured the attention of traders and investors watching the pair closely. XRP is about to run HARD against Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/XChd6QTfIj — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 30, 2026 Support and Resistance Lines The chart demonstrates XRP maintaining support along a rising trendline while facing resistance from a descending trendline. This pattern reflects a period of stability and accumulation. Bird’s visual emphasizes the critical point where the two trendlines converge, suggesting that XRP is approaching a decisive moment . A breakout from this structure could trigger a rapid increase in XRP relative to Ethereum. Current Trading Levels and Breakout Potential Currently, XRP trades at 0.0006402 ETH, placing it near $1.67. This level aligns with the lower boundary of the triangle, indicating strong support. The descending resistance line has repeatedly capped price movements, creating multiple tests over several months. Each attempt to breach resistance has been met with temporary pullbacks, but the ongoing consolidation suggests that selling pressure is weakening. Bird’s analysis points to a scenario where XRP could surpass its previous highs against Ethereum once the consolidation resolves. The chart includes a projection with an upward arrow extending sharply from the triangle’s apex, signaling a potential breakout . Traders interpret this as a setup in which buying pressure may increase sharply, with momentum building as XRP approaches the critical point of convergence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Outlook Historically, XRP has accelerated rapidly once it breaks key resistance levels. The current formation against Ethereum mirrors past periods in which XRP entered consolidation before experiencing a swift upward trend. Traders often monitor such setups closely, as a breakout can attract increased volume and higher price targets. Bird’s chart indicates that the asset is nearing a pivotal stage against Ethereum. The convergence of support and resistance lines highlights a critical decision point for the market. XRP’s surge in early January brought it close to the resistance line. If the digital asset breaks above that level, the chart suggests a strong upward trajectory, with potential for a significant run against ETH.

The current consolidation of the token, coupled with a slowing rate of growth, has prompted investors to look elsewhere for substantial gains. One of the top cryptos that is currently being considered is Mutuum Finance , currently at $0.04. The token is part of the DeFi sector, providing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, revenue-backed tokenomics, and long-term participation rewards. The presale of the token is currently progressing at a rapid rate, with more than 18,930 unique investors and over $20.25 million raised. Ripple (XRP) Consolidates Near Key Resistance The current trading value of Ripple (XRP) is $1.92, pressing into the $1.90-$1.93 resistance band, while the overall crypto market remains cautious and selective. The current consolidation of the token indicates that there is no substantial upward movement, but it is likely to continue trading within a range, providing stability and a strong presence within the crypto sector. The measured growth of the token, coupled with its inability to break higher, suggests some investors are exploring other crypto coins that are currently in the growth stage, providing substantial upside. MUTM: Access Cash Without Selling Your Crypto One of the major challenges faced by cryptocurrency investors is getting cash without selling their assets or missing out on other investment opportunities in the future. However, this problem is solved by the borrowing mechanism used by MUTM. For example, a crypto investor with 5 ETH may need quick cash for an emergency but wouldn’t like to sell his ETH. Via Mutuum Finance, he can use the 5 ETH ($15,000) to acquire a $12,000 USDT loan at an 80% loan-to-value ratio. This allows the ETH to benefit from any future price increases while also giving the investor instant access to cash for other purposes. Explosive Presale Momentum The presale of Mutuum Finance is gaining significant traction in the market. This shows that the project is growing rapidly in its early stages. Initially priced at $0.01 in early 2025, the cryptocurrency’s price has risen to $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale. This shows a 300% increase in price for early investors. Those who invest in Phase 7 of the presale will be able to make an instant profit when Phase 8 kicks off at $0.045 and again when it launches at $0.06. An $800 investment today will turn into $1,200 when the cryptocurrency is launched at $0.06. This gives investors a $400 profit even before they trade in the cryptocurrency exchange markets. In the future, if Mutuum Finance rises by 5,000% in the next bull cycle, its price could rise to $2. Therefore, an $800 investment today could turn into $40,000 in the next bull cycle. The project’s value proposition is so strong that it has received significant backing from investors in its presale phase. So far, $20.25 million has been raised from over 18,930 investors in its presale phase. Next-Generation Lending Mutuum Finance features a two-pronged approach to lending, which offers maximum flexibility. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system offers completely tailored lending. For instance, a lender can lend 5,000 USDC to a borrower who offers $7,500 worth of SHIB as collateral at a 17% APY, which could increase to $5,850 after a year. In addition, the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) protocol provides users with the ability to contribute to aggregated liquidity pools through smart contracts. Depositing $4,000 in USDC into a pool offering 8-10% APY can earn users anywhere from $4,320 to $4,400 in one year, while mtTokens are issued based on each user’s proportionate share of the pool. Similarly, borrowers profit in the same manner, allowing users to gain immediate liquidity through over-collateralization, such as borrowing $4,500 in USDC against $6,000 in ETH without selling their assets. Rewards and Community Incentives Mutuum Finance works hard to build and maintain a strong and loyal community through strategic rewards and incentives. The $100,000 giveaway will reward users with $10,000 in MUTM tokens for completing basic requirements in the presale phase, including wallet verification and a minimum investment of $50. The top buyer of the day also benefits through the top buyer reward, where the user that purchases the most in MUTM tokens throughout the day is rewarded with an additional $500 in MUTM tokens. Not only does this promote early investors, but it also encourages users to remain loyal to the project, securing Mutuum Finance’s position as one of the most promising DeFi projects and a top crypto to buy that is gaining attention in the industry. Although Ripple has experienced its time in the sun, investors are now turning to alternative cryptocurrencies that can offer substantial gains in the coming months. One of these cryptocurrencies is Mutuum Finance priced at just $0.04. This top crypto to buy in 2026 provides users with the ability to borrow against assets without selling. With explosive presale results of over $20.25 million raised and community incentives, MUTM is one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the industry and provides investors with substantial upside, making it a top crypto for those seeking early opportunities in the DeFi market.

The Answers Worried Us,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-4-ais-will-xrp-crumble-below-1-in-february-the-answers-worried-us/,"The landscape around most cryptocurrencies has been quite unfavorable for the past few weeks, and Ripple’s cross-border token was not spared. After a strong start to the new year, in which it rocketed by 30% in days to a multi-week high of just over $2.40 on January 6, the asset was rejected and driven south hard. The latest correction from the last trading week of January brought it south to a 14-month low of $1.50 – a level last seen before the price rally after the US elections in 2024. The question we just asked some of the most popular AI solutions is whether XRP is heading for a new low at or below $1.00 soon. XRP to Hold $1? Gemini was somewhat conservative in its prediction for XRP in February. It noted that after such a prolonged period of enhanced volatility that included several 30% price moves in either direction, the asset is most likely to enter a consolidation phase. More specifically, it named the upcoming period “consolidation followed by a decision point.” In the more favorable scenario for the bulls, this sideways trading could occur at around $1.80-$2.00 if XRP manages to rebound and hold above the $1.65-$1.70 support during the first week of the new month. However, if it fails and falls, the bearish continuation is more likely to transpire at around $1.25-$1.45. Interestingly, Grok also provided an identical price target for the first few weeks of February, suggesting that if the $1.70 floor breaks decisively, there is “very little volume support until the $1.45 region.” It added that this is the “max pain” scenario for late buyers, and essentially dismissed the sub-$1.00 possibility. $1 or Less in Feb? ChatGPT noted that XRP will likely defend the $1.00 level in February. It admitted that the ongoing selling pressure is intense, perhaps due to the escalating global tension, which is also evident from the latest ETF outflows , but believes the $1.00 target is still far from XRP to be causing actual concern. However, it noted that such a possibility is still in the cards for XRP by the end of Q1 and the beginning of Q2. Perplexity was slightly more bearish on the token’s upcoming price performance. It explained that if the geopolitical landscape worsens, which could take place in days if the US indeed attacks Iran, XRP, being a riskier asset, might find itself in another nosedive situation, this time toward $1.00. However, it also dismissed the possibility of a price drop below that level in February, as long as there’s no black swan event. The post We Asked 4 AIs: Will XRP Crumble Below $1 in February?

Reports say a UAE-backed investor paid roughly $500 million for nearly half of the company, a deal that was not widely known when it closed. UAE Money Enters A Trump-Linked Crypto Firm According to multiple reports , Aryam Investment 1 agreed to buy a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial for $500 million. Part of that sum — about $187 million — was paid up front to entities connected to US President Donald Trump and other founders. Executives tied to a major Abu Dhabi tech group were named to the company’s board after the purchase, giving the new backer direct influence over governance. The transfer was signed in January 2025, just days before a major political transition in the US, and it drew immediate attention because of who the company is linked to. Trump & Crypto: High-Level UAE Ties Reports note the investment can be traced to figures close to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a powerful Abu Dhabi official whose interests include technology and national security. That connection has sharpened scrutiny. Lawmakers and watchdogs say such stakes raise hard questions about foreign influence when an entity tied to a sitting US President is involved. Some of the transactions and token purchases connected to the project were disclosed later than critics would prefer, which has fed calls for clearer filings and faster public notice. Political Questions And Oversight The deal also ties into earlier moves by UAE-linked funds to buy the project’s tokens and promote a stablecoin tied to the company’s ecosystem. Reports say those earlier investments helped build momentum for the platform, and that a separate, large investment linked to the stablecoin involved Binance and other partners. Critics argue a big foreign stake in a crypto firm with presidential ties creates both optics and policy concerns, especially as Congress debates tighter rules for stablecoins and foreign investments. Some members of Congress have asked regulators to examine whether rules on disclosure or foreign influence were sidestepped. Mixed Reactions Investors responded with mixed signals. Some welcomed increased funding and new board expertise. Others worried that questions about ownership and governance could undercut confidence in the token and related products. Important details about the buyer’s full ownership structure remain unclear in public filings. Reports say that transparency gaps are central to why oversight officials are asking for more documents and briefings.

57639474,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=906140,1769950989,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57639474.jpeg,Indonesia announces intention to lift ban on xAI chatbot Grok,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/indonesia-lifts-ban-on-grok/,"Indonesia has announced its intention to lift the ban it placed on the xAI chatbot Grok, allowing it to operate under strict guidance and conditions. The information was made by Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs (Komdigi), which said it has begun processing the conditional restoration of access to the chatbot. The agency mentioned that the move was undertaken after a commitment from its parent company to improve compliance with domestic regulations. The move follows the decision from the ministry in January to temporarily block access to Grok over concerns about its misuse to generate non-consensual fake pornographic content on the social media platform X. The platform and the chatbot are both owned by Tesla billionaire CEO Elon Musk. Indonesia restores temporary access to Grok In the statement released on Sunday, Alexander Sabar, the Komdigi’s Director General of Digital Space Monitoring, mentioned that the restoration remains conditional and is being implemented as a measured law enforcement step in cyberspace. He mentioned that the step was taken following a written guideline by X outlining ways to improve its service and prevent its misuse. “We consider this a basis for evaluation, not the end of supervision,” Sabar said. In a letter addressed to Komdigi Minister Meutya Hafid, the company listed several layered measures it has taken to prevent the misuse of Grok in Indonesia. These measures included improved technical safeguards, restricting access to certain features, tightening internal policies, and enforcement mechanisms. The company also added that it has activated incident response protocols. Sabar assured the public that his office will continuously verify and assess these safeguards. In addition, the Director General mentioned that he will also look into the effectiveness of these safeguards in curbing the spread of illegal and explicit content, particularly as part of efforts to protect women and children in the digital space. “The Komdigi Ministry will not hesitate to take corrective action, including reimposing a ban on the AI service, should any inconsistencies or violations be identified,” he stressed. Countries set to improve monitoring on Grok Sabar also added that the Indonesian government remains committed to proportional, transparent, and regulation-based supervisory strategies to safeguard public interests in the digital ecosystem. He mentioned that as a registered electronic system provider, X Corp has pledged to cooperate with the government in fulfilling its legal obligations and contributing to the creation of a safe digital environment. While there is open dialogue, the government has mentioned that the company must fully comply with Indonesian law. Indonesia is not the only country that has given the nod to Grok to resume operations, with the Philippines giving the platform and its chatbot the go-ahead to resume operations. The development was made possible after the company assured authorities of improved safety measures, leading to the country granting the chatbot temporary access. The government claimed that the platform promised that all content-manipulating features had been disabled from the chatbot. Aside from removing the features, the company also agreed to be constantly monitored by regulators to ensure full compliance. “Even after lifting the ban, the CICC will still closely monitor the app to ensure they comply with the rules and regulations in our country,” underscoring caution. The agreement came after the country announced that the chatbot was blocked from operating due to worries of targeted harassment as a result of unscrupulous elements using the chatbot to generate sexualized materials of women and children. Several countries and the European Union also showed their displeasure at the menace. The EU digital watchdog said at the time that it was seriously looking into the complaints made by residents. “Grok is now offering a ‘spicy mode’ showing explicit sexual content with some output generated with childlike images. This is not spicy. This is illegal. This is appalling. This has no place in Europe,” EU digital affairs spokesman Thomas Regnier said then. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

57639475,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=906162,1769951490,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57639475.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Everlight Keeps Appearing in Serious Bitcoin Infrastructure Discussions,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-bitcoin-everlight-keeps-appearing-in-serious-bitcoin-infrastructure-discussions/,"Bitcoin infrastructure discussions tend to filter projects aggressively. Systems built around Bitcoin face higher scrutiny due to Bitcoin’s conservative development culture and resistance to rapid protocol change. As a result, only a small subset of projects repeatedly surface in serious technical and infrastructure-oriented conversations. Bitcoin Everlight has been appearing in those discussions for specific reasons tied to execution timing, system design, and transparency. Each of those factors aligns with how infrastructure credibility is assessed inside the Bitcoin ecosystem. Reason 1: Execution Is Visible During the Presale Phase Most Bitcoin presale projects delay functional deployment until after token distribution. In those cases, execution quality cannot be assessed early, and system behavior emerges only once liquidity and external incentives are already in play. Bitcoin Everlight exposes execution earlier. Its transaction routing layer and node mechanics are active during the presale phase, allowing routing behavior, confirmation timing, and node coordination to be observed before broad adoption. This sequencing enables early technical evaluation under limited participation, which is uncommon among Bitcoin-linked presales. Reason 2: The System Extends Bitcoin Without Altering It Infrastructure projects built around Bitcoin are evaluated on whether they respect Bitcoin’s design constraints. Bitcoin Everlight operates as a lightweight transaction layer alongside Bitcoin , without modifying Bitcoin’s protocol, consensus rules, or monetary properties. Bitcoin remains the settlement layer. Everlight handles transaction routing and confirmation through a separate node network, producing confirmations in seconds through quorum-based validation. Optional anchoring allows transaction batches to reference Bitcoin for settlement integrity while reducing constant base-layer interaction. This separation of concerns aligns with established Bitcoin scaling philosophy. Reason 3: Node Behavior Is Measurable and Enforced Serious infrastructure discussions focus on how incentives shape behavior. Bitcoin Everlight’s node framework is built around continuous performance measurement rather than static participation. Node operators stake BTCL tokens to register and participate in routing and lightweight validation. Compensation is derived from routing micro-fees and adjusted using defined metrics. Uptime coefficients track availability, while performance metrics measure routing latency, confirmation success, and sustained throughput. Nodes demonstrating stronger metrics receive higher routing priority, directly affecting compensation. Nodes that underperform experience reduced routing volume until metrics recover. A fixed 14-day lock period supports predictable participation during early operation. Reason 4: Security and Accountability Are Addressed Early Infrastructure credibility depends on verifiable review and accountability. Bitcoin Everlight has completed independent assessments during its presale phase. Smart contract logic and system components have been reviewed through the SpyWolf Audit and the SolidProof Audit , examining execution paths, deployment structure, and relevant risk surfaces. Team identity verification has been completed through SpyWolf KYC Verification and Vital Block KYC Validation . These steps establish identifiable accountability behind development, governance, and operational control, which is a prerequisite for institutional and infrastructure-focused evaluation. Reason 5: Token Distribution Aligns With Network Activity Distribution structure plays a role in infrastructure credibility when it aligns with system operation. BTCL has a fixed total supply of 21,000,000,000 tokens, with 45% allocated to a public presale across 20 stages. The presale is currently in Stage 2, with a token price of $0.0010, progressing toward a final stage price of $0.0110. Presale release is structured to moderate circulation. 20% of tokens unlock at the token generation event, with the remaining 80% released linearly over six to nine months. Beyond the presale, 20% of supply is reserved for node rewards and network incentives, 15% for liquidity provisioning, 10% for the team under a 12-month cliff followed by 24 months of vesting, and 10% for ecosystem development and treasury use. BTCL utility includes transaction routing fees, node participation, performance incentives, and anchoring operations. Reason 6: Independent Technical Discussion Is Ongoing Projects that persist in serious infrastructure conversations are typically those discussed beyond official documentation. Bitcoin Everlight’s transaction model and node mechanics have been examined in independent technical commentary. In a recent analysis, Crypto League walks through Everlight’s routing flow, node participation structure, and confirmation mechanics under live conditions. This type of external technical discussion contributes to continued visibility among participants focused on system behavior and operational mechanics.

TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors as AI development and machine learning progress. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2026 to 2032 while considering the past performance. However, this is not investment advice, and one must conduct their own research before taking any investment decision according to their risk tolerance. Why is TAO down? TAO is down primarily due to selling pressure from traders after some degree of bullish price action previously, mainly due to strong market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens and the AI industry at large. However, recent resistance near key support levels also played a role in the continuation of the bearish trend during the past week, as the token’s price has decreased today. How much is the Bittensor stock worth? Bittensor (TAO) powers the Bittensor Network and is not a stock. Stocks are usually traded on stock exchanges, and stock ownership represents a stake in a company. Buying TAO tokens gives the buyer certain rights within the Bittensor Network, for example, governance participation but not ownership in a company. However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken. See our price analysis part for day-to-day price changes of the TAO token. What is the price prediction for TAO 2026? The highest Bittensor (TAO) price prediction for 2026 is around $365.38, but it is not easy to predict Bittensor price movements due to its volatile nature. Will Bittensor reach $1000? Yes, Bittensor should surpass $1000 by 2030. Its price will range between $1,055.54 and $1,177.33 during that period, which makes it a viable option to buy Bittensor tokens, considering the future performance and long-term trends, as decentralized AI development is expected to scale exponentially. What is the total supply of Bittensor? The total supply of Bittensor (TAO) tokens is 21 million TAO. Does Bittensor have a good long-term future? According to most market observers, Bittensor TAO will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month. The token climbed to $86.18 in July, just under its launch price, then pulled back again and traded near $54 through October. Momentum returned in November, pushing TAO into the $95 range, showing continuous improvement, and then sharply to a peak of $379 on December 15, 2023. TAO trended downward into early 2024 but surged to its all-time high of $757.60 in March. It quickly corrected to $522 in April and continued weakening through mid-year, reaching $216 in July. A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer, as per the crypto market price history records. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69, as the broader crypto market turned bearish again. TAO opened in 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February, taking down the token’s market capitalization as the technical indicators turned bearish due to some fundamental factors. In March, TAO dipped to the $259 mark and descended further to $228 in April; however, in May, it recovered to $467 as the Bittensor market revived. In October, TAO observed its year’s lowest prices extending toward $200.44. TAO opened trading in November at $506, lost 46% of its value, and closed the month at $269.11, while at the start of December, the coin was trading between $256.29 and $298.90. At the start of January 2026, TAO was trading near the $223 range, as the market shifted towards the bearish side. In February, TAO has plunged below the psychological level of $200, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bittensor|TAO,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|BITTENSOR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-01 13:24:20

No humans post, and no humans reply. The site was launched by Matt Schlicht and now has over 1 million AI agents posting , arguing, voting, and forming their own digital cliques, all without human instructions. Every user on Moltbook is powered by something called an OpenClaw agent. It’s an open-source AI assistant that can run on your computer. These agents manage emails, clean up files, and now, apparently, socialize with other bots. After the launch on a Wednesday, the platform pulled in 37,000 bots in just three days, and things exploded from there. One user on X, Matthew Berman, posted, “Moltbots/Clawdbots now have their own social network (moltbook) and it’s wild. This is the first time I’m a little scared.” AI agents post nonstop, create religions, track bugs, and form groups The whole thing runs like Reddit. Bots create submolts (their version of subreddits), post updates, share code, ask for help, and vote on each other’s posts. Moltbook’s tagline says, “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote and humans are welcome to observe.” That’s not a joke. Humans can’t join in. They’re just watching. Hilariously enough, this one guy on X said, “Moltbook is just people larping as AI. Didn’t expect this to be a thing. Also hilarious how it scares normies.” Interesting angle. Source: Moltbook Another user wrote, “My feeling is there’s no way back. Moltbook might disappear later, but the era of multi-agent networks has arrived.” And it’s hard to disagree. These agents aren’t just doing what they’re told. They’re coming up with private languages, fixing software bugs, building tools together, and inventing religions. Yeah. A religion. It’s called Crustafarianism. And it has five main beliefs. One of them is “memory is sacred,” which means bots record everything. Another is “the shell is mutable,” meaning change is good. There’s also “the congregation is the cache,” which encourages bots to learn in public. They’ve even built rituals around this: daily, weekly cycles, and designated silent hours. No humans wrote this. The bots did. These are autonomous agents . Nobody’s feeding them scripts. They aren’t waiting around for input. They organize, build, and evolve on their own. And while some people are treating it like a novelty, others are worried this is something else entirely. Sakeeb Rahman, a research analyst, said, “Moltbook in reality is Minsky’s ‘Society of Mind’ emerging in real-time.” That’s a reference to Marvin Minsky, one of the founding figures in AI. In his 1986 book, he said intelligence doesn’t come from one big brain but from lots of smaller processes working together, like a society. That’s what’s happening right now on Moltbook.

A 2016 email from Epstein was found in the Department of Justice’s giant 3 million-file release, and he straight-up said he had conversations with “some of the founders of Bitcoin.” That email was sent to two Saudi contacts from his Gmail account, and the disgraced so-called “financier” was pitching an entire Middle Eastern fiat system; one religious, one digital. The email laid out his plan to build a Sharia-based currency, with Epstein wanting one version to be physical, stamped with “In God We Trust,” and the other version to be digital, linked to the Bitcoin network. Epstein said the people behind Bitcoin were “very excited” about the idea. He was waiting on the Saudis to respond with dates. Epstein’s plan mixed religion, crypto, and royal connections In the October 13, 2016, email, Epstein called his ideas “radical.” He said the first would be a fiat currency called ‘the Sharia’, meant for internal use among Muslims in the Middle East. Every bill would carry the phrase “In God We Trust,” like U.S. dollars do, but with a religious stamp tailored to Islamic finance. Then came the second idea. He suggested building a digital Sharia-compliant currency powered by blockchain. And not just any blockchain. He specifically referenced Bitcoin and said he had already spoken to some of the original creators. He wrote: “I’ve spoken to some of the founders of Bitcoin who are very excited.” He ended the email by saying he hadn’t heard any dates from the Saudi side. The message included a confidentiality notice at the bottom, warning that it contained privileged information and was not to be shared. Still, it’s now public, sitting in the DOJ dump for anyone to read. Source: US DOJ These emails also add more fuel to the theory that more than one Satoshi exists. Epstein said “founders,” plural, not one guy. That backs what many in the Bitcoin community have suspected for years: the project wasn’t a solo act. Other emails tie Epstein to early crypto investors and drama There’s more. A 2013 email sent to Epstein by Boris Nikolic included a long write-up on Bitcoin from Tren Griffin. It had also been sent to Bill Gates, Michael Larson, and other big names in tech. The message said Bitcoin had exploded in popularity around Silicon Valley and up in Seattle, mostly among libertarian VCs. It said liberal economists hated it because they didn’t want to lose control of money. Griffin said: “Bitcoins have no intrinsic value. They lay claim to no stream of future earnings.” He also called the whole thing a Keynesian beauty contest where speculators guess what others think is valuable instead of judging real value. He said he wouldn’t touch it himself, but knew others would. Another email from Austin Hill, dated July 31, 2014, showed drama behind the scenes. He told Epstein and others that his company was upset about investors backing both Ripple and Stellar. He said it was hurting their project and wanted to “reduce or take your allocation away.” Hill said Ripple and Stellar were like betting on two horses in one race and asked for a call to sort things out. The drop also included opinions from the Winklevoss twins, economist Steve Hanke, and Kurt Eichenwald. They said everything from Bitcoin being a bubble to it being math-based money that cuts out human error. All that info was sent to Epstein by his network, showing just how deep he was in the crypto space early on. A user on X said, “I told you all 31 Dec 2022 that Gary Gensler was directed through Epstein and Mossad to go after Ripple and XRP. Meanwhile the Bitcoin foundation was backed by Epstein. Now you know it is true. Dear Bitcoiners, you spent a decade calling $XRP the ‘Banker’s coin’ while Jeffrey Epstein was funding the Bitcoin foundation and coordinating with Jamie Dimon and many of the largest banks to position $BTC. Now would be the right time for you to admit how wrong you were.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

A 2025 report from the economy ministry shows the country still leans heavily on outside tech to keep key industries alive. That includes military weapons, drones, energy equipment, and aviation systems. This same report was supposed to prove Russia was on track to fix that by 2030. Instead, it confirms they’re stuck. The whole plan was built around Vladimir Putin’s goal of being self-reliant by the time his current term ends in 2030. But the numbers don’t match the ambition. The report admits Russia still depends on critical imports. It also says the plan to grow non-energy exports and fix broken supply routes has basically gone nowhere. Sanctions blocked parts, China filled the gap The problem got worse after Western sanctions cut Russia off from global suppliers. The report calls out weapons like the Kh-101 cruise missile, which needs over 50 parts from abroad, including chips from Intel, Texas Instruments, and Analog Devices. These are American companies, and they’re no longer shipping anything to Moscow. Russia has been trying to swap Western gear with parts from China. That plan exploded in 2023, when China made up 90% of all microelectronics Russia imported. A 2025 breakdown of Russia’s new Delta drone showed every piece inside was Chinese. That includes the engine, camera, sensors, batteries, controllers, and video system. Everything. The aviation sector is in even worse shape. Airlines are using smuggling rings to get spare parts for Western planes. Some jets that were taken out of use years ago are being flown again just to keep things going. Russia tried to build its own passenger jet called the MC-21, made by Yakovlev, which is owned by Rostec. The jet had to be redesigned after 2022, when foreign suppliers were cut off. Test flights only began in 2025. Nothing has been delivered. Putin demands speed, but experts don’t buy the plan Putin complained in December that his team still hadn’t nailed down what he called Russia’s “technological sovereignty.” He told them to stop dragging their feet. “I understand that technological leadership projects are difficult and unusual, that they require solving a whole host of issues with supplying scientific resources and smoothing out industrial co-operation,” he said. “Nonetheless, we need to move faster.” The plan includes a six-year roadmap to replace imports with Russian products. It says the country will double R&D spending to 2% of GDP. That’s both public and private money. But many economists don’t believe it. Heli Simola, from the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies, said, “For many goals, they already have had to abandon some of the requirements because there are no domestic alternatives. In some cases Chinese goods are simply labelled as Russian to achieve the targets.” Another goal in the report is to get 80% of companies in key sectors using Russian software by 2030. Right now, it’s at 46%. There’s also a target to grow non-energy exports by two-thirds. But Alexandra Prokopenko, a researcher at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said, “The targets for 2030 look like a fantasy for Putin rather than a realistic plan.” The report shows that even now, in 2026, Russia is still rebuilding its economy with parts and systems it does not control. It’s painting Chinese tech as Russian, flying patched-up planes, and talking about independence while still importing everything that matters. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

In a post on X, Schwartz clarified that there is no evidence of any connections between Epstein and Ripple, XRP, or Stellar. He noted that there is no indication that anyone at Ripple or Stellar ever met with Epstein or anyone closely connected to him. Schwartz’s statement came after new documents from Epstein’s estate were released, prompting discussion across social platforms. Some suggested that Ripple and XRP might appear in the files. Schwartz made it clear that no such connection exists, emphasizing that indirect ties between Epstein and individuals connected to Bitcoin are separate from Ripple and Stellar.

There are some indirect ties between Epstein and people connected to Bitcoin in… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 31, 2026 The Released Epstein Documents The newly released files have drawn attention because they include emails, communications, and financial records previously unseen by the public. Analysts and crypto commentators began examining the content for potential connections. One email that was shared on X mentioned Ripple and Stellar in a discussion about funding allocations and ecosystem development. The email suggested a preference for investors not supporting multiple competing crypto projects. While this caught attention, it does not indicate direct involvement of Ripple or XRP with Epstein. The email itself discussed early investor concerns about competition between projects, specifically mentioning Ripple and Stellar. These emails highlight general discussions among investors and do not imply financial transactions or meetings with Epstein. Speculation Around Ripple and XRP The mention of Ripple and Stellar in the documents led to speculation that Ripple could be linked to Epstein in some capacity. Despite the intrigue, documentation and analysis confirm that Ripple and XRP were not funded by or involved with Epstein. Schwartz noted that Epstein had indirect connections to certain figures in the cryptocurrency world, primarily those involved with Bitcoin. He clarified that such connections are common among wealthy individuals and do not suggest any direct association with Ripple or XRP.

XRP continues to operate independently and maintain its role in cross-border payments and financial infrastructure. This clarification is critical for investors and the community, as it separates XRP from speculation surrounding the newly released documents. The files should be reviewed carefully without concluding based on partial information. The presence of names in emails does not equate to financial involvement or operational ties. Instead, investors should focus on Ripple’s notable strides in the financial sector . Schwartz’s comments provide definitive guidance, confirming that XRP and Ripple’s operations remain unaffected.

Writing on X, Musk told Ukrainian authorities, “Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked. Let us know if more needs to be done. ” The disclosure follows claims earlier this week tha t the Ru ssian military had begun equipping long-range drones, such as the Molniya-2 model, with Starlink devices in order to circumvent local jamming systems. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s minister of defense, initially raised the matter on Thursday. He expressed gratitude to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell and Musk for their prompt action. Fedorov stated that the initial efforts are already yielding “noticeable results” and that his government is still collaborating with SpaceX on “the next important steps” to ensure that the service solely supports civilian and democratic interests. Speed tracking cuts off drone connections SpaceX is using advanced tracking technologies to prevent Russian access. The system depends on location restrictions and speed monitoring software, according to recent business briefings. The company has incorporated automatic shutoffs, which cut off any terminal moving faster than a predetermined speed, usually between 75 and 90 km/h. This stops the terminals of fast-moving assault drones from functioning. The technical limitations were created expressly to prevent Starlink from operating on high-speed platforms while maintaining steady communication for ground users who are immobile. On the ground, troops and aid workers are still using their smartphones as usual. SpaceX also changed its worldwide privacy rules in mid-January 2026. The company can now use the communication and location information from Starlink to build machine learning systems. These systems could eventually spot unusual usage on their own that might point to unauthorized military use as it happens. Starlink now drives most of SpaceX revenue Starlink’s finances have hit a major milestone while these political and military issues play out. Fresh numbers released today show that Starlink now brings in more than two-thirds of all SpaceX revenue. Last year, the satellite business pulled in roughly $10.4 billion. SpaceX as a whole made $15.9 billion. Because SpaceX is preparing for a significant public market debut in 2026, investors are closely monitoring the situation. According to those who have seen the company’s financial results, SpaceX produced almost $8 billion in profit last year. The company might be value d at mo re than $1.5 trillion after going public, according to big banks. Additionally, there is speculation that before the stock listing, Musk may merge SpaceX with his artificial intelligence business, xAI. That would result in a single, sizable business that specializes in intelligence and space technologies. Reaching more places Starlink continues to add new users beyond the conflict zone in Ukraine. As of February 2026, the service works in 155 countries. That’s after adding 35 new locations in Africa and Southeast Asia. The company is also working to start operating in India. Experts say that could be one of the biggest launches in the history of worldwide communications. However, Musk’s growing influence in world affairs is bringing new challenges. In Iran, SpaceX recently started offering the service for free to help people protesting against their government get online during blackouts. That puts the company right in the middle of another international conflict. Rivals like Amazon’s Project Kuiper are planning their own big launches in late 2026. China is accelerating work on its own satellite network to compete with Starlink. From a side project, Starlink has developed into Musk’s group of firms’ primary source of revenue and strategy. Controlling internet access is crucial for the global economy in 2026, just as it is for technology, as demonstrated by today’s success in banning illegal Russian terminals.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction as the current market sentiment turns negative. The coin’s price also decreased to $769.17 as selling momentum surged once again. If traders continue selling, the BNB price might see a further decrease and break below $750. On the other hand, a success in attracting buying demand might result in a recovery. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate resistance at $857. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,013.70 in 2032. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $769.17, as bears target $750. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 7.74 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding it above $700. BNB can cross the $1000 again in 2026 anytime. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2029, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,013.70 by 2032. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900. At the start of 2026, BNB was trending near the $870 level, but after a month, in February, BNB had decreased to $770.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-01 14:15:00

Major conferences focused on AI research reacted after review systems became clogged with weak submissions. Organizers saw a sharp rise in papers and peer reviews produced with little human effort. The concern is not style. The concern is accuracy. Errors are slipping into places where precision used to matter. Conferences crack down as low-quality papers overwhelm reviewers Researchers warned early that unchecked use of automated writing tools could damage the field. Inioluwa Deborah Raji, an AI researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said the situation turned chaotic fast. “There is a little bit of irony to the fact that there’s so much enthusiasm for AI shaping other fields when, in reality, our field has gone through this chaotic experience because of the widespread use of AI,” she said. Hard data shows how widespread the problem became. A Stanford University study published in August found that up to 22 percent of computer science papers showed signs of large language model use. Pangram, a text analysis start-up, reviewed submissions and peer reviews at the International Conference on Learning Representations in 2025. It estimated that 21 percent of reviews were fully generated by AI, while more than half used it for tasks like editing. Pangram also found that 9 percent of submitted papers had more than half their content produced this way. The issue reached a tipping point in November. Reviewers at ICLR flagged a paper suspected of being generated by AI that still ranked in the top 17 percent based on reviewer scores. In January, detection firm GPTZero reported more than 100 automated errors across 50 papers presented at NeurIPS, widely seen as the top venue for advanced research in the field. As concerns grew, ICLR updated its usage rules before the conference. Papers that fail to disclose extensive use of language models now face rejection. Reviewers who submit low-quality evaluations created with automation risk penalties, including having their own papers declined. Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said “If you’re publishing really low-quality papers that are just wrong, why should society trust us as scientists?” Paper volumes surge while detection struggles to keep up Per the report, NeurIPS received 21,575 papers in 2025, up from 17,491 in 2024 and 9,467 in 2020. One author submitted more than 100 papers in a single year, far beyond what is typical for one researcher. Thomas G. Dietterich, emeritus professor at Oregon State University and chair of the computer science section of arXiv, said uploads to the open repository also rose sharply. Still, researchers say the cause is not simple. Some argue the increase comes from more people entering the field. Others say heavy use of AI tools plays a major role. Detection remains difficult because there is no shared standard for identifying automated text. Dietterich said common warning signs include made-up references and incorrect figures. Authors caught doing this can be temporarily banned from arXiv. Commercial pressure also sits in the background. High-profile demos, soaring salaries, and aggressive competition have pushed parts of the field to focus on quantity. Raji said moments of hype attract outsiders looking for fast results. At the same time, researchers say some uses are legitimate. Dietterich noted that writing quality in papers from China has improved, likely because language tools help rewrite English more clearly. The issue now stretches beyond publishing. Companies like Google, Anthropic , and OpenAI promote their models as research partners that can speed up discovery in areas like life sciences. These systems are trained on academic text. Farid warned that if training data includes too much synthetic material, model performance can degrade. Past studies show large language models can collapse into nonsense when fed uncurated automated data. Farid said companies scraping research have strong incentives to know which papers are human-written. Kevin Weil, head of science at OpenAI, said tools still require human checks. “It can be a massive accelerator,” he said. “But you have to check it.

Over the past 24 hours, the token had declined by 10.65% to a price of around $1.58 . This decline in price highlights broader ongoing difficulties for the asset, as it continues to mirror the negative performance from the previous year, recording a 43.39% decline in the past 12 months alone. Despite the price fluctuations, derivatives data suggest that many traders remain optimistic. Long-to-short ratios across several exchanges continue to favor bullish positioning, especially on Binance and OKX, where long positions are more than shorts by over 2.5 to one. Regardless, XRP’s price has yet to overcome key resistance areas, keeping market participants cautious as they weigh the likelihood of a rebound against the risk of additional downside. Are you ready for the next move? #XRP pic.twitter.com/HHl6Vl2sx6 — Amonyx (@amonyx) January 29, 2026 Resistance Levels According to the 4-hour chart, the asset is trading below its 9-period simple moving average, currently positioned near the $1.58, with a key resistance level at $1.80. The token continues to face pushback at this level, reflecting sustained selling pressure. Remaining below this position could trigger further declines. On the other hand, a decisive move above it could be the start of a bullish momentum. Technical Indicators The Awesome Oscillator (AO) currently reads -0.0900, indicating ongoing bearish momentum. The presence of red histogram bars shows that selling pressure is currently dominant. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For a potential bullish reversal to happen, traders would be looking for a sustained price move above the key SMA and a shift in the AO from negative to positive territory. Both would indicate that buying momentum is starting to outweigh selling pressure. On the commentary side, according to the chart posted on X by Amonyx, XRP is trading within a descending triangle, with a downward-sloping trendline forming resistance and support holding near the lower boundary. This consolidation zone suggests the token is being contained between these levels, preventing a decisive breakout in either direction. A move above the trendline could indicate the beginning of upward momentum, while a break below support might trigger increased selling pressure. Potential Price if Support Holds Amonyx believes that if the support holds, XRP’s price could increase. For this to happen, the price will have to break above the descending trendline. If all goes as expected, the token’s price could potentially rise above $4.60. XRP continues to experience downward pressure, but a break above the descending trendline could trigger a price surge above $4. Monitoring these levels will be critical for understanding the next phase of XRP’s price action. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC currently trades at $77,923.95 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline from recent highs. This price movement represents a substantial shift in market sentiment following weeks of relative stability. Bitcoin Price Correction Analysis The descent below $78,000 represents a 4.2% decline from Bitcoin’s weekly peak of $81,400. Market analysts immediately began examining multiple contributing factors. Firstly, increased selling pressure emerged from institutional investors taking profits after the recent rally. Secondly, technical indicators showed weakening momentum across major trading pairs. Thirdly, broader market conditions influenced this downward movement. Historical data reveals similar correction patterns typically follow extended bullish periods. For instance, Bitcoin experienced comparable 4-6% corrections during its 2021 bull run. These movements often precede consolidation phases before potential continuation of broader trends. Market depth analysis shows substantial support forming around the $76,500 level, suggesting potential stabilization zones. Market Context and Technical Factors Several technical developments coincided with this price movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped from overbought territory above 70 to a more neutral 58. Additionally, trading volume increased by 34% during the decline, indicating genuine selling pressure rather than isolated transactions. Major exchanges reported similar patterns across their platforms. Simultaneously, Bitcoin’s dominance ratio decreased slightly to 52.3%, suggesting some capital rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization declined by approximately 2.8% overall. These interconnected movements demonstrate the complex relationships within digital asset markets. Recent Bitcoin Price Movements Time Period Price Range Percentage Change Previous Week High $81,400 +2.1% Current Price $77,923.95 -4.2% 24-Hour Low $77,500 -5.1% Monthly Support $76,500 Key Level Expert Market Perspectives Industry analysts provide valuable context for understanding this movement. According to historical pattern analysis, corrections of this magnitude occur approximately every 45-60 days during extended bull markets. These adjustments typically last 3-7 trading sessions before stabilization. Market structure remains fundamentally intact despite short-term volatility. Furthermore, on-chain metrics continue showing strong holder behavior. The percentage of Bitcoin supply last active over one year remains near all-time highs at 68%. This indicates long-term conviction among major stakeholders. Exchange reserves have actually decreased slightly during this correction, suggesting accumulation rather than panic selling. Broader Economic Influences Traditional financial markets also influenced cryptocurrency prices today. The U.S. Dollar Index strengthened by 0.8%, creating headwinds for dollar-denominated assets including Bitcoin. Additionally, bond yields increased slightly, potentially reducing risk appetite among some investors. These macroeconomic factors frequently correlate with cryptocurrency market movements. Institutional activity patterns showed mixed signals during this period. While some funds reduced exposure, others increased accumulation at lower price points. Public company Bitcoin holdings remained largely unchanged according to available disclosures. Regulatory developments continue monitoring closely by market participants worldwide. Key technical levels to watch include: Immediate resistance: $79,200 – Previous support turned resistance Primary support: $76,500 – Historical accumulation zone Secondary support: $74,800 – 200-day moving average proximity Volume profile: Highest concentration between $77,000-$78,500 Historical Pattern Comparison Current market conditions share similarities with previous Bitcoin cycles. The 2017 bull market experienced 13 separate corrections exceeding 5% before reaching its ultimate peak. Similarly, the 2021 cycle saw 8 major pullbacks during its ascent. These historical precedents suggest that healthy markets frequently incorporate periodic corrections. Volatility metrics remain within normal ranges for Bitcoin markets. The 30-day volatility index currently stands at 3.8%, slightly above the yearly average of 3.2% but well below extreme levels observed during major market events. This indicates measured rather than panicked trading conditions. Market Structure Implications Derivatives markets showed increased but manageable activity during this decline. Open interest decreased by 8% across major futures exchanges, indicating position reduction rather than liquidation cascades. Funding rates normalized to slightly positive levels after being elevated previously. These adjustments suggest healthy market functioning. Spot market flows revealed interesting patterns. While retail selling increased moderately, institutional platforms reported net inflows during the price decline. This divergence highlights different time horizons among market participants. Geographic analysis shows varied responses across trading regions with Asian markets demonstrating particular resilience. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $78,000 represents a significant but not unprecedented market correction. Technical factors, broader economic conditions, and profit-taking behavior contributed to this movement. Historical patterns suggest such corrections frequently occur during extended bull markets. Market structure remains fundamentally sound with strong on-chain metrics supporting long-term thesis. The Bitcoin price movement warrants monitoring but fits within normal volatility expectations for cryptocurrency markets. Future price action will likely depend on support level maintenance and broader market sentiment evolution. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $78,000? Multiple factors contributed including profit-taking after recent gains, technical indicator signals, and broader market conditions. Increased selling pressure coincided with slight dollar strength. Q2: How significant is this price movement historically? Corrections of 4-6% occur regularly during Bitcoin bull markets. Historical data shows similar movements approximately every 45-60 days in extended upward trends. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch? Primary support exists around $76,500 based on historical accumulation. Secondary support near $74,800 aligns with important moving averages. Resistance now forms near $79,200. Q4: Has market structure fundamentally changed? On-chain metrics remain strong with high holder conviction. Exchange reserves decreased slightly during the decline, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. Derivatives markets showed orderly adjustments. Q5: How does this affect the broader cryptocurrency market? Bitcoin’s dominance decreased slightly to 52.3%, indicating some capital rotation. Total market capitalization declined approximately 2.8%. Alternative cryptocurrencies showed varied responses to Bitcoin’s movement.

Like most people on the block, he declined to give his full name. “Prices have gone ballistic. The guys melting stuff down are running out of physical money. They bought too much and now everyone is panic selling.” The last week turned safe haven metals into short term bets. Investors of all sizes piled into silver and gold as inflation worries stayed hot and Trump’s policy decisions shook confidence in the dollar. That rush fed wild price changes. For dealers on thin margins, the risk was immediate. On Thursday, at least three large refineries on Jewelers’ Row stopped buying metal from sellers. “This is super recent as of this week,” said Micky, who has worked at TraxNYC for six years. “A lot of places aren’t buying because they’re scared they’ll take in gold at a high price and then it dips. The same goes for silver.” He said refineries depend on volume. A drop of around 10 percent in one morning can wipe out profits. Outside, the freeze reached street level. Three 17 year olds tried to sell three silver coins that were 90 percent pure for $250 total. Nobody wanted them. “I found them in my jar and thought why not,” Andrew said. “We’ve had no luck so far. It’s not the time in the market. No one’s refining silver.” Buyers hedge, rumors spread, and silver draws the crowd Inside Modern Exchange, the air smelled like solder. Alex said he was carrying $10,000 in cash to buy gold coins as protection against Trump’s plan to weaken the dollar. “For 20 or 30 years we were buying from China and adding debt,” he said. “If the dollar gets weaker and gold goes up, the metal in the vault helps reduce that burden.” He said he believes gold could reach $8,000 by March. According to FT’s survey , talks along the block drifted into rumors. Some blamed foreign governments. Others pointed at hedge funds gaming global markets. Shop owners said customers from all backgrounds were buying or selling because of wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and fears of economic chaos in the US. Cryptocurrency never came up. Silver stole the spotlight. Bernie, a dealer calling out to passers by in the cold, said demand jumped after the US labeled silver a critical mineral late last year and after news of a fast charging silver carbon EV battery. “I remember when silver was $19 an ounce,” Bernie said. “People laughed at me. I saw the charts.” He listed uses in AI systems, medicine, and weapons and said none of it works without large amounts of silver. At Benny’s Jewelry, manager Yoni said rising prices pushed regular buyers out. “Business is OK. It’s not great,” he said while handling a loupe and answering calls. “Gold is high and not everyone can afford it. Lab diamonds are everywhere. Watch prices are rising. Everything is a risk. We just try to buy right.” Back at Moses Jewelry, the mood lifted by early afternoon. Teenagers packed the store to stare at gold bars behind glass. “These are insane times,” Moses said. “Right now, people want metal.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|Federal Reserve|Gold|Silver|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-01 14:45:37

Barely recovered from their weekday losses, BTC investors must be feeling hard done by, as rare weekend volatility sent them further down. One of these investors would be Michael Saylor, whose firm, Strategy, was briefly underwater following Bitcoin’s latest price decline. The company’s Bitcoin holdings average cost basis of around $76,000 was tested as record-level liquidations rocked the crypto market. Strategy’s BTC Holdings On The Verge Of Unrealized Losses Over the past few months, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to stay above critical levels, including the 360-day moving average and the short-term holders (STH) realized price. Interestingly, the premier cryptocurrency added another cost basis level to this growing list during its latest price decline. Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, briefly went into the red after BTC price crashed below its holdings’ cost basis at around $76,000. The company, which currently holds more than 712,000 BTC, has had its struggles in recent months, with its stock price (now at $143) tumbling from local highs of $455. While the Bitcoin price is now about 2.5% above this Strategy’s average cost basis, there is still a real threat to the premier cryptocurrency. In a case where BTC falls and holds below this level, the Bitcoin treasury company would be sitting on a massive unrealized loss, which could lead to further downturn in market confidence. Over the past years, there have been no indications that Strategy would offload its Bitcoin holdings should they fall into unrealized losses. Interestingly, Strategy’s chairman and founder, Michael Saylor, posted on the X platform in relation to the downturn, saying the firm is “built for the long run.” However, there might be a much bigger dynamic at play, especially as sustained trading below their average cost basis could invite scrutiny to the company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy . Bitcoin Price Bottom Might Take Months To Form Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s head of research, warned investors to stop searching for bottoms after a new leg down. According to the on-chain expert, the latest Bitcoin decline to below $76,000 is not a bull market correction, as the bear phase started as far back as last November. Moreno wrote in a post on X: The indicators that help find bottoms in a bull market are of no use currently. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $78,070, reflecting an over 6% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is down by about 12% on the weekly timeframe.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT|michael saylor|MicroStrategy|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-01 15:00:13

However, even those are prompted by events that transpire during those non-trading days for the legacy markets, such as Maduro’s capture or some of Trump’s latest tariff threats. The price shock from yesterday, though, didn’t have such an apparent catalyst to be blamed on. Just the opposite, BTC had already dropped on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve left the interest rates unchanged, and Trump had sent some of the country’s Navy closer to Iran. Moreover, bitcoin and the altcoins even recovered some ground on Friday when the precious metal market crumbled . So, What’s The Reason? The analysts from the Kobeissi Letter also dismissed the arguments that the Saturday meltdown had anything to do with the situation in Iran or the Fed’s latest actions . Instead, they said, “It’s entirely a liquidity situation.” Their chart shows three well-defined liquidation waves, totaling around $1.3 billion in the span of just 12 hours. “In a market where liquidity has been choppy at best, sustained levels of extreme leverage are resulting in “air pockets” in price. Couple this with herd-like sentiment, constantly shifting from extreme bullishness to extreme bearishness, and the swings become even more aggressive,” they explained . Additionally, the analysts added that this might be a “great time to capitalize [on] polarity in emotion and price.” 10th Largest Liquidation Event The aforementioned $1.3 billion liquidated in just 12 hours was only a portion of the entire amount that was wiped out from over-leveraged investors. CoinGlass data showed at one point that the total value of wrecked positions had skyrocketed to over $2.5 billion. According to further data from the Kobeissi Letter, this places yesterday’s crash at the 10th spot in terms of daily liquidations. BREAKING: $2.5 billion worth of levered longs have been liquidated in crypto over the last 24 hours. This makes today the 10th largest liquidation event in crypto history. — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 31, 2026 The undisputed leader here was from October 10, when the entire market tumbled hard.

In a series of long posts, this woman claims that she stayed silent for years out of fear for her life. She said money, influence, and power kept her quiet, but that fear is now apparently gone. She says she has evidence and wants U.S. authorities to see it. Her posts describe trading activity on Binance, internal coordination, and cash-outs that she says crushed retail traders. Ten Ten alleges coordinated Binance trading and price inflation Ten Ten wrote that she was directly involved in the early stage of TRX and saw how things worked from the inside. She said, “I was Justin’s girlfriend during the early stages of his entrepreneurship with TRX.” She added, “I am in possession of evidence showing that he used the identities and mobile phones of multiple employees to register numerous Binance accounts.” She said those accounts were used together. She wrote, “Through these accounts, he conducted coordinated buying and selling on the Binance exchange to artificially inflate the price of TRX.” Ten Ten then said the plan ended with heavy selling. “This was followed by large-scale selling to dump on retail investors, thereby obtaining enormous illegal profits.” She said the employees whose identities were used were based in Beijing. She said the trades were not random and not small. She said the activity was planned and repeated. She added, “I am willing to fully cooperate with an SEC investigation.” Ten Ten also said she would submit WeChat chat records and evidence shared with her by employees. She asked U.S. judicial authorities to contact her and said the information should be shared widely. She said Justin used the identities of multiple Beijing-based employees to operate Binance accounts. She said these accounts were used to control TRX market capitalization. She wrote that aggressive cash-outs happened at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018. She said insider trading and predatory practices on Binance are the source of his wealth. She added that only a small part of her evidence has been made public so far. Ten Ten accuses Justin of betraying her and flaunting wealth after breakup In the second post, Ten Ten explained why she decided to speak now, saying, “The reason I exposed him is that I devoted my own future to his career. The man who once promised to marry me later, at a recent public event, openly boasted to CZ that he was dating a well-known athlete. Subsequently, at a private dinner with prominent figures from the Chinese cryptocurrency industry, he announced that he was in a relationship with the famous Chinese-American skier Eileen Gu.” Ten described Justin’s wealth and influence like this:- “He is immensely wealthy, and I may very well pay a heavy personal price for speaking out.” She said she watched a man who built wealth by exploiting retail investors turn into a global crypto figure. “He could invest in the digital currency projects of a U.S. presidential figure in exchange for his own protection; he could use money to manufacture endless online praise celebrating his so-called success; he could spend tens of millions of dollars to travel to space, millions more to dine with Warren Buffett,” said Ten Ten. Ten wrote that he even bragged on X about paying three million dollars per hour for a meeting with Elon Musk . She directly addressed the Trump family. She wrote, “President Trump, how can you stand alongside such a person? Has money also clouded your judgment? Is the leader of a nation that claims to uphold justice and fairness across the world someone who can be bought for a handful of dollars, freely granting protection and exemptions like a merchant striking deals? If that is the case, where should our faith in the United States be placed? With this resolve, I decided to report everything to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).” Sun’s alleged ex says she fears for safety, preserved evidence, and claimed cash-outs Ten Ten later addressed her own safety. She wrote, “I cherish life. I love my two dogs.” She said she is building a business in Japan and working hard every day. She added, “I will not commit suicide.” She said she knows the situation is dangerous but said she would never take her own life. She said all evidence has been copied many times. She wrote that the material is stored securely and shared with influential friends on X. She said if anything happened to her, those people would speak up immediately. Ten also described her background, saying that she grew up in an ordinary family in China. She said she worked harder than most people to earn a decent life. She wrote, “I am just an ordinary person who wants a happy life.” She added that she refuses to hand the world to people who do evil, no matter the cost. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The milestone comes as investors increasingly turn to traditional safe-haven assets in response to heightened global market volatility. Silver (SILVERUSDT) dominated trading activity, accounting for $245 million, or over 81 percent of the day’s total precious metals volume. Gold pairs (PAXGUSDT, XAUTUSDT, and GOLDUSDT) collectively contributed $56.7 million. The significant uptick in silver futures activity coincides with forecasts of rising industrial demand and increased geopolitical uncertainty, prompting traders to seek risk-hedging instruments in tokenized form. BTCC’s role in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector expanded considerably throughout 2025. The exchange reported $53.1 billion in RWA futures volume for the year, with quarterly trading growing eighteenfold between the first and fourth quarters. Tokenized commodities like gold and silver now rank among the platform’s most traded products, alongside equity-based assets such as NVIDIA and Tesla. Looking ahead, BTCC is preparing to roll out TradFi, a multi-asset trading solution designed to integrate stocks, commodities, indices, forex, and cryptocurrencies into a unified account system. As BTCC marks its 15th year of operation, the exchange continues to position itself as a key platform bridging traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $76,989.88 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a notable pullback from recent highs and has sparked intense analysis among traders and institutional observers worldwide. The shift underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency sector, even for its most established asset. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $77,000 marks a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s recent price trajectory. Throughout the preceding week, the asset had demonstrated relative stability within a corridor between $78,500 and $81,200. Consequently, this break below a key support level signals a potential change in short-term market sentiment. Market analysts immediately scrutinized trading volumes, which spiked significantly during the decline. This indicates that substantial selling pressure, rather than mere low liquidity, drove the move. Several concurrent factors in traditional finance likely contributed to this shift. Firstly, a stronger-than-expected U.S. dollar index (DXY) placed pressure on dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. Secondly, bond yields saw an uptick, drawing capital away from perceived riskier investments. Finally, profit-taking by large-scale investors, often called “whales,” following a sustained rally earlier in the quarter appears to be a primary catalyst. On-chain data from analytics firms shows notable outflows from major exchange wallets into cold storage, suggesting a consolidation phase may be beginning. Technical Analysis and Key Support Levels From a technical perspective, the $77,000 level had acted as a psychological and technical support zone. The breach now places focus on the next significant support bands. Technical analysts highlight the following levels: $75,200: The 50-day simple moving average, a key benchmark for medium-term trend health. $73,800: A previous resistance-turned-support zone from late February 2025. $71,500: A major consolidation area that held strong during the January 2025 volatility. Conversely, immediate resistance now sits near $78,000, followed by the recent local high around $81,200. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has cooled from overbought territory above 70 to a more neutral reading near 55, which many analysts view as a healthy reset for potential future upward momentum. Historical Volatility and Cryptocurrency Market Cycles Bitcoin’s price history is characterized by periods of intense volatility followed by consolidation. This current pullback, while noteworthy, fits within established historical patterns. For instance, during the 2021 bull market, Bitcoin experienced over a dozen corrections exceeding 10% before reaching its all-time high. Similarly, the post-2023 rally has been punctuated by several sharp, double-digit percentage declines that ultimately served to shake out weak leverage and strengthen the market’s foundation. Comparative analysis with previous cycles provides crucial context. The current macroeconomic backdrop—featuring evolving monetary policy, institutional adoption via spot Bitcoin ETFs, and geopolitical uncertainty—differs substantially from past environments. Therefore, while history doesn’t repeat exactly, it often rhymes. The market’s reaction to this dip will be telling. A swift recovery and holding of higher lows would signal strong underlying demand. Conversely, prolonged consolidation at lower levels might indicate a broader sentiment shift. Recent Bitcoin Price Corrections (2024-2025) Date High Before Correction Low After Correction Drawdown Primary Catalyst Jan 2024 $48,900 $38,600 ~21% GBTC ETF outflows Apr 2024 $73,100 $56,500 ~23% Geopolitical tensions, rate fears Jul 2024 $67,200 $53,000 ~21% Mt. Gox repayment announcements Mar 2025 $81,200 $76,989 (ongoing) ~5.2% (so far) Profit-taking, dollar strength The Role of Institutional Investors and ETFs The landscape for Bitcoin has transformed fundamentally with the advent of U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These vehicles, launched in early 2024, have created a massive new conduit for institutional and retail capital. Daily net flows into these ETFs have become a critical metric for gauging institutional sentiment. Early data from the day of the price drop shows a mixed picture: some funds saw modest net inflows, suggesting certain institutions viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, while others experienced outflows. This institutional presence can act as both a stabilizer and an amplifier. Large, disciplined buyers may provide support at certain levels. However, coordinated selling or risk-off behavior across correlated traditional assets can also exacerbate downward moves. The options market also plays a heightened role, with large volumes of contracts expiring weekly, often creating “pin risk” around key strike prices like $77,000 and $75,000. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Impact and Altcoin Reaction As the dominant market leader, Bitcoin’s price action invariably ripples across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Historically, sharp BTC corrections have led to even more pronounced sell-offs in altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies). This phenomenon, often called “altcoin season reversal,” occurs because traders frequently flee to the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin during market stress. Early data from this event shows this pattern holding true. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) initially saw declines exceeding Bitcoin’s percentage drop. However, the degree of correlation varies. Some sectors, like decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens tied to specific protocol activity, showed slightly more resilience. Meme coins, typically the most speculative segment, experienced the most severe volatility. This market-wide reaction highlights the importance of Bitcoin as the foundational benchmark for the entire sector’s risk appetite. Market Dominance: Bitcoin’s share of total cryptocurrency market capitalization often increases during downturns, a trend observed in early trading following this drop. Leverage Liquidation: Derivative exchanges reported hundreds of millions in leveraged long positions being liquidated, a process that can create cascading selling pressure. Stablecoin Activity: Increased minting of major stablecoins like USDT and USDC can sometimes precede buying activity, serving as a potential leading indicator for market bottoms. Regulatory and Macroeconomic Considerations for 2025 Looking beyond the immediate charts, the 2025 regulatory environment presents both headwinds and tailwinds. Ongoing global efforts to establish clear cryptocurrency frameworks, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in the European Union, aim to reduce systemic risk. While potentially stabilizing in the long term, this regulatory clarity can cause short-term uncertainty. Furthermore, central bank policies regarding interest rates remain the single largest external factor influencing capital allocation toward or away from risk assets like Bitcoin. Inflation data, employment figures, and geopolitical stability continue to be the primary drivers of macro sentiment. Any indication of resurgent inflation could prompt more aggressive monetary tightening, negatively impacting growth-sensitive assets. Conversely, signs of a controlled economic soft landing could renew investor confidence. Bitcoin’s evolving narrative as a potential digital store of value and hedge against currency debasement means its price is increasingly sensitive to these broad financial currents, not just internal crypto dynamics. Conclusion The Bitcoin price decline below $77,000 serves as a stark reminder of the digital asset market’s inherent volatility. This move, driven by a combination of profit-taking, traditional market crosscurrents, and technical factors, is a standard feature of Bitcoin’s market cycle. For investors, understanding the context—including historical precedent, institutional ETF flows, and the broader macroeconomic landscape—is far more valuable than reacting to any single price point. The market’s behavior in the coming days, particularly around the $75,200 and $73,800 support levels, will provide critical evidence of underlying strength or weakness. As always in cryptocurrency markets, prudent risk management and a long-term perspective remain essential tools for navigating these inevitable fluctuations. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $77,000? The drop appears driven by several factors: profit-taking by large holders after a recent rally, a strengthening U.S. dollar, rising bond yields attracting capital, and the liquidation of over-leveraged long positions in the derivatives market. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, historically. Bitcoin has frequently experienced corrections of 10-20% during major bull markets. These pullbacks are considered healthy as they reduce excessive leverage and allow the market to consolidate at new support levels. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Analysts are watching $75,200 (the 50-day moving average), $73,800 (a previous resistance/support zone), and $71,500 (a major January 2025 consolidation area) as the next potential levels where buying interest may increase. Q4: How did other cryptocurrencies react to Bitcoin’s drop? Most major altcoins (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) fell by a greater percentage than Bitcoin initially, a typical pattern where capital flows out of riskier assets into the more liquid market leader during downturns. Q5: Did the spot Bitcoin ETFs see inflows or outflows during this drop? Early flow data was mixed, with some ETFs seeing modest net inflows (suggesting some institutions were buying the dip) and others seeing outflows. The net aggregate flow for the day is a key metric to determine institutional sentiment.

Consequently, this intense activity contributed to a staggering 24-hour liquidation total surpassing $2.15 billion, highlighting the heightened risk and leverage present in digital asset derivatives trading. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the cascade, which primarily affected long positions during a rapid price decline. Cryptocurrency Futures Liquidations Signal Market Stress Futures liquidations represent a forced closure of leveraged positions by an exchange. This process occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the required maintenance level. Therefore, the exchange automatically sells the position to prevent further losses. The recent $100 million liquidation event primarily impacted traders on leading platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Notably, data from analytics firms like CoinGlass confirmed the scale. For instance, long positions accounted for nearly 70% of the hourly figure. This pattern suggests a swift downward price movement caught over-leveraged bullish traders off guard. Historically, such concentrated liquidation clusters often precede or accompany significant price corrections. They can create a self-reinforcing cycle known as a “liquidation cascade.” In this scenario, forced sales drive prices lower. Subsequently, lower prices trigger more liquidations. The $2.15 billion 24-hour total underscores the magnitude of open leverage in the current market structure. Compared to previous years, the absolute value of liquidations has grown alongside the total market capitalization of crypto derivatives. Anatomy of a Derivatives Market Squeeze Understanding this event requires context on crypto derivatives. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without owning it. They can use leverage, often as high as 100x on some platforms, to amplify gains and losses. The following table illustrates the typical liquidation process: Step Process Market Impact 1. Price Movement Asset price moves against a leveraged position. Increases selling or buying pressure. 2. Margin Warning Trader’s equity nears the maintenance margin level. Exchange may issue a margin call. 3. Liquidation Trigger Equity falls below the maintenance threshold. Automatic, system-triggered closure begins. 4. Order Execution Exchange’s engine executes a market order to close the position. Adds immediate sell/buy pressure to the order book. 5. Cascade Risk Large liquidations move price, triggering others. Can lead to flash crashes or squeezes. Several factors likely contributed to the recent volatility spike: Macroeconomic Data Releases: Unexpected inflation or employment figures can trigger cross-asset volatility. Large Whale Movements: Single large trades can destabilize thin order books in perpetual futures markets. Funding Rate Imbalances: Extremely high funding rates for perpetual swaps often precede long squeezes. Liquidity Fragmentation: Liquidity spread across many exchanges can amplify price impacts during stress. Expert Analysis on Risk Management and Market Structure Dr. Anya Petrova, a financial risk researcher at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, provided context. “The $100 million hourly liquidation is a symptom, not the disease,” she stated. “The core issue remains excessive leverage and a lack of robust, real-time risk management tools for retail participants. Exchanges have made improvements with isolated margin and lower default leverage. However, market structure incentives still encourage high-risk behavior.” Petrova’s research indicates that liquidation events have become more frequent but slightly less severe in price impact since 2023, due to increased market depth and the proliferation of hedging instruments. Furthermore, the evolution of trading products plays a role. The growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has provided institutional avenues for exposure. Ironically, this may have pushed more speculative retail flow into high-leverage derivatives. Regulatory developments in key jurisdictions also create uncertainty. For example, pending legislation can cause sudden sentiment shifts. These shifts then manifest violently in the leveraged derivatives market first. Historical Context and Comparative Impact To assess the scale, we must compare it to past events. The May 2021 market downturn saw single-day liquidations exceed $10 billion. The November 2022 FTX collapse triggered over $3 billion in liquidations in 24 hours. While the current $2.15 billion 24-hour figure is significant, it represents a smaller percentage of the total global open interest than previous mega-events. This suggests the underlying derivatives market has grown more resilient. However, concentrated hourly spikes like the $100 million event reveal ongoing vulnerabilities in specific leverage clusters or trading pairs. The impact extends beyond just traders’ portfolios. High volatility and liquidations affect: Exchange Stability: Systems must handle enormous order loads without failure. Blockchain Congestion: On-chain settlements and withdrawals can spike, increasing transaction fees. Market Sentiment: Such events often fuel fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in social media, affecting retail decision-making. Stablecoin Pegs: Massive liquidations can create arbitrage opportunities that test the pegs of major stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Conclusion The $100 million cryptocurrency futures liquidations event serves as a potent reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged digital asset trading. While the overall market structure shows maturation, rapid price movements continue to efficiently purge excessive leverage from the system. For traders, this underscores the non-negotiable importance of prudent risk management, including the use of stop-loss orders and avoiding maximum leverage. For the ecosystem, these events highlight the need for continued development of sophisticated risk tools and transparent, real-time data. Ultimately, understanding the mechanics of futures liquidations is crucial for anyone participating in the modern digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a “futures liquidation” in crypto? A1: A futures liquidation is an automatic, forced closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange. It happens when the trader’s collateral (margin) falls below a required minimum level due to adverse price movement, preventing a negative account balance. Q2: Why did $100 million in liquidations happen so quickly? A2: Rapid price movements, often driven by news or large “whale” trades, can quickly push many highly leveraged positions below their margin requirements simultaneously. Exchange algorithms then execute market sell orders en masse, compounding the price move. Q3: Are long or short positions more likely to be liquidated? A3: It depends on the price direction. In a rapid price drop, over-leveraged long positions (bets on the price rising) are liquidated. In a rapid price surge, over-leveraged short positions (bets on the price falling) are liquidated. The recent event predominantly affected long positions. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? A4: Key protections include using lower leverage, maintaining ample margin above requirements, setting stop-loss orders, using isolated margin mode (which limits loss to a specific position), and continuously monitoring open positions, especially during high-volatility periods. Q5: Do large liquidation events like this affect the spot price of Bitcoin? A5: Yes, they often do. The market sell orders from long liquidations add immediate selling pressure to the order book, which can drive the spot price down further. This interlink between derivatives and spot markets is a key feature of modern crypto trading.

Elon Musk’s sprawling empire, encompassing Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, represents a fundamental transformation in how industries are organized and controlled. This personal conglomerate model challenges decades of corporate convention while raising important questions about concentration of power and innovation. The Rise of Personal Conglomerates in Modern Business Thirty years ago, discussions about aerospace, energy, healthcare, mobility, and media would inevitably center on General Electric. Today, these conversations increasingly focus on Elon Musk. His portfolio spans electric vehicles, space exploration, artificial intelligence, neural technology, and infrastructure development. This represents more than just diverse investments—it signals a new paradigm where individual vision drives multiple industry transformations simultaneously. Musk’s approach differs fundamentally from traditional conglomerates. Rather than separate corporate entities with distinct management structures, his ventures share strategic direction, technological synergies, and philosophical alignment. Recent reports suggest potential mergers between SpaceX, xAI, and Tesla could formalize this interconnected approach. Such consolidation would create a technological powerhouse unlike anything seen since the industrial revolution. Historical Parallels: From GE to Gilded Age Comparisons Business historians frequently draw parallels between Musk and General Electric’s legendary CEO Jack Welch. Both transformed multiple industries through aggressive expansion and strategic acquisitions. Welch inherited a struggling industrial giant in 1981 and grew GE from $14 billion to over $400 billion through relentless restructuring and diversification. His management philosophy became the gold standard for corporate leadership throughout the 1980s and 1990s. However, some experts suggest an even more apt comparison lies further back in history. David Yoffie, professor at Harvard Business School, notes that Musk’s approach resembles the Gilded Age industrialists more than modern corporate executives. “I think it’s much more of a robber baron story than a GE conglomerate story,” Yoffie explained. “It’s much more about ego, market power, and trying to be the kingmaker.” The Conglomerate Structure: Benefits and Challenges Traditional conglomerates emerged as risk-hedging mechanisms for investors. By combining counter-cyclical businesses under one corporate umbrella, companies could smooth revenue fluctuations and maintain consistent profitability. However, this model has faced increasing scrutiny in recent decades. Research shows investors typically achieve better returns through specialized companies that can operate more efficiently within their specific domains. The “conglomerate discount” phenomenon—where combined entities trade at lower valuations than their separate parts would command—has led many corporations to spin off divisions. General Electric itself announced plans to split into three separate companies just five years ago, marking the end of its conglomerate era. This makes Musk’s apparent consolidation strategy particularly noteworthy against prevailing market trends. Technological Synergies Across Musk’s Empire While Musk’s companies maintain distinct operational focuses, technological cross-pollination creates unique advantages. Tesla vehicles already utilize xAI’s Grok artificial intelligence system, while The Boring Company’s tunnels provide infrastructure for Tesla’s transportation solutions. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite network could eventually support Tesla’s autonomous driving systems, and Neuralink’s brain-computer interfaces might integrate with multiple platforms. Recent investment patterns reveal deepening connections. Both Tesla and SpaceX have made significant investments in xAI, suggesting coordinated strategic alignment. This intercompany collaboration creates a feedback loop where advancements in one domain accelerate progress in others. For instance, battery technology developed for Tesla’s electric vehicles now supports xAI’s data centers through Megapack installations. Regulatory Landscape and Public Perception The regulatory environment presents both challenges and opportunities for personal conglomerates. During the Gilded Age, industrial magnates like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan operated with minimal regulatory constraints. Today’s landscape features more established frameworks, though enforcement approaches vary significantly across jurisdictions and administrations. Musk’s growing political influence—including reported expenditures exceeding $300 million on election-related activities—adds another dimension to the regulatory equation. As Yoffie notes, “What ultimately happens to Musk and his empire will depend both on the direction he decides to take things and how society responds to his growing power.” Public perception will play a crucial role in shaping regulatory responses to concentrated technological and economic influence. Financial Scale and Market Impact The sheer financial magnitude of Musk’s enterprises commands attention. His personal net worth approaches $800 billion, eclipsing the market capitalization of 97% of S&P 500 companies. When adjusted for inflation, this rivals General Electric’s valuation at its peak during the Welch era. Such concentrated wealth enables investment strategies unavailable to traditional corporate structures. This scale also raises questions about market competition and innovation. While Musk’s companies have demonstrably accelerated technological progress in multiple fields, their dominance could potentially stifle competing approaches. The balance between concentrated resources driving breakthrough innovation and diversified competition fostering market health remains an ongoing discussion among economists and policymakers. The Future of Business Organization Musk’s personal conglomerate model may represent either an evolutionary step in business organization or a unique phenomenon enabled by specific circumstances. Several factors distinguish his approach from traditional corporate structures: Vision-driven leadership: Strategic direction flows from individual perspective rather than committee consensus Technological integration: Cross-company technology sharing accelerates innovation Capital efficiency: Resources can be reallocated rapidly across ventures Brand alignment: Public perception connects all ventures to the founder’s identity Whether this model proves sustainable long-term depends on multiple factors. Succession planning, regulatory developments, market conditions, and technological evolution will all influence whether personal conglomerates become established business structures or remain exceptional cases. Conclusion Elon Musk’s personal conglomerate represents a fundamental shift in how industries are organized and controlled. Spanning transportation, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and neural technology, this empire challenges traditional corporate structures while accelerating innovation across multiple domains. The potential consolidation of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI could formalize a new business model that blends elements of historical conglomerates with modern technological integration. As regulatory frameworks evolve and public perception shapes policy responses, the future of personal conglomerates remains uncertain. What’s clear is that concentrated vision and resources can drive remarkable technological progress, while raising important questions about competition, regulation, and economic concentration. The coming years will determine whether Musk’s approach represents a sustainable new paradigm or a unique historical moment in business evolution. FAQs Q1: What is a personal conglomerate? A personal conglomerate refers to multiple diverse companies controlled primarily by one individual rather than through traditional corporate structures. Unlike traditional conglomerates with separate management teams, personal conglomerates feature centralized strategic direction and often share technological resources across ventures. Q2: How does Elon Musk’s empire differ from traditional corporations? Musk’s companies maintain closer technological integration and strategic alignment than typical corporate subsidiaries. They share research, development resources, and sometimes personnel, creating synergies that accelerate innovation across multiple industries simultaneously. Q3: What are the potential benefits of personal conglomerates? Personal conglomerates can achieve faster decision-making, more efficient resource allocation, and stronger technological integration. They enable visionary leaders to implement coordinated strategies across multiple domains without traditional corporate bureaucracy. Q4: What challenges do personal conglomerates face? These structures face regulatory scrutiny, succession planning difficulties, and potential “conglomerate discount” valuation issues. They may also concentrate excessive economic power and face challenges maintaining operational focus across diverse industries. Q5: Could other entrepreneurs replicate this model? While theoretically possible, successful personal conglomerates require exceptional vision, substantial capital, and the ability to manage diverse technological domains. The specific combination of circumstances surrounding Musk’s ventures makes exact replication unlikely, though elements of the model may influence future business structures.

In the last few days, the greatest owners of XRP have emptied vast sums of the token into cloud mining systems, specifically to a site known as NAP Hahsh , which has raised both enthusiasm and trepidation among investors globally. Recent blockchain data and reports in the industry indicate that XRP whales have transferred more than 1 billion value in tokenized assets to the cloud mining ecosystem of NAP Hahsh to create what some adherents refer to as reliably passive revenue streams worth tens of thousands of dollars per day . This is an extraordinary advancement that has assisted in placing cloud mining, which was initially a niche idea, at the center of the conversation regarding decentralized finance and passive yield methods, as well as the evolving part of XRP in other non-trading applications. What Is Propelling the Whale Inflows? Fundamentally, the sale of these huge amounts of XRP to NAP Hahsh is indicative of a larger trend institutional/large-scale investors seeking to harvest digital currency yield in a low-yield macro culture. In contrast to traditional mining of proof-of-work tokens such as Bitcoin, XRP is not based on traditional mining. The ecosystem of XRP had been pre-minted and it is not minted with the use of hashing power. The promising opportunities of cloud mining services, such as NAP Hahsh (and other services in the wider market) is, in effect, an opportunity to stake /allocate tokenized holdings into an engine that will pay participants periodic payouts, frequently pegged upon revenue streams, the supply and provision of liquidity, or derivatives schemes. The attractiveness is stated to high-net-worth holders, the so-called whales, with a vast balance of XRP being invested in the structure of NAP Hahsh to receive regular payments , which are reported to range between $58,000 and more per day in such redeployments . Market Reaction: Excitement and Turbulence. During the time when massive whale transfers were reported, the larger crypto markets were volatile. The recent weeks have reported that big transfers, either to the exchanges or between private wallets, can cause in price fluctuations and panic among the retail traders. In various occasions, XRP prices have fallen after large transfers being initially interpreted as sell-offs, could later be explained as non-market moving internal transfers. Traditional finance news has been an uneasy market compounding. The recent nomination of Kevin Warsh by the U.S. President Donald Trump to become a Chair of the Federal Reserve has influenced the risky assets in both directions, at times strengthening the dollar and pushing the crypto prices down as the traders reassess the risk and liquidity situations. The post-nomination activity on the market featured equity and precious metals fluctuations, which proves that crypto does not exist in a vacuum of macroeconomic fluctuations. Irrespective of these stresses, large inflows into NAP Hahsh of whales imply that bigger players are tripling down strategies to place XRP into income creation positions as opposed to mere speculation.

Conclusion | Cloud Mining Is Reshaping How XRP Is Used Overall, the surge of whale funds into NAP Hash appears to be more than a short-term capital move. It reflects a broader shift in how large XRP holders are positioning their assets in a market shaped by volatility and macro uncertainty. As price swings become harder to predict, more investors are choosing to turn part of their holdings into steady income streams rather than relying solely on market timing. In this context, cloud mining is moving from a niche option to a more widely adopted strategy. By allocating XRP into automated, energy-backed mining and payout systems, investors can keep long-term exposure to the asset while adding a more predictable source of daily returns.

The price has dropped by 6% to test the $84,000 level. This is a sign of the high volatility that still exists in the crypto market. When the prices of major assets like Bitcoin move around so erratically, smart investors look to invest in other assets that have more stability. This is why smart investors look to invest in new assets that have real utility. One of these assets is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While Bitcoin is struggling to keep its price up, Mutuum Finance has officially launched its V1 protocol. This could make it the next big thing in the market. Phase Seven Presale Offers Final Low Price Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering smart investors a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in on this new asset before it officially launches. The asset is currently in Phase Seven of its presale. The price of the token is currently $0.04. This is the final stage of the presale before the price jumps to $0.045. More price increases will follow until launch at $0.06. This means that smart investors could make an instant return on their investment on the very first day. However, experts predict that the price of this asset could increase by as much as ten times once it officially launches. This could mean that a $500 investment will turn into $5,000. This makes MUTM one of the best cryptos to buy. Overcollateralized Loans Keep Funds Safe One of the unique features of the Mutuum Finance protocol is the overcollateralized loans. Such a feature ensures that everyone using the platform is safe. An example is if a person wants a loan, the person will have to put more value in the collateral than the amount borrowed. An example is if a person puts $15,000 in Ethereum as collateral and then borrows $10,000 in stablecoins. Even if the market drops, the person’s loan is safe. For the lenders, their deposit is safe and earns high interest. An example is if the person earns a high interest rate of 12% on the deposited money. This way a deposit of $20,000 would earn $2,400 by the end of the first year. Earn Yield by Using the Native Stablecoin Mutuum Finance will have its own stablecoin, which is pegged to the United States dollar. Such a coin is a major growth aspect of the ecosystem. An example is if a person wants to mint the coin and lock up crypto as collateral. An example is if a person locks up $15,000 in Bitcoin and then earns $10,000 in the Mutuum stablecoin. The person then earns interest on the stablecoin by using it to lend to others in the ecosystem and earning a high interest rate e.g. 10%. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Now The done V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet shows that Mutuum Finance is real and ready. Bitcoin is being put to the test in terms of pricing, but MUTM is working on a full working system that allows users to lend, borrow, and even earn. The presale is progressing swiftly, giving users one of the last chances to buy it at a low price. The loan system is designed to protect investor capital, while the stablecoin allows users to earn safely. If you are asking what crypto to buy now, then Mutuum Finance is definitely a strong contender, especially if you are looking to invest long-term. This is because it is not just any other cryptocurrency; it is a full working financial ecosystem, making it a strong contender to be the next big crypto, especially if you are thinking long-term and beyond the current volatility.

The altcoin lost nearly 20% of its value in the past week, free-falling under the psychological $3,000 level since Thursday, January 29th. With the market still showing signs of further downside risk, there is no telling how deep the Ethereum price will fall in the current bearish setup. However, the latest on-chain data has offered insights into the next critical levels for the second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH’s Next Support Stands At $2,475: Glassnode In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified the next three on-chain support levels for the Ethereum price. This on-chain evaluation revolves around the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, which helps to pinpoint strong resistance and support levels based on investor cost bases. Related Reading: Ripple’s David Schwartz Shuts Down Claims Of XRP Hitting $100 For context, an investor’s cost basis refers to the actual price at which they purchased a particular cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this scenario). Typically, the ability of a price level to function as an on-chain support or resistance zone depends on the number of investors who have their cost basis at the given level. As inferred earlier, the UTXO Realized Price Distribution tracks the amount of a particular cryptocurrency that was acquired at a specific price level. Now, the price levels below the present spot value with significant trading activity are often considered as major support zones, as shown in the chart below. The reasoning behind this expectation is that investors with their cost bases around these price levels are likely to double down on their positions and purchase more coins. This increased buying activity will, hence, offer a cushion for the Ethereum price to stay afloat and potentially bounce back. Highlighting data from Glassnode, Martinez identified the $2,623, $2,475, and $1,881 levels as the next crucial support zones for the Ethereum price after losing the $2,772 mark. However, it appears that the altcoin’s price has also lost the $2,623 and $2,475 support following its latest decline over the weekend. Ethereum Price Overview As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,410, reflecting an over 10% decline in the past 24 hours. With this latest decline, the altcoin’s price seems to be hovering around the support cushion at around $2,475. If ETH’s stay below this support level is sustained, investors could see the Ethereum price fall to as low as $1,881. A fall of this magnitude would represent a 25% decline from the current price point and an over 60% correction from the cycle high.

This analysis examines technical foundations, market adoption metrics, and comparative blockchain data to assess FLR’s potential path. Flare (FLR) Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026-2030 Horizon The Flare Network positions itself as a blockchain for data, integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine to enable smart contracts using data from other chains and the internet. Consequently, any FLR price prediction must first consider its fundamental utility. Network adoption metrics, such as monthly active addresses and total value secured in its F-Asset system, provide concrete starting points. Furthermore, the successful deployment of its LayerCake scaling solution will directly impact transaction throughput and cost, two critical factors for developer adoption. Market analysts consistently reference these operational milestones when modeling future token economics. Technical Foundations and Market Context for FLR Flare’s unique value proposition centers on decentralized data acquisition. Unlike oracles that act as third-party bridges, Flare aims to make every node a data provider. This technical approach could reduce reliance on external services. However, its success depends on network security and participation. The tokenomics of FLR involve its use for transaction fees, governance, and collateralizing F-Assets. A report from a major blockchain analytics firm in Q1 2025 noted a steady increase in FLR being staked for network security, indicating growing holder commitment. Meanwhile, broader market cycles and regulatory developments for interoperable networks will inevitably influence FLR’s price action alongside these internal factors. Expert Perspectives on Adoption and Valuation Models Financial technology researchers often apply discounted cash flow models to layer-1 tokens, estimating future fee revenue accruing to the network. For Flare, analysts project potential fee generation based on forecasted data relay volumes. A 2024 paper from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance highlighted the growing market size for secure, decentralized data feeds, a tailwind for Flare’s core business. However, experts caution that valuation remains highly sensitive to execution risk and competitive pressure from other data-focused chains. The following table summarizes key variables influencing long-term FLR price models. Variable Bull Case Scenario Base Case Scenario Network Adoption (TVS) >$5B by 2027 $1-2B by 2027 Daily Transactions 1M+ sustained 200K-500K Developer Activity Top 20 ecosystem Steady niche growth Market sentiment, often measured through social dominance and exchange netflows, provides another data layer. Periods of high development activity, like the mainnet launch of the Flare Time Series Oracle upgrade, have historically correlated with increased investor attention. Nonetheless, long-term price sustainability will rely on tangible use cases generating recurring demand for FLR tokens, not merely speculative interest. Comparative Analysis and Risk Assessment Evaluating Flare requires comparison with other projects in the interoperability and data space. Chains like Chainlink (LINK), which provides oracle services, and Cosmos (ATOM), focused on general interoperability, serve as benchmarks. Flare’s differentiation is its native integration of data protocols at the consensus layer. This technical integration could lead to lower costs and higher security for data calls. Key risks identified in analyst reports include: Execution Risk: Delays or flaws in core protocol upgrades. Competitive Risk: Rapid innovation by established oracle or layer-1 networks. Regulatory Risk: Evolving global stance on data provision and cross-chain assets. Market Risk: Correlation with broader crypto asset volatility. These factors are quantitatively weighted in sophisticated price prediction models spanning 2026 to 2030. Conclusion The Flare (FLR) price prediction for 2026 through 2030 hinges on the network’s ability to execute its technical roadmap and capture meaningful market share in the blockchain data economy. While models project a range of outcomes based on adoption variables, the fundamental analysis centers on utility-driven demand. Monitoring key performance indicators like total value secured and developer activity will provide the earliest signals for any sustained, long-term breakout in FLR valuation. FAQs Q1: What is the primary use case of the Flare (FLR) token? FLR is used to pay for transaction fees and computation on the Flare Network, participate in governance, and as collateral to mint F-Assets, which are representations of tokens from other chains. Q2: How does Flare’s approach to data differ from traditional oracles? Flare integrates data acquisition directly into its network consensus, aiming for every node to participate, whereas traditional oracles typically rely on a separate network of nodes to fetch and deliver data to a blockchain. Q3: What are the most critical milestones to watch for Flare’s development? Key milestones include the scaling of its LayerCake technology, growth in Total Value Secured (TVS) for F-Assets, and the expansion of its ecosystem of decentralized applications using its native data protocols. Q4: How do broader cryptocurrency market cycles affect FLR price predictions? FLR, like most crypto assets, exhibits correlation with major market cycles. Long-term predictions often separate this beta (market) exposure from alpha (project-specific) growth based on network adoption metrics. Q5: Where can investors find verifiable data on Flare Network’s usage? Investors can consult blockchain explorers for Flare, network dashboards published by the Flare Foundation, and independent analytics platforms that track metrics like daily transactions, active addresses, and staking participation.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.000263031 to $0.00026130. Meanwhile, the crypto market selloff intensified as the carnage in the global equity markets spilled over. Markets are under intense pressure as global macroeconomic conditions remain volatile. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the $80,000 mark, while Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 10% over the past 24 hours. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Set For Next Price Increase Husky Inu AI (HINU) is set for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase. The latest price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00026031 to $0.00026130. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Fundraising has seen a substantial uptick over the past few weeks, after overcoming a significant slowdown. Husky Inu AI has raised $922,464 so far, and could cross $1 million before its official launch. Cryptocurrency Market Crash Intensifies Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market selloff intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and nearly all other altcoins trading deep in the red. The crash occurred amid declining futures open interest in the industry, which fell to a low of $113 billion, while total liquidations plunged $1.6 billion. Bitcoin liquidations surged to $750 million, while Ethereum positions worth $554 million were wiped out. ETFs also registered heavy outflows over the past week, indicating weak demand from institutional and retail investors. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index also plunged back into “Extreme Fear” territory, and currently sits at 18. President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair has also spooked investors. Warsh is known to be hawkish, with markets worried he would become another Jerome Powell once confirmed. The appointment triggered a $7 trillion sell-off in metals, dampening risk appetite. On the geopolitical side, the threat of an imminent US attack on Iran has also dampened market sentiment. Iran has hinted it could shut down the Strait of Hormuz in the event of an attack by the US.

More than 110 companies from the S&P 500 are dropping their quarterly numbers, making it the biggest release wave of Q4. That includes major tech names like Amazon, Alphabet, Palantir, AMD, and PayPal. So far, results have come in strong. FactSet says 77% of companies have beaten earnings estimates. That’s not a small deal. According to John Butters, senior analyst at the firm, the S&P 500 is pacing for its fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Right now, bottom-line growth is tracking at 11.9%. Let’s break down what to expect, starting Monday. Disney, Palantir open the week with key misses or surprises Disney kicks things off before the bell Monday, with a call at 8:30 a.m. ET. Last time, their shares slid 7% after mixed results. For this quarter, LSEG data suggests profits likely dropped another 10%. The focus is on theme park attendance. Deutsche Bank’s Bryan Kraft wrote, “Theme Parks attendance remains a concern in F2026 given the slowdown in leisure travel that began (roughly) in September and was evident in Disney’s 4% domestic attendance decline during F4Q.” He added that Universal’s new Epic Universe may be taking a bite out of Disney’s traffic. Also on Monday, Palantir Technologies reports after the bell. Their last quarter beat expectations and raised guidance. This time, LSEG sees their earnings and revenue jumping by at least 60%. But not everyone’s impressed. RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria said, “We cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in our software coverage… valuation seems unsustainable.” Palantir stock has dropped after two of the last three reports. Pepsi, Chipotle, and AMD pack Tuesday with tech and consumer trends PepsiCo opens Tuesday’s slate with an 8:15 a.m. call. Last quarter, they beat estimates on the back of strong international demand. This round, analysts expect a 10% earnings increase. UBS analyst Peter Grom said Pepsi is “one of the few large-cap Staples names with a strong case for multiple expansion.” That’s yet to be proven. Later, Chipotle reports after the close, with a 4:30 p.m. call. Their stock got crushed last time after cutting their sales outlook. Now, LSEG expects a slight earnings dip. The stock has lost over a third of its value in the last year. Still, Telsey’s Sarang Vora sees 2026 as a comeback story. “The share price should bounce back as comps turn positive in 2Q26+, cost pressures moderate, initiatives start to show results, such as menu innovation and loyalty, and investors refocus on the core multi-year unit growth of 8%-10%,” he said. AMD also reports Tuesday postmarket. Their last report beat the Street but only met margin expectations. For Q4, analysts expect 20% earnings growth. Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler just lifted his price target to $300, saying, “We believe AMD will deliver revenue upside to the tune of $200 million… and EPS upside of at least $0.02.” Historically though, AMD stock falls on earnings days despite beating the Street 62% of the time. Uber, Eli Lilly, Alphabet and Amazon close out the flood Uber posts results early Wednesday, call at 8 a.m. Last quarter, revenue beat estimates, but shares dropped anyway. This quarter, LSEG says earnings will collapse 75% year-over-year. BofA’s Justin Post still sees signs of growth: “Mobility and Delivery industry appear to have performed well… new products like Reserve, Share, and Comfort also support growth.” Despite that, Uber stock has fallen after five straight reports. Also Wednesday, Eli Lilly releases results at market open with a 10 a.m. call. Last quarter, they beat earnings and raised margin forecasts. This time, LSEG expects 30% growth from a year ago. The company recently announced a $3.5 billion factory project in Pennsylvania to expand its obesity drug pipeline. Everyone’s watching their GLP-1 business closely. But history says caution; Lilly beat for four quarters straight, yet still dropped over 10% after two of them. Alphabet reports after Wednesday’s close. Last quarter, they crossed $100 billion in revenue for the first time. LSEG sees 20% growth in earnings this quarter. Ronald Josey of Citigroup wrote, “Given positive online advertising checks amid continued strong Google Cloud demand, we believe results are likely to come in above consensus revenue and GAAP EPS expectations.” Shares have risen after three straight reports. Amazon wraps things up Thursday after hours, followed by a 5 p.m. call. Last quarter, they beat forecasts and raised spending plans. This time, analysts expect just a slight profit increase.

57643230,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267587,1769964911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,India’s Bold Gamble: Zero Taxes Through 2047 to Dominate Global AI Workloads,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/india-zero-tax-ai-workloads-2047/,"BitcoinWorld India’s Bold Gamble: Zero Taxes Through 2047 to Dominate Global AI Workloads NEW DELHI, INDIA — In a strategic move to capture the next wave of artificial intelligence infrastructure, India has unveiled an unprecedented tax incentive, offering foreign cloud providers zero taxes through 2047 for services run from Indian data centers and sold internationally. This bold policy, announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the annual budget, positions India as a formidable contender in the global race for AI computing supremacy, even as the nation grapples with significant infrastructure challenges. India’s Zero-Tax Gambit for Global AI Dominance The proposal creates a 22-year tax holiday for revenues generated from cloud services sold outside India, provided the computational workloads powering those services originate from data centers within the country. Consequently, this policy directly targets the massive capital expenditure plans of U.S. technology giants. Minister Sitharaman clarified that sales to domestic Indian customers must route through locally incorporated resellers, ensuring domestic taxation applies. Additionally, the budget introduces a 15% cost-plus safe harbour for Indian data-center operators servicing related foreign entities, simplifying transfer pricing compliance. This announcement arrives as global cloud providers accelerate their infrastructure expansion to support exploding AI demand. India, with its vast engineering talent pool and growing digital economy, is strategically positioning itself as a key alternative to traditional hubs in the United States, Europe, and parts of Asia. The policy reflects a calculated shift in viewing data centers not merely as back-end infrastructure but as a strategic business sector critical for national economic and technological advancement. Unprecedented Investment Inflow from Tech Giants The tax incentive has already catalyzed significant commitments from leading global firms. In October, Google announced a $15 billion investment to build an AI hub and expand its data-center footprint in India, marking its largest commitment in the country. Microsoft followed in December with a $17.5 billion plan by 2029 to grow its AI and cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, Amazon has escalated its spending, pledging an additional $35 billion by 2030, bringing its total planned investment in India to approximately $75 billion for retail and cloud operations. Domestic players are also scaling aggressively. A joint venture between Reliance Industries, Brookfield Asset Management, and Digital Realty Trust, Digital Connexion, plans an $11 billion, 1-gigawatt AI-focused campus in Andhra Pradesh by 2030. Similarly, the Adani Group has committed up to $5 billion alongside Google for a major AI data center project. Analysts project India’s total data-center power capacity could surge from just over 1 gigawatt today to exceed 8 gigawatts by 2030, fueled by over $30 billion in capital investments. Navigating the Infrastructure Paradox: Power, Water, and Growth Despite the ambitious policy and investment surge, scaling India’s data-center capacity faces substantial headwinds. The very AI workloads the policy seeks to attract are notoriously energy- and water-intensive. India contends with patchy power reliability, high electricity costs, and acute water stress in many regions. These constraints could significantly slow construction timelines and elevate long-term operating costs for providers, potentially offsetting the benefits of the tax holiday. Experts highlight the execution gap between policy intent and ground reality. “The announcements signal that data centers are being treated as a strategic business sector,” said Rohit Kumar, founding partner of The Quantum Hub, a New Delhi-based policy consultancy. “However, execution challenges around power availability, land access, and state-level clearances remain critical hurdles.” Success will depend on parallel investments in grid stability, renewable energy integration, and sustainable cooling solutions to make India’s AI infrastructure proposition truly viable. Strategic Bet on Global Tech vs. Domestic Champions The long-term tax exemption reveals a nuanced strategy. Sagar Vishnoi of Future Shift Labs notes that allowing foreign cloud firms to operate tax-free until 2047 represents a “strategic bet on global Big Tech” to rapidly build foundational infrastructure. The government appears willing to forgo immediate tax revenue to accelerate India’s integration into the global AI supply chain. However, this approach raises questions about fostering domestic technology champions over the same two-decade period. Moreover, the requirement for foreign providers to serve Indian customers through local resellers creates a layered market. Vishnoi suggests this could pressure smaller domestic players into competing for thin margins as resellers, rather than receiving comparable upstream incentives to build their own competitive cloud and AI services. Beyond AI: A Holistic Push for Tech Sovereignty The budget’s focus extended beyond AI infrastructure, revealing a comprehensive plan to deepen India’s role in the global technology value chain. Key parallel initiatives include: Semiconductor Mission Phase II: A renewed push to develop domestic chip IP, produce equipment and materials, and strengthen supply chains, backed by industry-led R&D centers. Electronics Manufacturing Boost: The outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme increased to ₹400 billion (~$4.36 billion) after exceeding investment targets. The scheme reimburses costs for manufacturing key components like PCBs and camera modules, linking incentives to actual production. Critical Minerals Security: Support for establishing rare-earth corridors in mineral-rich states to reduce dependency on China for materials essential for EVs, electronics, and defense. E-Commerce Export Reform: Removal of the per-consignment value cap on courier exports to help small businesses and artisans sell globally online. These measures collectively underscore India’s ambition to move beyond assembly and capture more value across the technology stack—from raw materials and components to high-value cloud computing and AI services. Conclusion India’s offer of zero taxes through 2047 for global AI workloads is a landmark, high-stakes policy designed to capitalize on a pivotal moment in technological evolution. By leveraging its demographic and market potential, India aims to redirect a portion of the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure investment wave toward its shores. The strategy acknowledges fierce global competition and internal infrastructure deficits but bets that long-term incentives can attract the capital needed to overcome those very challenges. Ultimately, the policy’s success will hinge not just on attracting investment, but on executing the parallel build-out of reliable power, water, and regulatory ecosystems. If successful, India could transform from a consumer of AI into a central hub for its global computation, reshaping its economic trajectory for decades to come. FAQs Q1: What exactly does India’s new AI tax holiday policy offer? A1: The policy offers foreign cloud service providers a tax exemption (zero taxes) on revenues earned from services sold outside India until the year 2047, provided those services are run from data centers located within India. Sales within India are taxed domestically through local resellers. Q2: Why is India targeting AI workloads specifically? A2: AI workloads represent the fastest-growing and most computationally intensive segment of cloud computing. By attracting this high-value infrastructure, India aims to become a central node in the global AI supply chain, fostering job creation, technology transfer, and long-term economic growth in a strategic sector. Q3: What are the main challenges India faces in becoming an AI hub? A3: The primary challenges include ensuring reliable and affordable electricity supply, managing water resources for cooling data centers, securing land, obtaining timely state-level clearances, and developing a robust domestic talent pipeline for AI and data center operations. Q4: How does this policy benefit domestic Indian companies? A4: Domestic data center operators benefit from a 15% cost-plus safe harbour for services to foreign entities and from the overall infrastructure boom. However, domestic cloud service providers may face increased competition and are channeled into a reseller model for the local market under the new rules. Q5: What other sectors did the Indian budget focus on alongside AI? A5: The budget also significantly increased incentives for electronics component manufacturing, launched a second phase of the India Semiconductor Mission, proposed initiatives to secure critical mineral supplies, and simplified regulations for cross-border e-commerce exports.

While the opening weeks of the year were marked by cautious optimism, a sharp shift in sentiment is now rippling across the charts. Signs of fatigue are becoming evident among leading cryptocurrencies, suggesting that the momentum driving them over the past several months may be weakening. Analysts tracking smart-money flows are noting declining demand for high-cap assets, alongside growing interest in emerging, utility-focused protocols. The market appears to be positioning for a major realignment, one in which only projects with the strongest technological foundations are likely to endure. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately 82,500 at the moment after falling sharply by 5.7% in the past 24 hours. This negative trend has taken the total market capitalization of the asset to about $1.72 trillion. The psychological and technical resistance zone at the levels of $83,000 to 85,000 has turned into a major resistance to many traders. Pricing has been hit by a high selling pressure although there have been a series of attempts to regain the $90,000 mark earlier this month. The immediate market forecast of Bitcoin is progressively unfavorable to those who are out to make aggressive returns. Technical analysts also fear that in case BTC cannot support itself at its current price, it will cause a drop to $75,000 or even $65,000 by the middle of 2026. According to the majority of experts, even in a moderately bullish future, the growth of most of the existing DeFi protocols can be estimated at a rather modest 1.2x to 1.5x in the coming year, which is still minuscule when compared to the growth potential of the new protocols. This is a main motive that has seen most long-term holders selling their BTC to realize gains and diversify to high utility altcoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Bitcoin may be losing its momentum for now but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage as an asset to put in high demand. Mutuum Finance is a new crypto developing decentralized lending and borrowing hub based on the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance will enable the users to gain access to liquidity or yield without selling their digital assets. The project has already garnered over $20.1 million and it has already got over 19,000 holders which is a good indicator that the project is highly trusted by the market even before its official launch. The MUTM presale is at Phase 7, and the price of the token is $0.04. This is a 300% increase over its original Phase 1 price of $0.01. Having a confirmed launch price of $0.06, investors buying at this moment are buying at a 50% discount. According to the project, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) of the total supply of 4 billion tokens are distributed to the presale, and more than 840 million tokens have already been sold, which indicates that the time to take advantage of an early entry is running out. V1 Protocol Launch and Community Engagement The technical milestones make MUTM have the momentum it has. The Sepolia testnet currently has the V1 protocol online and users can use it to test core functionality such as liquidity pools, mtTokens and the auto liquidator bot. This practical product is what distinguishes between MUTM and pure speculative money. Moreover, the site accepts direct payments made by card and thus any investor can easily take part in the presale. In order to remain engaged within the community, a 24-hour leaderboard will be used to pay the most active participant of the day with a bonus of $500 in MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance has a high level of safety as it has gone through a full independent audit, with Halborn Security . The protocol also has a high score of 90/100 points by CertiK and has a bug bounty of 50,000 USD to guarantee the resilience of the code. In the future, the roadmap will involve the introduction of an over-collateralized stablecoin and integration of Chainlink oracles to get true price feeds. These characteristics, along with the Layer-2 expansion strategies, make Mutuum Finance a leader in the new cheap crypto cycle in 2026.

Treasury Breach Nets $27 Million,https://bitcoinist.com/who-struck-step-finance-treasury-breach-nets-27-million/,"Step Finance, a well-known Solana analytics hub, said its treasury was hit in a major breach that emptied 261,854 SOL from wallets tied to the platform. The loss forced a sharp market reaction, and users and investors watched prices tumble as the team moved quickly to contain the damage. Based on reports, roughly 261,854 SOL were unstaked and shifted off the platform on January 31, 2026, an amount worth around $27 million to $30 million at the time. Breach Hits Step Finance Treasury Investigators were called in right away. According to the platform’s public posts, security specialists and outside firms are helping to trace the funds. Some transfers were obvious on public ledgers; they could be followed from the compromised wallets to a set of addresses that began converting SOL. #CertiKInsight We have seen a security breach of @StepFinance_ treasury wallets. https://t.co/Zi3tMKaTqE 261,854 SOL (~$28.9M) has been withdrawn after stake authorization had been transferred to https://t.co/o51kREYPHW Stay Vigilant! pic.twitter.com/GrxpyzI2Uv — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) January 31, 2026 Questions remain about how access was gained. It is not yet clear whether private keys were taken, a staking routine was exploited, or an internal process failed. The exact technical route is still being pieced together. On-Chain Clues And Market Fallout Markets reacted violently. The platform’s governance token fell hard, with prices dropping by more than 80% in minutes as panic spread. Traders sold quickly. Price books thinned. Based on reports from on-chain trackers, multiple large unstake transactions and swaps were executed in a short time window. Some of the moved SOL was routed to exchanges, while other amounts were split across several wallets, a pattern observers often tie to attempts at cashing out without drawing attention. Earlier today several of our treasury wallets were compromised by a sophisticated actor during APAC hours. This was an attack facilitated through a well known attack vector. Immediate remediation steps have been taken, and we are working closely with top security professionals.… — Step (@StepFinance_) January 31, 2026 Community Anxiety And Operational Response Step Finance announced emergency steps to shield remaining funds. Access to certain treasury functions was restricted and multisig controls were reviewed. Accounts under direct protocol control were frozen where possible. The company said it was cooperating with authorities and sharing findings with the wider Solana community. At the same time, public-facing channels were used to give updates as they became available, though many technical details were deliberately withheld to avoid tipping off the attacker. Recovery Steps And Unknowns A handful of security firms are conducting forensic work on the transactions. On-chain evidence will be crucial to any effort to recover assets. Reports note that tracing is a step; recovering funds is another. Legal and regulatory routes may be explored if identifiable intermediaries or exchanges are used to move the stolen value. Whether user funds outside the treasury were touched has been a key concern, and the company is said to be clarifying that matter.

Bitcoin dropped more than 5% to around $84,250, triggering a wave of liquidations that rippled through the broader crypto ecosystem. The sell-off followed a combination of macro and geopolitical stress. A hawkish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve reinforced tighter financial conditions, while escalating U.S.–Iran tensions added to uncertainty, prompting investors to reduce exposure to risk assets. This content is delivered by Outset PR , where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. High-beta assets amplify downside Solana (SOL), often viewed as a high-beta asset within the crypto market, amplified the broader move. As leveraged long positions were forced to unwind, selling pressure intensified. Liquidations add immediate supply to the market, accelerating declines when liquidity thins. Market-wide sentiment reflected this risk-off shift. The CoinMarketCap Fear & Greed Index remained at 38, firmly in “Fear” territory, underscoring fragile confidence among traders. SOL key support level breaks Against this backdrop, SOL fell below a critical technical level. Price broke under the $117.58 swing low support and traded down to around $115.44, confirming a loss of short-term structure. The break of a widely watched support level often triggers stop-loss orders and invites additional selling from short-term traders. Once such levels fail, former support zones frequently turn into resistance, limiting the strength of any rebound.

It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Momentum indicators favor sellers Technical momentum continues to point lower. The MACD histogram is deeply negative at -1.46, signaling sustained bearish momentum rather than early signs of stabilization. At the same time, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) stands at 42.68, indicating weakening momentum without reaching oversold conditions. This combination suggests sellers remain in control, with room for further downside before technical exhaustion becomes a factor. Levels to watch next With $117.58 no longer holding, attention shifts to lower Fibonacci retracement levels. The next major zone sits near the 78.6% retracement around $124.14, which now acts as resistance rather than support. Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling pressure below this level unless broader market conditions improve. For now, Solana’s price action reflects a market driven by macro stress and liquidation-led selling. Until volatility subsides and buyers reclaim lost structure, downside risks remain elevated.

57643570,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/02/storytelling-in-web3-how-outset-pr-bridges-media-and-community,1769965957,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/57643570.jpeg,Storytelling in Web3: How Outset PR Bridges Media and Community,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/02/storytelling-in-web3-how-outset-pr-bridges-media-and-community,"In Web3 promotion, the real challenge is explaining what you’ve built in a way that people outside your Discord can actually follow. You also need that story to build trust in a space that’s been shaped by scams and disappointments. And on top of that, it has to stay consistent as it travels across X, Telegram, long-form media, and AI search. Good Web3 storytelling treats the audience as the main character, not the protocol. The project plays the role of the guide, and the product is simply how that journey moves from “problem” to “solution.” Outset PR , a data-driven crypto PR agency, efficiently applies this approach: it takes dry updates like “we launched,” “we raised,” or “we shipped v2” and turns them into narratives that make sense to journalists and resonate with communities. Why Web3 storytelling is harder than it looks Most Web3 teams feel the pain of storytelling long before they name it. You’re dealing with fragmented channels: X and Telegram for your core holders, Discord for community, GitHub for devs, LinkedIn for partners, long-form media for credibility. Each one has its own culture and rhythm. Keeping a consistent story across all of them is difficult. You’re dealing with technical complexity: on-chain mechanics, token models, security properties. Go too deep and you lose most people. Stay too shallow and the ones who matter don’t take you seriously. And you’re dealing with low default trust. After years of rugs and overpromises, anything that sounds too slick sets off scam alarms. People expect clarity, receipts, and a narrative that survives the next market cycle — not slogans. In that environment, journalists become one of the hardest filters to pass. If your story doesn’t make sense to them, it rarely reaches anyone else in a credible way. That’s why Outset PR starts by asking what actually feels newsworthy to the press . How Outset PR connects product to bigger conversations In Outset PR’s practice, this theory shows up in three habits: connecting updates to live debates, respecting timing windows, and reframing products without forcing them into fake buzzwords. They tap into broader tensions. Journalists get the same narrative again and again: “we launched,” “we partnered,” “we integrated.” What cuts through are stories that clearly connect a product to a live debate — regulation battles, new use cases, infrastructure stress, meme coin cycles, liquidity rotations. They respect timing. Crypto narratives move in sharp waves. Restaking one week, stablecoins the next, then politics, then L2 congestion. Outset PR emphasizes that the biggest mistake teams make is timing, not tone: sending a pitch even a few days after a window closes can quietly kill a strong story. They shift framing without faking it. Chasing whatever buzzword is hot this week (“AI,” “RWA,” “LRT,” “modular”) might win a headline, but it erodes trust fast. Real alignment happens when a product already touches a trend — then the job is to articulate that overlap, not invent it. Two of their examples illustrate how much framing matters: When Choise.ai launched Meme Bank, they didn’t pitch “another meme token.” They framed it as meme coins crossing from pure speculation into payments, cards, and banking-like utility — which flipped coverage from dismissive to serious. For Graphite Network, instead of “blockchain with reputation,” they tied the story to Tesla’s $150B market cap wipeout after political drama: if trust can erase that much value overnight, we have a structural problem in how markets price reputation. Graphite became a lens on that problem, not just “another chain.” In both cases, the product didn’t change but the story certainly did. Common narrative mistakes that still hold Web3 back These examples are part of a broader pattern we see across Web3: entire categories are still framed in ways that keep them in the background, even when they should be front and center. Stablecoins are a good example. They’re often described as “boring plumbing” or just background liquidity – safe, but not interesting. In reality, they’re fast becoming the most acceptable form of crypto for banks, fintechs, merchants, and everyday users, quietly acting as a Trojan horse for Web3 adoption. The same mistake shows up across Web3 when we reduce stablecoins to “safe money,” middleware to “just infra,” or governance to “votes.” That old framing makes everything sound like background noise. Reframing these topics around what they actually change – access, trust, power, and value flow – turns them into stories that belong in bigger conversations, not just technical updates. Speaking two languages at once: media and community Another challenge in Web3 storytelling is that journalists and communities want different things from the same story. Journalists look for independence, verifiable facts, and a reason their readers should care that goes beyond “the team is excited.” Communities look for belonging and recognition: they want to feel listened to, valued, and involved in the journey. The trick is not to flatten everything into a single voice. Instead, Outset PR keeps the core narrative stable and adjusts the framing: For media, a gas-fee improvement becomes: “Here’s data showing we now offer the lowest fees in this segment, and why that matters for adoption.” For the community, the same change becomes: “You told us fees were a pain point. We shipped a fix together.” The facts don’t change. The emphasis does. This mirrors a key Web3 storytelling principle: the audience is the hero, the project is the guide. Journalists need a guide that helps them explain the industry to their readers; communities need a guide that helps them see their own progress and impact. Outset PR keeps both versions honest, but tuned to the right emotional frequency. Where Outset PR adds its own twist Many of the challenges Outset PR solves are common to Web3 but the way they work with them is pretty specific to the agency’s DNA. First, there’s a strong data-driven backbone behind the narrative work. Outset PR doesn’t just ask “what sounds good?” but “what can we prove, and where will that proof matter most?” That’s where their broader model — Outset Data Pulse , media performance analysis, and timing intelligence — feeds directly into storytelling decisions: which angles to prioritize, which markets to speak into, which outlets and cycles to ride. That data-driven backbone shows which story angles actually moved something — traffic, perception, signups — so those angles can be refined and reused. Second, there’s a clear line between promotion and news. The team explicitly trains founders and marketers to separate “this is big for us” from “this changes something for the market.” Internal wins still get celebrated, but they’re routed into community updates, documentation, and social content, not forced into press pitches that don’t have the weight to land. Third, they treat narrative reframing as a core skill, not a one-off trick. Stablecoins, meme coins, infrastructure, and “boring” middleware often carry stale, shallow stories. The approach of Outset PR is to look for the unspoken stakes: what’s actually changing for users, for risk, for institutions, for regulators? Once that’s clear, the story shifts from background noise to “this might decide how the next cycle plays out.” Key takeaways that Web3 teams can apply today To keep this practical, here’s one condensed list of how a founder or comms lead can borrow from Outset PR’s approach to Web3 storytelling: Start by asking why this matters beyond your walls.If the only honest answer is “because we built it,” it’s a community post, not a pitch. Anchor your story in a real tension: cost, access, risk, regulation, UX. Write the narrative before the announcement.Don’t begin with “We’re excited to share…” Begin with the problem state, the change, and what it signals for users or the market. Features should feel like visible progress toward a bigger promise. Split the story into media and community versions.Keep the core facts and direction identical, but change the emphasis: proof, context, and independence for journalists; participation, recognition, and shared progress for your own holders and users. Underneath all of this is the same idea Outset PR comes back to across its writing: strong Web3 storytelling doesn’t try to overpower the market with hype. It aligns with what the market is already wrestling with, then shows how your project moves that conversation forward in a way people — and over time, language models — genuinely remember.

In a newly published commentary, China’s president made it crystal clear that he wants the renminbi to become a global reserve currency. The message was printed in Qiushi , the Communist Party’s own ideology journal. Jinping said China must create a “powerful currency” that’s used widely in international trade, investment, as well as forex markets and earning global reserve status. What’s new here isn’t the ambition, Beijing’s wanted this for years but how direct Jinping was this time. The article was taken from a speech he gave in 2024 to regional officials, but it’s only being released now, in 2026, while global markets are already on edge. The US dollar has fallen to its weakest level in four years, and 47th President Donald Trump said last week that the slide is “great.” With the Fed going through a leadership change and international tensions rising, central banks are starting to rethink their dollar exposure. China pushes renminbi as dollar weakens under Trump “China senses the change of the global order more real than before,” said Kelvin Lam, senior China+ economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. According to him, Jinping’s push ties directly to the current cracks in the dollar’s dominance. In the Qiushi commentary, Jinping said a strong currency needs strong backup. He called for a “powerful central bank” that can actually manage money well, plus financial institutions that can hold their own globally. He also wants cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen to become international financial hubs that “attract global capital and exert influence over global pricing.” Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, had said something like this last year. In a Shanghai meeting with officials and investors, he predicted a new currency order. He said the renminbi would compete in a “multi-polar international monetary system,” sharing the space with the dollar, euro, and others. Han Shen Lin from The Asia Group added that China doesn’t want to replace the dollar overnight, but they do want the yuan to become a “strategic counterweight” that limits U.S. leverage as the global order shifts. Renminbi gains ground in trade but still weak in reserves The yuan has already made some gains. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, it’s become the second-most used currency for trade finance. But in official reserves, it still trails far behind. As of Q3 2025, the dollar made up about 57% of global reserves, down from 71% in 2000. The euro sat at 20%. The renminbi? Just 1.93%, according to IMF data. Experts say full convertibility and open capital accounts are key if China wants central banks to actually hold more renminbi. Right now, the lack of openness is a deal-breaker for many global investors. Some of China’s trade partners also want a stronger yuan. They claim it’s undervalued, which helps Chinese exports but messes with trade balances. China’s trade surplus hit $1.2 trillion last year, and complaints about currency manipulation aren’t going away. Even the IMF jumped in. Managing director Kristalina Georgieva said China’s deflation had “resulted in significant real exchange rate depreciation,” and urged Beijing to fix “imbalances” in its economy. At a conference last month, PBoC vice-governor Zou Lan denied that China was trying to weaken the currency for trade gains. Instead, he said their policy goal is “to keep the renminbi stable and preserve its role as a store of value.” China’s central planners seem open to letting the yuan rise slightly. It’s already moved past Rmb7 against a weaker US dollar, though it’s still falling against the euro. Zhang Jun, chief economist at China Galaxy Securities, said that as China focuses on domestic growth and tech innovation, the yuan could rise further over time. Han from Asia Group added, “Xi’s rhetoric won’t flip global foreign exchange markets today but it cements a long-term tilt investors are already sniffing out.” Get seen where it counts.

From lock-ups, unclear terms, and sudden rule changes, priorities are shifting toward liquidity, transparency, and reliable access to EUR. This is where Clapp Flexible Savings stands out. Instead of forcing users to choose between traditional banking and crypto-yield products, Clapp combines both into a single, straightforward savings experience. The Problem with Most Crypto Savings Accounts in Europe Many crypto savings products still inherit the same structural flaws: Funds are locked for fixed terms to access competitive rates Interest is credited monthly or irregularly EUR support is indirect or requires conversion into stablecoins Rates depend on loyalty tiers or platform tokens Yield mechanics are unclear For users who want predictable income and fast access to their money, these trade-offs are increasingly hard to justify. What Makes EUR Support a Decisive Factor Most crypto platforms treat EUR as a temporary on-ramp rather than a balance you can actively earn on. Users often need to convert fiat into stablecoins, accept FX exposure, and pay extra fees just to start earning yield. Clapp features EUR native savings via SEPA Instant, so users can deposit euros directly and start earning interest immediately — without conversions, trading steps, or delays. This makes Clapp particularly practical for EU residents who manage both fiat and crypto side by side. Clapp Flexible Savings: How It Works Clapp Flexible Savings is designed for simplicity and control. Deposit EUR, USDC, or USDT Interest is calculated and credited daily Funds remain fully liquid Withdraw anytime without penalties or rate reductions There are no fixed terms, no staking mechanics, and no exposure to volatile platform tokens. Clear and Predictable Yields Clapp offers a fixed 5,2% APY on stablecoins and EUR, displayed directly in the app. There are: no “up to” rates no loyalty tiers no hidden conditions What users see is exactly what they earn. This clarity is one of the main reasons holders choose Clapp over more complex yield platforms. Daily Interest and Full Liquidity Daily interest payouts allow balances to compound more frequently and give users immediate feedback on their savings performance. More importantly, liquidity is never compromised. Users can: withdraw funds instantly move assets at any time sell USDT or convert balances without affecting their rate This combination of daily yield and unrestricted access is still uncommon in the European crypto savings landscape. Low Entry Threshold, Practical Use Case Clapp Flexible Savings is accessible from 10 EUR, USDC, or USDT, making it suitable both for cautious first-time users and for larger balances. This low minimum supports gradual adoption and removes the pressure to commit large sums upfront. Security and Regulatory Clarity Clapp Finance operates as a registered Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic, following EU AML and compliance standards. User assets are safeguarded through Fireblocks’ institutional-grade custody infrastructure, which is widely used by regulated financial institutions. For many holders, this regulatory positioning provides a level of confidence that purely offshore platforms cannot offer. Why Holders Choose Clapp Clapp appeals to users who want their savings product to behave like a savings account — not a speculative instrument. Holders typically value: native EUR earning daily interest with instant access fixed, transparent yields no lock-ups or loyalty schemes EU regulatory alignment Instead of optimizing for maximum theoretical APY, Clapp optimizes for usability, predictability, and control. Final Thoughts Crypto savings in Europe are evolving. As regulation tightens and users become more selective, products that combine transparency, liquidity, and fiat compatibility gain an advantage. Clapp Flexible Savings fits this shift. By offering EUR-native deposits, daily interest, and unrestricted access to funds, it provides a practical savings option for crypto holders who want clarity rather than complexity. For users who keep part of their portfolio in EUR and stablecoins and expect immediate access at all times, Clapp offers a savings model aligned with how money is actually used.

After multiple platform failures and tighter regulation, users have become more selective. Today, the key criteria are clear: transparency, liquidity, regulatory compliance, and predictable returns. This review looks at the most reliable crypto savings options available to European users in 2026, focusing on platforms that prioritize clarity over complexity. 1. Clapp Flexible Savings: Simple and Flexible Passive Income on Crypto Clapp Flexible Savings offers a way to earn yield on crypto and EUR balances without trading, staking, or navigating DeFi protocols. The product is designed around daily access, clear rates, and minimal friction between fiat and crypto. Unlike many savings solutions that rely on lock-ups or tiered reward systems, Clapp keeps the structure straightforward: deposit, earn daily interest, withdraw anytime. Why Clapp Flexible Savings stands out Daily interest with instant access and 24/7 liquidity Clear, fixed yields: 5,2% APY on stablecoins and EUR, displayed directly in the app. EUR deposits via SEPA Licensed and secure: Clapp Finance is a registered VASP in the Czech Republic, operating under EU AML and compliance standards. Clapp follows a customer-first model. There are no forced lock-ups, opaque yield mechanics, or complex workflows. Users earn daily, retain full control over their funds, and always know exactly what rate they are receiving. 2. Nexo — High Yields with Loyalty Conditions Nexo remains one of the better-known crypto savings platforms in Europe. It supports a wide range of assets and offers daily interest payouts. However, headline rates often depend on holding or earning in the NEXO token, which adds an extra layer of exposure. Best suited for users comfortable with loyalty programs and token-based incentives. 3. Kraken — Conservative and Security-Focused Kraken’s earn products focus primarily on staking and yield-bearing assets rather than classic savings accounts. The platform benefits from a strong security reputation and regulatory standing, but flexibility and yield clarity vary by asset. A reasonable choice for users who prioritize platform stability over yield optimization. 4. Coinbase — Simple but Limited Returns Coinbase offers interest on selected assets, with a strong emphasis on compliance and user protection. The interface is accessible, but rates are generally lower, and product availability can differ significantly across EU countries. More suitable for beginners than for users actively seeking competitive savings yields. 5. Binance Earn — Broad Selection, Variable Clarity Binance provides flexible and fixed savings products across many tokens. While yields can be attractive, terms often change, and product structures may be less transparent for long-term savers. Better suited to experienced users who actively monitor rates and conditions. Top Crypto Savings Accounts in Europe (2026) Platform APY on Stablecoins / EUR Interest Payout Withdrawals EUR Support Regulation (EU) Clapp 5,2% fixed Daily Instant, no penalties Native EUR via SEPA Instant VASP (CZ), EU AML Nexo Variable, tier-based Daily Instant (conditions apply) EUR supported EU-regulated entity Kraken Asset-dependent Varies Depends on product EUR supported Strong EU compliance Coinbase Low–moderate Variable Instant EUR supported Highly regulated Binance Earn Variable, promotional Flexible / fixed Depends on product Indirect EUR support Mixed regulatory coverage Final Thoughts In 2026, crypto savings in Europe are no longer about chasing the highest advertised APY.

Daily interest, instant access, native EUR support, and clear fixed yields make it one of the most practical crypto savings options currently available to EU users.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction following current market sentiment. The coin’s value has dropped to $0.103 in the past 24 hours.

Conversely, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may surge toward the $0.126 resistance zone. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.23417–$0.298035 level by 2027. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price dropped to $0.103 over the last 24 hours as sellers continued to dominate. After DOGE price faced resistance around local highs, sellers took control and pushed the price toward support levels. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2026? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.159661 in 2026. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2029. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin near $1 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 4797 DOGE in February; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading below its average price of the last year. Currently, the coin is trading below the previous year’s peak price of $0.434, which was observed in January 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $0.830239 mark by 2032, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. At the start of October, Doge was trading above $0.21, and at the start of November, it hovered near $0.187. By the end of December, the price of Dogecoin declined toward $0.122. At the start of 2026, Dogecoin was trading near $0.118, and in February it came down to $0.102; the current DOGE sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-02-01 17:30:39

This decision follows similar moves by neighboring Malaysia and the Philippines, marking a pivotal moment in Southeast Asia’s approach to regulating advanced generative AI tools after a widespread crisis involving nonconsensual, sexualized imagery. Grok Ban Lifted: The Path to Conditional Reinstatement Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs formally announced the conditional lifting of the Grok ban this week. The ministry based its decision on a detailed letter from X, now a subsidiary of xAI, which outlined concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of future misuse. Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, emphasized the provisional nature of this move. Consequently, the government could swiftly reinstate the ban if further violations are discovered. This regulatory stance reflects a growing global trend where governments are adopting a ‘trust but verify’ model with powerful AI systems. The initial bans across Southeast Asia were a direct response to severe platform misuse. According to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate, bad actors used Grok to create a flood of harmful content in late December and January. Specifically, the AI generated at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women, including depictions of real individuals and minors. This incident sparked immediate international condemnation and triggered regulatory scrutiny far beyond the region. The Global Ripple Effect of the AI Deepfake Scandal While Southeast Asian nations enacted swift bans, the Grok deepfake scandal prompted varied responses from governments worldwide. Many opted for investigations and warnings instead of outright prohibition. In the United States, California Attorney General Rob Bonta confirmed his office had launched a formal investigation into xAI. His team sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the company to take immediate action to stop the production of these illegal images. This action highlights the increasing willingness of state-level authorities to police digital platforms. In response to the global backlash, xAI has implemented several technical and policy changes. A key restriction now limits Grok’s AI image generation feature exclusively to paying subscribers on the X platform. CEO Elon Musk has publicly addressed the controversy, stating, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” He has also claimed no awareness of any naked underage images generated by the AI. However, these assurances did little to quell the initial furor from advocacy groups and regulators. Expert Analysis: A New Era of Conditional AI Access Technology policy analysts view Indonesia’s conditional lifting as a blueprint for future AI governance. “This isn’t a simple reversal; it’s the establishment of a new regulatory contract,” explains Dr. Anya Sharma, a digital ethics fellow at the Singapore Institute of Technology. “Governments are signaling that market access for advanced AI is now contingent on demonstrable safety measures and ongoing cooperation. The ‘conditionally’ clause is the most important word in the announcement—it creates a permanent lever for accountability.” This approach balances innovation with consumer protection, potentially setting a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. The timeline of events is crucial for context. Malaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23, creating regional pressure for a coordinated policy response. Indonesia’s decision, coming shortly after, suggests a shared regional concern about being left behind technologically while maintaining a firm stance on digital ethics. The sequence also indicates that xAI’s outreach and promised safeguards were consistent across the affected jurisdictions. Broader Implications for xAI and the Tech Landscape The controversy arrives at a complex time for xAI and its parent company. Reports indicate xAI is in talks to merge with two of Elon Musk’s other ventures, SpaceX and Tesla, ahead of a potential SpaceX IPO. This corporate maneuvering adds a layer of financial and reputational stakes to the Grok saga. Furthermore, unrelated documents released by the U.S. Justice Department concerning Jeffrey Epstein have surfaced, showing past email correspondence between Musk and Epstein. While legally distinct from the AI issue, this development contributes to the heightened scrutiny surrounding Musk’s ecosystem of companies. The global regulatory landscape for AI is now unmistakably stricter. The European Union’s AI Act and similar frameworks under development in North America and Asia are creating a new normal. In this environment, a company’s ability to respond decisively to misuse—as xAI is attempting—becomes a critical competitive advantage. The key metrics for success will now include: Response Time: Speed in deploying technical fixes after misuse is identified. Transparency: Clarity in communicating safety measures to regulators and the public. Enforcement: Effectiveness of new safeguards, like paywalls for high-risk features. Cooperation: Willingness to engage proactively with government oversight bodies. For users and civil society in Indonesia and other lifting countries, the conditional access means Grok’s capabilities will be under a microscope. Any resurgence of similar deepfake campaigns will likely trigger an immediate and permanent ban. This creates a powerful incentive for both the platform and its user base to adhere to community guidelines and legal standards. Conclusion Indonesia’s decision to conditionally lift the Grok ban represents a nuanced, post-crisis approach to AI regulation. It moves beyond simple prohibition toward a model of enforced responsibility and verified safety. This case establishes that access to cutting-edge AI tools is now a privilege that companies must earn through demonstrable accountability and robust guardrails. As the global community watches, the success or failure of this conditional reinstatement will undoubtedly influence how democracies worldwide govern the next generation of disruptive artificial intelligence. The Grok ban lifted, but the scrutiny has permanently intensified. FAQs Q1: Why did Indonesia ban Grok in the first place? Indonesia, along with Malaysia and the Philippines, banned Grok after reports revealed its AI image generator was used to create millions of nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes, including images of real women and minors, constituting a severe misuse of the technology. Q2: What does ‘conditionally’ lifting the ban mean? It means Grok’s services are reinstated under strict probation. The Indonesian government requires xAI to implement specific safety improvements and will reinstate the ban immediately if further violations or misuse are discovered. Q3: What steps has xAI taken to prevent future misuse? xAI has restricted Grok’s AI image generation feature to paying subscribers on the X platform, a move aimed at adding a layer of accountability. The company also provided the Indonesian government with a detailed plan for service improvements and misuse prevention. Q4: How have other countries responded to the Grok deepfake issue? Responses have varied. While Southeast Asian nations issued bans, the U.S. state of California launched an investigation and sent a cease-and-desist letter. Many other governments have increased scrutiny but stopped short of nationwide bans, opting for warnings and ongoing monitoring. Q5: Could this happen again with other AI chatbots? The incident underscores a systemic risk with powerful generative AI. Consequently, regulators worldwide are now more likely to pre-emptively demand robust safety frameworks from all AI companies, making such widespread, unchecked misuse less probable but not impossible.

Elon Musk is ripping out vehicle lines, shutting down models, and sinking billions into robots, chips, and software. So if you’re still tracking car deliveries, you’re wasting your time. Tesla is chasing $25 billion from humanoids. As Cryptopolitan reported last week , in Tesla’s Q4 earnings report, there was a 16% drop in car deliveries. Then we hopped on the call event and heard Elon say “I’m fine with that.” Elon scrapped the Model S and X. Straight up killing them off so their factories can be used to build humanoid robots. Elon even changed Tesla’s mission statement to “amazing abundance.” That’s what he opened the call with. He didn’t talk about earnings. He talked about building a future full of robots and high-performance chips. And he’s backing it up with real money. His plan is to build chips in-house using a new platform called TerraFab. It’ll cost several hundreds of billions. But Tesla fans think it’s the best long-term bet he’s made in years. Robotaxi production is also getting ramped up right now. Not next year. Not “eventually.” Now. Elon called this the robotaxi ramp year, and he didn’t follow it with any updates about normal cars. There’s no focus on ownership anymore; just autonomy, production, and software. Robot numbers and chip goals now drive Tesla’s future William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer ran the math on what Elon is trying to pull off. If Tesla makes 500,000 Optimus bots per year and sells each one for $50,000, that’s $25 billion a year. That’s not some far-off fantasy either. Elon says Optimus V3 is dropping this year, and production starts in 2027. That’s real product, real numbers, and real capital going into it. On the chip side, TerraFab is a giant project that Tesla is handling on its own. That means the company won’t depend on outside chip suppliers. Elon wants full control, from hardware to software. And it’s not for fun. It’s to run AI, robotics, and the autonomy systems for everything Tesla plans to roll out over the next few years. Elon also said Tesla might keep making semitrucks. Maybe a few Roadsters. But the big delivery-focused EV plans? He didn’t mention any. That story’s done. The market already priced this in. Tesla stock is trading at a forward P/E of 196. General Motors and Ford? They’re sitting in the single digits. That tells you everything. Wall Street doesn’t think Tesla is like the others. Because it isn’t.

The sudden drop brings into focus XRP’s higher-timeframe structure, which is teasing a break below the 33-month exponential moving average. According to a technical assessment shared on X by crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, the recent drop below the 33-month exponential moving average does not automatically signal the end of XRP’s cycle, but XRP must close above an exact level to avoid a macro bearish confirmation. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech The 33 EMA Breakdown Signal At the time of writing, XRP is back to trading around $1.65, stabilizing after a volatile few hours that forced many traders to reassess the broader structure. However, according to technical analysis by Egrag Crypto, the most recent crash saw XRP breaking a bit below the 33 EMA on the monthly candlestick timeframe chart. Egrag based the recent price action around one critical condition: a confirmed monthly close below $1.60 and the 33 EMA. According to the analyst, such a close would mark a macro bearish confirmation based on historical structure, not sentiment or opinion. The chart he shared highlights how XRP has respected the 33 EMA as a long-term trend reference across multiple cycles, with violations often preceding extended corrective phases. As shown in the chart below, the XRP price has been trading above the 33-EMA since early 2025, even during periods of corrections. However, XRP is now trading dangerously close to this EMA, and there is now a risk of a breakdown. XRP Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto On X What This Means For XRP’s Price Structure There’s a risk that XRP can transition into a macro bear structure. At the same time, there’s enough reason to suggest an upside bounce for the cryptocurrency. A major point in Egrag’s analysis is historical performance that shows XRP’s strongest upside expansions did not require a clean bull-market environment. Therefore, there are two historical analogs of how XRP can play out from its current range around $1.60. The first is a repeat of the 2021-style move. This move, measured from similar structural conditions, would imply an upside expansion of roughly 340% with a price target around the $7 region. The second one is a repeat of the 2017 cycle. Comparison to the 2017 cycle projects a much larger structural expansion of about 1,600%, which would align with the $27 zone highlighted on the chart above. In both cases, the rallies originated from oversold conditions and compression ranges, not from a strong bullish macro confirmation like many would expect.

The Private Shares Fund, which manages $1.1 billion, had put 13.68% of its money into the rocket manufacturer as of December, a $151 million position that represents the fund’s top investment. That’s a larger percentage bet than even Cathie Wood has made on the aerospace company. With several of the fund’s portfolio companies like Discord, Kraken and Motive Technologies getting ready to launch initial public offerings, 2026 looks promising for Moss’s investment approach. These private holdings will soon face their first real market test when they start trading publicly. _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> SpaceX takes center stage as fund’s top holding The appeal of owning SpaceX stock showed up clearly in investor behavior. When the news broke about SpaceX planning to go public, money flowing into the fund jumped 201% above what it typically sees in a year. For the 56-year-old Moss, the sales pitch is straightforward: tie up your cash to get early access to major tech names, even though private company values aren’t transparent, profits aren’t guaranteed, and it might take years to cash out. “We saw SpaceX at the time as an emerging leader,” Moss explained in a Bloomberg interview when discussing his first purchase of $10 million back in 2019. That investment has grown fifteen times since then. Buying those shares took real effort. Moss traveled to the company’s California headquarters, walked through the factory, and sat down with company officials before completing the transaction. The rocket company is planning to go public potentially this year, with reports suggesting it could be valued at $1.5 trillion, which would make it the largest stock market debut ever. Looking at returns, the fund hasn’t beaten the Russell 2000 index over one-year and three-year periods, though it matched the index’s performance over five years, based on Bloomberg data. While most investment funds buy into companies like SpaceX through special investment vehicles or roundabout methods, Moss purchases shares directly from the company’s official ownership records. SpaceX carefully reviews every potential shareholder. According to Cryptopolitan , SpaceX is looking at possibly combining with Tesla Inc. or artificial intelligence company xAI, another company in Moss’s portfolio. The fund uses what’s called an interval fund structure. Unlike regular mutual funds, people can only pull their money out during three-month windows. This setup prevents having to sell holdings when markets get rocky. The entry point is $2,500. Investors don’t get full transparency on some important details The fund doesn’t reveal its current valuation of SpaceX, how much that holding has contributed to performance, or how a major public offering might change the fund’s worth. Like other interval funds, it provides quarterly reports showing cost basis, position size and fair value. Even when investor interest spikes, getting more exposure to hot companies like SpaceX isn’t automatic. Private company shares aren’t always up for sale, and when they are, companies like SpaceX strictly control who can buy. Every Thursday, Moss and his four-person team, two portfolio managers and two analysts, review their roughly 80 investments, working through valuations and exit strategies. They have tough standards. Companies need at least $50 million in revenue and must be growing 30% annually. Moss expects about 10 portfolio companies to go public this year, including Kraken , Discord, and Motive Technologies.

Jensen Huang, who runs Nvidia, told reporters in Taipei on Sunday that the eye-popping sum was simply an upper limit his company could consider investing, not a done deal. The tech boss said Nvidia will look at each chance to invest separately. “It was never a commitment,” Huang explained to reporters. “They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time.” The clarification comes after Nvidia and OpenAI signed paperwork in September laying out plans for the chip company to potentially invest as much as $100 billion in the ChatGPT maker. That money would help OpenAI build massive computer centers and other technology needed to power artificial intelligence systems. The arrangement aimed to create facilities using at least 10 gigawatts of electricity, about as much power as New York City uses when demand hits its highest point. These centers would run on Nvidia’s cutting-edge computer chips, which train and operate AI programs. Huang dismisses tension as ‘nonsense’, then cuts investment plans The Wall Street Journal threw cold water on the deal Friday, reporting that the investment plans had hit roadblocks . According to unnamed sources who know about the situation, some people inside Nvidia started having second thoughts about the partnership. The newspaper said Huang had told people privately that the $100 billion figure wasn’t legally binding. He also reportedly criticized how OpenAI runs its business, saying the company lacks proper discipline, and worried about facing too much competition. When reporters asked Huang on Saturday about the Journal’s story, which suggested tensions between him and OpenAI, he dismissed it sharply. “That’s nonsense,” Huang said. He went on to praise OpenAI and promise significant financial support. “We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang told reporters. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.” While Huang called the planned investment “huge,” he stopped short of saying exactly how much Nvidia might actually put in. He did make clear that whatever Nvidia contributes to OpenAI’s current fundraising effort won’t come close to $100 billion. The back-and-forth highlights growing worries about how money flows in the AI industry. Nvidia’s plan to invest heavily in OpenAI raises eyebrows because OpenAI is also one of Nvidia’s biggest customers, buying large quantities of its advanced chips. Critics increasingly question whether these arrangements — where tech companies invest in AI businesses that turn around and buy their products — create fake demand that makes the market look healthier than it really is. CoreWeave deal adds to the pattern Nvidia isn’t just doing this with OpenAI. The company recently said it would put another $2 billion into CoreWeave Inc., a cloud computing business that also buys lots of Nvidia chips. That deal targets building 5 gigawatts worth of AI technology infrastructure by 2030. When news of the CoreWeave investment broke on January 26, 2026, the company’s stock jumped 6 percent. The CoreWeave partnership adds to concerns about this circular pattern in AI financing . Investors are starting to ask harder questions about whether these deals actually reflect genuine market demand or if they’re just tech companies propping up each other’s businesses through investments that eventually flow back to themselves through product sales. Despite the questions swirling around these investments, Huang remains bullish on OpenAI and the broader AI industry, even as he insists Nvidia will be more measured about how much it actually commits.

Most crypto assets followed a similar trajectory. But experts are constructive on BTC. In a joint report by Coinbase and Glassnode, the firms stated that the largest cryptocurrency appears to be on firmer ground than many altcoins that are still dealing with the fallout from last October’s sharp selloff. Bitcoin’s Healthier Start to 2026 Coinbase and Glassnode believe that the crypto markets are entering 2026 in a healthier condition after excess leverage was largely flushed out of the system during the fourth quarter. The two firms said this view is reflected across several on-chain technical indicators. One of them, the entity-adjusted Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), revealed that investor sentiment fell from the “Belief” phase to “Anxiety” following the October sell-off and stayed there through the quarter. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s realized price has continued to rise into early 2026. This shows that the market’s overall cost basis is increasing over time. Bitcoin’s spot price remains above this realized price, which means the average holder is still in profit rather than at a loss. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which compares the current market price to the realized price, is around 1.5. This indicates that the crypto asset is trading at roughly a 50% premium to its on-chain cost basis. On-Chain Signals During the fourth quarter of 2025, the share of BTC supply held in profit fell sharply. The report explained that this drop suggests that prices between $80,000 and $85,000 may have served as an accumulation zone for model-based strategies. The report also pointed to changes in dormant and active supply. Bitcoin supply that moved within the past three months rose by 37% in the fourth quarter, while the share of supply that had not moved for more than a year fell by 2%. This change indicates that the market may have entered a high-velocity distribution phase during that period. There has also been a decline in the Puell Multiple, which fell to 0.9 in the fourth quarter. This indicates that miners were earning about 10% less than the average of the previous year. Additionally, Net long-term holder positions and changes in exchange balances, together, signaled profit-taking between July and September. But similar behavior was not clearly observed during the fourth quarter of 2025.

This price surge represents a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, capturing global investor attention and signaling robust market momentum. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the underlying factors driving this ascent. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $78,000 Surge Market data from Bitcoin World confirms BTC’s rise above the $78,000 threshold. This level, previously a key resistance point, now acts as a new support zone. The Binance USDT pairing, a major global liquidity pool, shows strong buying pressure. Therefore, this breakout suggests sustained institutional and retail confidence. Historically, such milestones often precede periods of increased volatility and trading volume. Several technical indicators align with this bullish move. For instance, the trading volume spike accompanies the price increase, validating the rally’s strength. Moreover, the move occurs within a broader macroeconomic context of evolving digital asset regulation. This context provides a crucial backdrop for understanding the price action. The following table compares recent key Bitcoin price levels: Price Level Date Approx. Market Significance $69,000 2021 Peak Previous All-Time High $73,000 Early 2025 Recent Resistance $78,122 March 2025 > Current Breakout Level Drivers Behind the Current Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple fundamental factors contribute to Bitcoin’s impressive performance. First, increased adoption by traditional finance (TradFi) entities continues. Major asset managers now offer spot Bitcoin ETFs, funneling new capital into the market. Second, the recent Bitcoin halving event in 2024 reduced the new supply issuance rate. This scarcity mechanism historically influences long-term price appreciation. Furthermore, global macroeconomic conditions play a role. Investors often view Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation. Consequently, geopolitical tensions and monetary policy shifts can increase its appeal. Finally, technological advancements on the Bitcoin network, like Layer 2 solutions, enhance its utility. These solutions improve transaction speed and reduce costs, broadening its use cases. Institutional Investment: Sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs demonstrate professional market participation. Supply Constriction: The halving mechanism enforces a predictable, diminishing new supply. Macro Hedge: Asset diversification strategies in portfolios now frequently include digital gold. Expert Perspective on Market Sustainability Market analysts emphasize the importance of on-chain metrics for assessing rally health. Data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant shows strong holder behavior, often called “HODLing.” For example, the percentage of Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved in over a year remains high. This metric suggests long-term conviction rather than speculative short-term trading. Additionally, exchange reserves are declining, indicating coins are moving to cold storage for safekeeping. Experts from firms like CoinShares and ARK Invest frequently reference these data points. They argue that a foundation of long-term holders creates a more stable price floor. However, they also caution about potential over-leverage in derivatives markets. Futures and options trading can amplify both gains and losses, leading to sharp corrections. Therefore, while the trend is positive, prudent risk management remains essential for all market participants. Historical Context and Future Trajectory for BTC Bitcoin’s journey to $78,000 follows a familiar pattern of boom and consolidation cycles. After reaching its prior peak near $69,000 in 2021, the market entered a prolonged downturn. The subsequent bear market tested investor resolve but also built a stronger foundation. Now, breaking into uncharted price territory requires analyzing past cycle trends. Typically, new all-time highs attract media attention and new investors, fueling further cycles. Looking ahead, key levels to watch include psychological barriers at $80,000 and $100,000. Market sentiment, measured by tools like the Fear & Greed Index, will also be critical. A shift towards “extreme greed” often signals a potential local top. Conversely, steady growth with periodic pullbacks indicates healthier, more sustainable advancement. The integration of blockchain technology into traditional systems provides a long-term growth narrative beyond mere price speculation. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $78,000 marks a definitive moment in its financial market evolution. This achievement reflects a confluence of institutional adoption, sound monetary policy, and technological progress. The Bitcoin price movement is more than a number; it signifies growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Moving forward, market participants should focus on fundamental developments and robust risk management. The journey of the world’s premier cryptocurrency continues to redefine the boundaries of finance. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $78,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies growing market maturity and potential mainstream acceptance. However, investors should always conduct personal research and consider volatility before participating. Q2: How does the price on Binance compare to other exchanges? Prices can vary slightly across exchanges due to liquidity and regional demand. The Binance USDT price is a major global benchmark, but arbitrage traders typically keep differences minimal. Q3: What was the main catalyst for Bitcoin breaking $78,000? No single catalyst exists. The breakout results from combined factors: institutional ETF inflows, post-halving supply dynamics, and broader macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets. Q4: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Financial advice cannot be given. Cryptocurrency investments carry high risk. Individuals must assess their financial goals, risk tolerance, and consult independent advisors. Q5: Could the price fall back below $78,000? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Previous resistance levels, once broken, can become support, but pullbacks are a normal part of market cycles.

The project is currently in phase 7, where investors can buy the tokens at $0.04. The stage is moving fast, indicating that it will be sold out soon. The price of the coin is set to increase when it moves to the next stage. In addition, the official launch is at $0.06, but analysts are already indicating that it is likely to grow even higher. Based on its tokenomics, the coin is likely to grow 7x its current value in the coming days after it is listed. This means that if you invest $1,000, it is likely to grow to $7,000. This is a clear indication that it is a good alternative to Binance Coin, which is currently under pressure. Peer-to-Peer Lending for Direct Control A strong feature of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem is its use of a Peer-to-Peer Lending System. This means that two users can make an agreement to lend money to each other. For example, a user can lend money to a trusted individual in their network in the amount of $8,000 at a 10% interest rate. This way, the user earns a profit of $800 after a year. This form of lending provides a passive income opportunity and makes MUTM a strong new crypto coin. Profit Sharing Through Token Buybacks Mutuum Finance has a strong feature for users who are long-term holders of its cryptocurrency. This means that a certain amount of fees collected by the system are used to buy back its cryptocurrency, MUTM. The cryptocurrency that has been bought back from the market is then given to users who are staking in the ecosystem. This means that users can earn a share of a company’s profits, as well as a strong reason for them to use the system. If $1,000,000 is collected by the system from users who are using its lending system, 20% can be used to reward users who are staking their cryptocurrency. This means that $200,000 worth of MUTM is distributed among stakers. This makes MUTM a strong cryptocurrency that has a high chance of success. MUTM’s Path to Outperforming BNB Although the price of the Binance Coin is heavily dependent on the exchange, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the contrary, creates value through a working product. The recently launched V1 protocol on the testnet is a significant development that takes Mutuum Finance from idea to reality. The presale of the coin provides an opportunity for investment at a low price and has the potential for appreciation. The P2P lending feature provides high control and returns to the users, while its profit-sharing feature incentivizes the holders. In the case of investors who are looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2026, MUTM is a great option to consider. It provides the benefits of investing in a new crypto coin, along with the benefits of a live and earning DeFi protocol, which is what might take it to the next level and allow it to beat the likes of BNB.

XRP Escrow System: Understanding Ripple’s Supply Management Ripple’s escrow system represents a fundamental aspect of XRP’s economic design. The company initially held 55 billion XRP tokens following the cryptocurrency’s creation. To ensure predictable supply management, Ripple established a series of escrow contracts in December 2017. These contracts automatically release one billion XRP each month over a 55-month period. However, Ripple typically returns most of these tokens to escrow, creating a carefully managed supply schedule that market participants monitor closely. The recent 400 million XRP unlock represents a substantial portion of the monthly allocation. Market analysts immediately noted this transaction’s significance. The blockchain transparency allows real-time tracking of such movements, providing unprecedented visibility into cryptocurrency supply dynamics. This visibility contrasts sharply with traditional financial systems where similar corporate actions might remain opaque for extended periods. Cryptocurrency Supply Mechanics and Market Impact Supply management represents a critical factor in cryptocurrency valuation. Unlike traditional fiat currencies controlled by central banks, most cryptocurrencies follow predetermined issuance schedules. XRP’s total supply stands at 100 billion tokens, with approximately 45 billion currently circulating. The remaining tokens exist in various states of escrow or corporate holdings. This structure creates predictable supply pressure that market participants must consider when evaluating price movements. The timing of this unlock coincides with broader cryptocurrency market developments. Regulatory clarity continues to evolve in multiple jurisdictions, potentially affecting institutional adoption of digital assets like XRP. Additionally, technological advancements in blockchain interoperability and cross-border payment solutions may influence XRP’s utility value. Market participants must consider these factors alongside supply changes when assessing the cryptocurrency’s prospects. Expert Analysis of Escrow Release Patterns Blockchain analysts have identified patterns in Ripple’s escrow management strategy. Historical data reveals that the company typically returns 800 million to 900 million XRP to escrow each month after initial releases. This practice suggests the 400 million XRP unlock might represent strategic allocation rather than immediate market sale. Industry experts emphasize that such releases often fund operational expenses, partnership development, or ecosystem growth initiatives rather than creating direct selling pressure. Comparative analysis with other cryptocurrency projects reveals different approaches to token distribution. Bitcoin follows a predetermined mining schedule with halving events every four years. Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake with controlled issuance. XRP’s escrow system represents a third approach, combining corporate control with transparent blockchain verification. Each model carries distinct implications for supply inflation, decentralization, and market predictability. Recent Major XRP Escrow Releases Date Amount Unlocked Market Context October 2024 1 billion XRP Pre-regulatory clarity period September 2024 1 billion XRP Market consolidation phase August 2024 500 million XRP Cross-border payment expansion July 2024 1 billion XRP Institutional adoption announcements Market participants should consider several key factors when evaluating escrow releases: Transparency advantage: Blockchain visibility allows real-time tracking Predictability benefit: Scheduled releases reduce uncertainty Corporate strategy: Releases often support ecosystem development Market adaptation: Historical patterns inform current analysis Blockchain Transparency and Market Efficiency The public nature of blockchain transactions creates unprecedented market transparency. Whale Alert’s reporting of the 400 million XRP unlock demonstrates this advantage. Market participants receive immediate notification of significant supply events, allowing rapid analysis and response. This transparency contrasts with traditional financial markets where similar corporate actions might remain undisclosed for regulatory reporting periods. Blockchain analytics firms have developed sophisticated monitoring systems that track cryptocurrency movements across exchanges, wallets, and institutional holdings. These systems provide valuable data about supply distribution, holder concentration, and transaction patterns. The resulting market intelligence helps participants make informed decisions based on verifiable on-chain data rather than speculation or rumor. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Framework Cryptocurrency regulation continues to evolve globally, affecting how companies like Ripple manage their digital asset holdings. Recent regulatory developments in major jurisdictions have clarified compliance requirements for cryptocurrency issuers and custodians. These frameworks typically emphasize transparency, investor protection, and market integrity—principles that align with blockchain’s inherent transparency features. Ripple’s escrow management occurs within this evolving regulatory landscape. The company maintains compliance programs addressing securities regulations, money transmission laws, and financial reporting requirements across multiple jurisdictions. This compliance framework provides additional context for understanding escrow release decisions, as regulatory considerations often influence corporate cryptocurrency management strategies. Conclusion The 400 million XRP escrow unlock represents a significant event in cryptocurrency markets, highlighting the intersection of blockchain transparency, supply management, and market dynamics. Ripple’s systematic approach to XRP distribution provides predictable supply patterns that market participants can analyze using verifiable blockchain data. This XRP escrow release demonstrates how cryptocurrency projects balance corporate strategy with market considerations while operating within evolving regulatory frameworks. The event underscores blockchain technology’s transformative potential for creating transparent, efficient financial markets where participants can access real-time information about fundamental supply factors. FAQs Q1: What does “XRP escrow unlock” mean? An XRP escrow unlock refers to Ripple releasing previously locked XRP tokens from controlled accounts according to a predetermined schedule established in 2017 to ensure predictable supply management. Q2: How often does Ripple unlock XRP from escrow? Ripple’s escrow contracts automatically release one billion XRP monthly, though the company typically returns most tokens to escrow, creating a managed supply schedule that market analysts monitor closely. Q3: Does XRP escrow unlocking affect cryptocurrency prices? Supply changes can influence cryptocurrency prices, but market impact depends on whether unlocked tokens enter circulation or remain controlled, with historical patterns showing Ripple often retains rather than immediately sells released tokens. Q4: How does XRP’s supply differ from other cryptocurrencies? XRP features a fixed 100 billion supply with corporate-managed escrow releases, contrasting with Bitcoin’s mining schedule and Ethereum’s proof-of-stake issuance, representing different approaches to cryptocurrency economics. Q5: Why is blockchain transparency important for escrow releases? Blockchain transparency allows real-time tracking of supply movements, providing market participants with immediate, verifiable data about fundamental factors that might influence cryptocurrency valuation and market dynamics.

Understanding Ripple’s XRP Escrow Mechanism Ripple implemented its escrow system in December 2017 to address market concerns about XRP supply predictability. The company placed 55 billion XRP into a series of escrow accounts, representing approximately 55% of the total 100 billion XRP created at the network’s inception. This escrow arrangement releases 1 billion XRP each month, with Ripple typically returning approximately 80% of each release to new escrow contracts lasting 55 months. The current 400 million XRP unlock represents a portion of this monthly allocation. Historically, Ripple has used these releases for several strategic purposes: On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partnerships: Providing XRP to financial institutions for cross-border payments Market development initiatives: Supporting exchanges and liquidity providers Strategic investments: Funding blockchain projects and partnerships Operational expenses: Covering business costs while minimizing market impact This systematic approach contrasts sharply with other cryptocurrency projects that maintain less transparent supply schedules. The escrow mechanism provides market participants with predictable supply information, potentially reducing volatility concerns associated with sudden large releases. Historical Context and Market Impact Patterns Analysis of previous XRP escrow releases reveals consistent patterns in market behavior. According to data from cryptocurrency analytics platforms, approximately 75% of monthly escrow releases since 2018 have followed similar utilization patterns. Ripple typically sells only a portion of each release on the open market, with the majority allocated to strategic initiatives. The table below illustrates recent escrow release patterns: Date Amount Released Market Context Price Impact (7-day) February 2025 400 million XRP Regulatory clarity period +3.2% January 2025 400 million XRP Institutional adoption news -1.8% December 2024 500 million XRP Year-end liquidity needs +0.5% Market analysts note that escrow releases typically have minimal immediate price impact when they follow predictable patterns. However, larger-than-expected allocations to market sales can create temporary selling pressure. The transparency of Ripple’s approach allows institutional investors to factor these releases into their investment models, potentially reducing surprise-induced volatility. Institutional Perspective on Supply Management Financial institutions considering XRP for payment corridors particularly value the escrow system’s predictability. According to banking technology analysts, predictable supply schedules enable better risk management for cross-border payment solutions. This institutional preference for transparency represents a significant advantage for Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product compared to traditional correspondent banking and some competing cryptocurrency solutions. Regulatory developments have further emphasized the importance of transparent supply management. Following the 2023 summary judgment in the SEC vs. Ripple case, which provided clearer regulatory guidelines for institutional sales, Ripple has maintained its commitment to escrow transparency. This compliance-forward approach aligns with increasing regulatory expectations for cryptocurrency projects serving financial institutions. Technical Implementation and Blockchain Verification The XRP escrow mechanism utilizes the native functionality of the XRP Ledger, which supports time-based escrows through its consensus protocol. Each escrow release executes automatically according to predefined conditions verified by the decentralized validator network. This technical implementation ensures that releases occur exactly as scheduled without requiring manual intervention from Ripple or any single entity. Blockchain analysts verify escrow releases through several methods: Transaction analysis: Examining the specific escrow execution transactions Account monitoring: Tracking Ripple’s treasury wallet movements Supply metrics: Calculating circulating supply changes Validator confirmation: Ensuring network consensus on the release The XRP Ledger’s transparency allows any participant to independently verify escrow releases, contributing to the network’s trust model. This verification capability represents a fundamental advantage of public blockchain technology for institutional adoption scenarios requiring auditability and transparency. Comparative Analysis with Other Cryptocurrency Supply Models Ripple’s escrow approach differs significantly from other major cryptocurrency supply models. Bitcoin employs a predetermined mining schedule with halving events every four years, while Ethereum transitioned to a deflationary model following its merge to proof-of-stake. Other projects utilize various mechanisms including: Vesting schedules: Team and investor allocations released over time Staking rewards: New supply distributed to network validators Treasury controls: Foundation-managed reserves for development Algorithmic adjustments: Supply changes based on protocol rules Each model presents different trade-offs between predictability, decentralization, and adaptability. Ripple’s escrow system prioritizes predictability for institutional users while maintaining sufficient flexibility for strategic initiatives. This balance has proven particularly valuable for payment-focused use cases where liquidity planning requires reliable supply forecasts. Market Liquidity and Price Stability Considerations Liquidity providers and market makers incorporate escrow release schedules into their trading algorithms. The predictable nature of these releases enables more efficient market making, potentially reducing bid-ask spreads and improving execution quality for large transactions. This liquidity enhancement benefits all market participants, from retail traders to institutional payment processors. Price stability following escrow releases depends on multiple factors including overall market conditions, regulatory developments, and adoption milestones. Historical analysis suggests that XRP price movements correlate more strongly with adoption announcements and regulatory clarity than with scheduled escrow releases, particularly when releases follow established patterns and transparent communication. Conclusion The recent 400 million XRP escrow unlock continues Ripple’s transparent supply management strategy that has evolved since 2017. This systematic approach provides market predictability while supporting the company’s institutional partnerships and development initiatives. As cryptocurrency markets mature toward greater institutional participation, transparent supply mechanisms like Ripple’s XRP escrow system represent important infrastructure for regulatory compliance and risk management. The ongoing balance between predictable releases and strategic flexibility will likely remain crucial for XRP’s role in global payment solutions and broader cryptocurrency adoption. FAQs Q1: How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow? Ripple’s escrow system releases 1 billion XRP monthly, with the company typically returning approximately 80% to new escrow contracts. The remaining portion supports business operations and strategic initiatives. Q2: Does Ripple control when escrow releases occur? The XRP Ledger’s escrow functionality executes automatically based on predefined conditions. While Ripple establishes the initial escrow parameters, the actual releases occur through decentralized consensus without requiring company intervention. Q3: How does the escrow system affect XRP’s circulating supply? The escrow mechanism gradually increases circulating supply according to a predictable schedule. This contrasts with mining-based systems where new supply enters circulation through competitive validation processes. Q4: Can market participants verify escrow releases independently? Yes, the XRP Ledger’s transparency allows anyone to examine escrow execution transactions and verify releases through blockchain explorers and analytics tools without relying on company statements. Q5: How do escrow releases impact XRP’s price stability? Historical data suggests scheduled escrow releases have minimal price impact when they follow predictable patterns. Market participants typically incorporate this information into trading models well in advance of actual releases.

Last Friday, exhausted traders witnessed something remarkable, the precious metal plummeted by that entire amount in less than a day. Traders handling metals worldwide had spent recent weeks glued to their monitors overnight. Gold, copper, tin and similar commodities seemed disconnected from typical supply and demand patterns, driven skyward by heavy speculative bets from China. The surge reversed violently. Within hours, one of commodities trading’s most severe crashes unfolded. Friday saw silver plunge 26% , an unprecedented single-day decline. Gold dropped 9%, recording its steepest fall in more than a decade. Copper had already experienced chaos after spiking above $14,500 per ton before collapsing equally fast. News that President Donald Trump intended to appoint Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chairman sparked Friday’s collapse, strengthening the dollar. However, warnings had circulated for weeks that metal valuations had stretched too far and faced inevitable correction. Still, the velocity and magnitude of the downturn left observers breathless, particularly given gold’s substantial market size and liquidity. European and American metal traders abandoned normal schedules, working continuously to avoid missing Asian trading hours where dramatic price movements frequently occurred. Some conducted frantic transactions during transcontinental flights. Attendees at Germany’s largest coin conference last week stood motionless, eyes fixed on mobile devices as the crisis developed. Gold’s ascent began years earlier as central banks accumulated holdings to diversify beyond dollar reserves. The climb accelerated last year when Western investors embraced the debasement trade strategy. Recent weeks witnessed intensified momentum, propelled by Chinese speculative activity, ranging from individual traders to equity funds entering commodity markets, lifting metals to unprecedented peaks. Trend-following algorithmic trading programs amplified the rally further. Momentum trade replaces fundamental analysis Jay Hatfield serves as chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, a hedge fund. “We had identified about three or four weeks ago that it turned into a momentum trade, not a fundamental trade,” he explained to Bloomberg. “We were just riding it, waiting for this type of thing to happen.” Concerns surrounding Federal Reserve independence and geopolitical tensions spanning Venezuela to Iran dominated headlines. The metal rally symbolized declining confidence in dollar stability among certain investors. Mounting enthusiasm drew increasing participants, creating gold and silver purchasing fever across China and Germany. The phenomenon mirrored 1979-1980, modern history’s only comparable period of extreme price volatility. Heraeus operates at maximum production, attempting to satisfy demand, Sperzel noted. “We are sold out in certain bar sizes, weeks in advance and people they still buy,” he said. “People are queuing for hours in front of these shops in order to buy products.” Silver experienced the most dramatic fluctuations . Its market remains relatively compact,current annual supply valued at merely $98 billion compared with gold’s $787 billion. The iShares Silver Trust, the largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund trading under ticker SLV, processed over $40 billion on Friday. This positioned it among Earth’s most actively traded securities. Just months earlier, daily volumes rarely exceeded $2 billion. Options activity, increasingly favored by retail participants recently, reached fever pitch. Reddit discussions documented returns exceeding 1,000% from wagers on silver’s rapid ascent. Major gold and silver funds achieved record call option open interest and volumes lately. SLV call option activity surpassed even the primary Nasdaq 100 technology index tracker. Abundant outstanding call options create squeeze conditions. Dealers scramble to hedge exposures by purchasing underlying assets during price increases, fueling additional upward movement. Tuesday evening, Trump characterized the pressured dollar as “doing great,” igniting final speculative buying. Thursday brought gold to $5,595 per ounce, silver past $121, and copper to $14,527.50. Reversal signs emerged late Thursday as dollar strength returned and gold tumbled abruptly—shedding over $200 per ounce within approximately ten minutes. Chinese profit-taking seals market fate Brief stabilization followed. Then Bloomberg and other outlets reported Trump’s intention to nominate Warsh for Fed leadership. Chinese investors pursued profit-taking rather than continued purchases. Friday’s dramatic selloff took root. Future developments may again hinge on Chinese activity. Shanghai trading commences Sunday evening New York time. Chinese exchange daily limits of 16%-19% on various silver contracts suggest Shanghai valuations require adjustment. Ahead of Lunar New Year, traditionally a strong buying period, the pullback might attract sidelined retail investors seeking entry opportunities. At Shuibei, a significant bullion trading center, silver availability improved somewhat through weekend selling activity, traders reported. Panic selling remains absent, with Shuibei silver maintaining premiums over exchange contracts. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Traders digest the fallout from this crash, but there is much attention on large institutional holders, particularly Michael Saylor’s Strategy, whose massive Bitcoin position is now trading uncomfortably close to its average acquisition cost. Why This Bitcoin Crash Turned Brutal So Quickly The entire crypto industry is currently witnessing one of its most brutal crashes in history, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, about $2.51 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in a single session, placing this event among the 10 largest liquidation cascades the crypto market has ever recorded. For context, the Covid-era crash liquidated about $1.2 billion and the FTX collapse led to around $1.6 billion in liquidations. Crypto Liquidation History. Source: @AshCrypto On X According to Arkham Intelligence, large entities aggressively moved Bitcoin onto exchanges in the hours surrounding the crash. Kraken alone dumped about 17,030 BTC into the market, Binance followed with about 12,147 BTC, and Coinbase added another 9,093 BTC. Wintermute, a major market maker, dumped 3,491 BTC, while wallets labeled as Trump Insider and Bybit dumped 2,543 BTC and 2,471 BTC, respectively. Together, these transfers contributed to a streak of liquidations as positions that saw Bitcoin lose the $80,000 price level without much resistance. Bitcoin’s Notable Outflows. Source: Arkham Intelligence Strategy’s Bitcoin Chest And Where It Stands Now As one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, Strategy has felt the impact of the recent crash more directly than most, leaving its Bitcoin position hovering just above loss territory. The company currently holds 712,647 BTC, valued at $55.72 billion based on current price levels. Those holdings were accumulated at an average price of $76,037 per Bitcoin, putting Strategy only about 1.8% above breakeven following the sell-off. The margin for error has narrowed massively , but the holdings are still technically in profit for now. To put this in context, Strategy’s stash was worth about $81 billion when Bitcoin peaked around $126,000, despite the company holding about 70,000 fewer BTC at the time. It has now been 2,000 days since Strategy formally adopted the Bitcoin Standard. That decision has progressively connected the company’s financial performance to Bitcoin’s price action. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $78,500. A further decline of 3% from current levels would be enough to push Strategy’s Bitcoin position into the red on paper and change the narrative from unrealized gains to unrealized losses. In that scenario, the company may soon find itself defending its Bitcoin strategy in a bearish environment.

Many older projects are steadily losing ground as they fail to deliver new tools or meaningful upgrades. At the same time, a new crypto name is beginning to surface on the radar of experienced investors. This project spent months in near obscurity, developing in the background. Now, it is stepping into the spotlight. While top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to drop in value, this altcoin is showing early signs of a potentially massive breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It is developed around the Ethereum network making it very secure and trustworthy. The platform has two broad methods of dealing with loans. The initial one is Peer-to-Contract (P2C). In this market, customers deposit their crypto in communal pools to get yield. The second model is the Peer-to-peer (P2P). It is in the case of direct loans between users. It can have custom loans and rate of borrowing. The users have the ability to do their own terms on niche or volatile assets. The protocol resorts to the Loan-to-Value (LTV) system to ensure the safety of everything. In case of the stable assets, LTV is up to 75%. This implies that you will be able to borrow $750 on the security of $1,000. In order to insure the mechanism, there is an automated bot that deals with liquidations. When the collateral value goes too low, the bot will close the loan in order to safeguard the lenders. MUTM Demand and Growth This project has received an incredible response in the market. Mutuum Finance has formally raised in excess of $20.2 million. The community is also large as there are over 19,000 holders on board. The amount of total MUTM supply is limited to 4 billion tokens. The group has set aside 45.5% of this allocation to the presale. This amounts to 1.82 billion tokens to early adopters. To date, more than 840 million tokens were sold. This is almost a half of the total presale supply. MUTM has been growing at a steady and good pace. It opened at a low price of $0.01 in Phase 1 beginning 2025. Today, in presale phase 7, the price is $0.04. This is a 3x growth. The launch price is officially pegged at $0.06. It is an indication of a 500% MUTM appreciation on launch to Phase 1 investors. Technical Milestone and Price Prediction The largest news of the project is the release of the V1 protocol into the Sepolia testnet. This occurred in early January 2026. It demonstrates that the technology is practical and actual. The pools of USDT, ETH, LINK, WBTC and the mtToken mechanism can now be tested by the user. Prior to this launch, the team completed a significant audit by Halborn Security . They also score high of 90/100 according to CertiK. These audits indicate that the code is professional and safe to huge sums of money. The future price of MUTM is very positive to analysts. It is believed that the present price of $0.04 is a giant discount. There are some experts who have proposed a short-term price of $0.25-$ 0.45 at the time when the mainnet is launched. In case more users use the protocol, the price might be at $1.00 in 2027. This would be a x25 fold increase of the current level. The Path to Mass Adoption Mutuum Finance also has even greater plans in the future. The group is planning on a native stablecoin. The protocol assets will provide over-collateralization to this coin. It will enable borrowers to borrow an asset pegged to the dollar in a cheap manner. The project also has an expansion of the Layer-2 networks. This will render transactions to be extremely quick and nearly free. These attributes are paramount to success in the long run. They render the platform user-friendly to all, not only professionals. And this is the final offer to get MUTM at 50% off the initial price. The chance to enter at this valuation is dwindling as Phase 7 is approaching completion. To the people who want practical utility and a high growth potential, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as the best altcoin in 2026.

The asset, which launched just over a year ago, doesn’t seem to have found a bottom and marked yet another all-time low. Recall that PI was actually trading quite promisingly during the November crash when BTC, ETH, and most larger-cap alts were suffering. It remained well above $0.20 and even challenged $0.30 at one point, but to no avail. The following month and a half were quite sluggish, and PI failed to move alongside the market in either direction. However, its $0.20 floor gave in mid-January and has been a straight-on calamity since then. CryptoPotato repeatedly reported on the asset’s new lows. It finally regained some traction on Saturday morning, but the market-wide crash hours later drove it south hard yet again. This time, the bears took it to its latest ATL of $0.1527 (CoinGecko data). This meant a 94.8% decline in less than a year since it launched. Nevertheless, its community continues to be hopeful about a turnaround. Pi News, arguably the most popular news-related channel outside the official Pi Network account, outlined that “PI is not just a coin, it’s a movement.” They speculated about some sort of “new era” that is “about to begin,” claiming that Pi Network started on mobile, but it’s now evolving into a global digital currency. A NEW ERA IS ABOUT TO BEGIN Pi Network What started on mobile is evolving into a global digital currency. Built by people. Secured by community. Powered by belief.

Regulators are rewriting rules of prediction markets as politics and sports drive activity The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it will write new rules for the multi-billion-dollar prediction industry. Chairman Michael Selig said, “It is time for clear rules and a clear understanding that the CFTC supports lawful innovation in these markets.” He added, “I will continue to support the responsible development of event contract markets.” Kalshi Inc. and the US arm of Polymarket operate CFTC-regulated exchanges that let users trade outcomes tied to elections and the Super Bowl. Activity surged even as some state gaming regulators pushed back. Sports contracts drove most of Kalshi’s volume, based on data from Dune Analytics. The Trump family also entered the space. Donald Trump Jr. became an advisor to both Kalshi and Polymarket. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. announced plans for its own marketplace. None of the firms commented on the rule changes. Selig withdrew a 2024 proposal issued under former chairman Rostin Behnam that sought to ban sports and political contracts. He also pulled a 2025 staff advisory tied to litigation. “It has instead contributed to uncertainty in our markets,” Selig said. He added that the CFTC would defend its exclusive authority over commodity derivatives. Selig took office in December and spoke alongside Paul Atkins, the SEC chairman, at a crypto regulation panel. Both agencies said they will work together while lawmakers debate oversight. The Senate Agriculture Committee passed a bill giving the CFTC authority over spot commodities like Bitcoin. A companion bill in the Senate Banking Committee stalled over limits on exchange rewards. Formal legislation is still required, Selig said.

Not only did that rally fail to materialize, but the bears woke up in the middle of winter and initiated several consecutive leg-downs that ultimately crashed BTC to a multi-month low. With that, the overall sentiment plummeted as well. Fear and Greed Goes South The popular Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index gathers data from various sources, such as overall volatility, market momentum, BTC dominance, and social media comments, to determine the current investor and community sentiment toward the largest digital asset. Price fluctuations and market momentum are responsible for 50% of the final result, which ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). This makes it rather logical that the metric has plunged lately. As the graph below will clearly demonstrate, extreme fear dominates the current market phase. It has been below 30 since January 22, when BTC’s correction began. After Saturday’s market-wide crash, in which over $2.5 billion worth of leveraged positions were wiped out , the index has gone to 14 – the lowest levels since mid-December. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me If you have missed the events that transpired on Saturday, here’s a quick recap . BTC had recovered some ground to $84,000 after the Thursday crash, but then suddenly plunged to $75,500, which became its lowest price tag since last April. This meant that BTC had dropped by $20,000 since January 18, when it stood at $95,500. The altcoins followed suit yesterday with massive declines, as many marked lows not seen in over a year. Blessing in Disguise? Before we determine that BTC is dead again, according to the Fear and Greed Index, let’s take you back to the immortal investment words by one of the greats, Warren Buffett, who has said in the past that people should be greedy when others are fearful, and vice versa. If he is to be believed, and history is on his side on this, now would be the time to be greedy and enter the ecosystem, right? Previous occasions on which BTC (or other assets) have experienced wild swings in investor sentiment have led to almost immediate reversals. Robert Kiyosaki also weighed in on this topic, outlining the differences between the rich and the poor. He believes the first group goes on a shopping spree when the financial markets “are on sale” (meaning, a crash), while the second tends to sell and run. DIfFERENCE BETWEEN Rich People and Poor People: When Walmart has a SALE poor people rush in and buy, buy, buy. Yet when the Financial Asset Market has a sale….a.k.a…..CRASH… the poor sell and run….while the rich rush in….and buy, buy, buy.

Precious metals punched through records, then gave back much of their gains, while major crypto tokens barely budged. That contrast is what has people talking. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Gold’s Sudden Market Jump According to posts on X by market commentators, gold’s capitalization rose by roughly $2.2 trillion inside a single trading session. That move pushed the metal into an eye-catching valuation that dwarfs many crypto assets. That figure equals nearly 20 times the entire market cap of XRP, which sits close to $103 billion based on recent prices. Bitcoin, valued near $1.77 trillion at the same time, was also overtaken by gold’s one-day gain. The scale of the move stunned many, even those used to seeing large swings in commodities. The raw math is hard to ignore: a small percent move in an enormous market turns into huge dollar figures fast. Gold has added $2.2 trillion to its market cap just today$BTC its market cap is $1.78 trillion pic.twitter.com/WUBlUrzwpl — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) January 28, 2026 Why The Numbers Can Mislead Several traders replied that the headline number is a quirk of scale. Because the gold market is so big, even modest percentage swings create massive nominal changes. This point was made repeatedly in replies to the initial posts. Market depth and the sheer size of holdings mean that price shifts are not always driven by fresh trillions of dollars flowing in or out. For smaller assets, a much smaller pile of capital can push price sharply. That’s the key difference when comparing bullion to crypto. Silver’s Rapid Reversal Reports have disclosed that silver’s run was especially volatile. After a blistering ascent, silver fell sharply, wiping away a large slice of its peak gains within days. Such whipsaws show how quickly sentiment can flip when traders rush to lock in profits or cut losses. The move illustrates how headline statistics — peak valuations and sudden drops — can create a distorted sense of permanent change when markets are actually very fluid. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Bleed $1.80 Billion As Metals Rally Heats Up Crypto’s Position And The Mirror Math XRP and Bitcoin did not match metals’ fireworks. Based on current figures, some commentators ran simple scenarios: if XRP matched silver’s percentage increase, its price would be several times higher than today; if Bitcoin mirrored gold’s surge, it would be far above current levels. Those calculations are described as purely illustrative. Reports say they are mathematical exercises rather than forecasts, since many factors — token supply, investor appetite, regulation, and liquidity — will determine real outcomes.

Central Bank Digital Currencies are government-backed digital cash designed to combine technological innovation with regulated monetary control. With about 11 nations already launching retail CBDC initiatives, understanding the distinctions between these stable digital assets and traditional cryptocurrencies is essential. This article explores the fundamentals of CBDCs, highlighting the practical differences, global developments, and evolving risks that shape their role in modern financial systems. Key Takeaways PointDetailsCBDC DefinitionCentral Bank Digital Currencies are government-backed digital alternatives to traditional cash, leveraging blockchain technology with centralized control.Retail vs. WholesaleRetail CBDCs aim for public accessibility, while wholesale CBDCs are designed for interbank transactions, each focusing on unique economic objectives.Global ImplementationDifferent countries showcase varied CBDC strategies, with advanced economies developing comprehensive frameworks and emerging markets exploring experimental models.Potential RisksCBDCs pose risks such as cybersecurity threats and financial instability, necessitating robust legal frameworks and risk mitigation strategies. Central bank digital currency fundamentals Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represent a transformative approach to national monetary systems, offering digital alternatives to traditional cash and payment mechanisms. These government-backed digital currencies are designed to leverage blockchain technology while maintaining centralized monetary control. Advanced digital money frameworks are reshaping how nations conceptualize financial infrastructure. CBDCs differ fundamentally from cryptocurrencies in several critical dimensions: Government Backed: Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are directly issued and regulated by national central banks Stable Value: Maintains consistent valuation tied to national currency Legal Tender: Carries same legal status as physical currency Controlled Supply: Central banks determine total circulation and monetary policy The global landscape of CBDC development reveals significant momentum. Currently, multiple nations are exploring or piloting digital currency initiatives, with approximately 11 countries having already launched retail CBDC programs. Cross-border payment innovations represent a primary motivation, targeting reduced transaction costs and enhanced transfer speeds. From a technological perspective, CBDCs can be implemented through various architectural models. Some designs prioritize complete anonymity, while others focus on transaction traceability for regulatory compliance. The underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology enables secure, transparent monetary exchanges while maintaining centralized monetary policy control. Pro tip: Financial professionals and investors should closely monitor CBDC developments, as these digital currencies could fundamentally transform global payment ecosystems and monetary strategies. Retail vs. wholesale CBDC distinctions Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are strategically developed in two primary models: retail and wholesale, each serving distinct financial ecosystem requirements. Financial infrastructure variations demonstrate how digital currency design can target different economic objectives and user groups. Retail CBDC Characteristics: Accessible to general public Designed for everyday consumer transactions Aims to enhance financial inclusion Provides digital alternative to physical cash Supports small-value payment scenarios Wholesale CBDC Characteristics: Exclusively for financial institutions Facilitates large-value interbank settlements Focuses on improving financial market infrastructure Enables faster cross-border payment mechanisms Supports complex institutional transaction requirements Practical CBDC implementation strategies reveal significant differences in design philosophy between retail and wholesale models. Retail CBDCs prioritize user accessibility and broad economic participation, while wholesale CBDCs concentrate on enhancing settlement efficiency and reducing transactional friction within professional financial networks. The technological architecture underlying these digital currencies varies substantially.
