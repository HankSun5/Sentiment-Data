49998094,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=783532,1755040993,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49998094.jpeg,Nvidia becomes biggest single-stock weight in S&P 500 history,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-biggest-single-stock-weight/,"Nvidia now holds more than 8% of the S&P 500, the largest weight for any one stock in the index since records began in 1981, according to data from CNBC. The company’s market value closed Monday at about $4.5 trillion, giving it unprecedented sway over the benchmark. This historic share of the index comes after a massive run in its stock price, powered by demand for its chips since late 2022. The rally has been relentless. Nvidia’s stock soared 239% in 2023, climbed 171% in 2024, and has already risen 36% in 2025 through Monday’s close. Over the past three months alone, as the market recovered from April’s tariff-related drop, the stock jumped 56%. Nearly nine out of ten Wall Street analysts covering the company have it rated as a buy. The stock now trades at 59 times its trailing 12-month earnings, based on FactSet figures, reflecting investor demand for its position in the AI market. China risks and political agreements D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria, who has a neutral rating on Nvidia, set a $135 price target that implies a 26% fall from current levels. He pointed to China as a major risk. Official reports show low double-digit sales into China, but Luria noted that many other shipments end up there indirectly, either to Chinese firms based overseas or through resellers who move the products into the country. “It’s a big part of their sales that is at risk from either further action by the U.S. or by further restrictions from China,” he said. Over the weekend, the Financial Times reported that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices reached an agreement with the U.S. government to give 15% of revenue from chips sold in China in exchange for export licenses. Wells Fargo estimated that the deal could push Nvidia’s growth higher by more than 20%. Luria said the arrangement could allow sales of the B30 chip later this year or in 2026, but stressed that the outcome remains uncertain. Infrastructure bottlenecks and rising competition Even with demand at record highs, Nvidia’s output could be limited by infrastructure. Luria said customers now face delays not because of chip shortages, but because of data center requirements. Operators need enough power grid capacity and HVAC systems to run the chips, and those resources are already strained. He warned that rising electricity demand from data centers is so steep that power availability itself could slow Nvidia’s growth. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, raised another concern; competition. Amazon Web Services has been building alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs to cut AI training costs. Boockvar noted that Nvidia’s current 75% gross profit margin will be hard to keep as the semiconductor business remains competitive and cyclical. He added that some of Nvidia’s biggest customers are also working toward becoming direct rivals, which could eventually erode its dominance in AI infrastructure. Nvidia’s unmatched influence on the S&P 500 now ties the index’s performance closely to its share price. While its rise has been powered by demand for AI chips, the threats from political tensions, energy constraints, and aggressive competitors remain firmly in play.

The district, which is home to many of East Asia’s richest people, has joined others in cracking down on residents who fail to pay their local taxes. But it has also begun seizing crypto from residents who fail to pay other local levies, including property taxes. Gangnam Crypto Crackdown Kyunghyang Shinmun reported that the district has recouped 200 million won ($144,057) in unpaid taxes in the first half of the year by confiscating coins. Garosu-gil, in Seoul’s Gangnam District. (Image: Im Do-bin [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In most cases, the district has done this by cross-checking its data on unpaid taxes against crypto wallet data from the nation’s five fiat-trading crypto exchanges . When the district finds coins in tax evaders’ wallets, it responds by freezing the funds. It then delivers an ultimatum: Pay up, or we will liquidate your coins. In many cases, crypto-keen residents rush to settle their tax bills before the district sells off their tokens. The district is home to most of South Korea’s biggest crypto and blockchain firms, as well as its most prominent crypto investors. A Gangnam tax management official told the media outlet: “Many residents of Gangnam own a significant amount of virtual assets. When we started seizing virtual assets, we saw a significant rise in voluntary payments of outstanding tax bills.” Thousands of unregistered children in Korea lack state registration, hindering access to essential services and education. https://t.co/nvfoRXbsvk — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 11, 2025 Crypto Whales Pleading Poverty? The district gave examples of cases where crypto owners had used Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens to conceal their wealth. In one case, a resident who “had been complaining angrily about not having enough money to pay taxes” was found with a wallet containing “more than enough” crypto to pay their 120 million won ($86,495) property tax bill. In another instance, a resident with 19 local tax bills, many of which dated back to 2020, claimed he had “no money to pay” the bills. But when Gangnam tax officials discovered and froze his crypto, the resident “voluntarily paid 1.4 million won ($1,000) in arrears.” New rules governing corporate crypto ownership will soon allow government organs like Gangnam District to open crypto wallets. This will make the liquidation process easier and more effective, tax officials claim. The head of the Gangnam District government, Jo Seong-myeong, said: “Regardless of the amount, if a resident is a long-term tax evader, we will seize their virtual assets. We will do this without exception.” Furthermore, the Seoul Metropolitan Government says it is creating a cooperative system with autonomous districts. This will allow tax officials throughout the city to conduct bulk searches and seizures of tax evaders’ crypto funds.

The deal will let tax officials identify and seize crypto from both active and dormant crypto wallets. Korbit says it is actively cooperating with Busan Customs Office data requests “in accordance with relevant laws and administrative procedures.” A Korbit spokesperson explained: “As the cryptoasset ecosystem becomes increasingly institutionalized, collaboration with public institutions is becoming increasingly important. Korbit will continue to provide institutional and technical support. We will help establish a transparent system for paying tax.” The post Seoul’s Gangnam District Targets Tax Evaders in Revamped Crypto Confiscation Drive appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|crypto tax|South Korea,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-12 23:30:00

Nawfal, host of the popular ‘Roundtable’ program on X, shared his projected price targets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana by December 31, 2025, based on the assumption that the current bull run continues. Bitcoin Positioned to Lead the Rally Central to Nawfal’s forecast is Bitcoin, which he believes could reach $225,000 by the end of the year. This target would represent a market capitalization exceeding $4.4 trillion, placing Bitcoin ahead of the world’s largest publicly traded companies and second only to gold in total valuation. My predictions for December 31st: $BTC – $225,000 $ETH – $10,000 $SOL – $1,000 $XRP – $10 What do you think @grok ? — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) August 11, 2025 Nawfal’s outlook suggests that such a move in Bitcoin would create a favorable environment for other major cryptocurrencies, potentially enabling several to achieve new record highs. Analysts often highlight Bitcoin’s role in setting the tone for market sentiment, and in this scenario, its rise could provide the foundation for substantial gains in the broader market. XRP Could Approach $10 In his year-end scenario, Nawfal expects XRP to reach $10, which would nearly triple its current price of $3.18 . At this level, XRP’s market capitalization would exceed $500 billion, further strengthening its position among the most valuable digital assets. While this projection is below the $30 targets suggested by some highly optimistic analysts such as Carl Moon, it would still mark the first time XRP has traded in double digits. Supporters of this outlook often cite potential catalysts such as institutional adoption, exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals , and increased integration of Ripple’s payment technologies. Some industry figures expect even greater growth if these factors align quickly. For example, market commentator Zach Rector has argued that ETF inflows following approval, combined with the resolution of Ripple’s legal challenges , could push XRP toward $20 in 2026. Analyst EGRAG predicts XRP will range between $7 and $30 during this cycle, with a base expectation of $20. Conversely, more cautious voices, such as Aaron Arnold, place a $5 price target on XRP by early 2026, assuming Bitcoin reaches $150,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum and Solana Price Forecasts For Ethereum, Nawfal projects a climb to $10,000 by December 2025. The asset is currently valued at $4,400 , marking a 45% gain over the past month and its highest level in three years. Achieving Nawfal’s target would place Ethereum’s market capitalization above $1.2 trillion. While some believe Ethereum could potentially rise to $25,000 this year, the $10,000 level remains a widely discussed and more conservative benchmark among market analysts. Nawfal’s prediction for Solana places the token at $1,000 by year’s end. This would represent a gain of over 475% from its present value of $177 . Solana’s all-time high of nearly $300 was set seven months ago, and while the token has not revisited that level, it has advanced 24% in the past two months. If the $1,000 target is reached, Solana’s market capitalization would stand at approximately $540 billion, comparable to some of the largest global corporations. Nawfal’s projections suggest that 2025 could bring unprecedented valuations across several leading cryptocurrencies if bullish momentum persists. His scenario relies on Bitcoin maintaining market leadership while other assets benefit from heightened investor confidence, institutional inflows, and potential regulatory advancements.

49998060,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=174363,1755041447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/49998060.jpeg,Bitcoin Flirts with $123K — Is $140K the Next Big Stop?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-flirts-with-123k-is-140k-the-next-big-stop/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is inching toward a milestone that just months ago felt ambitious — a new all-time high near $123,000. The mood across trading desks and crypto Telegram groups is almost electric, with one question dominating: can the king of crypto leap to $140K before year-end? The rally isn’t running on retail hype alone. Institutional players — hedge funds, pension giants, and Wall Street’s biggest asset managers — have been moving money into Bitcoin at a pace we haven’t seen before. On-chain trackers show billions in fresh inflows, signalling that traditional finance isn’t just testing the waters anymore; they’re swimming with both arms. Wall Street’s Newfound Urgency Part of this rush comes from a surge in demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. With U.S. regulators loosening their grip, firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have been scaling up positions aggressively. That extra liquidity has given the market a sturdier backbone, making traders more comfortable stacking BTC at higher price levels. Then there’s the macro picture. A widely expected Federal Reserve rate cut could act as lighter fluid for the rally. Historically, cheaper borrowing pushes capital toward high-return, risk-on plays — and right now, Bitcoin is wearing that crown. The $140K Question Right now, traders have their eyes fixed on the $140,000 psychological level. Technical charts are showing a bullish MACD crossover and strong RSI support, hinting at more upside if momentum continues. Still, it’s worth noting that profit-taking phases and sudden macroeconomic shifts could stir up short-term volatility along the way. If the rally stays intact, though, breaking $140K could unlock a fresh wave of FOMO from both retail and institutional investors. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Watchlists While Bitcoin dominates the conversation, some investors are positioning for what often comes next — altcoin season. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been quietly building momentum in its presale, drawing attention from early-bird buyers who see potential for outsized gains once BTC’s rally spills into the broader market. With utility-driven tokenomics, an engaged community, and well-timed entry into the cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been floated by market watchers as a possible high-return play. Some projections — while speculative — put post-launch ROI potential in the 70x+ range. If Bitcoin breaks $123K and edges toward $140K, expect this kind of presale project to pop up on a lot more radars. In past market rallies, capital often trickled from BTC into mid-cap and emerging tokens, creating outsized opportunities for early movers. If Bitcoin does push past $123K and makes a serious run toward $140K, the stage could be set for MAGACOIN FINANCE to grab attention from both retail traders and bigger players hunting the next high-growth token.

Analyst Lays Out the Path",https://cryptopotato.com/ethereums-next-stop-5210-or-6946-analyst-lays-out-the-path/,"Ethereum (ETH) has logged nearly 20% gains in the past week as it outperformed many crypto assets. After reclaiming the $4,200 price level for the first time since 2021, ETH has managed to stay above this level. Beyond price action, on-chain data reveals a telling change in how the leading altcoin’s most dedicated holders are behaving. From “Capitulation” To “Belief” There has been a significant shift in sentiment among long-term Ethereum holders over the past four months. In fact, crypto analyst Ali Martinez found that this cohort of investors is moving from a phase of “capitulation” to one of “belief.” Such a transformation means that investors who previously showed signs of surrender or likely selling at a loss or exiting positions amid market uncertainty are now demonstrating renewed confidence in ETH’s future trajectory. Historically, transitions from capitulation to belief have coincided with the early stages of bullish cycles. This is because reduced selling pressure and stronger holding behavior can create a more favorable supply-demand dynamic for price appreciation. With sentiment improving, the focus now shifts to ETH’s next major resistance levels. Martinez has now identified $5,210 and $6,946 as Ethereum’s next potential price targets based on Pricing Bands, a technical tool used to project key resistance and support zones. These levels represent significant milestones that, if reached, could signal ETH’s progression into a new price discovery phase. The $5,210 mark is likely to serve as the first major hurdle, where traders may anticipate increased profit-taking. However, a successful breakout could set the stage toward the higher $6,946 target. Market sentiment isn’t the only thing improving. Ethereum’s fundamentals are also showing signs of strength. New Smart Contracts Set Historic Record CryptoQuant revealed that Ethereum’s 180-day moving average of new smart contracts has hit an all-time high this week. This milestone points to strong, sustained developer engagement rather than a short-lived surge. The momentum comes three months after Ethereum’s 2025 Pectra upgrade, which has boosted scalability and slashed gas fees. These improvements have fueled real-world adoption, as evidenced by DeFi platform Aave exceeding $10 billion in daily volume and NFT marketplace OpenSea processing over one million transactions daily. Such heightened smart contract creation has often preceded ETH price rallies, which makes this trend a potential leading indicator for market performance. With record contract activity and enhanced network capabilities, Ethereum appears poised for a development-driven growth cycle. “Ethereum’s developer economy is in overdrive, with Pectra acting as the ignition. Should this pace continue, the fundamentals point toward stronger activity and valuations in the coming months.” The post Ethereum’s Next Stop: $5,210 or $6,946?

Right now, traders are comparing the Cardano (ADA) price forecast and the Dogecoin (DOGE) growth potential against a newcomer that’s grabbing headlines — Cold Wallet. While ADA and DOGE offer proven market presence, Cold Wallet’s projected 4,900% ROI puts it in a different category entirely when discussing the best crypto to invest in now. Both ADA and DOGE are seeing bullish momentum. Cardano is holding a breakout structure, potentially heading toward $2.00 in 2025, while Dogecoin’s buyers are targeting $0.30 after a strong technical run. But even these promising setups pale in comparison to other crypto’s ROI projections and unique reward-based utility. Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast The Cardano (ADA) price forecast for 2025 is signaling potential upside of around 150% from current levels. Trading near $0.81, ADA has been building on a bullish structure after bouncing off $0.7760 support. Analysts see $1.00 as the first major psychological barrier, with a break above opening the path toward $2.00 later in the year if momentum continues. Institutional interest and whale accumulation have been growing, supported by ADA’s expanding ecosystem. The coin’s resilience through market swings reinforces its appeal to cautious investors. Technical signals, including sustained higher lows, point toward a bullish continuation pattern that could deliver steady returns. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in now with a balance of safety and potential, ADA offers a strong case. However, the Cardano (ADA) price forecast still points to returns far more modest than Cold Wallet’s target. Dogecoin (DOGE) Growth Potential The Dogecoin (DOGE) growth potential remains firmly in the spotlight. Trading around $0.25, DOGE is pushing toward the $0.30 mark as bullish sentiment gains traction. Technical indicators like golden crosses and ascending channels are reinforcing this move, with some analysts even suggesting $0.35 as an achievable target in the near term. DOGE’s strength lies in its community-driven rallies and ability to capitalize on market sentiment shifts. The coin often experiences fast surges during periods of hype, making it a favorite among traders seeking volatility. While the Dogecoin (DOGE) growth potential is attractive for short-term traders, it lacks the sustained high-ROI trajectory offered by others crypto. In the context of the best crypto to invest in now, DOGE offers excitement but not the same scale of projected returns. Cold Wallet’s 4,900% ROI Edge Cold Wallet is currently priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17 of its presale, with $5.9M raised and 698.39M tokens sold. With a projected launch price of $0.3517, early buyers are looking at an extraordinary 4,900% ROI. This potential dwarfs the Cardano (ADA) price forecast and the Dogecoin (DOGE) growth potential, making it a standout in the best crypto to invest in now debate. The $CWT token powers a self-custody wallet designed to reward users for on-chain activity. Cashback rewards of up to 100% apply to gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp transactions. This makes Cold Wallet not only an investment opportunity but also a functional tool for active crypto users. Its tokenomics are built for sustainability: 40% of the supply is allocated to the presale, 25% to rewards, 12% to liquidity, 10% to ecosystem development, 7% to the team and advisors, and 6% to the treasury. This distribution supports long-term value while fueling growth incentives. Looking ahead, Cold Wallet plans to integrate Layer 2 or custom scaling solutions to deliver zero-gas rewards and instant interactions. This infrastructure ambition reinforces its case as the best crypto to invest in now, offering both high ROI potential and lasting utility for the market. The Final Verdict Cardano offers a disciplined growth outlook, with the Cardano (ADA) price forecast pointing toward steady gains if bullish momentum holds. Dogecoin, driven by market enthusiasm, continues to deliver bursts of upside, with the Dogecoin (DOGE) growth potential appealing to traders who thrive on volatility. Yet neither matches Cold Wallet’s projected 4,900% ROI.

Related Reading: XRP ABC Wave Shows How High The Price Will Go If This Structure Holds Daily trading volumes soared 208% to $12.4 billion after the settlement, with analysts estimating a 95% chance of ETF approval by October 2025. However, price action suggests the euphoria may be cooling. In the 24 hours ending August 12, XRP slipped 4% from $3.19 to $3.13, despite hitting an intraday peak of $3.32. Heavy selling during the 19:00 hour, totaling 73.87 million in volume, indicates large holders are locking in profits. While support has held at $3.12, resistance remains firm at $3.27–$3.32. Bearish Fractal Signals Potential 45% Drop Technical analysts are eyeing a concerning development on XRP’s two-week chart: a bearish divergence where price makes higher highs but the relative strength index (RSI) prints lower highs. This setup mirrors conditions from the 2017–2018 market peak, which preceded a brutal multi-month selloff. If the pattern repeats, XRP could slide toward its 50-period exponential moving average near $1.64, roughly 45% below current prices, before finding meaningful support. Interim demand may emerge around $1.90–$2.00, but the bearish fractal suggests momentum is fading. Such a correction wouldn’t necessarily end the broader bull market but could shake out overleveraged traders, reset sentiment, and set the stage for a more sustainable uptrend later. XRP's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Can Bulls Invalidate the Bearish XRP Setup? Bulls see a different path. XRP is testing the $3.55 resistance level, which capped the 2018 rally, and has broken out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Clearing $3.55 with strong volume could open the door to $4.41 and potentially $5.68, especially if U.S. regulators approve an XRP ETF and whales shift from distribution to accumulation. Ripple’s focus on long-term infrastructure, CBDC partnerships, and real-world asset tokenization could underpin fundamental demand even if short-term price action turns choppy.

BlockDAG (BDAG), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX) are among those projects. Each has taken a different approach, from community-driven ecosystems to research-focused development and high-speed blockchain performance, but they share a common trait: long-term relevance in a market often obsessed with short-term gains. BlockDAG has turned heads with rapid presale growth and an active user base. SHIB’s community keeps expanding its reach. Cardano maintains its reputation for careful, research-based upgrades. Avalanche continues to build a high-performance environment for decentralized apps and enterprise-level solutions. These qualities are shaping them into the top altcoins for future growth. 1. BlockDAG Becomes One of the Biggest Presales in Crypto’s History BlockDAG’s rise has been powered by a presale structure that attracts committed participants. Features like its Buyer Battles have encouraged substantial allocations, creating a foundation of strong holders from the start. This approach signals long-term confidence and lowers the risk of early sell-offs when public trading begins. The project’s numbers reinforce its standing. The presale has brought in $371.5 million so far, selling more than 25 billion BDAG coins. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, reflecting a 2,660% increase from Batch 1. With the launch price set at $0.05 and an immediate post-launch target of $1, current buyers could see returns of 3,522%. Those who joined in Batch 1 have already reached that 2,660% ROI compared to the Batch 29 price. With over 200,000 holders and a growing developer base, BlockDAG is shaping its network for long-term stability. The presence of large-scale participants creates resilience and positions BDAG as one of the top altcoins to hold heading into the next market cycle. 2. Shiba Inu Strengthens Its Ecosystem Shiba Inu remains a prominent name in discussions about top altcoins thanks to its large, loyal community. Developments like Shibarium, a layer-2 network, aim to speed up transactions and cut costs. While SHIB’s price can still be volatile due to its supply, its use cases in DeFi and NFTs give it more substance than its meme coin origins suggest. Supporters believe SHIB’s expanding ecosystem will make it more functional and relevant over time, which could help it compete with other top altcoins in the long run. 3. Cardano Maintains a Steady, Research-Driven Path Cardano’s slow and methodical approach has helped it remain in the conversation about top altcoins for years. Built on a proof-of-stake system, ADA is designed for both efficiency and scalability. Its peer-reviewed updates ensure each new feature is rigorously tested before release, reducing the risk of flaws. The network’s smart contract capabilities have grown gradually, supporting decentralized applications and DeFi projects. This careful, research-driven path appeals to those who prefer stability over quick, risky expansion, keeping ADA relevant among the top altcoins for the long term. 4. Avalanche Blends Speed with Enterprise Appeal Avalanche has secured its place among top altcoins by delivering high throughput and near-instant transaction finality. Its subnet framework allows customized blockchain deployments, making it attractive to both developers and enterprises seeking tailored solutions. As partnerships expand and more projects join the ecosystem, AVAX’s demand could grow significantly. The combination of speed, flexibility, and scalability gives Avalanche the qualities needed to stay competitive among the top altcoins in both consumer and enterprise markets. Final Word on the Top Altcoins to Watch While the crypto market moves quickly, projects that attract and keep committed holders often outperform over time. BlockDAG’s presale numbers, stable participant base, and ROI potential make it a standout in the current group of top altcoins. SHIB benefits from unmatched community support, ADA continues its steady evolution, and AVAX delivers performance that meets enterprise demands. For anyone assessing top altcoins with a mix of innovation and staying power, these four deserve close attention heading into the next cycle.

On-chain data shows that the 200 million ADA tokens changed hands in large-scale purchases, lifting whale holdings to 10.3% of total supply. Analysts point out that this mirrors the 2021 accumulation pattern that preceded ADA’s parabolic rally. The move comes as Cardano exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval odds have surged from 60% to 75%, according to Polymarket data . If granted, such approval could open the door for pension funds, hedge funds, and other institutional players to gain easy exposure to Cardano, a development that could significantly amplify demand. Technical Picture Points to a Potential ADA Breakout Currently, ADA trades near $0.78 after a brief pullback from last week’s rally above $0.80. The $0.82–$0.83 resistance zone remains the key short-term barrier. A decisive break above it could send ADA toward $0.93, with the psychological $1 mark in focus. Beyond that, analysts have floated $2 as a longer-term target if momentum accelerates. Support remains strong at $0.70, where ADA has consistently bounced since mid-2023. Higher lows on the weekly chart suggest accumulation, and open interest in ADA derivatives has reached $1.44 billion, one of the highest levels in months. While this surge signals growing trader participation, it also sets the stage for heightened volatility. Technical indicators remain balanced, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near neutral, leaving room for further upside. Moving averages on the 20-day and 50-day timeframes still point to a constructive trend. Perfect Storm Brewing for Cardano (ADA) The convergence of whale accumulation, rising ETF approval odds, and supportive technicals has many traders calling this a “perfect storm” for Cardano. Market analyst The Cryptomist suggests that if ADA can clear its current resistance, it could trigger a chain reaction of buying similar to the 2021 run. Still, traders remain cautious, noting that failed attempts at $0.83 could lead to a retest of $0.70 or even $0.60. For now, the balance between support and resistance is holding, but pressure is building. If the ETF green light arrives and whales maintain their buying spree, ADA could be on the verge of one of its most significant breakouts in years.

The exercise aims to illustrate the scale of price movement that even a modest portion of that historic rally would produce today, and to highlight the market-cap implications of such an event. XRP’s most dramatic appreciation occurred during the 2017–2018 bull market. The token rose from about $0.005 in March 2017 to a peak recorded on Bitstamp near $3.31 in January 2018. The cumulative increase over that period is commonly expressed as roughly 66,100%, a measure frequently referenced when analysts discuss potential fractal repeats or partial recurrences of that cycle. Why XRP Fell Short in 2020–2021 During the 2020–2021 altcoin surge, many rival tokens achieved new highs, but XRP did not participate to the same extent. Market observers attribute that underperformance largely to regulatory and exchange-related limitations, notably delisting and the state-side enforcement action initiated against Ripple in December 2020. Those developments constrained liquidity and institutional engagement for XRP during a period when broader market conditions were favorable. Now that Ripple and the SEC have both moved to withdraw their appeals , many view the legal dispute as effectively resolved, leaving XRP without the overhang that previously limited its market potential. The 10% Fractal Scenario and Price Projections Digital Asset Investor examines what would happen if XRP reproduced just 10 percent of its 2017 rally. Based on current market prices, this scenario would place XRP at approximately $212. In an alternative case, if the rally began from $0.50 in November 2024, a point some analysts believe marks the start of a 2017-style fractal, the result would be around $33.55. A three-digit XRP price would carry profound implications for market capitalization. Industry commentators have estimated that a $212 price would imply a market value on the order of $12.57 trillion, depending on the exact circulating supply used in the calculation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 That figure would place XRP among the largest assets globally by market cap and would require extraordinary levels of liquidity and adoption relative to present conditions. Analyst Observations and Cautions Several chart technicians and Elliott-wave practitioners, including Charting Guy and EGRAG , have suggested that the current price structure resembles the 2017 fractal. If that pattern is valid, applying proportional gains produces the lower-range projection above ($33.55). However, analysts also emphasize practical constraints that make a full three-digit outcome improbable without exceptional developments. Key limiting factors include circulating supply, required inflows of capital, exchange liquidity, regulatory clarity, and sustained institutional adoption. A 10% replication of XRP’s 2017 rally would generate headline-grabbing nominal prices, but translating such a scenario into persistent market value would necessitate vast and sustained capital inflows and structural changes in market participation. The numerical exercise is useful for understanding scale, yet it should be considered a hypothetical illustration rather than a near-term forecast.

Analysts are calling this the start of something big, with growing chatter about altcoin season 2025. Market watchers believe institutional demand will be the force that drives ETH higher. And while ETH leads the charge, traders are scanning the market for the best altcoins to buy 2025. One name catching attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, tipped by experts as a potential 71x gainer in the next bull run. Ethereum Blasts Past $4,300 — Setting the Tone for 2025 Ethereum’s recent breakout to $4,300 has done more than just boost morale — it’s reshaping the Ethereum price prediction narrative for 2025. The move comes with inflow data showing $269.8 million pouring into ETH in just one week, according to CoinShares . That level of institutional interest is rare outside of peak bull phases. X post by analyst Ted Analyst Ted summed it up with one tweet: “I told you that $ETH is the fastest horse to bet on.” With Bitcoin already at new highs and Ethereum still 11% below its 2021 peak, the upside potential is clear. Traders focused on next altcoin season predictions see ETH as the catalyst that could ignite rallies in the best performing altcoins during bull runs. For those building their watchlists of top cryptocurrencies to buy now, Ethereum’s leadership role makes it a natural inclusion — but it’s also sparking a hunt for smaller caps that could run even faster. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The 71x Speculation Play for This Cycle Experts project MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 71x gain in the upcoming bull run cycle, making it one of the best crypto to buy now for high-risk, high-reward investors. The appeal comes from its position outside the spotlight — it’s not competing directly with Ethereum for institutional dollars but instead drawing in retail traders looking for asymmetric upside. The project has been quietly building its community, gaining traction without the hype cycles that often burn out new tokens. In a market where Smart Money Portfolio Plays for the Next Market Expansion are becoming a priority, MAGACOIN is seen as a rare setup with a favorable risk-reward profile. While large-cap coins like ETH may double or triple from here, smaller caps with compelling narratives have the potential to multiply many times over — and MAGACOIN is fitting that mold for 2025. Can Ethereum Pump Trigger Altcoin Season? Ethereum’s surge past $4,300 isn’t just another price move — it’s a signal that momentum is building ahead of what many believe could be the most exciting stretch of altcoin season 2025. The inflows, analyst confidence, and the Ethereum price prediction for $10K all point toward continued upside. Yet history shows that while Ethereum will likely lead, the biggest winners of a cycle often come from outside the top ten. This is why seasoned traders mix their top cryptocurrencies to buy now between established leaders and speculative plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of those speculative plays — a project with the kind of narrative, timing, and potential that could see it move far faster than the broader market once the next rally accelerates. For investors looking beyond Ethereum, this could be one of the best altcoins to buy 2025 before the real mania begins.

Source: TradingView Volume analysis shows moderate activity at 42.83K ETH, validating institutional participation during the breakout. ATR at 2,880 indicates a very high volatility environment with potential for massive moves as Ethereum approaches the all-time high challenge. Historical Context: Recovery Acceleration Toward New Heights Ethereum’s 2025 performance demonstrates strong institutional resilience with explosive recovery from April’s $1,385 low to current levels near an all-time high. The 194% appreciation showcases renewed institutional confidence and adoption acceleration. The year’s journey from January’s $3,271 through brutal correction to March’s $1,823 and April’s $1,385 bottom established a strong accumulation foundation. May-August recovery showed consistent institutional buying with dramatic acceleration in recent weeks. Source: TradingView Current pricing sits just 8.44% below the November 2021 all-time high of $4,892 , positioning Ethereum for potential new record levels. Support & Resistance: Strong Foundation Despite Overbought Levels Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $4,221 , representing initial defense during a potential overbought correction. The 20-day EMA at $3,848 provides a substantial support buffer with 12.8% downside protection. Key support demonstrates exceptional depth with 50-day EMA at $3,422 ( -22.4% buffer) and 100-day EMA at $3,043 ( -31.0% buffer). Source: TradingView Resistance begins at today’s high around $4,433 , followed by a psychological $4,500 and an all-time high challenge at $4,892 . Breaking above current resistance could trigger momentum acceleration toward new record levels.

ChatGPT’s ETH Analysis: Altseason Peak Dynamics ChatGPT’s ETH analysis reveals a key altseason positioning with Ethereum’s dominance surge, validating cycle progression theories. Speaking with Cryptonews, Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, explained that “ alt season is at its peak, signaled clearly by Bitcoin’s dominance slipping to 60% , with more than 30 altcoins having outpaced Bitcoin’s growth over the last 90 days. “ Ray’s analysis positions the current Ethereum rally within the broader altseason context. “The inflow of institutional capital into Ethereum will extend the summer for altcoins—but the real question is, for how long and which coins will benefit,” he added. The altseason dynamics suggest Ethereum’s current dominance represents natural cycle progression, with institutional capital rotation from Bitcoin creating momentum for smart contract platforms. Ray emphasizes timing, saying that “what may feel like the start right now is, at best, the middle of the run.” Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Rally Ethereum maintains the second-largest cryptocurrency position with $540.03 billion market cap, demonstrating a 4.03% increase. The substantial market cap growth accompanies an extraordinary 18.26% volume surge to $49.03 billion . The 9.18% volume-to-market cap ratio indicates exceptional trading activity, suggesting massive institutional repositioning and retail FOMO. Source: TradingView A circulating supply of 120.7 million ETH with unlimited maximum supply reflects deflationary tokenomics through a burning mechanism.

However, failure to break $4,500 would indicate a healthy overbought correction to $3,800 – $4,200 range as the market digests gains, creating an optimal accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives Ethereum toward $10,000 + targets.

This significant climb, up five points from the previous day, isn’t just a number; it reflects a palpable shift in crypto market sentiment , moving away from caution and embracing a wave of optimism. For anyone deeply involved in or looking to enter the dynamic world of digital assets, understanding what drives this index and its implications is absolutely crucial. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? This unique and insightful tool, provided by software development platform Alternative.me, serves as a thermometer for the prevailing emotional state of the crypto market. It operates on a simple yet powerful scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies ‘extreme fear,’ indicating widespread panic and selling, while 100 represents ‘extreme greed,’ suggesting euphoria and potential overvaluation. A score of 73, as we’ve observed, clearly places the market in a strong ‘Greed’ phase, indicating heightened confidence among investors. The index isn’t based on guesswork; it’s a carefully calculated composite of six distinct factors, each contributing to its overall score: Volatility (25%): This measures how much the current price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fluctuates compared to their average historical values. High volatility often signals a fearful or uncertain market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor assesses the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing it to historical averages. Strong, consistent buying volume typically indicates a healthy, growing market. Social Media (15%): By analyzing keywords and hashtags across various social media platforms, the index gauges public sentiment and the general buzz around cryptocurrencies. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these surveys previously provided direct insights into investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric looks at Bitcoin’s share of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance might indicate a flight to safety, while falling dominance could suggest altcoin season. Google Trends (10%): This component analyzes search queries related to cryptocurrencies. For example, a surge in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” might signal fear, while “how to buy Bitcoin” could indicate growing interest. Understanding these underlying components empowers investors to perform better market sentiment analysis , moving beyond mere headlines to grasp the deeper currents influencing crypto prices. Decoding the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does 73 Mean for Bitcoin Dominance and Your Strategy? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index pushes into the ‘Greed’ zone, especially hitting a significant 73, it suggests that investors are feeling overwhelmingly confident. This often translates into increased buying pressure, as participants become more willing to take risks in anticipation of further price appreciation. It’s a period where optimism reigns, and many see opportunities for quick gains. However, it’s also a time for caution. Historically, periods of extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections. When euphoria peaks, assets can become overvalued, making them susceptible to sudden downturns. Conversely, extreme fear often presents prime buying opportunities for those brave enough to enter when others are selling. The role of Bitcoin dominance also comes into play here. While the index reflects overall market sentiment, Bitcoin’s share can influence how that greed manifests. If Bitcoin dominance is high during a greed phase, it might mean capital is flowing primarily into BTC. If it’s low, it could signal an “altcoin season” where other cryptocurrencies are gaining significant traction alongside Bitcoin’s rise. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Savvy Investors The cryptocurrency market is renowned for its inherent market volatility . While the current high ‘Greed’ score might feel exhilarating and encourage impulsive decisions, it’s absolutely essential to approach this environment with a balanced and strategic perspective. The index is a powerful indicator, but it should never be your sole guide for investment choices. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this period of heightened sentiment: Resist FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Avoid impulsive buying decisions. Base investments on solid research, not emotion. Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Research fundamentals, team, technology, and use case before investing. Consider Profit-Taking: If you’ve accumulated significant gains, securing some profits can protect your capital. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spread investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risks. Implement Risk Management: Use tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Stay Informed Beyond the Index: Keep an eye on broader economic news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space. These also significantly influence overall crypto market sentiment . The index is a valuable diagnostic tool, offering a quick read on the prevailing mood. However, it should always complement, rather than replace, comprehensive research, a sound investment strategy, and a clear understanding of your personal financial goals. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index ‘s impressive rise to 73 confirms a strong bullish shift in crypto market sentiment . This ‘Greed’ zone indicates widespread optimism and a willingness to embrace risk, driven by factors including positive market momentum and robust trading volumes. While this excitement is palpable, smart investors leverage this data wisely, balancing enthusiasm with prudence. Staying informed about key indicators like Bitcoin dominance , understanding the inherent market volatility , and conducting thorough market sentiment analysis remains absolutely crucial for navigating the exhilarating, yet unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency investing. Use the index as a guide, but let informed decisions be your ultimate compass. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A1: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘extreme fear’ (0) to ‘extreme greed’ (100).

Always combine it with thorough research, risk management, and a well-defined investment strategy. Q5: What is Bitcoin dominance? A5: Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. It indicates how much of the overall crypto market value is held by Bitcoin compared to altcoins.

Bitcoin remains near record highs, Ethereum continues to set new multi-year benchmarks, and major altcoins like Solana, XRP, and BNB are maintaining steady upward momentum. While these headline numbers grab attention, the real story may be in how capital is spreading across the ecosystem. From blockchain-based collectibles to decentralized lending protocols and centralized exchange tokens, multiple sectors are enjoying renewed interest at the same time. That breadth of growth has traders asking for the next altcoin breakouts and rotation plays to watch — and for some, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing onto the list of the best altcoins to buy in the current market cycle. DeFi Continues to Draw Capital Decentralized finance remains one of the clearest examples of crypto’s potential to attract and deploy capital at scale. Large protocols like Lido and ETHFI still dominate total value locked, but smaller projects are notching faster growth, sometimes doubling their locked capital in weeks. This appetite for new DeFi solutions has been reinforced by record Ethereum network activity, reflecting both retail participation and corporate accumulation — factors that often help shape the best altcoins to buy in a bull market. NFTs Reclaim Investor Attention NFT markets have seen a resurgence, with daily user activity rivaling — and in some cases surpassing — that of DeFi platforms. Sales volumes are climbing again, blue-chip collections are holding or raising their floor prices, and Ethereum remains the primary settlement layer for high-value transactions. This renewed energy is pushing investors to reassess which NFT-linked projects might join the ranks of the best altcoins to buy for the next stage of growth. CeFi Strengthens Its Role Centralized finance remains a key access point for newcomers and institutions alike. Despite ongoing debates over governance and transparency, CeFi platforms continue to attract significant funding, reflecting investor belief in their role as gateways to the crypto economy. Tokens linked to major exchanges tend to track this growth, often benefiting from higher volumes and product expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as Best Altcoin to Buy Ahead of Next Big Wave Leading crypto researchers place MAGACOIN FINANCE in their Best Altcoins to Buy for 2025 , and its appeal fits squarely into the current cross-sector rally. As money flows into NFTs, DeFi, and CeFi, some of it inevitably filters toward projects that can capture attention quickly and respond to market moves with agility. The appeal comes from timing. When different parts of the market are booming at once, traders often look for coins that can benefit from multiple trends instead of just one. MAGACOIN fits that profile — it’s small enough to move quickly when buying pressure builds, but it’s also gaining enough attention to stay on investors’ radar. That mix of agility and visibility is what makes some traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a smart way to ride the current wave without having to guess which single sector will lead next. Final Word With growth happening in multiple corners of the market, the current rally is less about one dominant narrative and more about several strong engines running at once. That diversity offers more opportunities — and more complexity — for investors deciding where to position. For those willing to balance blue-chip stability with high-upside bets, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the best altcoins to buy to capture the speed and excitement of this multi-sector expansion.

Bitmax, a prominent KOSDAQ-listed firm, has made a strategic move, substantially boosting its Bitcoin holdings . This bold expansion underscores a powerful trend: the increasing embrace of digital assets by institutional players globally. Are we witnessing a new era for corporate crypto investments , and what does this mean for the broader market? What’s Driving Bitmax’s Expanding Bitcoin Holdings? Bitmax recently announced an impressive addition of 51.1 Bitcoin (BTC) to its portfolio. This brings their total Bitcoin holdings to a notable 551 BTC, as reported by Money Today. This isn’t just a random purchase; it’s a calculated decision reflecting broader market dynamics and a clear vision for the future. Surging Institutional Demand: The company specifically highlighted a significant surge in institutional demand for Bitcoin. This indicates that large corporations, hedge funds, and investment firms are increasingly viewing BTC not as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate and valuable asset class for long-term growth. Impact of U.S. Policy: A key factor cited by Bitmax was the influence of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order. This order, which permitted crypto investments within 401(k) retirement plans, notably channeled approximately $265 million into Bitcoin. This example powerfully demonstrates how even seemingly distant regulatory or policy shifts can create substantial capital inflows into the crypto market, influencing global corporate strategies. Bitmax’s proactive stance signals a deep confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring potential and its evolving, integral role in the global financial landscape. Their decision provides a tangible example for other companies considering similar moves. The Growing Appeal of Institutional Bitcoin: A Strategic Imperative? Why are more and more institutions, like Bitmax, strategically turning to institutional Bitcoin ? The reasons are multifaceted, extending beyond mere speculation to encompass robust diversification strategies and effective inflation hedging. For many forward-thinking corporations, integrating Bitcoin into their treasury offers compelling advantages: Asset Diversification: Bitcoin’s historical low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can significantly help balance a corporate portfolio, especially during periods of economic volatility or uncertainty. It provides an alternative avenue for growth. Inflation Hedging: As global fiat currencies face persistent inflationary pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly perceived as a reliable store of value, often likened to “digital gold.” Its finite supply provides a natural scarcity that appeals to those seeking to preserve purchasing power. Boosting Corporate Value: By holding an asset with a proven track record of appreciation, companies aim to strengthen their balance sheets and potentially enhance their overall market valuation, attracting more investors. This accelerating trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings underscores the cryptocurrency’s maturation and its undeniable acceptance within mainstream finance. It’s becoming a strategic imperative for treasuries looking to future-proof their assets. Navigating Crypto Investments in South Korea: A Dynamic Landscape South Korea has consistently been a vibrant and influential hub for cryptocurrency activity, boasting a tech-savvy population and high trading volumes. Bitmax’s actions further cement its position at the forefront of the South Korea crypto market . While the market has certainly experienced its share of regulatory evolution and adjustments, the underlying enthusiasm and interest in digital assets remain remarkably strong. Companies operating here, including Bitmax, are adeptly navigating this dynamic landscape by: Adhering to Robust Regulations: Diligently complying with local financial regulations and transparent reporting standards, which builds trust and legitimacy within the South Korea crypto market . Identifying Growth Opportunities: Actively seeking and capitalizing on strategic growth opportunities within South Korea’s rapidly expanding digital economy, particularly as it intersects with global crypto trends. The decision by a KOSDAQ-listed firm to significantly increase its Bitmax Bitcoin reserves sends a powerful, positive message to both local and international investors about the inherent potential and stability within the Korean digital asset market. It serves as a benchmark for other regional players. Bitmax Bitcoin Strategy: Driving Diversification and Corporate Value Bitmax’s strategic intent is clear: to meticulously diversify their assets and decisively boost corporate value. Their latest, substantial acquisition of Bitmax Bitcoin is a direct and bold reflection of this overarching ambition. As Bitcoin continues its relentless expansion into the global financial system, companies that proactively embrace it early stand to gain a considerable competitive edge. This isn’t merely about short-term speculation; it’s fundamentally about recognizing Bitcoin’s rapidly increasing utility as: A highly efficient cross-border payment mechanism. A robust and resilient store of value. A powerful hedge against the inherent volatility and inflationary pressures of traditional markets. By thoughtfully integrating Bitcoin into their core holdings, Bitmax is strategically positioning itself for sustained future growth and enhanced financial resilience in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. This forward-thinking, proactive approach could undoubtedly inspire a multitude of other firms to critically re-evaluate their own traditional asset allocation strategies and consider the merits of digital assets. In conclusion, Bitmax’s substantial increase in Bitcoin holdings is far more than just a fleeting headline; it represents a profound and clear indicator of Bitcoin’s undeniable rising prominence among sophisticated institutional investors. This decisive move by a significant South Korean firm highlights the burgeoning confidence in crypto assets, a confidence driven by both surging market demand and rapidly evolving, more favorable regulatory landscapes. As the global financial system continues its inevitable digital transformation, we can confidently anticipate more companies following Bitmax’s pioneering lead, thereby further solidifying Bitcoin’s foundational role as a cornerstone asset for strategic crypto investments worldwide.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves says the move will strengthen the department’s links with the business community. The appointment comes as Britain faces sluggish economic growth, a cooling business climate, and tough fiscal challenges. Sir Charlie Mayfield will not join the board alone. Edward Twiddy, a financial technology entrepreneur and chair of Northstar Ventures , will also take a seat. Jenny Scott, a former BBC economics correspondent and ex-director of communications at the Bank of England, also joins. All three will serve three-year terms starting on 1 September. The Treasury says they will each bring “fresh thinking” and practical experience to policy decisions. Reeves describes their combined expertise as “a huge amount of experience” that can help the government work more closely with business. The positions are part-time, involving 24 working days per year. They are remunerated, though the Treasury has not revealed the pay details. Mayfield aims to repair strained business relations Sir Charlie Mayfield steps into the role with a long track record in leadership and policy. He spent over 20 years in the private sector, including over a decade leading the John Lewis Partnership through one of the most challenging retail periods in history. His tenure was marked by efforts to modernise the business, adapt to online competition, and maintain the company’s employee-ownership model. In addition, Mayfield chaired the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, where he worked on bridging skills gaps and improving workforce productivity across industries. Combining corporate leadership with policy insight, this background is crucial to the Treasury’s current needs. His main task will be to rebuild trust between the government and the business community. Those ties have come under strain since Labour came to power, despite early signs of cooperation. Rachel Reeves, as Chancellor, initially won praise from corporate leaders for her pro-business tone after Labour’s election victory 13 months ago. However, the relationship cooled as key policies began to bite. One flashpoint was last October’s Budget, which introduced a £25 billion national insurance bill for employers. Business groups warned the move would raise costs, deter recruitment, and slow investment. For many in the private sector, the measure signalled a return to heavier taxation when companies were still recovering from pandemic disruptions and supply chain pressures. Mayfield’s appointment is seen as a signal that the Treasury is listening to these concerns. His role will involve advising on economic policy and acting as a bridge, encouraging open dialogue, addressing friction points, and helping shape measures that balance fiscal responsibility with business growth. Reeves has made clear she wants Mayfield to act as both a sounding board for business sentiment and a strategic thinker, capable of guiding the Treasury through the delicate task of keeping economic plans on track without alienating key industries. Twiddy and Scott to boost innovation and communication Edward Twiddy co-founded Atom Bank in 2014 after 13 years as a Treasury civil servant. He is expected to focus on “enterprise and innovation,” especially in financial technology. Reeves has been pressing regulators to speed up support for fintech and other fast-growing sectors in the City of London. Jenny Scott will advise the Treasury on improving how it explains its policies. She currently runs Apella Advisors, a strategic communications firm. Her experience includes guiding the Bank of England’s communications during the global financial crisis and the 2016 Brexit referendum. Reeves recently ordered a review of the Treasury’s communications strategy, signalling she wants the department to speak more clearly to the public and the markets. The appointments mark a push to blend government policy with real-world business and financial experience. Mayfield, Twiddy, and Scott will be under pressure to help shape policies that promote growth, restore trust, and give the public a clearer picture of the Treasury’s economic plans.

This event marks a crucial moment for the popular Solana-based memecoin launchpad, drawing considerable attention from investors and analysts alike. It is the first time the platform has sold a substantial amount of SOL tokens since its PUMP token generation event (TGE). What Exactly Happened in the Pump.fun SOL Sale? On-chain analyst @EmberCN on X first brought this notable transaction to light. The Pump.fun platform reportedly moved a staggering 86,000 SOL, equivalent to approximately $16.28 million, to the Kraken exchange. This transfer occurred just five hours prior to the analyst’s report. The funds originated from two specific wallets: Pump.fun’s fee wallet and another wallet previously used for PUMP token buybacks. This marks the first instance of such a large-scale SOL sale by the platform since the initial PUMP token distribution. The movement of such a significant sum to a centralized exchange like Kraken often signals an intent to sell or increase liquidity. Why is This Pump.fun Platform Activity So Significant? This substantial Pump.fun SOL sale holds considerable weight within the Solana ecosystem and the broader memecoin space. Pump.fun operates as a unique platform where users can launch memecoins directly on Solana without needing initial liquidity. Its model involves a bonding curve that ensures liquidity and fair launches. The sale is significant because it represents a major outflow of funds from a platform known for its rapid growth and innovative approach to memecoin creation. It raises questions about the platform’s financial strategies and its long-term stability. Understanding the PUMP Token Generation Event and Its Impact The PUMP token generation event (TGE) was a pivotal moment for Pump.fun. During the TGE, the platform distributed its native PUMP token, establishing its economic model and governance structure. Part of this model included using a portion of platform fees for PUMP token buybacks, aiming to support the token’s value. The recent SOL transfer from a wallet associated with these buybacks suggests a shift in strategy or a need for operational funds. This is why the current Pump.fun platform activity is under such scrutiny. It directly relates to the financial mechanics established during the PUMP token generation event . What Does This Mean for Solana Memecoin Launchpad Users? For users of the Solana memecoin launchpad , this development can spark both curiosity and concern. Pump.fun has become a go-to for launching new memecoins, attracting a large community of developers and traders. A significant sale like this can influence market sentiment around the platform’s stability and the broader Solana memecoin ecosystem. Users might wonder about the implications for future token launches, fee structures, or even the potential for increased volatility in tokens launched via Pump.fun. Transparency from the platform regarding the purpose of these funds would undoubtedly help in managing community expectations. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Market Activity Beyond Pump.fun and Solana, this event contributes to the ongoing narrative of cryptocurrency market activity . Large transfers of native tokens from projects to exchanges are always closely watched by analysts. They can signal various things, from operational expenses to profit-taking or even rebalancing of treasuries. The sheer volume of $16.28 million in SOL moved to Kraken is substantial and could, theoretically, add selling pressure to SOL if the funds are liquidated. This highlights the interconnectedness of different segments within the crypto market and how one platform’s actions can have ripple effects. Conclusion The Pump.fun SOL sale marks a significant transaction, drawing attention to the financial movements of a prominent Solana memecoin launchpad . This first major sale since the PUMP token generation event has sparked discussions about the Pump.fun platform ‘s operational strategies and its impact on the broader cryptocurrency market activity . As the crypto space evolves, such transparency and liquidity events remain crucial for understanding market dynamics and project health. Investors and users will undoubtedly watch for further updates from Pump.fun regarding this substantial transfer. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Pump.fun?

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news concerning Do Kwon , the co-founder of Terraform Labs. Recent developments indicate a pivotal moment in his ongoing legal battles, especially regarding the severe charges he faces. This situation highlights the complex nature of legal jurisdiction in the digital asset space and has major implications for the future of crypto regulation. Do Kwon’s Plea Deal: What Does It Mean? In a significant turn of events, Do Kwon , the central figure behind the collapsed Terra-Luna ecosystem, has reportedly reached a plea agreement with U.S. prosecutors. This deal, according to Reuters, involves him pleading guilty to two counts of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. It’s a crucial step in his legal journey, potentially shaping the remainder of his sentence. Agreement Details: Prosecutors will not oppose his request to serve the latter half of his sentence outside the U.S. Potential Location: This opens the door for him to potentially serve time in South Korea , where he also faces separate, equally serious charges. Significance: This agreement offers a clearer path forward for a case that has captivated the global financial and crypto communities. Navigating Crypto Fraud Charges Across Borders The case of Do Kwon is a prime example of the complexities involved when alleged crypto fraud spans multiple international jurisdictions. While the U.S. plea deal addresses specific charges, his legal troubles are far from over. He still faces significant legal challenges in his home country. South Korean prosecutors have their own set of charges against Kwon, including fraud and violations of capital markets law. They have committed to recommending a prison term of no more than 12 years for these offenses. However, it is important to note that the combined statutory maximum for these charges could be as high as 25 years, underscoring the severity of the allegations. This dual-nation legal process underscores the global efforts to hold individuals accountable in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. It sets a precedent for how international cooperation might handle future cases involving decentralized finance. The Impact of Do Kwon’s Sentence on Terraform Labs and Beyond The eventual Do Kwon sentence will undoubtedly have lasting implications, not just for him personally, but also for the legacy of Terraform Labs and the broader crypto market. The collapse of Terra-Luna in May 2022 wiped out billions of dollars in market value, leading to widespread investor losses and triggering a ‘crypto winter’. While Terraform Labs itself is undergoing changes and attempting to recover, the resolution of Kwon’s legal status is critical. His conviction or plea agreement could: Shape Regulatory Approaches: Influence how global regulators view and regulate stablecoins and other DeFi protocols. Restore Investor Confidence: Potentially contribute to rebuilding trust in the crypto space, especially concerning accountability for project founders. Precedent Setting: Establish important legal precedents for future cross-border crypto fraud cases. This case serves as a stark reminder of the risks and responsibilities associated with developing and investing in innovative, yet volatile, financial technologies. What’s Next for Do Kwon in South Korea Legal Proceedings? With the U.S. plea deal in place, attention now shifts significantly to the South Korea legal proceedings. The agreement allowing Kwon to potentially serve part of his sentence there suggests a coordinated approach between the two nations, though the specifics of this arrangement are yet to be fully detailed. The South Korean charges are separate and distinct from those in the U.S. It means even if the U.S. sentence is determined, Kwon will still face a full trial or resolution process in South Korea. The legal framework and potential outcomes in South Korea could differ considerably, adding another layer of complexity to his situation. Observers will be closely watching for how these two major legal sagas intertwine and ultimately conclude. The resolution of Kwon’s case will provide crucial insights into the evolving international legal landscape for digital assets. In conclusion, Do Kwon ‘s plea deal marks a pivotal moment in one of the most high-profile crypto fraud cases to date. It highlights the intricate legal challenges of the digital age and the ongoing efforts to ensure accountability within the crypto ecosystem. The path ahead remains complex, particularly with the looming South Korea legal proceedings, but this agreement offers a glimpse into a potential resolution for the Terraform Labs founder. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Do Kwon accused of? A1: Do Kwon is accused of fraud, including conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud in the U.S., related to the collapse of the Terra-Luna cryptocurrency ecosystem. He also faces separate fraud and capital markets law violation charges in South Korea. Q2: What is the significance of Do Kwon’s plea deal in the U.S.? A2: The plea deal means Do Kwon has agreed to plead guilty to specific charges in the U.S. It is significant because it potentially allows him to serve the latter half of his sentence outside the U.S., possibly in South Korea, and offers a clearer path to resolution for the U.S. case. Q3: Will Do Kwon definitely serve part of his sentence in South Korea? A3: The agreement states that U.S. prosecutors will not oppose his bid to serve the latter half of his sentence outside the U.S., potentially in South Korea. However, the final decision rests with the courts and depends on the legal processes and agreements between the two nations. Q4: How does this case impact Terraform Labs? A4: The collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem, spearheaded by Terraform Labs, led to significant financial losses for investors. The resolution of Do Kwon’s legal status is crucial for the legacy of Terraform Labs and could influence future regulatory approaches to stablecoins and DeFi, potentially aiding in restoring investor confidence.

USDC Circulation Soars 90% Year-Over-Year The uptick in Circle’s CRCL stock toward the $164 mark on Tuesday, comes on the heels of the recently passed GENIUS Act in both Congress and House of Representatives, which has spurred increased attention towards stablecoins and their applications in the financial market. According to Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jeremy Fox-Geen, the company is witnessing a surge in institutional interest, stating, “After our IPO and the Genius Act, we’re seeing an acceleration of interest, with major institutions all leaning in.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year Rhythm Fades Out As Fresh Market Forces Emerge: Expert Three weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed the country’s first crypto bill into law. The bill aims to establish a new regulatory framework for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. As a result, major companies and US banks have shown increased interest in these assets, potentially including them in their financial operations, which could significantly improve, given the low cost and speed of stablecoin transactions. As of June 30, the amount of USDC in circulation had skyrocketed by 90% compared to the same time last year, and Circle anticipates sustained growth at a compounded annual rate of 40%. The USDC stablecoin is also gaining traction not only for its use in digital transactions but also for cross-border remittances between individuals and businesses, as noted by CEO Jeremy Allaire. Circle Reports 53% Revenue Growth Circle reported a significant year-over-year revenue increase of 53%, reaching $658 million. According to Reuters, this growth was largely driven by increased interest income generated from the cash reserves and short-term investments backing its USDC stablecoins. Additionally, revenue from subscription and service offerings from the stablecoin issuer’s platform also saw an uptick, surpassing analysts’ expectations of $644.7 million, as compiled by LSEG. However, the company did report a net loss of $482 million, primarily attributed to non-cash charges associated with its initial public offering.

Despite the rise in its stock price, CEO Allaire indicated that Circle is taking a cautious approach regarding acquisitions. “We’re careful and deliberate. I don’t think our strategy here is to go try and do big, complex acquisitions to throw additional business lines,” he remarked.

The launch follows the company’s $1.2 billion initial public offering (IPO) in June and is scheduled to debut on a public testnet later this fall. According to Circle, Arc will be an enterprise-grade, EVM-compatible blockchain supporting payments, foreign exchange, and capital markets use cases. The network will use USDC as its native gas token, feature a stablecoin FX engine, offer sub-second settlement times, and provide optional privacy for transactions . The platform will be fully integrated with Circle’s existing infrastructure while maintaining interoperability with partner blockchains. Arc in Context: Stablecoin Sector Competition and Circle’s Market Position Circle is currently the second-largest stablecoin issuer, with USDC making up $65 billion of the roughly $260 billion total dollar-pegged stablecoin market. The company’s move into operating its own blockchain comes as other major issuers explore similar strategies. Tether, the market leader, has supported and developed stablecoin-oriented blockchains such as Stable and Plasma, highlighting growing competition in this niche. The announcement coincided with Circle’s second-quarter financial results. The company reported that USDC in circulation increased 90% year-over-year to $61.3 billion, with an additional 6.4% growth bringing the total to $65.2 billion as of August 10. Total revenue and reserve income grew 53% year-over-year to $658 million, while other revenue , including subscription, services, and transaction income, rose 252% year-over-year. Despite these gains, Circle posted a net loss of $482 million, which it attributed primarily to $591 million in IPO-related non-cash charges , including $424 million in stock-based compensation and $167 million tied to convertible debt valuation changes. Adjusted EBITDA increased 52% year-over-year to $126 million. Regulatory Landscape and Strategic Outlook CEO Jeremy Allaire described the second quarter as a milestone period, noting that Circle’s IPO marked a significant moment for both the company and the stablecoin industry . “We demonstrated sustained growth and adoption of our platform across a multitude of use cases and with a diverse set of industry-defining partners,” Allaire said, adding that the IPO has accelerated global interest in building on stablecoins and collaborating with Circle. The company also emphasized the importance of the recent enactment of the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump. The legislation establishes a federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, setting compliance standards for issuers. Circle stated that its long-standing approach to regulatory alignment is now reinforced by these new legal requirements , positioning it strongly within the regulated stablecoin space. By launching Arc, Circle seems to be aiming at expanding its role beyond issuing USDC to directly operating blockchain infrastructure tailored for stablecoin settlement and related financial services.

According to CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest, the exchange’s dominance in trading activity provides valuable context for interpreting Bitcoin’s performance at all-time highs (ATHs). By comparing volume distribution across exchanges during previous ATH periods, the analysis seeks to determine whether the broader market is participating in the rally or if activity is concentrated on a single platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin-Money Supply Link Is A Myth, Glassnode Researcher Reveals Bitcoin Exchange Volume Concentration and Market Signals BorisVest’s review found that during the first ATH in 2024, global market volumes were elevated, and Binance’s trading activity was more than double that of all other exchanges combined. When Bitcoin retested its ATH later that year, overall market volumes increased across multiple platforms, yet Binance maintained its lead in total trading share. In contrast, when Bitcoin set a new record in mid-2025, total market volume did not show a significant increase compared to previous rallies. While Binance still recorded nearly twice the trading volume of other exchanges combined, the absence of a wider market volume expansion raised concerns. The analyst noted that historically, ATHs supported by broad volume growth tend to indicate stronger market conviction. A lack of participation from other exchanges could signal potential challenges in sustaining higher prices over the coming months. On-Chain Patterns Suggest Gradual Market Progress In a separate assessment, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado onchain examined Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), a metric tracking the movement of long-dormant coins. The indicator recently turned lower after a brief rise, with Bitcoin’s price trading within a sideways range. Historically, increases in Binary CDD have been linked to selling pressure from long-term holders, often leading to corrections. However, current market conditions, shaped by changes in custody solutions, over-the-counter trading activity, and institutional investment strategies, make interpreting CDD spikes more complex. Avocado onchain highlighted that in recent cycles, Binary CDD rises have been followed by either prolonged sideways trading or moderate corrections. The current data supports what the analyst describes as a “stair-step” rally, where the market advances gradually while cooling short-term speculative activity. This pattern, if sustained, could prevent rapid depletion of buying momentum and allow for more stable long-term growth.

Other on-chain data suggests that selling from long-term holders remains subdued, indicating limited pressure to exit positions at current price levels. This aligns with the view that while near-term movements may be range-bound, the broader trend still holds the potential for future upside, contingent on broader participation and sustained investor demand.

50001109,555023,1755046820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50001109.jpeg,Experts Predict Rough Road Ahead For Wall Street Giants In Stablecoin Rollout,https://bitcoinist.com/experts-predict-rough-road-wall-street-stablecoin/,"In a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry with new regulations coming from the US, major financial institutions are setting their sights on stablecoins, thanks to the recent passage of the GENIUS Act . This regulatory framework, part of President Donald Trump’s vision to position the US as the global leader in cryptocurrency, has prompted banks like Bank of America, Fiserv, and Morgan Stanley to explore the adoption and integration of stablecoins. Should Companies Create Their Own Stablecoins While the GENIUS act opens new avenues for stablecoin usage, experts caution that the journey toward successful implementation will not be straightforward. The potential for instant payments and settlements that stablecoins promise is enticing, particularly when traditional banking transactions can take days. Companies such as Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoin initiatives, signaling a significant shift in how retail and financial services could operate in the future. However, a recent report by Reuters highlights that the GENIUS Act does not immediately eliminate the complexities associated with launching stablecoins. Businesses must navigate a labyrinth of strategic and technical challenges. One fundamental decision is whether to create their own stablecoin or to incorporate existing options. The intended use of the stablecoin will reportedly have greater influence on this decision; for instance, a retail platform might develop a stablecoin to enhance customer engagement, while others could utilize them for internal cross-border transactions. Stephen Aschettino, a partner at Steptoe, emphasized the importance of purpose in this decision-making process. “Is this something really designed to drive customers to engage with the issuer, or is the issuer’s primary motivation to have a stablecoin that is more ubiquitous?” he questioned. For non-banking entities, the adoption of stablecoins will inevitably bring new compliance obligations. The GENIUS Act mandates issuers to adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, which could impose additional costs and oversight requirements. Regulatory Guidelines Remain Uncertain Per the report, the implications of holding dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies for these institutions extend to regulatory compliance as well. Banks must consider how these digital assets will affect liquidity requirements. Julia Demidova, head of digital currencies product and strategy at FIS, pointed out that stablecoins held on bank balance sheets might necessitate greater capital reserves under existing regulations. “The GENIUS Act is great, but if the bank is treating their stablecoin on the balance sheet under prudential banking regulation, you still need to look at the risk weight of the asset,” she remarked. Another crucial aspect for companies venturing into these cryptocurrencies is the choice of blockchain technology. Stablecoins can be issued on various blockchain networks, with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) being popular options. However, banks may lean towards private, permissioned blockchains to ensure governance and control over transactions. Demidova noted that banks would likely prioritize clear structures and oversight, which are often lacking in public blockchain environments. Despite the excitement surrounding the GENIUS Act, its effective date remains uncertain, with federal banking regulators expected to release rules that will clarify compliance and risk management requirements. For instance, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is reportedly anticipated to outline guidelines that will address these issues, while the Treasury Department will need to assess foreign dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies regulatory frameworks in line with US standards.

The former president is working on a plan to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public in a deal that could be worth as much as $500 billion. If completed, it would be one of the largest public offerings in U.S. history. As political and financial circles react, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a token that investors are starting to watch. Reports say Trump has met with top banking executives to discuss the deal. Leaders from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America have attended talks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have also been involved. The goal is to release the two mortgage firms from government control. Trump has supported this idea since his first term. An earlier effort in 2020 stalled during the Covid-19 crisis. This time, the administration appears more determined. In May, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the government would still guarantee the companies’ obligations. However, he wants to oversee them as president while they operate independently. If successful, the IPO could unlock huge amounts of capital. It could also shift the housing finance market in ways not seen for decades. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Investor Attention As news of the IPO spreads, MAGACOIN FINANCE has started to attract more interest from investors. Some are shifting capital into the token ahead of what they believe could be a strong cycle. The project now has a dedicated community that considers MAGACOIN as not only a political statement but also an investment. An increase in activity tends to occur whenever Trump is in the headlines, and the recent IPO news is not an exception. Investors are keen on monitoring the development of this political and financial tale. The timing is everything. The trust in the plans of Trump can spill into the assets associated with his brand. The price history of MAGACOIN indicates that it responds well to those moments. This has led to speculation about what direction it may take next in case the IPO goes to fruition. Most of the holders are no longer interested in a quick trade but instead in long-term growth. In their opinion, MAGACOIN might be rewarded by compounding returns in case it is kept until the next market rally. Conclusion The Trump $500 billion IPO is turning out to be one of the largest pieces of financial news of the year. As Wall Street considers the potential impact, crypto traders are keeping an eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE in anticipation of returns. The token might experience an increase in interest and demand should the IPO proceed as scheduled.

50001276,https://thecoinrise.com/4-top-cryptos-to-buy-now-for-huge-gains-cold-wallet-etc-bch-icp/,1755046847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50001276.jpeg,"4 Top Cryptos to Buy Now for Huge Gains: Cold Wallet, ETC, BCH & ICP!",https://thecoinrise.com/4-top-cryptos-to-buy-now-for-huge-gains-cold-wallet-etc-bch-icp/,"Opportunities in crypto rarely last long. Bull runs often begin without warning, and by the time the surge starts, most gains are already locked in. This makes identifying the top cryptos to buy today crucial, especially for projects where early participation is rewarded through structured pricing that benefits first adopters. Currently, Cold Wallet is drawing attention with its reward-based model and a rare window for massive upside still open. Below is a closer look at four crypto projects worth noting before their prices move beyond reach. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): The 100x Potential in Plain Sight Cold Wallet stands apart from typical self-custody wallets. It changes the traditional fee-based approach into a reward-focused system. Users receive cashback in CWT, the native coin, whenever they pay gas fees, swap coins, or bridge across chains. Holding more CWT increases these rewards, making the coin a direct gateway to better benefits. The main highlight, however, is the price stage. Cold Wallet is now in presale stage 17, priced at $0.00998. With over $5.9 million raised and more than 707 million coins sold, momentum is strong. The final listing price is set at $0.3517, suggesting a potential 37x gain at listing and over 100x as the ecosystem expands and cashback use grows. With each stage, the price rises, and the chance for large gains shrinks. The 150-stage cap means there’s no endless wait for entry. Missing this stage could mean paying retail rates later when the multiplier is gone. Cold Wallet rewards both use and early entry, making it one of the most strategic top cryptos to buy today. 2. Ethereum Classic (ETC): Longstanding Chain with Steady Appeal Ethereum Classic remains one of the most discussed and enduring chains in the market. Created after Ethereum’s split following the DAO hack, ETC preserves the original chain’s code and principles. Operating on proof-of-work, it found renewed miner support after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. Its appeal lies in stability and its role as a truly decentralized alternative. Developers seeking secure, censorship-resistant networks are drawn to its proof-of-work model. While it may not be known for frequent updates, its reliability often attracts attention during down markets. If large capital flows into POW assets outside Bitcoin, ETC could be a key beneficiary. 3. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Simple Scaling That Works Bitcoin Cash is often overshadowed by newer Layer 1 projects, yet its role in providing low-cost, fast, and dependable peer-to-peer payments remains vital. In regions where affordability matters more than branding, BCH adoption continues to grow. Recent additions, such as eCash bridges and token layers, have broadened its capabilities beyond payments. With BCH still trading far below its past highs, long-term collection appears appealing, particularly for those seeking to diversify away from high-risk newer coins. As crypto adoption expands globally, BCH’s straightforward utility keeps it relevant as one of the top cryptos to buy today. Internet Computer (ICP): Building Web3 Infrastructure from the Ground Up Internet Computer entered with the aim of replacing traditional internet infrastructure through blockchain computing. Though its early price drop was steep, its tech remains distinctive. Developed by the DFINITY Foundation, ICP lets developers build and run decentralized apps and services directly on-chain, avoiding traditional cloud services. This could be valuable if Web3 adoption grows and blockchain backend systems become standard. Despite mixed opinions, ICP benefits from a well-funded treasury, ongoing development, and a growing app ecosystem. Its current low price compared to launch levels makes it worth considering for those willing to take a longer-term view and manage volatility. Final Say Finding the top cryptos to buy today is not about chasing hype coins. It’s about spotting projects with solid models, true use cases, and early pricing that leaves room for strong returns. Cold Wallet stands out not only for its reward system but for its presale price, which still allows room for substantial growth. As each presale stage pushes the price higher, the odds of large returns decline for those who wait. ETC, BCH, and ICP each bring unique advantages, from network stability to practical payments and infrastructure ambitions. But Cold Wallet’s blend of usability, growth potential, and a limited-time pricing window makes it a standout choice among the top cryptos to buy today .

This hybrid Layer 1 network has exceeded $371 million in presale funding, firmly establishing itself as the top crypto presale of the year and crossing the halfway point toward its $600 million target. For a project yet to launch on exchanges, the speed of growth and depth of adoption is drawing comparisons to early Solana and Avalanche, though BlockDAG’s pre-mainnet adoption numbers are even more impressive. Historically, projects with such funding and community momentum have often delivered strong post-listing performance. With its listing price set at $0.05 later this year, reaching $1 would represent a 1,733% return for current batch buyers. For a Layer 1 project with this level of traction before mainnet, analysts view the projection as ambitious yet achievable. A Complete Ecosystem Before Mainnet Release What sets BlockDAG apart is that its progress isn’t limited to fundraising. Its ecosystem is already highly active and growing at a rate rarely seen before launch. The X1 mobile miner app now has over 2.5 million active users, creating a large grassroots base ready to engage from the first day of trading. More than 200,000 BDAG holders have already secured tokens, and 19,200 ASIC miners have been sold, ensuring a strong decentralized hashrate at launch. On the developer side, more than 4,500 builders are already involved, with over 300 dApps in development. This pre-mainnet activity means that once the network goes live, it will launch with a functioning marketplace of applications, a milestone many projects struggle to reach even years after release. The project’s appeal lies in its technical design, which combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. This pairing delivers the scalability of DAG while maintaining the proven security and decentralization of Bitcoin’s model. The result is a system capable of processing thousands of transactions per second without compromising network integrity. EVM compatibility further enhances its developer appeal, enabling Ethereum-based projects to migrate easily. This reduces development time and allows creators and businesses to integrate seamlessly, speeding up ecosystem growth. Reaching Half of the $600M Goal Crossing the halfway point toward $600 million is more than just a numerical target, it reflects deep market confidence. This funding provides the resources for substantial liquidity support, global marketing pushes, and developer incentive programs when the project launches. Compared to past high-profile launches, BlockDAG is already in record-setting territory. Avalanche raised about $350M before listing, and Aptos reached $200M, both figures now exceeded by BlockDAG. With Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, investors are securing positions at nearly half the planned $0.05 listing price, offering strong upside potential from day one. Analysts highlight that the mix of cutting-edge infrastructure, large-scale pre-launch adoption, and robust funding could place BlockDAG among the top Layer 1 projects in its first year of trading. Some even project a long-term climb toward $1, which would mean over a 3,500% ROI from current presale prices. In a market where many projects debut with little more than a whitepaper, BlockDAG’s active ecosystem and ready user base give it a competitive advantage. Its early community momentum is likely to create powerful network effects once the token is live on major exchanges. Accelerating Toward the Finish Line Presale funding patterns often follow a predictable path, steady early sales, a sharp mid-phase surge, and a final buying wave before the end. BlockDAG is now entering its acceleration phase. With $371M already secured and more flowing in daily, the opportunity to buy at current prices is narrowing quickly. If the pace holds, the $600M target could be reached before the presale ends, placing BlockDAG among the largest Layer 1 raises of the last decade. This would solidify its position not only as the top crypto presale of the year but as one of the most ambitious launches in recent history. BlockDAG is breaking from the standard launch playbook. It will enter the market with an active global community, a functioning testnet, a developer ecosystem already building applications, and a funding base on par with established networks. For those searching for the top crypto presale right now, BlockDAG’s combination of scale, adoption, and readiness makes it a standout opportunity.

Understanding the pulse of the market is crucial, and a key indicator for many is the Altcoin Season Index . This fascinating metric helps investors gauge whether the broader cryptocurrency market is favoring Bitcoin or the vast array of alternative cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins. As of August 13th, the Altcoin Season Index , tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 34. This figure, a slight increase from the previous day, sends a clear signal: we are currently in a period often referred to as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and the overall crypto market trends ? What is the Altcoin Season Index, and How Does it Work? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency landscape. It provides a snapshot of which asset class – Bitcoin or altcoins – is leading the charge over a specific period. It’s not just a random number; it’s a calculated metric that helps identify broader cryptocurrency cycles . The index specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on the performance of native cryptocurrencies. It evaluates the performance of the top 100 coins listed on CoinMarketCap. The comparison is made over the past 90 days, offering a good look at recent market momentum. This systematic approach ensures that the index offers a clear, data-driven perspective on market dominance. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Score: Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Performance The index score ranges from 1 to 100, and each range tells a distinct story about the prevailing market conditions and altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Understanding these thresholds is essential to interpreting the index correctly: Altcoin Season: For the market to be considered in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This indicates widespread growth across the altcoin sector. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This suggests that Bitcoin is the dominant performer, often attracting capital away from altcoins or simply growing faster. With the index currently at 34, it falls firmly within the definition of Bitcoin Season , implying that Bitcoin’s recent gains have largely outpaced most of the top altcoins. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: What Does 34 Mean? An Altcoin Season Index reading of 34 confirms that Bitcoin has been the primary driver of growth in the cryptocurrency space over the last three months. This period often sees Bitcoin asserting its dominance, sometimes acting as a ‘safe haven’ during uncertain times, or simply leading the charge during a broader market rally. What are the implications for your investment strategy during such a phase? Focus on Bitcoin: Investors might prioritize Bitcoin holdings, expecting it to continue its strong performance. Selective Altcoin Bets: While overall altcoin performance might lag, some specific altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique narratives could still thrive. However, this requires more careful research. Risk Management: Periods of Bitcoin dominance can sometimes precede or coincide with market corrections for altcoins, making risk management even more critical. Staying informed about these crypto market trends is key to making informed decisions. Understanding Key Cryptocurrency Cycles: Why Does Bitcoin Season Happen? Bitcoin Season isn’t just a random occurrence; it’s often a reflection of broader market sentiment and investment flows within the cryptocurrency cycles . Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Market Uncertainty: During periods of economic instability or regulatory concerns, investors often flock to Bitcoin, viewing it as a more established and less volatile asset compared to newer, smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional adoption or large-scale investments typically target Bitcoin first, given its liquidity and established infrastructure. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precede periods of significant price appreciation, drawing attention and capital. These factors can collectively steer the market into a Bitcoin Season , impacting overall altcoin performance . Implications for Your Portfolio: Adapting to Current Crypto Market Trends The current Altcoin Season Index at 34 serves as a crucial signal for investors. While it indicates Bitcoin’s strength, it doesn’t mean altcoins are without opportunity. It simply means the overall tide is not lifting all altcoin boats equally. Diversification: Even in Bitcoin Season, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risk. Consider a balanced approach that acknowledges Bitcoin’s current dominance while maintaining exposure to promising altcoins. Research is Paramount: Look beyond general market trends. Investigate individual altcoins’ use cases, development teams, and community support. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Recognize that cryptocurrency cycles are dynamic. Short-term Bitcoin dominance might give way to altcoin surges later. Ultimately, the Altcoin Season Index is a guide, not a definitive predictor. It provides valuable context for understanding current crypto market trends and how they might influence your investment strategy. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 34 clearly indicates that the cryptocurrency market is currently in a Bitcoin Season . This metric offers vital insights into the prevailing market sentiment and the relative strength of Bitcoin versus the broader altcoin market. By understanding these crypto market trends and the underlying factors driving them, investors can make more informed decisions, adapting their strategies to navigate the dynamic world of digital assets and optimize their altcoin performance . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric tracked by CoinMarketCap that measures whether the top 100 altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days, indicating a period of altcoin dominance or Bitcoin dominance. How is Altcoin Season defined by the index? Altcoin Season is defined when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This suggests broad strength across the altcoin market. What does a low Altcoin Season Index score mean? A low score, like the current 34, indicates Bitcoin Season .

What does it mean when the very entities securing the network start offloading their digital gold? Over the past three days, Bitcoin (BTC) miners sold a significant 2,000 BTC, valued at approximately $240 million, according to JinSe Finance, citing data from CryptoQuant. This substantial miner selling pressure naturally leads to questions about its potential impact on the BTC price and the overall crypto market . Why Are We Seeing Such Significant Bitcoin Miner Sales? Understanding the motivations behind these large-scale Bitcoin miner sales is crucial for gauging future Bitcoin market trends . Miners operate in a highly competitive and capital-intensive industry. Their decision to sell can stem from various factors, reflecting both operational necessities and strategic market positioning. Operational Costs: Running a Bitcoin mining operation requires significant capital for electricity, hardware maintenance, and infrastructure. Selling BTC is often necessary to cover these ongoing expenses, especially when profitability margins tighten. Hardware Upgrades: To remain competitive, miners frequently need to invest in newer, more efficient mining equipment. These upgrades can be very costly, necessitating the sale of accumulated Bitcoin. Market Conditions: Following events like the Bitcoin halving, mining rewards decrease, putting pressure on profitability. Miners might sell to adjust to these new economic realities or to capitalize on perceived price peaks before potential dips. Debt Servicing: Some mining operations take on debt for expansion or equipment. Selling BTC can be a way to service these financial obligations. This dynamic relationship between mining profitability and miner selling pressure is a constant factor in the crypto market . How Do Bitcoin Miner Sales Affect the BTC Price? Any large-scale sale of an asset, including Bitcoin, can influence its price through the basic principles of supply and demand. When miners, who are significant holders of newly minted BTC, release a substantial amount onto exchanges, it increases the available supply. If demand does not match this increased supply, the BTC price can experience downward pressure. Historically, periods of increased Bitcoin miner sales have sometimes coincided with short-term price corrections. However, it is important to remember that the Bitcoin market is vast and influenced by numerous factors beyond just miner activity. Institutional adoption, macroeconomic indicators, regulatory news, and retail investor sentiment all play significant roles. While $240 million is a notable sum, the market’s ability to absorb such sales often depends on the broader liquidity and demand present at that time. Observing these patterns helps us understand evolving Bitcoin market trends . Navigating the Current Crypto Market: What Should Investors Do? For investors, understanding the implications of Bitcoin miner sales is about gaining a fuller picture of market dynamics, not necessarily reacting to every piece of news with panic. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like CryptoQuant provide valuable insights into miner flows and other on-chain metrics. Keeping an eye on these can offer early indicators of significant selling or accumulation. Consider the Broader Context: While miner sales can exert miner selling pressure , always consider them within the context of the wider crypto market . Are other indicators bullish or bearish? What are the macroeconomic conditions? Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience over its history. Short-term fluctuations due to specific selling events are part of its journey. A long-term investment strategy often helps weather these temporary storms. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying solely on one asset can be risky. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can mitigate the impact of volatility in any single asset. These sales are a natural part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, reflecting miners’ operational needs. While they can create temporary headwinds for the BTC price , they are one piece of a much larger puzzle. In conclusion, the recent $240 million in Bitcoin miner sales highlights the continuous activity within the mining sector. While such substantial sales can introduce temporary miner selling pressure on the BTC price , they are often a strategic move by miners to sustain operations or upgrade equipment. For investors, these events serve as a reminder to stay informed about Bitcoin market trends , analyze data thoughtfully, and maintain a balanced perspective on the dynamic crypto market . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin miner sales? A1: Bitcoin miner sales refer to instances where Bitcoin mining operations sell their newly mined or accumulated BTC holdings on the open market, typically to cover operational costs, invest in upgrades, or manage financial obligations. Q2: Why do Bitcoin miners sell their BTC? A2: Miners sell BTC primarily to cover high operational expenses like electricity, hardware maintenance, and facility costs. They also sell to fund hardware upgrades, manage debt, or strategically react to changes in mining profitability and market conditions. Q3: How do these sales affect the BTC price? A3: Large Bitcoin miner sales increase the supply of BTC on exchanges, which can create downward miner selling pressure on the BTC price if demand does not absorb the increased supply. However, the overall market liquidity and broader demand often mitigate the long-term impact. Q4: Is this a sign of a bear market? A4: Not necessarily. While significant miner sales can contribute to short-term price volatility, they are a regular part of the mining cycle. A bear market is typically indicated by a sustained downturn across the entire crypto market , driven by multiple factors beyond just miner activity. Q5: Where can I track Bitcoin miner activity? A5: You can track Bitcoin miner activity and Bitcoin market trends using on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, or Arkham Intelligence, which provide data on miner flows, reserves, and other relevant metrics.

Russell Verbeeten, the Managing Director for Consensys Canada, executed a notable Consensys ETH transfer , sending a substantial amount of Ethereum to the Kraken exchange. This move has sparked considerable discussion within the crypto community, raising questions about its implications for the individual, Consensys, and the broader market. Such large transactions by a prominent crypto executive ETH holdings are always of interest. Unpacking the Massive Ethereum Deposit to Kraken Just hours ago, on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X reported a fascinating transaction. Russell Verbeeten deposited 444.653 ETH, valued at approximately $2.05 million, directly to Kraken. This Ethereum deposit Kraken confirms a significant shift of digital assets by a prominent figure in the blockchain space. The immediate nature of this transfer suggests a swift decision or response to market conditions. It’s not the first time Verbeeten’s wallet has seen considerable activity. In April, his address, which had been dormant for three years, moved an astonishing 20,000 ETH—worth about $35.46 million at the time—into the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave. This earlier transaction set a precedent for large-scale movements from his holdings, making the recent Consensys ETH transfer even more intriguing. Why the Russell Verbeeten ETH Movement Matters The pattern of transactions from Russell Verbeeten’s wallet suggests a deliberate approach to managing substantial crypto assets. His previous move into Aave demonstrated an engagement with DeFi for potential yield generation or leveraging. Now, the recent Russell Verbeeten ETH transfer to a centralized exchange like Kraken could indicate several things: Liquidation or Diversification: The funds might be intended for conversion into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. Strategic Positioning: He might be preparing to participate in specific trading opportunities or utilize Kraken’s services for other financial activities. Security Considerations: Moving funds from DeFi to a centralized exchange could also be a strategic choice for perceived enhanced security or easier access, particularly for a high-profile crypto executive ETH holder. These movements are particularly noteworthy given Verbeeten’s role at Consensys, a leading blockchain software company known for its work on Ethereum infrastructure, including MetaMask and Infura. While personal transactions, they can sometimes be seen through the lens of broader industry trends or expert sentiment regarding ETH market implications . Assessing the ETH Market Implications of Such Transfers While a $2.05 million Consensys ETH transfer is significant for an individual, it’s important to consider its broader ETH market implications . On its own, this specific deposit is unlikely to cause a massive ripple effect on Ethereum’s price. The crypto market handles billions in daily volume, and individual large transactions, while notable, often don’t move the needle significantly unless they are part of a coordinated large-scale event or signal a major institutional shift. However, they do offer transparency into the actions of influential figures. The decision by a crypto executive ETH holder to make such a substantial Ethereum deposit Kraken highlights the ongoing activity of high-net-worth individuals and executives within the crypto ecosystem. Their actions are often watched closely as indicators of confidence, risk appetite, or shifts in strategy. The move, especially after a period of dormancy and a prior DeFi engagement, provides a glimpse into the diverse strategies employed by seasoned crypto participants. Key Takeaways from This Crypto Executive’s ETH Activity This incident serves as a reminder of the transparency offered by public blockchains. Every transaction, including this recent Consensys ETH transfer , is recorded and traceable, allowing on-chain analysts to monitor and report significant movements. For the average crypto holder, this transparency offers a unique vantage point to observe the behavior of large players and market veterans, and understand potential ETH market implications . It also underscores the dynamic nature of crypto asset management. From long-term holding to active participation in DeFi and strategic transfers to exchanges, individuals like Russell Verbeeten navigate a complex landscape to optimize their digital asset portfolios. Understanding these moves helps in comprehending the multifaceted strategies employed in the evolving world of decentralized finance and digital currencies. In conclusion, the recent Russell Verbeeten ETH deposit to Kraken is a noteworthy event, signaling another significant movement of Ethereum by a key industry figure. While the exact motivations remain private, the on-chain data provides valuable insights into the ongoing strategic management of large crypto holdings and the continuous flow of assets within the dynamic crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Russell Verbeeten? Russell Verbeeten is the Managing Director for Consensys Canada, a leading blockchain software company involved in Ethereum infrastructure. Q2: How much ETH did Russell Verbeeten transfer to Kraken? He deposited 444.653 ETH, which was valued at approximately $2.05 million at the time of the transfer. Q3: What was Russell Verbeeten’s previous large ETH transaction? In April, after three years of dormancy, his address moved 20,000 ETH (worth about $35.46 million then) into the DeFi lending protocol Aave. Q4: Why would a crypto executive make such a large Ethereum deposit to Kraken? Reasons could include preparing for liquidation into fiat, diversifying holdings, engaging in specific trading opportunities, or seeking enhanced security on a centralized exchange. Q5: Will this Consensys ETH transfer significantly impact Ethereum’s price?

Mutuum Finance is in presale Phase 6 and is currently priced $0.035. Its next price increase will have the token reaching $0.04 in phase 7. Early investors who have taken positions are set to see at least 400% returns once the token goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has exceeded more than $14.3 million raised and gained more than 15100 token holders. As XRP’s breakout gains momentum, Mutuum Finance’s growth narrative is cutting through the noise, leveraging blockchain-powered risk management and yield strategies that could redefine decentralized lending in 2025. XRP Approaches Breakout After Legal Resolution XRP is trading at approximately $3.21, navigating within a daily range of $3.16 to $3.34. The token has gained renewed momentum following the conclusion of the Ripple, SEC lawsuit, which sparked a 10% surge and lifted XRP close to its all-time high. XRP is now testing resistance near $3.60, with charts suggesting that a sustained breakout could pave the way toward the $4.60 level next. In the broader context of altcoin trends and investor rotation, XRP remains highly relevant, even as emerging DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enter the spotlight. Mutuum Finance Opens Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has completed Phase 5 of its presale and progressed to Phase 6, where its tokens are available at $0.035. Its next price increase will boost the price of its tokens by 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already raised over $14.3 million and acquired over 15100 holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Collaborates with CertiK to Announce $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is collaborating with CertiK in launching a Bug Bounty Program. The program has a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. There are four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical which will be rewarded under the program. The program is a mirror image of the vision of Mutuum Finance to build community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been subjected to a rigorous audit by Certik for security of users’ funds and blockchain security. This is a milestone along Mutuum Finance’s journey for an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 winners will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens. It has also recently announced that a leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders. Mutuum Finance is a P2P and P2C lending protocol where the customer has the opportunity to gain high returns with complete control over funds. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience that is well optimized to the customer’s needs and is safer, clearer, and more flexible than the conventional centralized lending products. XRP’s breakout momentum is grabbing headlines, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly setting up for what could be one of 2025’s most explosive DeFi launches. Now in Phase 6 at $0.035, with over $14.3 million raised from 15,100+ investors, MUTM combines dual lending models, a 95.0 CertiK trust score, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 token giveaway to drive both security and adoption. With the next presale stage pushing the price to $0.04, a 14.29% increase, the entry window before launch is closing quickly. Analysts project at least 4x returns at launch, with the potential for much higher gains as the protocol rolls out in full. Early movers could be securing one of the most lucrative positions in the coming DeFi cycle.

In this dynamic landscape, central banks are carefully considering their role in fostering innovation while safeguarding traditional financial systems. The Bank of Korea is no exception, actively shaping its approach to the burgeoning sector of stablecoins, particularly the potential for a Won stablecoin . Why a Bank-Led Won Stablecoin? A Strategic Approach Lee Byung-mok, director of the Bank of Korea’s Payment & Settlement Systems Department, recently shared a crucial perspective on the issuance of a South Korean won-denominated stablecoin. He advocates for a phased approach, beginning with traditional banks and gradually expanding to non-bank participants through a consortium model. This strategy aims to ensure a controlled and secure integration of digital assets into the existing financial framework. The primary concern stems from the potential for large corporations or big tech firms to issue stablecoins. Such a scenario, he cautions, could inadvertently allow these entities to function like banks, accepting deposits without adhering to established banking and electronic finance laws. This would directly challenge Korea’s fundamental principle of separating banking from commerce, posing significant risks to financial stability . Navigating Stablecoin Regulation: The Korean Approach The Bank of Korea’s proposed consortium model offers a structured pathway for stablecoin development. By initially restricting issuance to regulated financial institutions, the central bank maintains oversight and control, mitigating systemic risks that could arise from unregulated digital asset activities. This thoughtful approach to stablecoin regulation is vital for building trust and ensuring market integrity. The benefits of this bank-centric model include: Enhanced Consumer Protection: Banks operate under strict regulatory frameworks, offering greater safeguards for users’ funds. Reduced Systemic Risk: Centralized issuance by regulated entities helps prevent potential financial contagion. Monetary Policy Effectiveness: Maintaining control over the currency’s digital form supports the central bank’s ability to manage monetary policy. Alignment with Existing Laws: It ensures that new financial instruments comply with established legal principles. This measured strategy paves the way for a responsible evolution of the Digital Won , ensuring it complements rather than disrupts the nation’s economic foundation. Ensuring Financial Stability in the Digital Age The discussion around a Won stablecoin is not just about technological innovation; it is fundamentally about preserving financial stability . The Bank of Korea understands that while stablecoins offer efficiency and new payment avenues, their unchecked proliferation could create shadow banking systems. These systems might operate outside regulatory scrutiny, potentially leading to instability during economic downturns or periods of high volatility. Therefore, the emphasis on a bank-led model is a proactive measure to: Prevent regulatory arbitrage. Maintain the integrity of the payment system. Protect consumers and investors from unforeseen risks. The Bank of Korea’s stance underscores a commitment to innovation that is both secure and sustainable. The Road Ahead for the Won Stablecoin The journey towards a fully integrated Won stablecoin will likely be incremental. Starting with banks provides a secure sandbox for development and testing, allowing regulators to gather crucial insights before expanding the ecosystem. This careful expansion through a consortium model suggests a collaborative future, where innovation and regulatory oversight can coexist harmoniously. The Bank of Korea’s vision is clear: to embrace the potential of digital currencies while upholding the robust principles that have long underpinned South Korea’s financial system. This balanced approach sets a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. In conclusion, the Bank of Korea is taking a prudent and strategic approach to the development of a Won stablecoin . By advocating for bank-led issuance and a phased expansion, they aim to harness the benefits of digital currency while rigorously maintaining financial stability and adhering to sound stablecoin regulation . This thoughtful stance ensures that Korea’s digital future is built on a foundation of security and compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Won stablecoin? A Won stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won, aiming to offer the benefits of digital assets without price volatility. Why does the Bank of Korea prefer banks to issue stablecoins? The Bank of Korea prefers banks to issue stablecoins to ensure compliance with existing financial regulations, maintain financial stability, and prevent large corporations from operating like banks without proper oversight. What are the risks of large corporations issuing stablecoins? Allowing large corporations or big tech firms to issue stablecoins could enable them to take deposits by sidestepping existing banking laws, potentially violating the principle of separating banking from commerce and creating systemic risks. How will the consortium model work for stablecoin issuance? The consortium model proposes that initial Won stablecoin issuance starts with banks. Later, non-bank participants could join through a collaborative framework, allowing for controlled expansion under regulatory guidance. What is the primary goal of Korea’s stablecoin regulation? The primary goal of Korea’s stablecoin regulation, as highlighted by the Bank of Korea, is to ensure financial stability, protect consumers, and maintain the integrity of the payment system by integrating digital currencies responsibly.

Across Ethereum, Avalanche, Dogecoin, and even select meme coins, large-scale accumulation is accelerating. Historically, this behavior precedes major market rallies as retail traders follow the lead of these market-moving entities. But the latest rotation trend is worth noting: several whales who recently took profits from Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are now reallocating capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE , a presale-stage project building momentum ahead of its debut on centralized exchanges. This early migration hints that large players are positioning for both short-term upside in blue chips and long-term exponential gains in promising small caps. Ethereum Leads the Charge Ethereum remains the undisputed favorite among whale buyers. More than 200 new addresses holding over 10,000 ETH have appeared since July, pushing large-holder netflows up 270% in a single week. In total, whales have accumulated over $300 million in ETH during recent dips, buoyed by steady ETF inflows — including allocations to BlackRock’s Ethereum Trust. Layer-1 and Meme Coin Picks Avalanche (AVAX): Whale netflows into AVAX have surged 380%, with accumulation outpacing selling for weeks. Technical analysts say sustained demand could push AVAX through key resistance and toward new all-time highs. Dogecoin (DOGE): Large holders have snapped up over 2.1 billion DOGE, taking advantage of pullbacks. Total whale holdings now exceed 26.39 billion DOGE, reviving talk of another speculative rally. Binance Coin (BNB): Addresses holding at least 10,000 BNB have grown sharply since July’s price correction, indicating whale confidence in a rebound. Toncoin (TON): Despite price swings, TON’s net whale inflows remain firmly positive — a sign of conviction tied to its Telegram-linked adoption story. Meme Coins Gaining Ground PEPE: Wallets worth over $1M boosted their PEPE holdings by 1.36% in early August, supporting a price floor even during consolidation. Pengu (PENGU): A niche meme coin, PENGU has seen 11% whale wallet growth in just days, a sign of strong speculative interest MAGACOIN FINANCE — A Whale-Watched Newcomer While established altcoins dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a magnet for opportunistic whale capital. Early blockchain scans show wallets associated with high-value traders steadily building positions during the presale phase. The attraction is clear: MAGACOIN offers a fixed supply, dual independent audits, and an engaged community , giving it both credibility and viral growth potential. As one analyst put it, “This is one of the few small caps where you see the same whale wallet patterns that preceded DOGE and SHIB’s breakout years.” With exchange listings on the horizon, some whales are reallocating recent ADA and SOL profits into MAGACOIN, betting that its debut could deliver outsized percentage gains compared to already-mature Layer-1s. The Bigger Picture Mega-whale accumulation matters because it drives liquidity, sets the tone for retail sentiment, and often sparks trend reversals. This month’s buying patterns reveal a two-pronged strategy: Blue-chip stacking in ETH, AVAX, and BNB for network stability and institutional flows. High-risk, high-reward positioning in meme coins and early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture asymmetric upside. If history repeats, the next few months could see these positions mature into the kind of rallies that define market cycles. For investors, tracking whale moves — especially when they converge on a mix of proven assets and emerging players — can provide a valuable early signal.

The partnership brings together high-profile industry players, including Tron and Tether, and blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs in the fight against scams, hacks, and money laundering activity affecting billions of dollars in funds belonging to users and businesses around the globe. The team has yielded major dividends in less than a year. It has now frozen over $250 million in illegal cryptoassets (more than double the amount reported seized during their first six months). From major investment frauds and ransomware attacks to blackmailing and terror financing, these assets relate to everything. The achievement highlights the depth of the threat to the crypto sector and the increasingly adept nature of collaborative strike-back in a more organized fashion. T3 FCU freezes illicit crypto worldwide The T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) is a real-time system for tracking and dismantling illicit blockchain transactions through public-private collaboration. Founding members Tron, Tether, and TRM Labs work closely with law enforcement agencies worldwide to combat money laundering, investment fraud, extortion, terrorism financing, and other financial crimes. Pooling resources, the group monitored suspicious deals worth billions of dollars and intercepted high-value assets before disappearing into hidden channels. New figures from the group show the sums are frozen in generic terms, making up thousands of individual cases across over 100 countries. The new T3+ program broadens the reach of that unit by including exchanges, banks, and other industry participants to share intelligence in real time. The WEF has just announced that Binance will be the first to join, introducing global projects, which is a big step forward. Binance’s inaugural collaboration with T3 FCU saw the exchange freeze nearly $6 million tied to long-term online fraud dubbed a “pig butchering” scam, bilking victims into fake investments. This partnership will allow Binance compliance and security teams to work closely with T3 FCU analysts to help flag and freeze suspected funds faster than possible. The founder of Tron, Justin Sun, said the move would broaden existing and new collaborations to curb illicit activity on the blockchain in real time. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that bad actors have nowhere to hide on the blockchain when companies collaborate. Hackers speed up attacks, leaving less time to act The alliance is, notably, timely. More than $3 billion in crypto was stolen in the first half of 2025, according to a report from Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger. Some of this activity happens in seconds, as hackers have been known to clean out an account within less than 3 minutes from when they first breached it. Breach-to-funds-moved time averages 15 hours. The money is fully laundered in about 23% of cases before the public discovers the hack. The recovery rates are abysmal; in contrast, only 4.2% of the stolen funds were dealt with in the year’s first half. Theft prevention is where centralized exchanges become critical, but in a race against time. The report said that about 15% of the illegal cryptocurrency goes through these platforms, adding that compliance teams typically have around 10–15 minutes to block suspect trades before funds vanish. While in principle, T3 FCU has returned a lot of money, the means are inciting a lot of criticism from the crypto community. Tether froze $86k of stolen USDT. It was only last month that Tether popped up in the news headlines as it froze $86,000 of stolen USDT and prompted once again discussion over centralized control within an otherwise decentralized ecosystem. Finally, critics have cautioned that enabling stablecoin issuers and exchanges to freeze particular transactions could undermine user autonomy. However, supporters say it is an essential tool to shield victims and keep faith in the system. Industry leaders say that the best defence is to work together.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, ETH is trading above $4600, up 10% in the last 24 hours, as the possibility of a rate cut in September works its way through the market. Some traders see it likely that ETH could quickly challenge its all-time high of $4876 set in 2021. Polymarket bettors are going a step further; they believe that $5000 is possible before the end of August, and they are also giving a 28% chance of the asset's price crossing $5800 before the month ends. The surge has helped pull bitcoin dominance down from 65% to 59% as traders rotate into altcoins. In a recent report, analysts at Glassnode wrote that ETH is now nearing the +1 standard deviation “Active Realized Price” band around $4.7K, a level that has triggered heavy selling in past cycles. But behind the scenes, there's a growing liquidity sink that might weigh heavily on ETH's next phase of growth. A new CryptoQuant report shows that Ethereum is increasingly serving as a liquidity source for TRON’s USDT ecosystem. On Aug. 9, CryptoQuant data shows that a record $7.7 million worth of ETH was bridged to TRON and converted into USDT, while June 25 saw $19 million worth of ERC20 tokens, mostly USDC, make the same move. Inflows from TRON back to Ethereum remain minimal, highlighting a one-way flow of value that supports TRON’s stablecoin economy but siphons liquidity from Ethereum’s native DeFi activity. Over time, persistent outflows can weigh on spot demand and reduce Ethereum’s ongoing fee revenue and staking rewards as more of the stablecoin economy clears elsewhere. If this trend persists, Ethereum’s role could increasingly resemble that of a wholesale funding layer, powering liquidity for rival networks rather than capturing the transactional activity itself. That dynamic may not derail the current rally in the short term, but it could limit the sustainability of higher valuations if capital flight toward faster, cheaper settlement layers like TRON continues unchecked. But for now, the market has its eyes on $5K ETH. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin holds $119,943 (+0.4%) with bullish momentum intact, though resistance looms at $123K amid ETF outflows and ETH’s rally, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: ETH is trading above $4600 as the possibility of a 50 bps rate cut looms large. Gold: Gold edged up to around $3,350 as U.S. inflation data reinforced Fed rate cut bets, while easing U.S.-China trade tensions limited gains. S&P 500: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs as July CPI data met expectations, boosting bets on a September Fed rate cut and lifting tech stocks. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened higher Wednesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1% after a record close Tuesday.

50003632,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=783563,1755050344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50003632.jpeg,Coinbase brings back the stablecoin bootstrap fund to expand USDC liquidity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-revives-stablecoin-bootstrap-fund/,"Coinbase is reopening its revamped Stablecoin Bootstrap Fund for the first time in nearly six years, aiming to boost stablecoin liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Initially, the fund will provide liquidity to Aave, Morpho, Kamino, and Jupiter, with Coinbase Asset Management overseeing the program. It will supply liquidity in USDC and EURC on behalf of Circle, with plans to add other stablecoins. According to Coinbase’s chief business officer, Shan Aggarwal, the fund’s purpose is to “deploy capital in on-chain protocols to ensure sufficient liquidity for their unique use cases.” The total size of the fund remains undisclosed. The initial focus is on major DeFi platforms: Aave and Morpho on Ethereum, known for lending and borrowing, and Kamino and Jupiter on Solana, recognized for liquidity provision and trade aggregation. In a statement to CNBC, Coinbase emphasized that these moves are part of a long-term strategy to guarantee ongoing USDC availability for both established and emerging networks . This effort aims to lower borrowing costs, minimize trading slippage, and support protocol growth. Coinbase builds on 2019’s success Coinbase has been leveraging its balance sheet to supercharge the growing DeFi ecosystem. This new fund follows its first Stablecoin Bootstrap Fund, launched in 2019. American stablecoin saw a launch to seed liquidity for the USDC when it was still new to the open, decentralized markets. This was simple but very effective in the first phase. Compound, a crypto-based lending and borrowing platform, received $1 million in investment from Coinbase, with another $1 million going to dYdX, a derivatives trading venue. There were no grants; they were working capital redeployed to protocol liquidity pools to lower borrowing costs and speed up trade. The effort didn’t stop there as Coinbase diversified beyond IRL companies last year by including Uniswap (one of the biggest decentralized exchanges) and PoolTogether (a no-loss savings game rooted in the DeFi concept) in the fund. The $1.1 million Binance Balance Injection process was a further onchain staining of USDC utility in everyday activity. The results were significant. These early liquidity injections helped USDC become a fundamental store of value and vehicle currency throughout DeFi. By guaranteeing that traders and borrowers could always access USDC with frictionless, stable rates, this enabled significant trust and adoption in the fund. Today, USDC has evolved into a multi-chain powerhouse. It operates across all the previously mentioned ecosystems and Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, processing billions in daily transactions. Integrated into thousands of smart contracts, it underpins borrowing markets with several billion dollars locked at any given time. Coinbase says the timing of the relaunch matters. “Onchain financial services are at an inflection point,” the company added, arguing that both crypto natives and newcomers are increasingly turning to stablecoin-powered DeFi tools for borrowing, lending, and trading instead of traditional alternatives. Coinbase aims to support emerging projects In addition to more established names, Coinbase intends to support smaller or newer protocols. These projects often have difficulty gaining early liquidity, which may hinder their growth potential. Coinbase said it is seeding the pools and lending markets by injecting them with stablecoins directly to give them a more robust start, at least on its platform. The method would further stabilize interest rates by improving predictability for users of DeFi products. This purchase will allow us to put together even more resources to accelerate the interest and use we are seeing today,” Aggarwal said. He recommended that the liquidity support be token “agnostic” and decided on a protocol-by-protocol basis. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

However, as of the latest trading session, the asset is showing signs of correction. At the time of writing, XRP is valued at $3.17, representing a 1.2% decline over the past 24 hours from its recent high of roughly $3.22. The recent surge in XRP’s value was largely driven by a major legal development. On August 7, 2025, the long-running US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple and its executives officially concluded. The end of the case removed a significant source of uncertainty for the asset and sparked immediate price gains. However, on-chain data suggests that the rally may have been driven more by shifts within the existing investor base rather than by new market participation. Related Reading: XRP Stumbles, But A Recovery Could Be Around The Corner XRP On-Chain Indicators Show Mixed Market Dynamics CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain observed that daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger fell by more than 10% to around 24,701 following the legal resolution. This decline, despite the price increase, indicates that the upward movement was likely supported by capital rotation from existing holders instead of new user adoption. In the analyst’s view, the absence of a fresh wave of participants could limit the rally’s long-term momentum unless broader retail engagement picks up. Exchange flow data offers additional insight. Both Binance and Upbit recorded notable spikes in depositing addresses just before and immediately after the SEC case outcome was announced. Historically, such inflow surges can signal that traders are positioning for profit-taking or short-term speculation. At the same time, withdrawals also rose during this period, implying that some new entrants were building positions. The presence of both trends highlights a mix of motives in market activity, from short-term trading to longer-term accumulation. Liquidity Concentration and Market Outlook Changes in exchange reserves further illustrate the evolving market structure for XRP. After a period of decline, Binance’s XRP holdings have been increasing again, while Upbit’s reserves have maintained a steady upward trend. This reflects a growing role for the Asian market in supporting XRP trading volume. Conversely, OKX now holds almost no XRP, suggesting that most of its reserves have been withdrawn from the exchange. CryptoOnchain noted that the combination of higher prices alongside a drop in active user numbers points toward a market environment dominated by a smaller, concentrated group of traders. If exchange reserves continue to build rapidly, the probability of a short-term correction could increase, especially if profit-taking accelerates. While the resolution of the SEC case has removed a major legal risk for XRP, the sustainability of recent price gains may depend on attracting new market participants and reducing short-term selling pressure.

The oracle network’s deepening partnership with SWIFT now connects more than 11,000 financial institutions to both public and private blockchains, positioning Chainlink as critical infrastructure in the transition from traditional banking to blockchain integration. Institutional Adoption and DeFi Integration Accelerate Chainlink’s (LINK) Ascent At Chainlink’s recent SmartCon event , the network showcased its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), successfully linking SWIFT’s legacy messaging system with multiple blockchain networks. Trials with major banks, including BNY Mellon and BNP Paribas, demonstrated the real-world potential for moving tokenized assets seamlessly across different chains. The institutional roster continues to expand with collaborations involving the DTCC, Mastercard, and several central banks. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the NYSE, recently integrated its forex and precious metals data with Chainlink oracles, providing high-quality, tamper-proof financial data for DeFi applications. Technical Breakout Puts $30 in Sight From a technical perspective, LINK has broken out of a long-term descending trendline that has capped price action since December 2024. The move followed a double-bottom retest at the $18 level, signaling a shift in momentum. Analysts highlight $24 as the key resistance to watch, clearing it could trigger an accelerated move toward $30–$35. More aggressive projections point to $95–$100 if LINK sustains the breakout from its multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern formed since 2021. Currently trading above $21, LINK has defended critical support levels established during the recent rally, maintaining its bullish structure. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence On-chain data shows whales have purchased over $13 million worth of LINK in recent sessions, including a notable 510,000 LINK withdrawal from Binance to Compound. The number of daily active addresses has jumped from 5,500 to over 9,400, reflecting growing participation from both retail and institutional players. Decentralized exchange volumes have also spiked, surpassing $1.29 billion in 24 hours, suggesting that demand for Chainlink’s oracle services is driving activity beyond speculative trading. With a $15 billion market cap securing over $59.5 billion in assets, analysts argue LINK remains undervalued. If the bullish trend continues and institutional adoption deepens, a rally toward $30, and possibly far beyond, appears increasingly plausible.

Ripple Labs has officially settled its long-running case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), clearing years of regulatory uncertainty. The outcome has fueled a sharp rise in price and renewed institutional attention. Alongside XRP’s rebound, traders are looking at other high-upside opportunities, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is gaining momentum in its presale phase. A legal cloud lifts, and XRP takes off For years, the SEC lawsuit created hesitation around XRP’s adoption, costing it partnerships and slowing progress in global payments. The settlement changes that. Market analysts say the resolution restores confidence in XRP’s role as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions and in Ripple’s growing list of central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. In the hours following the news, XRP traded between $3.20 and $3.27, with trading volume surging past $12 billion. Technical analysts are watching the $3.35 level closely; breaking above it could open the way to $3.70, $4.46, and possibly $5.00 before year-end. Institutional interest and ETF chatter The end of the legal battle has sparked speculation about a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). With regulatory clarity now in place, some market watchers believe large financial firms could explore XRP-based products, which would likely attract new demand. Several analysts have raised their long-term price models, with some pointing to $7–$10 targets for 2026 if adoption continues at the current pace. Institutional flows, particularly from payment-focused funds, are expected to play a key role in sustaining momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE attracts high-upside investors While XRP dominates the headlines, a growing number of retail and early-stage investors are looking elsewhere for outsized gains. ROI analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE will hit 66x before the year’s end , citing strong whale accumulation and rapidly expanding community engagement. The project has been selling out presale stages at record speed. Its fixed token supply, zero-tax trading model, and verified audits are appealing to traders seeking both security and potential exponential growth. Market trackers report increasing wallet activity from large holders, suggesting confidence ahead of its planned exchange listings. The next phase for XRP and the altcoin market With the lawsuit behind it, XRP’s adoption push is expected to accelerate. Ripple is expanding payment corridors in Asia-Pacific, exploring CBDC pilots, and strengthening ties with traditional finance institutions. These moves could support both utility and price in the months ahead. At the same time, the broader altcoin market is rotating capital between established assets and promising newcomers. XRP’s rise has already boosted interest in politically-themed and narrative-driven projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. If current momentum holds, both could see significant moves as the 2025 bull cycle approaches.

Why BlockDAG’s $371M Presale Run & Global Sponsorships Are Fueling Bold Predictions!,https://thecoinrise.com/from-0-0276-to-1-why-blockdags-371m-presale-run-global-sponsorships-are-fueling-bold-predictions/,"The crypto market has seen its share of bold forecasts, but when several analysts start pointing to the same target, it becomes hard to ignore. BlockDAG (BDAG) , a hybrid Layer 1 network already ranking among the most talked-about presales in recent years, is now being positioned as a potential $1 token after launch. With $371 million raised, a Batch 29 price of $0.0276, and adoption metrics surpassing many active networks, the conversation has shifted from whether BlockDAG can compete to how far it can go. The presale performance has been exceptional by any measure. Reaching the $371 million milestone puts BlockDAG in the company of Avalanche and Solana’s early fundraising stages, a rare achievement for a project that has yet to launch. This substantial capital base gives the team the means to enter the market with strong liquidity, far-reaching marketing campaigns, and powerful incentives aimed at attracting both developers and users from day one. Architecture Designed for Scale and Lasting Impact One reason the $1 target has captured so much attention is BlockDAG’s hybrid architecture. The network fuses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, delivering parallel transaction processing while preserving Bitcoin-level decentralization and security. This setup supports throughput between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions per second, giving BlockDAG the performance headroom needed for massive scaling. In a market where congestion and high fees have crippled competitors like Ethereum during peak demand, this infrastructure offers a decisive advantage for sustained value growth. Most new Layer 1 chains face their toughest test after mainnet, struggling to onboard developers, attract dApps, and build a user base from zero. BlockDAG has flipped that script, securing its community and ecosystem ahead of launch. Over 4,500 developers are already engaged, with more than 300 dApps in the works, creating a ready-to-deploy environment from day one. The X1 mobile miner app now counts 2.5 million active users, while over 200,000 BDAG holders have positioned themselves early. On the hardware side, 19,000 ASIC miners have been sold, ensuring a secure, distributed hashrate from the start. This level of preparation means BlockDAG will not crawl out of the gate—it will launch at full sprint. Visibility and Marketing Driving the $1 Ambition Reaching $1 requires more than cutting-edge tech; it demands a strong market presence. BlockDAG has proven its ability to command attention through high-profile sponsorships with Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan, coupled with global media exposure. These campaigns place BlockDAG in front of millions worldwide, giving it a brand reach that most projects cannot match before listing. With its active content strategy and community-led promotions, the project is set to dominate discussion as it approaches mainnet and exchange listings in the months ahead. While crypto price forecasts are never certain, history shows that Layer 1 projects with advanced infrastructure, robust developer pipelines, and significant pre-launch adoption often see explosive growth after listing. If BlockDAG maintains its momentum, draws major liquidity providers, and keeps expanding its ecosystem, a climb to $1 within two years is within realistic reach. Such a move would put its market cap in the multi-billion-dollar range, achievable if current adoption trends continue. At the Batch 29 price of $0.0276, the presale offers a steep discount against the confirmed $0.05 listing price. For those who believe in the $1 target, this represents a potential 3,523% ROI from today’s level. As each batch progresses and prices increase, this window will close quickly, making early entry essential for securing maximum upside. With $371 million already raised and the $600 million target drawing near, available supply for presale buyers will not last long. Key Insights BlockDAG is more than a passing presale trend. It is a well-capitalized, technically advanced Layer 1 network supported by an active community and a growing base of developers. While the $1 goal is ambitious, its blend of scalability, security, global marketing presence, and strong pre-launch adoption gives it a realistic path toward that milestone. Whether it reaches the target within a year or takes two, the growth trajectory points toward substantial gains. For those searching for the best crypto to buy today, the current Batch 29 price could be the ideal entry point before the next stage pushes it higher.

50003403,https://thecoinrise.com/best-long-term-crypto-cold-wallets-50x-roi-projection-outshines-sol-and-link/,1755050455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50003403.jpeg,Best Long Term Crypto: Cold Wallet’s 50x ROI Projection Outshines SOL and LINK,https://thecoinrise.com/best-long-term-crypto-cold-wallets-50x-roi-projection-outshines-sol-and-link/,"In 2025, the competition for the best long term crypto investments is intense, with established projects and rising stars battling for investor attention. The Solana (SOL) rally prediction has been boosted by a strong technical breakout pattern, while the Chainlink (LINK) bullish rally outlook is gaining traction as it approaches a key resistance level that could nearly double its value. Both SOL and LINK have proven track records, active ecosystems, and credible growth narratives. Yet, Cold Wallet’s 50x ROI projection and innovative rewards-based model position it as more than just another token. By turning everyday crypto activity into a source of earnings, it could redefine how investors view the best long term crypto investments in the years ahead. Solana (SOL) Rally Prediction The Solana (SOL) rally prediction is underpinned by a bullish “cup and handle” breakout pattern that has analysts eyeing $260 as the next major target. This technical setup is strengthened by increasing volume, favorable RSI levels, and a consistent influx of institutional interest. Solana’s reputation for speed and scalability continues to attract developers and projects, adding depth to its long-term growth case. Beyond charts, Solana’s expanding role in DeFi, NFTs, and payments supports its inclusion among the best long term crypto investments. A decisive move past $260 could open the door to even higher valuations in 2025, potentially driving renewed market enthusiasm. Still, while the Solana (SOL) rally prediction offers appealing upside, it remains a traditional price appreciation story. Cold Wallet’s model, which combines ROI potential with tangible utility, may offer a more dynamic path to growth for investors willing to diversify beyond established Layer-1 blockchains. Chainlink (LINK) Bullish Rally Outlook The Chainlink (LINK) bullish rally outlook is building momentum as the token edges closer to a key resistance zone. A breakout could trigger a 95% rally, lifting LINK toward $40. This bullish setup is supported by Chainlink’s central role in providing oracle services across DeFi and real-world asset protocols, making it an essential infrastructure component. Growing adoption and integration across multiple blockchain networks have solidified Chainlink’s position as a leader in interoperability solutions. These fundamentals make the Chainlink (LINK) bullish rally outlook more than just a short-term trading signal, it’s a reflection of the project’s enduring value proposition. While LINK is undoubtedly one of the best long term crypto investments in the utility token category, even its most optimistic forecasts pale in comparison to Cold Wallet’s 50x ROI projection. The choice for investors comes down to stability versus aggressive growth potential. Cold Wallet’s Rewards-Based 50x Potential Cold Wallet isn’t just about self-custody. It’s about getting rewarded every time you use crypto the way it’s meant to be used. Enter $CWT, the utility token that turns everyday actions into value. Every time you pay gas, swap tokens, or move funds on or off chain, you earn CWT automatically. No extra steps, no hidden conditions, just usage turned into earnings. Gas cashback is a core feature. Depending on your tier, you can earn back a percentage of your gas costs, up to 100% for top-tier holders. Swap rewards work the same way, the more CWT you hold, the higher your cashback on in-app trades. Even on/off-ramp transactions between crypto and fiat return value to the user in the form of CWT. These rewards are powered by a dedicated token reserve built to support real-world usage at scale. Tiered rewards maintain a balanced ecosystem, while a halving schedule ensures sustainability as adoption grows. With every feature tied directly to user activity, Cold Wallet aligns long-term holding with ongoing engagement. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, with $5.9M raised and 698.39M tokens sold, Cold Wallet’s projected launch price of $0.3517 gives early investors a 50x ROI target. This combination of tangible utility and aggressive growth potential makes it a clear contender for the best long term crypto investments, standing apart from the purely price-driven prospects in the Solana (SOL) rally prediction and Chainlink (LINK) bullish rally outlook stories. Last Say The Solana (SOL) rally prediction offers a well-supported path to higher prices, driven by technical patterns and expanding ecosystem adoption. The Chainlink (LINK) bullish rally outlook is equally compelling, with strong fundamentals and integration across the blockchain space. Both deserve their place among the best long term crypto investments for 2025.

Analysts Tip Arctic Pablo as the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now with Neiro Oversold and PENGU Staying Bullish,https://timestabloid.com/10x-rise-analysts-tip-arctic-pablo-as-the-top-new-meme-coin/,"What happens when a presale coin’s journey feels like an epic adventure, and also packs the kind of ROI projections that make seasoned investors pause mid-trade? The market is buzzing as Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) surges toward the final stage of its meme coin presale, offering growth potential that outshines many post-launch plays. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is holding whale interest despite a short-term price dip, and Neiro (NEIRO) appears to be catching its breath after a parabolic run. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale performance, fueled by a vibrant community and deflationary mechanics, has many calling it the top new meme coin to invest in now. This article breaks down the latest on all three tokens, Arctic Pablo Coin, Pudgy Penguins, and Neiro, and why the APC presale is becoming a magnet for both whales and early-stage investors. What Makes Arctic Pablo the Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now What if a coin could combine a gripping mythical backstory with real-world staking rewards of 66% APY, weekly token burns, and price stages that climb toward massive percentage gains? That’s precisely the formula Arctic Pablo Coin has executed since launch. Currently in Stage 36, Horizon Haven, APC is priced at just $0.0008, with over $3.35 million raised. From here, the math gets exciting: 900% ROI from the current price to the listing price of $0.008. 12,400% ROI if analysts’ projections of $0.10 are reached post-launch. An investor putting $15,000 in today would receive 18,750,000 APC. At the presale’s end price of $0.008, that’s $150,000, before factoring in potential upside beyond launch. But APC’s appeal isn’t only about numbers. It’s mythical Arctic Pablo adventure, from Atlantis to Horizon Haven, creates a brand identity that’s immersive, memorable, and primed for community engagement. Weekly unsold token burns and a max supply cap of 221.2 billion add scarcity, while the Binance Smart Chain backbone ensures low fees and high-speed transactions. With staking rewards vested for two months post-launch, early participants lock in both yield and price advantage. For those watching meme coin presales as a hedge against market volatility, APC offers a structured, story-driven approach that blends entertainment with calculated investment mechanics. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Momentum Builds Toward Final Phase The Horizon Haven stage is the gateway to APC’s public debut. Each stage completion has steadily increased the token price, rewarding early participants with compounding percentage gains. This strategic meme coin presale’s weekly burn mechanism eliminates unsold coins permanently, creating a deflationary model that benefits holders and reinforces price pressure. For whales and high-net-worth entrants, the ability to secure millions of APC at sub-penny pricing before a high-volume listing of this top new meme coin to invest in now is an opportunity rarely available in such a structured format. In narrative terms, Horizon Haven marks the point where Arctic Pablo’s snowmobile journey reaches its climactic chapter, and the coin itself becomes the symbol of the expedition’s reward. Investors entering now aren’t just buying tokens; they’re securing a stake in a launch that already has market attention, liquidity strategies, and exchange listings in place. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Hold Whale Attention Amid Price Pullback Pudgy Penguins is trading around $0.0356–$0.037, down roughly 8–13% over the past 24 hours, with a market cap near $2.2B–$2.4B and $600M+ in daily volume. Despite the dip, technical analysts are watching a bullish cup-and-handle pattern, with breakout potential above $0.042 targeting the $0.05–$0.06 range. On-chain data shows whales accumulating during the decline, suggesting confidence in a rebound. PENGU’s social momentum remains strong, with over 200 billion “mindshare” views recently, reinforcing its position as a cultural force in the meme coin space. Neiro (NEIRO) Enters a Cooling Phase After Parabolic Gains Neiro, priced near $0.000399, has seen a ~7% drop in the past 24 hours with $64M in daily trading volume and a market cap of about $167M. The token is nearly at full circulating supply (420.69 billion NEIRO) and remains down over 87% from its all-time high of $0.0030. Recent market action shows resistance around $0.0004460, with some traders eyeing a potential short-term retrace to $0.0003935. However, its RSI hovering near oversold territory could prompt a bounce. For long-term holders, this consolidation phase may serve as a reset after explosive prior growth. Conclusion When weighing presale entry against established market plays, the current data makes a compelling case: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Horizon Haven stage offers structured ROI potential, staking yield, and scarcity mechanics that few meme coin projects can match. Based on recent market trends and the comparative performance of Pudgy Penguins and Neiro, Arctic Pablo stands out as the top new meme coin to invest in now for those seeking both narrative-driven branding and a tangible investment structure. With its final presale phase underway and a clear roadmap toward listing, this is the window where both retail participants and whales can position for maximum impact. This meme coin presale with massive potential will end soon. Will the entry be secured before the next price jump? Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale today and secure your share of the adventure.

This development, specifically a substantial ETH sale , has naturally drawn considerable attention from observers across the crypto market . Understanding such moves is crucial for anyone following the pulse of digital assets, as they can offer insights into broader trends and sentiment. What Exactly Happened with the Ethereum Foundation’s ETH Sale? Recently, a wallet address with known links to the Ethereum Foundation executed a significant transaction. This address swapped 4,095.18 ETH for a remarkable $18.747 million worth of DAI. The average selling price for this ETH sale was approximately $4,578 per ETH, as reported by the reliable on-chain analytics platform, Onchain Lens. This kind of movement by a prominent entity like the Ethereum Foundation often prompts questions. Is it a strategic treasury management decision? Or does it signal something deeper about their outlook on the Ethereum price or the broader market? It is important to note that the Ethereum Foundation frequently manages its treasury to support development and ecosystem growth. Transaction Size: Over 4,000 ETH, valued at nearly $19 million. Recipient Asset: DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Source: A wallet address directly associated with the Ethereum Foundation. Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact and Ethereum Price Implications Any large transaction involving a foundational entity like the Ethereum Foundation can send ripples through the crypto market . While an $18.7 million sale is substantial, it is relatively small compared to Ethereum’s vast daily trading volume. Therefore, a direct, immediate, and dramatic crypto market impact on the Ethereum price is unlikely solely from this event. However, such transactions are closely watched for their symbolic weight. They can influence sentiment, especially if market participants misinterpret the reasons behind the sale. Typically, foundations like Ethereum’s sell assets for operational expenses, grants, or strategic investments, not necessarily due to a bearish outlook. Understanding the context is key: Treasury Management: Foundations often diversify holdings or convert volatile assets like ETH into stablecoins (like DAI) for operational liquidity. Funding Initiatives: Proceeds might fund ongoing development, research, or community grants within the Ethereum ecosystem. Market Stability: Converting to stablecoins can be a move to ensure financial stability for long-term projects, shielding funds from market volatility. Understanding On-Chain Data and Future Outlook The ability to track such transactions is a testament to the transparency of blockchain technology. On-chain data provides invaluable insights into the movements of large holders and foundational entities. Tools like Onchain Lens allow anyone to verify these activities, fostering trust and accountability within the decentralized space. While this particular ETH sale by the Ethereum Foundation appears to be a routine treasury operation, it highlights the continuous evolution of how major players manage their digital assets. It also reinforces the importance of analyzing on-chain data for a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, rather than relying on speculation. Looking ahead, the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, with ongoing developments like the upcoming Dencun upgrade and Layer 2 scaling solutions. These fundamental improvements are far more likely to shape the long-term Ethereum price trajectory than isolated treasury management transactions. In conclusion, the recent ETH sale by an address linked to the Ethereum Foundation is a noteworthy, yet likely routine, treasury management event. It underscores the transparency of on-chain data and provides a valuable case study in how significant entities operate within the crypto market . While it might spark discussion, its direct crypto market impact on the Ethereum price is likely minimal, reinforcing the foundation’s commitment to long-term ecosystem development. Here are some frequently asked questions about the Ethereum Foundation and its activities: FAQs About the Ethereum Foundation and ETH Sales 1. What is the Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the Ethereum blockchain and its related technologies. It funds research, development, and community initiatives to ensure the continued growth and decentralization of the Ethereum ecosystem. 2. Why did an address linked to the Ethereum Foundation sell ETH? Addresses linked to the Ethereum Foundation often sell ETH as part of their treasury management strategy. This involves converting a portion of their volatile ETH holdings into stablecoins like DAI to cover operational expenses, fund grants, or diversify their portfolio for long-term financial stability. 3. How does this ETH sale impact the Ethereum price? While any large transaction can generate discussion, an $18.7 million ETH sale is relatively small compared to Ethereum’s daily trading volume. Therefore, this specific sale is unlikely to have a significant, direct, or lasting negative impact on the overall Ethereum price. It is more indicative of routine treasury operations. 4. What is DAI and why was it chosen for the swap? DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at approximately $1. It is often chosen by entities like the Ethereum Foundation for converting volatile assets because it provides a stable store of value for operational funds without exposure to market fluctuations. 5. Where can I track these on-chain transactions? You can track on-chain transactions using various blockchain explorers and analytics platforms. Tools like Etherscan, Nansen, or the mentioned Onchain Lens provide detailed information about wallet activities, transaction volumes, and asset movements on the Ethereum blockchain.

Recognized as one of the best crypto presales for growth-focused portfolios in 2025, some experts are now touting a possible 150x upside as the project nears major exchange listings. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Presale Pick for Growth Portfolios in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a standout in the 2025 presale scene, blending meme coin appeal with serious DeFi infrastructure. Unlike many early-stage tokens, it is 100% community-owned with zero venture capital influence, no insider allocations, and fully decentralized tokenomics. The project has already drawn 12,000+ holders and millions in presale funds, with momentum accelerating — wallet growth soared 420% month-on-month. Security remains a key focus, with a HashEx audit completed and a CertiK audit underway, complemented by a perfect 100/100 Trust Score on Scam-Detector. Analysts are now flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a best-in-class early opportunity, citing performance metrics that outpace SHIB. With rumored top-tier CEX and DEX listings imminent, the presale’s current entry point is seen as potentially pivotal for long-term upside, with forecasts stretching from 35x to 150x in the next cycle. Ethereum: Breakouts Point to $6K, $8K, and Even $20K Targets Ethereum’s native token ETH is on a tear, up roughly 35% this week to above $4,330, its highest level since December 2021. Multiple technical patterns are aligning for a bullish push. A Wyckoff Accumulation breakout suggests a target near $6,000. Meanwhile, a multi-year symmetrical triangle breakout could project ETH toward $8,000 in the coming months. Some analysts, like Nilesh Verma, are even pointing to a historical fractal that could drive ETH to $10,000 minimum, and potentially $20,000 by mid-2026, if momentum holds. Historically, Ethereum has delivered parabolic runs after breaking similar formations, as seen in April 2020’s 950% rally. With favorable macro sentiment and institutional inflows returning, Ethereum’s breakout could fuel a broad altcoin rally. Yet, smaller-cap L2 may still overshadow its percentage upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which have more room for exponential growth. XRP: Breakout Structure Eyes $15 After Clearing “Final Boss” Resistance XRP is back in the spotlight after breaking above a long-standing resistance channel, now trading above $3 with analysts targeting a run to $15. Veteran market watcher Ali Martinez identifies this as the completion of a multi-month bull flag formation that began after XRP’s 580% surge in late 2024. The recent breakout could lead to a brief retest of the $2.4–$2.5 range before launching into its next leg up. Crypto analyst Dom notes that XRP recently smashed through a significant 29 million token sell wall between $3.25 and $3.50, which he labeled the “final boss” before real price discovery. With this barrier gone, the near-term target sits at $4, while the long-term goal of $15 represents a 328% gain from current levels. Still, while XRP’s structure is bullish, the percentage potential pales compared to early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where upside multiples are exponentially higher. The Bottom Line With Ethereum and XRP breaking major resistance levels, the broader market’s sentiment is turning bullish. Meanwhile, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the hidden giant for exponential gains. Backed by strong community ownership, zero-tax tokenomics, and imminent exchange listings, this presale could be 2025’s breakout success story.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recently demonstrated a remarkable streak of positive performance, signaling growing confidence in digital asset funds . On August 12, these innovative investment vehicles recorded a total net inflow of $66.32 million, marking their fifth consecutive day of gains.

What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows? This impressive run of Bitcoin ETF inflows highlights a clear shift in investor sentiment. For five straight days, capital has poured into these funds, accumulating a substantial sum. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone attracted a significant $111.81 million in inflows. This strong performance from a major financial player like BlackRock underscores the growing legitimacy and appeal of Bitcoin as an investable asset. However, it wasn’t a clean sweep across all funds. While some celebrated gains, others experienced outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB saw outflows of $23.86 million, and Grayscale’s GBTC, a long-standing player, also recorded a $21.63 million outflow. These movements show a dynamic market where investors are actively reallocating capital, possibly seeking out funds with lower fees or different strategic exposures. Other funds in the sector reported no net change in their holdings for the day, indicating a concentrated flow towards top performers. How Do Consistent Inflows Shape Crypto Investment? Consistent positive flows into crypto investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they reflect a maturing market.

The ability for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency simplifies the process, making it accessible to a wider audience, including traditional investors who might be wary of direct crypto ownership. The sustained demand for these ETFs can influence Bitcoin’s price stability and overall market capitalization. As more capital enters the ecosystem through regulated channels, it can reduce volatility and foster a more stable environment for digital assets. This institutional participation also signals greater acceptance from the mainstream financial world, which is a positive development for the entire digital asset landscape. Navigating the Landscape of Digital Asset Funds The performance of various digital asset funds , including the contrasting inflows and outflows, paints a picture of a competitive and evolving market. BlackRock’s substantial inflow suggests a preference for new, perhaps more efficient, investment products.

They can select funds based on their risk appetite, fee structures, and the reputation of the fund manager.

It also highlights the importance of due diligence when choosing where to place your capital in this burgeoning sector. What Do These BTC Market Trends Mean for Your Portfolio? Observing these specific BTC market trends provides valuable insights for both seasoned and new investors. The consistent positive inflows suggest a bullish sentiment building around Bitcoin. For those considering entering the market, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and relatively straightforward entry point. They remove some of the complexities associated with direct cryptocurrency purchases, such as managing private keys or choosing a secure exchange. However, it is crucial to remember that while ETFs offer convenience, they are still subject to market volatility. The crypto market remains dynamic, and prices can fluctuate significantly. Staying informed about market developments, understanding the underlying asset, and considering your personal financial goals are essential steps before making any investment decisions. This latest streak of Bitcoin ETF inflows certainly adds an optimistic note to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement! We are seeing a significant shift in the crypto market , as Bitcoin dominance has recently fallen to a six-month low. This crucial metric, which measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, is often a strong indicator of what’s to come for other digital assets. When Bitcoin’s dominance dips, it frequently signals the potential beginning of an altcoin season – a period where alternative cryptocurrencies experience substantial growth. What Does Falling Bitcoin Dominance Mean? Understanding Bitcoin dominance is key to navigating the crypto landscape. Historically, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king, holding the largest share of the market. However, its recent decline from 61.7% to 59.4% over the past week, as reported by TradingView data, suggests a shift in investor sentiment. Shift in Capital: Investors may be rotating profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: A lower Bitcoin dominance often indicates that market participants are willing to take on more risk, exploring smaller, more volatile assets. Evolving Market: The growing maturity and diversity of the crypto market mean that altcoins are gaining more individual traction and utility. This decline in dominance is not just a statistical anomaly; it is a signal that the market’s focus is broadening beyond Bitcoin. Is an Altcoin Season Truly Underway? The term altcoin season refers to a phase where altcoins, or cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, outperform Bitcoin significantly. The current drop in Bitcoin dominance strongly supports this narrative. Historically, such drops have preceded periods of explosive growth for many alternative digital assets. For instance, during previous cycles, a decline in Bitcoin’s market share often led to: Rapid price appreciation for various altcoins. Increased trading volumes across altcoin pairs. Renewed interest in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or Layer-2 solutions. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the current indicators align with historical patterns that suggest an upcoming altcoin rally . Many analysts are now closely watching for signs of sustained momentum in this area. How Can You Navigate This Potential Altcoin Rally? As the market dynamics shift, investors have an opportunity to adapt their strategies. It is crucial to approach any potential altcoin season with careful consideration and research. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, consider diversifying across a range of promising altcoins. Look for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Research Thoroughly: Understand the technology, team, and community behind each altcoin. Due diligence is paramount in the volatile crypto space. Manage Risk: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and social sentiment. The crypto market moves quickly. This period could present significant opportunities for those who are prepared and informed about the nuances of the digital assets space. Challenges and Considerations in the Altcoin Market While the prospect of an altcoin season is exciting, it is important to acknowledge the inherent challenges. The altcoin market is known for its volatility and susceptibility to rapid price swings. Not all altcoins will perform well, and some may even fail. Key considerations include: Market Saturation: Thousands of altcoins exist, making it difficult to identify truly valuable projects. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins may suffer from low liquidity, making it hard to enter or exit positions quickly without impacting price. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for altcoins is still evolving, which can introduce additional risks. Project Viability: Some projects may lack sustainable business models or sufficient community support, leading to eventual decline. Therefore, a cautious and well-researched approach is essential to navigate these waters successfully. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Assets? The recent dip in Bitcoin dominance truly marks a pivotal moment for the broader crypto market . It signals a potential shift in momentum, opening the door for an exciting altcoin season where alternative cryptocurrencies could shine. While opportunities abound, prudent investing, thorough research, and disciplined risk management remain critical. As the market evolves, understanding these dynamics will empower investors to make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on the unfolding shifts in the world of digital assets . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitcoin dominance? A1: Bitcoin dominance is a metric that measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. It indicates Bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market. Q2: Why does falling Bitcoin dominance suggest an altcoin season? A2: When Bitcoin dominance falls, it means capital is flowing out of Bitcoin and often into altcoins. This reallocation of funds can cause altcoin prices to rise significantly, leading to an altcoin season. Q3: How long does an altcoin season typically last? A3: The duration of an altcoin season can vary widely, from a few weeks to several months. It depends on various market factors, investor sentiment, and broader economic conditions. Q4: Are all altcoins guaranteed to perform well during an altcoin season? A4: No, not all altcoins will perform equally well. While some may see significant gains, others might underperform or even decline. Thorough research into individual projects is crucial. Q5: What should I do if I want to participate in an altcoin rally? A5: Conduct extensive research on promising projects, diversify your portfolio, manage your risk by investing only what you can afford to lose, and stay updated on market trends and news.

In a case that underscores the critical importance of national security, a South Korean crypto exchange CEO , identified only as Lee, received a four-year prison sentence on appeal. The Seoul High Court upheld a lower court’s decision, finding Lee guilty of serious offenses. Lee was accused of receiving approximately 700 million won (about $505,000) in digital assets. These funds came from a suspected North Korean agent . Crucially, Lee also contacted an active-duty military officer. The purpose of this contact was to leak sensitive military secrets . This verdict highlights the severe consequences for individuals who compromise national security, especially when digital assets are involved in illicit activities. The Dangerous Nexus: Crypto, Espionage, and a North Korean Agent The involvement of a suspected North Korean agent in this case raises significant concerns about the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies for espionage and illicit funding. Digital assets, while offering many legitimate benefits, can also be exploited due to their decentralized nature and perceived anonymity. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by global authorities in monitoring and regulating the flow of digital money. The use of cryptocurrency in such a sensitive operation demonstrates a sophisticated attempt to circumvent traditional financial oversight. Understanding the Violation of the National Security Act The Seoul High Court’s decision found Lee guilty of violating the National Security Act . This act is a cornerstone of South Korean law, designed to protect the nation from threats, particularly those related to espionage and activities that could undermine state security. Violations of this act are treated with extreme gravity, reflecting the potential harm they can inflict on the country. The substantial prison sentence reflects the seriousness with which the South Korean legal system views such breaches of trust and national safety. Protecting Yourself: Lessons from the South Korean Crypto Case This case offers crucial insights for anyone involved in the digital asset space. While it directly pertains to national security, it also underscores broader themes of due diligence and accountability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Vigilance is Key: Always be aware of the source and purpose of any funds or digital assets you receive. Know Your Counterparties: Understand who you are dealing with, especially in high-value transactions. Legal Compliance: Familiarize yourself with and adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction, particularly those concerning financial transactions and national security. Reporting Suspicious Activity: If you encounter anything that seems illegal or suspicious, report it to the appropriate authorities. The South Korean crypto landscape, like many others, is evolving, and regulatory bodies are becoming increasingly adept at tracking illicit activities. Integrity and transparency remain paramount for the legitimate growth of the crypto industry. The sentencing of a crypto exchange CEO for leaking military secrets to a North Korean agent marks a significant moment in the intersection of digital finance and national security. This case, prosecuted under the strict National Security Act , serves as a powerful deterrent against similar illicit activities. It reinforces the message that while the crypto world offers innovation, it is not beyond the reach of the law, especially when national security is at stake. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who was the crypto exchange CEO involved in this case? A1: The CEO was identified only by the surname Lee. Specific details about the exchange were not publicly disclosed in the reports. Q2: What was the primary charge against the CEO? A2: The primary charge was violating the National Security Act, specifically for receiving funds from a suspected North Korean agent and attempting to leak military secrets. Q3: How much digital asset was involved in the transaction? A3: The CEO reportedly received approximately 700 million won, which is equivalent to about $505,000, in digital assets.

NEAR’s 5% rebound points toward a potential breakout, although resistance remains a challenge and its price movement is still delicate. AAVE has shown a strong bullish reversal above $280, supported by technical strength and renewed institutional interest. Its alignment with key indicators suggests room for further growth if momentum continues. Even with these developments, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers the most compelling case. Backed by a $270 million acquisition and over 2 million active users, its Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998 targets a 3,423% ROI at launch. NEAR Protocol Builds Support After 5% Recovery NEAR Protocol gained 5% in the past 24 hours, rising from $2.47 to $2.60 despite broader market volatility. The move followed an extended consolidation between $2.48 and $2.52, with a breakout around 10:00 UTC on strong trading volume of 3.36 million, nearly three times the daily average. Analysts attribute the spike to renewed institutional interest as buyers seek alternatives amid economic uncertainty. Late in the session, selling pressure trimmed gains, with price pulling back from $2.61 resistance to settle near $2.60. Support is forming at $2.51, and a sustained push above $2.61 could set the stage for a move toward $2.65 or $2.70. AAVE Eyes $300 After Breaking Key Resistance AAVE’s price has climbed above $280, signaling a bullish reversal after overcoming important resistance levels. The token broke past the 200 EMA at $276 and is now holding near $281. The breakout follows a cup-shaped formation, indicating a shift from consolidation to upward momentum. All major EMAs, including the 20, 50, 100, and 200, are positioned below price, reinforcing the positive technical outlook. The rally is supported by news of a new institutional fund launch with Plasma, aimed at bringing traditional finance into the blockchain space. If AAVE maintains levels above $275, it could aim for the $290 to $300 range in the short term. Cold Wallet’s $270M Deal Creates Rare Pre-Launch ROI Window Cold Wallet’s $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet has instantly transformed its growth trajectory. By securing over 2 million active users before launch, the project has skipped the slow adoption phase most crypto startups face, positioning itself for immediate scale. At $0.00998 in Stage 17 of its presale, Cold Wallet is offering a projected 3,423% ROI based on its confirmed $0.3517 launch price, with cashback rewards already live for early participants. This instant access to a large, engaged user base creates a powerful foundation for network activity and token demand from day one. The fact that rewards are already functioning before the token hits exchanges gives early buyers a tangible advantage, turning speculation into active earning potential. With each presale stage, Cold Wallet’s price moves higher, meaning the cost of entry rises while the possible ROI decreases. Waiting too long to enter could mean missing the optimal profit window, especially as momentum builds and awareness spreads. Stage 17’s entry price represents a limited opportunity to secure maximum upside before the next price jump. Combining an established user base with proven utility, Cold Wallet offers more than theoretical growth potential. It delivers a pre-launch environment where timing can define the scale of returns. Quick Rundown While NEAR Protocol and AAVE show signs of potential, Cold Wallet stands in a league of its own. NEAR’s recent gains remain within a narrow range, and AAVE’s momentum will need a decisive push above $300 to sustain. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, has already raised $5.91 million in its presale and delivers real-world utility by rewarding users with cashback for their on-chain activity. With a projected 3,423% ROI and the acquisition of Plus Wallet’s millions of active users, Cold Wallet is more than a speculative play. It is a complete ecosystem growing rapidly and rewarding participants from the very start.

Analyst Reveals Bold Target From Multi-Year Pattern,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-12-analyst-bold-target-multi-year-pattern/,"An analyst has pointed out how the breakout from this multi-year long XRP triangle pattern could point to a massive bullish target for the asset’s price. XRP Has Been Shooting Up Since Breaking Out Of This Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a multi-year technical analysis (TA) pattern in XRP’s weekly price chart. The pattern in question is a triangle, which forms whenever an asset trades between two converging trendlines. The upper line of the pattern is likely to provide resistance, while the lower one support. A break out of either of these levels can hint at a continuation of trend in that direction; a surge above the triangle can be a bullish signal, while a drop under it a bearish one. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retraces Below $120,000: Is Coinbase Selling To Blame? Triangles can be of a few types, with three popular ones being the ascending, descending, and symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides which category a specific triangular channel belongs to. One trendline being parallel to the time-axis means that the pattern is one of the first two types. More specifically, it’s an ascending triangle if the upper line is parallel, while it’s a descending one in the case of a flat lower line. When both trendlines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite angle, the symmetrical triangle forms. In the context of the current topic, the triangle of interest is closest to this type. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the long-term triangle that the 7-day price of XRP was trading inside before its earlier breakout. As is visible in the graph, the weekly XRP price was trading inside a pattern that looked like a symmetrical triangle with a slight upward bias between 2018 and 2024. In a proper symmetrical triangle, the probability of a breakout occurring is considered the same in either direction, but considering that this triangle was angled upward, a bullish breakout may have been more likely. And indeed, in November 2024, the asset managed to break past the upper boundary of the formation, kickstarting a bull rally. Generally, triangle breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the height of the pattern. That is, the resulting move in the price may be equal to the distance between the trendlines at their widest.

From the current value of the cryptocurrency, a run to this level would imply an increase of almost 287%. It now remains to be seen whether the pattern would hold up for the token. XRP Price XRP recovered above $3.37 earlier, but the coin has since seen a retrace as its price is back at $3.25.

In a recent X post, Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, highlighted that Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund has increased its indirect exposure to BTC. Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund Increased Bitcoin Stack Lunde noted that Norway’s sovereign wealth fund – Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) – has significantly raised its indirect BTC exposure in 2025. He remarked: This is my favorite chart to update whenever the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund discloses holdings. It efficiently shows that BTC is finding its way into any well-diversified portfolio, intentional or not. Notably, the NBIM fund increased its Bitcoin stake to 7,161 BTC. At current market prices, this is valued at approximately $844 million. At the end of 2024, the fund’s exposure stood at 3,821 BTC, meaning its indirect holdings jumped by 3,340 BTC in just the first half of 2025. In percentage terms, that’s a massive 192% year-on-year increase. According to Lunde, the surge in BTC exposure was primarily driven by the fund’s significant positions in core treasury vehicles such as Strategy and Marathon Digital. It was also supported by strong Bitcoin accumulation among other top corporate treasury holders. Strategy and Marathon Digital are among the leading public companies with the largest BTC reserves. Data from CoinGecko shows that Strategy currently holds 628,946 BTC, while Marathon Digital holds 50,000 BTC. Combined, these two companies own more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply, valued at over $81 billion at current market prices. For NBIM, Strategy added 3,005.5 BTC to its indirect exposure, while Marathon Digital contributed 216.4 BTC. Other notable contributors to the sovereign wealth fund’s Bitcoin exposure include Block (85.1 BTC), Coinbase (57.2 BTC), Metaplanet (50.8 BTC), and GameStop (33 BTC). Conversely, Riot Platforms reduced exposure by 76.7 BTC. 2025: The Year Of BTC Adoption While Bitcoin had already found its way onto corporate balance sheets before 2025, this year has seen the trend accelerate rapidly. Several companies have announced new fundraising initiatives aimed at increasing their BTC holdings. Last week, Turkish mobility app Marti Technologies revealed plans to hold 20% of its total cash reserves in BTC. UK-based Satsuma Technology also pledged to expand its Bitcoin position. Similarly, Galaxy Digital recently increased its Bitcoin holdings by 4,272 BTC while reducing its exposure to Ethereum (ETH). At press time, BTC trades at $119,810, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|K33 Research|nbim|Norges Bank Investment Management|Norway sovereign wealth fund|Strategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-13 03:00:22
50005561,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=174347,1755054044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/50005561.jpeg,"$653M in Token Unlocks This Week — Will Aptos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum Face a Sell-Off or Rally?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/653m-in-token-unlocks-this-week-will-aptos-avalanche-and-arbitrum-face-a-sell-off-or-rally/,"This week, the crypto market faces a wave of supply pressure as roughly $653 million in tokens are set to unlock across Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), and other projects. This is part of an August unlock total projected between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, a notable drop from July’s record $6.3 billion. Historically, unlocks can lead to sharp price swings, but in certain cases, they have triggered rallies when demand outpaced selling pressure. While traders focus on whether these large-caps can hold their ground, a rising presale star— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is positioning itself as the next big rotation target for smart money. Aptos: Strong Fundamentals, Big Test Ahead Aptos is holding near $4.80 after a week of gains, but its upcoming $50 million APT unlock could put short-term pressure on price. The project has been gaining institutional credibility through its Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization efforts, partnering with financial giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton to bring traditional assets on-chain. If Aptos can maintain support above $4.65 post-unlock, it may have room to retest the $5 mark; a breakdown below $4.35 could see consolidation toward $4.00. Avalanche: ETF Hopes Versus Supply Pressure Avalanche has recently traded near $24.04 on the back of bullish developments, including BlackRock’s $240 million investment and VanEck’s $100 million RWA fund for AVAX projects. Bloomberg now gives a 90% probability of an Avalanche ETF approval by year-end, which has fueled institutional optimism. However, more than $39 million in AVAX tokens will be released this month, adding to overall supply-side concerns in August’s unlock cycle. If capital inflows remain strong and DeFi activity rebounds, AVAX could aim for the $27–$28 range. Failure to absorb new supply could push prices toward critical support near $20. Arbitrum: Momentum Meets Unlock Risk Arbitrum has been one of the stronger performers in recent weeks, rallying over 28% in the past month to around $0.50. Positive sentiment has been driven by rumors of a Robinhood partnership, growing Total Value Locked (TVL) near $3 billion, and the rollout of AI-integrated DeFi tools on its BOLD testnet. On August 16, however, 92.65 million ARB tokens—worth about $40 million—will be unlocked. If large holders hold their positions, the rally could extend toward $0.60. Heavy post-unlock selling, however, could test lower support levels around $0.21. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Post-Unlock Opportunity While Aptos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum navigate this week’s supply challenges, early investors are already looking for the next big opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE , now in its presale, offers exactly what early buyers are looking for. MAGACOIN FINANCE has successfully completed a thorough independent review, meeting and exceeding global blockchain standards for safety, transparency, and reliability. This achievement reassures investors, strengthens community trust, and highlights the project’s commitment to long-term growth. With its security credentials validated, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a credible and promising crypto opportunity. Analysts are projecting strong returns from current presale prices, making it a prime candidate for capital rotation once volatility from these unlocks subsides. History has shown that when large-cap tokens face supply shocks, a portion of liquidity often flows into promising early-stage projects, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that profile. The Bottom Line The $653 million in token unlocks this week could either trigger sharp sell-offs or prove the resilience of Aptos, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. For traders, the focus will be on how quickly new supply is absorbed. For those seeking asymmetric upside, however, the bigger story may be unfolding in the presale market, where MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of 2025’s most talked-about opportunities.

BlockDAG (BDAG) , a next-gen Layer 1 built on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture combined with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, has rapidly become a leading topic in 2025. With its presale already crossing $371 million, it ranks among the largest early raises in recent years. Currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, both analysts and retail buyers see it as the top crypto to buy before prices push higher. A Technical Design Focused on Power and Scalability BlockDAG’s core appeal lies in its unique technical approach. While traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum group transactions in a single sequence of blocks, this can cause delays. DAG-based systems handle transactions in parallel, which boosts processing speed significantly. By pairing DAG with an adapted PoW method, BlockDAG achieves scalability while maintaining decentralization, two qualities rarely found together in new Layer 1 networks. This model can process thousands of transactions per second without risking the concentration of control that Proof-of-Stake (PoS) often faces. Many in the crypto space see this combination as a sign that BlockDAG could be a serious contender for years ahead, especially for those who value both speed and long-term network strength. Additionally, BlockDAG offers full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, meaning Ethereum-based dApps can easily migrate without changes to their code. This minimizes migration challenges and helps projects launch quickly. The results are already showing. More than 4,500 developers have joined, creating over 300 dApps before the mainnet is live. Paired with early grant programs and hackathons, BlockDAG is building a strong foundation for its on-chain economy from launch day. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, which strengthens its position as a top choice ahead of listing. Early Adoption Numbers Setting New Standards What stands out most about BlockDAG’s growth is the strength of its user base before launch. Its X1 mobile miner app has attracted over 2.5 million active users, introducing them to network mining while simulating rewards. Already, there are more than 200,000 BDAG holders, and 19,000 ASIC miners have been sold, showing clear preparation for post-mainnet operations. This large, active community gives BlockDAG an edge over many other projects. While most Layer 1 chains start with low usage and then try to grow, BlockDAG is starting with miners, developers, and holders already in place. This approach could give it faster adoption and liquidity once trading begins. On the marketing front, BlockDAG has gone big, even partnering with Inter Milan to reach mainstream audiences. This visibility, combined with steady product launches, keeps it firmly in focus across crypto discussions. With the team targeting a $600 million presale cap, they’ve already passed the halfway mark, a sign of both strong demand and likely high liquidity after listing. Price Outlook and Market Potential At the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276, and with a confirmed listing price of $0.05 later in the year, early participants could see an immediate 81% gain at launch. Longer-term forecasts suggest a price range between $1 and $3 in the first two years if adoption speeds up and dApp releases grow as planned. BlockDAG’s mix of strong tech, massive presale activity, and major global branding is why so many are calling it the top crypto for this market phase. Unlike many presales built only on hype, BlockDAG is delivering measurable results, from miner hardware sales to developer sign-ups, all of which point to genuine readiness for launch. Final Say Opportunities of this scale don’t appear often. With $371 million already raised, BlockDAG has clearly caught the attention of both retail buyers and bigger market players. Its hybrid DAG plus PoW design, EVM compatibility, and ready-to-go user base offer an edge that few new networks can match. At $0.0276 in Batch 29, it’s one of the last chances to buy before the price rises further. For those who believe in high-speed performance, true decentralization, and early mass adoption, BlockDAG’s foundation is hard to overlook. As it races toward its $600M target, it’s no wonder it ranks high on the list of top cryptos to buy now .

For traders engaged in derivatives, understanding the forces at play is absolutely crucial. Today, we’re diving into the recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the last 24 hours, which offers a stark look at market volatility and the risks associated with leveraged crypto positions . What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation ? Before we break down the numbers, let’s clarify what perpetual futures trading entails. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual.’ Liquidation , in this context, occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This typically happens during sharp price movements against a highly leveraged position. When prices move unfavorably, especially for those holding large leveraged crypto positions , liquidations can cascade, amplifying market volatility. The 24-Hour Breakdown: Crucial Crypto Liquidation Data Over the past 24 hours, the market witnessed substantial liquidations across major cryptocurrencies. This recent surge in forced closures provides valuable insights into prevailing market sentiment and areas of significant risk. Here is the detailed breakdown: Ethereum (ETH): $267.08 million liquidated, with a staggering 84.34% of these being short positions. This indicates a strong upward price movement caught many bearish traders off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): $35.30 million liquidated, with 63.82% of these being short positions. While less severe than ETH, it still points to a significant squeeze on those betting against Bitcoin. Solana (SOL): $27.92 million liquidated, with an overwhelming 85.18% of these being short positions. Solana traders experienced one of the most concentrated periods of short liquidations . What’s immediately apparent from this crypto liquidation data is the dominance of short liquidations. This means a significant majority of traders who were betting on prices to fall faced forced closure of their positions, often leading to rapid price increases as exchanges buy back assets to close these positions. Why Do So Many Short Liquidations Occur? The high percentage of short liquidations suggests a market environment where prices experienced unexpected upward surges. Traders who open short positions believe an asset’s price will drop. They borrow and sell an asset, hoping to buy it back cheaper later and profit from the difference. However, when the market moves contrary to their expectations, and prices rise rapidly, these short positions quickly become unprofitable. Exchanges initiate liquidations to prevent traders from incurring losses beyond their collateral. This can create a ‘short squeeze,’ where forced buying to cover short positions further fuels the price rally, trapping even more short sellers. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone involved in perpetual futures trading , as it highlights the inherent volatility and interconnectedness of market movements. Navigating Leveraged Crypto Positions Safely While the potential for high returns with leveraged crypto positions is enticing, the risks are equally substantial. The recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation figures serve as a powerful reminder of this. To mitigate risks, consider these actionable insights: Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on your trades. Appropriate Leverage: Avoid excessively high leverage, especially if you are new to perpetual futures. Market Understanding: Stay informed about market trends, news, and technical analysis. Don’t trade purely on speculation. Diversification: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Emotional Control: Trading can be emotional. Stick to your trading plan and avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. The past 24 hours have underscored the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, particularly for those engaging in perpetual futures. The significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation across ETH, BTC, and SOL, predominantly from short positions, illustrates the rapid shifts that can occur. These events serve as a powerful cautionary tale, emphasizing the critical importance of robust risk management and a deep understanding of market mechanics when dealing with leveraged products. Staying informed and trading responsibly are your best defenses against unexpected market turns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are crypto perpetual futures? A1: Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without owning the actual asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. Q2: What causes crypto perpetual futures liquidation? A2: Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements, typically due to significant price movements against their trade. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Q3: Why were so many short positions liquidated recently? A3: A high volume of short liquidations suggests that the market experienced unexpected upward price movements. Traders who bet on prices falling (short positions) were caught off guard, leading to forced closures as prices rose. Q4: How can traders avoid liquidation when dealing with leveraged crypto positions? A4: Traders can reduce liquidation risk by using proper risk management, such as setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, staying informed about market conditions, and not over-concentrating their capital in single trades.

The rally leaves the world’s second-largest digital asset just 5% shy of its record high set in Nov. 2021. The surge comes as demand from institutional investors and corporate treasuries accelerates. Ethereum-focused treasuries, listed entities that buy and hold the cryptocurrency as part of their core strategy, now collectively hold $16.4b worth of Ether, data from strategicethreserve.xyz shows. Bitmine, SharpLink, Ether Machine Lead ETH Holdings Surge The largest holder, Bitmine Immersion Tech, controls 1.2m ETH valued at $5.27b, representing nearly 1% of the total Ether supply. Its ETH position jumped more than 600% over the last 30 days. SharpLink Gaming follows with 598,800 ETH, worth $2.74b, up 177% in the same period. The Ether Machine ranks third, holding 345,400 ETH valued at $1.58b, with an 8% increase in the past month. $ETH is outperforming $BTC by 4.4%. Are we entering altseason? pic.twitter.com/XZjaRWy7Qf — CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 12, 2025 The Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit steward of the network, holds 232,600 ETH worth about $1.07b, although its position has dipped slightly. Other significant holders include PulseChain Sac, Coinbase and Bit Digital. July Sees Sharpest-Ever Jump in Ethereum Treasury Holdings Interest from these treasury-focused entities has been building for months. In July, corporate Ethereum balances posted their largest monthly gain on record, according to Binance Research. Holdings rose about 127% to more than 2.7m ETH, worth roughly $11.6b at the time. SΞR: 14 ETH Treasuries now hold a combined $2.5M ETH ($11.25 billions), about 2.08% of the total ETH supply. pic.twitter.com/vnAl2lmukl — Strategic ETH Reserve (SΞR) (@SERdotxyz) August 13, 2025 Such aggressive accumulation adds to the bullish momentum that has pushed Ether to its highest levels in nearly three years. Analysts point to the growing appeal of Ethereum’s ecosystem, from its role in decentralized finance to tokenization initiatives, as a driver of demand from both traditional finance players and crypto-native firms. The strong showing for Ether comes as Bitcoin remains steady. The largest cryptocurrency traded around $119,331 on Wednesday, unchanged on the day but up nearly 5% over the past week. The overall crypto market was firmer, with total capitalization rising 1.8% to $4.1 trillion. Market watchers say continued inflows from institutions and on-chain activity are likely to determine whether Ether can close the gap to its all-time high in the coming days.

Its performance, however, coincided with a notable change in market structure as investor capital flowed aggressively into altcoins. According to Binance Research’s market insights shared with CryptoPotato , Bitcoin’s dominance fell by 5.2% to 60.6%. During the same period, altcoin dominance climbed to 39.2% which happens to be one of 2025’s largest monthly jumps. The rotation was supported by improved macroeconomic sentiment, optimism around a potential US Federal Reserve rate-cut cycle, and the absence of destabilizing market events. ETH Becomes Corporate Favorite Leading this shift was Ethereum, which surged 51% over the month, buoyed by record institutional participation. Corporate ETH treasuries rose 127.7% to over 2.7 million ETH, and amounted to nearly half the holdings of US-listed ETH ETFs. In July, 24 companies incorporated ETH into their balance sheets and opted for direct ownership instead of ETF exposure to benefit from staking rewards and Ethereum’s deflationary supply model. Beyond Ethereum, several other altcoins posted significant gains. XRP, SUI, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and BNB all benefited from ecosystem developments, expanding corporate adoption, and growing investor interest in DeFi and tokenization use cases. This market-wide rally reflected a market increasingly willing to diversify beyond Bitcoin as sentiment toward altcoin utility strengthened. In the stablecoin sector, the passage of the GENIUS Act on July 17 was a regulatory breakthrough in the US, introducing a federal framework for fully reserved, AML-compliant stablecoins. The development spurred institutional adoption. For instance, JPMorgan expanded its deposit-token pilot, Citi advanced tokenized deposit trials for cross-border settlements, and Visa committed to scaling stablecoin-based payments. On-chain stablecoin settlement volumes continued to exceed Visa’s transaction throughput. NFT Market Rebound The NFT sector witnessed a sharp rebound. Binance Research found that the total trading volume jumped almost 50% in July. The top position in sales volume was dominated by Ethereum-based NFTs, which saw a 58% gain. Bitcoin NFTs also rose more than 28%. The standout driver was a 393% spike in CryptoPunks sales following a headline-grabbing whale purchase. Polygon-based NFT activity, however, saw a decline. Industry discussions around embedding NFTs within ETF structures suggested early-stage institutional exploration of the sector.

This development is more than just another token added to the roster; it signals evolving market dynamics and potential new avenues for diversification. Traders are already buzzing about what this new pair could mean for their strategies. So, let us dive into the details and understand the implications. What is BFUSD and Why is BFUSD USDT Trading Important? BFUSD represents a new digital asset entering the Binance ecosystem. While specific details about BFUSD’s utility or backing are yet to be fully disclosed, its pairing with USDT (Tether) is highly significant. USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, widely used for its stability and liquidity across various exchanges. The introduction of a BFUSD USDT trading pair immediately provides a stable and liquid gateway for traders. This pairing allows users to easily convert between the new asset and a widely accepted stablecoin, minimizing volatility risks often associated with direct crypto-to-crypto pairs. Consequently, this enhances accessibility and fosters a more predictable trading environment for everyone. How Does a New Binance Listing Impact Your Portfolio? Every new Binance listing can create ripples across the cryptocurrency market. For traders, it often presents a chance for early participation in a potentially growing asset. Historically, new listings can lead to increased trading volume and price discovery as the market reacts to the new availability.

This allows traders to potentially capitalize on the initial excitement while managing risk effectively. Navigating Crypto Spot Trading with Confidence The BFUSD/USDT pair will be available for crypto spot trading . For those new to this, spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery. Unlike futures or margin trading, you own the asset outright. This makes it a more straightforward and often less risky option for many participants. To navigate this new listing confidently, consider these actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand what BFUSD is, its purpose, and its potential use cases. Start Small: Avoid committing a large portion of your capital immediately. Set Limits: Utilize stop-loss orders to protect your capital from unexpected downturns.

Despite broader caution, the asset has been quietly building momentum, driven by institutional inflows, ecosystem expansion, and bullish technical setups. This combination of factors has not only strengthened NEAR’s position but also sparked interest in other emerging plays — including MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to attract aggressive early-stage buyers. Institutional capital powers NEAR’s August recovery Over the past week, NEAR has climbed from $2.47 to $2.60, overcoming a period of sideways trading. The move was backed by strong institutional buying, particularly from funds looking to diversify into high-potential Layer-1 projects. Daily trading volume has doubled to over 3.4 million units, a clear signal that both retail and institutional players are becoming more active. Technically, the breakout above $2.495 was a key turning point. With the RSI now at 55.41 and a confirmed bullish MACD crossover, market momentum appears to be shifting in NEAR’s favor. Analysts are now watching resistance levels at $2.80 and $2.85, with a potential breakout zone between $3.04 and $3.10. Ecosystem expansion drives long-term value One of NEAR’s most significant strengths lies in its growing ecosystem. Recent partnerships with Aurora Labs and Subzero Labs have broadened its developer network, while experimental cross-chain integrations with Cardano could open up new user bases. The adoption of “transaction intents” — simplified smart contract interactions that improve user experience — is also increasing. While NEAR’s total value locked (TVL) in DeFi remains below previous highs, this focus on improving usability positions it for sustained growth. Analysts expect NEAR’s price to trade between $2.80 and $3.17 through August, with potential to hit $4.66 by year-end if current momentum continues. MAGACOIN FINANCE attracting parallel investor interest While NEAR’s recovery is earning attention, some investors are also targeting early-stage opportunities with higher potential percentage gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project. Bonus live — claim 50% EXTRA with code EXTRA50X before this allocation closes — a move that has added urgency for those looking to secure early positioning. Backed by a fixed token supply and verified through dual independent audits, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both retail traders and whale wallets ahead of its exchange debut. Analysts see it as a rare small-cap with fundamentals strong enough to sustain momentum post-launch. Social engagement around the project continues to climb, and presale allocation is shrinking daily. Positioning ahead of Q4 liquidity shifts With Q4 historically bringing higher market liquidity, institutional capital is likely to keep flowing into assets with strong narratives and growth potential. NEAR offers a Layer-1 infrastructure play backed by tangible ecosystem expansion, while MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a speculative growth opportunity with a capped supply and active community growth. For traders and long-term investors alike, the combination of NEAR’s steady performance and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s accelerated presale momentum offers two very different but complementary strategies heading into the 2025 bull cycle.

What was promised as a streamlined, ‘one-size-fits-all’ AI experience with the launch of GPT-5 has quickly become a more intricate landscape, challenging initial expectations and bringing back a familiar, albeit complicated, feature: the model picker. Why Did the ChatGPT Model Picker Return? When OpenAI introduced GPT-5 , the grand vision was to simplify the user experience dramatically. The company aimed for a single, intelligent AI model that could automatically determine the best way to answer any user query through an internal router. This approach was intended to eliminate the need for users to navigate the often-criticized model picker , a feature that even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted to disliking due to its complexity. However, the reality of GPT-5 ‘s rollout has shown that this unified approach did not universally satisfy user demands, leading to its unexpected return. What Are GPT-5 ‘s New Modes, and How is OpenAI Adapting? Contrary to the initial ‘one-size-fits-all’ promise, Sam Altman recently announced new settings for GPT-5 , signaling the unexpected return of the model picker . Users can now choose between ‘Auto,’ ‘Fast,’ and ‘Thinking’ modes. The ‘Auto’ setting attempts to replicate the original router’s functionality, while ‘Fast’ and ‘Thinking’ allow users to directly select models optimized for speed or deeper processing, respectively. This rapid adjustment highlights OpenAI ‘s commitment to iterating quickly based on user feedback. Furthermore, paid users can now access several legacy AI models , including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3, which were temporarily deprecated. This reversal addresses significant user backlash, demonstrating the strong attachment users developed to specific AI personalities and response styles. How Do User Preferences Shape the Evolution of AI Models ? The initial deprecation of popular AI models like GPT-4o revealed a crucial insight for OpenAI : human attachment to AI personalities is a real and impactful phenomenon. Users had grown accustomed to the unique responses and characteristics of these models in ways the company had not fully anticipated. This unexpected user sentiment underscored why a single, unified GPT-5 model, even with an intelligent router, couldn’t universally meet diverse user needs. The company is now exploring more per-user customization for model personality, acknowledging that a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient in a rapidly maturing AI landscape. This shift underscores the growing importance of tailoring AI experiences to individual user preferences, moving beyond just performance metrics and acknowledging the unique bond users form with their ChatGPT interactions. What Are the Challenges in AI Model Routing for ChatGPT ? The technical challenge of routing user prompts to the most suitable AI models is far more complex than it appears. It requires a sophisticated understanding of both user preferences and the specific nature of each query, all while making a decision in split seconds to ensure a fast response if required. The initial performance of GPT-5 ‘s router on launch day was reportedly ‘largely broken,’ leading to user dissatisfaction and prompting discussions from OpenAI’s leadership, including an AMA session with Sam Altman. While the team is iterating rapidly, the complexity lies in aligning an AI model’s behavior to subtle human preferences, which can vary from desired verbosity to a preference for contrarian answers. This ongoing challenge highlights the nuanced relationship between users and their chosen ChatGPT experiences and the intricacies involved in perfecting the model picker functionality. The journey of GPT-5 and the fluctuating status of ChatGPT ‘s model picker underscore a vital lesson in AI development: user experience and personalization are paramount. While the ambition for a streamlined, automated AI was clear, the reality of diverse user needs and deep-seated preferences for specific AI models necessitated a swift pivot. OpenAI ‘s quick response to reintroduce choice and bring back beloved legacy models demonstrates their commitment to adapting and improving. As AI continues to integrate into our daily lives, the ability to customize and choose the right tool for the job, even down to an AI’s personality, will likely become a defining feature of successful platforms. The evolution of ChatGPT serves as a compelling case study in balancing innovation with user-centric design.

50008137,554382,1755057611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50008137.jpeg,Ethereum Derivatives Mania: Positions Cross $30 Billion For First Time Ever,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-derivatives-mania-cross-30-billion-ever/,"Data shows the Ethereum derivatives market Open Interest has hit a new all-time high (ATH) following a surge in trader positioning. Ethereum Open Interest Has Crossed $30 Billion As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Ethereum Open Interest has seen a rise recently. The “ Open Interest ” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. It includes both long and short bets. When the value of the indicator registers an uptick, it means the investors are opening up new positions on the market. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when this trend develops, so the price can become more volatile following it. On the other hand, the metric going down suggests holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Such a trend usually leads to the asset behaving in a more stable manner, due to a clearance of leverage. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Ethereum Open Interest over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Open Interest has seen some rapid growth alongside the rally in the cryptocurrency’s price above $4,400. This would suggest that the run has brought in speculative interest in the asset. This isn’t anything unusual, but the fact that the spike in the Open Interest has been sharp may be worth noting. Whenever the derivatives market gets overheated, mass liquidation events can follow as some high-leverage traders inevitably lose their bets. These events tend to be violent and shake up the asset’s price. Considering that the latest Open Interest increase has taken Ethereum positions to a new record beyond $30 billion, it’s possible that volatility could follow for the coin this time as well. Some significant liquidations have in fact already occurred over the last 24 hours, as data from CoinGlass shows. As is visible in the above heatmap, Ethereum with $140 million in liquidations has been the top-ranked coin in the cryptocurrency market in terms of forceful closures over the past day. In some other news, profit-taking on the ETH network slowed down after peaking at $771 million per day in July, but it’s picking back up as a result of the latest rally, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post . Investor profit-taking has climbed back to the $553 million per day mark, which is lower than the earlier high, but still quite notable. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $4,460, up more than 24% over the last week.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Derivatives|Ethereum open interest|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-13 04:00:11

BlockDAG’s presale demonstrates this perfectly. The gap between today’s price and projected post-launch value remains wide, giving early participants a rare chance to capture substantial upside. Currently priced at $0.0276 in batch 29, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised more than $371 million and sold over 25 billion coins. Since batch 1, the project has delivered an impressive 2,660% ROI, proving strong momentum before even hitting exchanges. For those looking at the top crypto coins to buy, every batch matters. As prices rise, the potential ROI narrows. Acting while the gap is still large could mean the difference between hitting life-changing multiples or settling for smaller wins. The opportunity window is open now, but it is shrinking with each stage. How BlockDAG’s ROI Gap Works in a Fast-Moving Presale The ROI gap is the space between the current entry price and the value experts believe the asset can reach post-launch. For BlockDAG, that gap remains substantial for those joining before the later stages. Batch 1 buyers entered at a fraction of today’s price and are already looking at paper gains exceeding 26x. Analysts are projecting strong valuations for 2025 – 2030, leaving current buyers with meaningful upside. But each batch closes that gap slightly, reducing the maximum achievable return. Waiting for more confirmation could mean stepping in after much of the easy potential is gone. With $371 million already committed and demand continuing to climb, market watchers agree this presale still holds significant upside. For anyone seeking top crypto coins to buy, the key question isn’t whether to join, it’s whether to do it before the most favorable entry point disappears. Why Early Entry Still Offers the Biggest Multiples Joining a presale early offers more than just a better price, it creates a compounding advantage when trading begins. Those who secure early positions lock in the biggest gap between entry and launch prices, allowing the flexibility to take partial profits while keeping a sizable position in play. BlockDAG’s batch pricing system makes this progression easy to track. Each new batch raises the cost, reducing potential gains for late entrants. At $0.0276 in batch 29, the profit potential remains attractive if projections hold true, but later buyers will inevitably face slimmer margins. This stage offers a rare blend of affordability and visibility in the top crypto coins to buy category. BlockDAG’s $371 million raise and over 25 billion coins sold show it is firmly established in the market spotlight while still leaving room for strong upside. Delaying Entry Could Cost Serious Gains Many buyers delay until they see proof of success. While caution has its place, in presales like BlockDAG, this approach often carries a high cost. The ROI gap today will not be the same even a few weeks from now. By launch, the largest multiples will already belong to those who acted early. This shrinking margin also impacts long-term strategies. Early participants can use a portion of their profits to enter other high-potential projects while still holding their original BlockDAG allocation. Late entrants, however, will need to hold for longer just to match the early buyers’ multiples. With over $371 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a verified 2,660% ROI since batch 1, BlockDAG combines real progress with transparent market traction, qualities that separate it from many presale projects. The time to maximize the upside is before the next price jump. The Stage Is Set for BlockDAG’s Next Move BlockDAG’s presale reinforces a proven market truth: early movers often capture the best gains. Priced at $0.0276 in batch 29, the project has already raised over $371 million, sold more than 25 billion coins, and delivered a 2,660% ROI since batch 1. The ROI gap that exists now will narrow with each passing stage. For those considering the top crypto coins to buy, every delay risks smaller returns. Acting now could secure the most favorable entry point, positioning buyers for significant gains when BlockDAG enters the open market.

Analyst Forecasts $10 Target For Potential Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-set-up-for-another-leg-analyst-forecasts-10-target-for-potential-breakout/,"Sui (SUI) is attempting to reclaim a key resistance area after recovering from last week’s lows and growing institutional interest in the ecosystem, leading some analysts to suggest that a breakout might be around the corner. Related Reading: ZORA Hits New ATH Amid 50% Daily Surge – What’s Behind The Breakout? SUI Rallies Amid Ecosystem Interest On Tuesday, SUI jumped 7.4% intraday following major news for the ecosystem from institutional players. The cryptocurrency has been attempting to reclaim the $3.90-$4.00 zone over the past few weeks, briefly breaking out during the July market rally. The altcoin has been trading between $2.33-$4.00 price range since the Q2 recovery, hitting a seven-month high of $4.44 two weeks ago. For most of this period, SUI has hovered within the mid-zone of its multi-month range, failing to reclaim the $4.00 resistance multiple times. The early August pullback saw the token drop 27% from the local highs before bouncing at the end of last week. Since then, SUI’s price has recovered 20% from this month’s lows, rallying 6.65% in the past 24 hours to the $3.90 area. On August 12, one of the largest digital asset firms, Grayscale Investments, announced two new products that expand its “existing lineup of Sui Ecosystem products.” Earlier this year, the firm launched its Grayscale Sui Trust, which fueled a 44% rally after the announcement. Now, the firm has launched the Grayscale DeepBook Trust and the Grayscale Walrus Trust to “offer investors exposure to two key protocols driving innovation within the Sui ecosystem,” affirmed Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s Head of Product and Research. The trusts, which are now open for daily subscriptions for eligible accredited investors, function as Grayscale’s other single-asset investment trusts and are solely invested in the DEEP and WAL tokens, respectively. SUI’s Price Ready For $10? Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems noted the cryptocurrency “really likes to move along the 3 drives pattern.” The pattern consists of three consecutive price movements in the same direction, before a trend reversal. As the chart shows, SUI displayed a bullish 3 drives formation during the November-January rally, which was followed by a bearish 3 drives pattern during the February-April pullback. Now, the cryptocurrency has been potentially repeating the bullish setup since the May breakout, with the third drive up still ahead. “We should still have one leg left,” the analyst asserted, which could propel SUI’s price to the $5.00 resistance. Crypto Rand noted that SUI is consolidating after its local breakout, which could target an initial run to the $5.00 mark and a potential rally to an all-time high (ATH) around the $10 barrier. Related Reading: XRP Stumbles, But A Recovery Could Be Around The Corner Similarly, analyst Alex Clay suggested that investors should “not ignore SUI,” as it has a potential cycle top of $11.7. He explained that altcoin displays a strong higher timeframe with a cup and handle formation between 2023 and 2024, followed by a re-accumulation within a 10-month symmetrical triangle. To the market watcher, the compression period “is over” and a breakout could be imminent in the coming weeks. A confirmed breakout from the $4.00 resistance could kickstart a rally to a new high between the $7.90 and $11.7 area. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.91, a 12% increase in the monthly timeframe.

With bullish technicals and community hype building, traders are wondering if this marks the start of a meme coin comeback. But while DOGE leads the headlines, one new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is quietly gaining momentum, with traders eyeing significant gains as capital rotation flows into high-upside projects. Whale Activity Sparks the DOGE Surge On August 11, a single whale injected roughly $200 million into Dogecoin, pushing the price from $0.23 to $0.24 in a single day. This buying wave comes after earlier whale accumulation lifted DOGE to $0.23 on August 9 before sellers capped gains. Such moves reinforce confidence, keep liquidity healthy, and often set the stage for sustained rallies. DOGE is currently forming a cup and handle pattern on the 4-hour chart — a bullish setup that, if confirmed with a close above $0.235 on strong volume, could launch the price toward $0.25–$0.27. Support remains firm between $0.215 and $0.20, while a decisive break above $0.25 could open the path to $0.30+ . The RSI sits at 58, leaving room for upside before hitting overbought conditions. Institutional Interest Meets Community Power Beyond its meme coin roots, Dogecoin continues to see growing legitimacy. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust is bringing DOGE into regulated investment portfolios, while endorsements from figures like Elon Musk keep mainstream attention high. The “Doge Army” remains as active as ever, driving social media momentum and retail participation. Meme Coin Revival on the Horizon? While Dogecoin leads the pack, its resurgence could reignite interest across the meme coin sector, historically known for sharp rallies during bullish market phases. If DOGE breaks through $0.25 with conviction, it could trigger speculative flows into similar tokens—signaling a possible meme coin comeback in late 2025. For traders and investors, the combination of whale accumulation, bullish chart patterns, and growing institutional acceptance makes Dogecoin one to watch closely in the coming weeks. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Riding the Meme Coin Resurgence As DOGE grabs headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own narrative as the next breakout meme coin. MAGACOIN FINANCE blends meme coin community energy with serious DeFi fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is approaching the final stages of its highly anticipated token sale, with demand surging from both retail traders and early-stage crypto investors. The limited supply available at presale prices is being claimed quickly, creating urgency for those looking to secure an entry before the public listing and potential price surge ahead. The Bottom Line Dogecoin’s breakout could spark a broader meme coin revival, attracting both retail traders and institutional curiosity. While DOGE battles resistance near $0.25, savvy investors are already scouting the next high-upside move. In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as that play — offering early entry, strong tokenomics, and the potential to ride the same speculative energy now powering DOGE’s rally.

With users seeking better rewards, smoother user experiences, and genuine reasons to stay engaged, several projects are rising above the rest. This breakdown highlights the top crypto presale in 2025 options that are building momentum. Each offers a clear value proposition, but one is already making moves that could disrupt major incumbents. Below are four presale tokens worth monitoring closely, starting with a wallet platform that’s raised $5.9 million and is aiming directly at MetaMask’s dominance. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): Turning Transaction Costs into User Rewards Cold Wallet is shaping up to be the presale many will wish they bought into early. Unlike standard wallets that charge users for interacting with the blockchain, Cold Wallet rewards them instead. Holders earn CWT, the native token, for actions like paying gas fees, swapping assets, or bridging funds. Its biggest leap came with a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly adding over 2 million active users to its network. This move gives Cold Wallet immediate reach and adoption potential rather than starting from zero. Plus Wallet’s interface already appeals to beginners, and Cold Wallet’s integration of cashback incentives transforms it into a product built for daily use rather than just token storage. Currently in presale stage 17 at $0.00998 per CWT, the project has raised $5.9 million so far. With a launch price of $0.3517, early buyers are looking at a potential 3,632% ROI if the token holds at launch, and over 100x returns as adoption scales. For anyone searching for the top crypto presale in 2025, this is one of the most compelling cases. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Building Loyalty Through Wallet Rewards BEST Wallet Token focuses on creating loyalty incentives for frequent crypto users. While Cold Wallet is cashback-driven, $BEST offers in-app benefits like fee discounts, early access to new features, and priority for wallet-integrated launches. Its tiered rewards mirror credit card-style perks, and gamification in the presale phase has helped early buyers unlock bonuses through activities like referrals, trading, and cross-chain operations. With a direct link between token holding and user benefits, $BEST is steadily gaining traction among active on-chain participants. 3. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Paying Users to Subscribe to Content SUBBD is targeting a gap in the content economy by rewarding both creators and subscribers. On its platform, when a user subscribes to a creator, they earn partial rewards in $SUBBD tokens. Long-term subscribers receive greater rewards, incentivizing sustained engagement. The model bypasses traditional platforms that take large cuts, giving creators full earnings while also offering audiences tangible benefits for loyalty. Features like staking, tipping, and automated monetization make it attractive to creators seeking fair compensation. With the presale active and interest building, SUBBD is carving a place as one of the top crypto presale in 2025 plays for investors who see value in blockchain-powered creator economies. 4. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): A Meme Token with a Functional Roadmap Maxi Doge blends community-driven meme appeal with a plan for long-term utility. Alongside its branding, MAXI offers NFT integration, staking rewards, and DeFi partnerships that use the token for access. A significant highlight is its commitment to burn 50% of total supply before presale ends, drawing interest from investors focused on supply reduction strategies. The project’s partnerships, launchpad backing, and growing community make it more than a typical meme play, positioning it as one of the top crypto presale in 2025 for those seeking both hype and application. Identifying the Top Crypto Presale in 2025 This year’s presale market isn’t defined by hype alone. Value, utility, and usability are setting the best apart. Cold Wallet leads with its $270 million acquisition and reward-based model, already backed by millions of users. SUBBD is changing how creators and audiences interact, BEST is giving loyal wallet users perks that matter, and MAXI is showing that meme coins can evolve with purpose. For investors watching the top crypto presale in 2025 , the clock is ticking, especially on Cold Wallet’s sub-cent pricing. With each presale stage increasing the entry cost, waiting too long could mean buying at post-launch prices and missing out on substantial upside.

There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.288 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3.30 zone. XRP Price Eyes Upside Break XRP price formed a base above the $3.10 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price gained pace for a move above the $3.120 and $3.15 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $3.250 resistance, but the bears were active near $3.30. A high was formed at $3.30 and the price dipped toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3.10 swing low to the $3.30 high. The price is now trading above $3.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.2880 level. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.288 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $3.30 level. A clear move above the $3.30 resistance might send the price toward the $3.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.380 resistance or even $3.40 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.450 zone. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.30 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.20 level. The next major support is near the $3.150 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3.10 swing low to the $3.30 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $3.080 support. The next major support sits near the $3.020 zone where the bulls might take a stand. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.

A 300 million USDT transfer from a DeFi platform like Aave to a centralized exchange such as HTX suggests a deliberate action by a substantial holder. Aave is known for its lending and borrowing services, allowing users to earn interest or take out loans against their crypto assets. HTX, on the other hand, is a major global cryptocurrency exchange facilitating trading, deposits, and withdrawals. DeFi to CeFi Movement: This specific flow indicates a shift from the more permissionless, often yield-generating environment of DeFi to the more structured, liquid trading environment of a centralized exchange. Potential Liquidity Provision: The funds could be moved to HTX to provide liquidity for trading pairs, prepare for large-scale buying or selling, or facilitate over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Whale Activity Monitoring: This is a classic example of crypto whale activity . Tracking these large transfers helps analysts understand where significant capital is flowing and what intentions might be behind it. Understanding the context of such a move is crucial for anyone monitoring the crypto market. It often provides a glimpse into the strategies employed by major players. Analyzing the Aave HTX Transaction: Potential Reasons Behind Large Crypto Movements Several theories emerge when a significant sum like $300 million USDT changes hands in the crypto space. While the exact motives of the entity behind this Aave HTX transaction remain private, common reasons for such large crypto movements include: Arbitrage Opportunities: Whales might move funds to capitalize on price discrepancies between exchanges. If USDT trades at a slight premium on HTX compared to other platforms, moving a large sum could allow for profitable arbitrage. Pre-emptive Trading Positions: The funds might be preparing for a significant trade, either buying or selling other cryptocurrencies. A large USDT deposit could precede a substantial purchase of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Yield Optimization: Although Aave offers yields, the whale might have identified a more lucrative, short-term yield opportunity or a specific investment product only available on HTX or through its network. Risk Management: Shifting funds from a DeFi protocol to a centralized exchange could also be a risk management decision, perhaps in anticipation of market volatility or a desire to reduce exposure to smart contract risks inherent in DeFi. Each possibility paints a different picture of the market’s immediate future. This type of transaction truly underscores the dynamic nature of digital asset shift patterns. Impact and Implications: What This Digital Asset Shift Means for You A digital asset shift of this scale, specifically a 300 million USDT transfer , can have several implications, even if indirect, for the broader market and individual participants. While it doesn’t directly dictate price movements, it contributes to the overall market sentiment and liquidity profile. Market Liquidity: Such a large deposit of USDT on HTX increases the available liquidity on that exchange, potentially making large trades easier to execute without significant price impact. Sentiment Indicator: For some, a move from DeFi to CeFi might signal a more cautious approach by large holders, or a preparation for increased trading activity. Monitoring Whale Wallets: This event highlights the importance of monitoring known whale wallets and significant transactions. Tools like Whale Alert provide invaluable insights into these powerful movements. It is important for everyday investors to observe these trends, but not necessarily to react impulsively. Instead, consider what these large crypto movements might imply for market stability and future trading opportunities. Such insights can help inform your own investment strategy. In conclusion, the 300 million USDT transfer from Aave to HTX is a significant event in the crypto world. It showcases the ongoing interplay between decentralized and centralized finance and the strategic maneuvering of large holders. While the exact motivations behind this particular Aave HTX transaction remain speculative, its occurrence underscores the need for vigilance and informed analysis in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape.

From trading desks in London to bustling markets in Tokyo, the spotlight is firmly on the future trajectory of the US Dollar and the potential for significant shifts in monetary policy. Recent economic indicators, particularly fresh CPI Data , have fueled widespread speculation that the Federal Reserve might be gearing up for a series of Interest Rate Cuts as early as September. What does this mean for the volatile Forex Market , and how are Asian Currencies poised to react? Understanding the Fragility of the US Dollar : What’s Driving the Downturn? For years, the US Dollar has stood as a bastion of stability, often serving as a safe-haven asset during times of global uncertainty. However, recent trends suggest a noticeable shift in its strength. The dollar has been trading in a muted range against a basket of major currencies, with a distinct undertone of fragility. Several factors contribute to this evolving narrative: Inflationary Pressures Easing: A primary driver of the dollar’s recent strength was the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hike cycle aimed at taming surging inflation. As inflation shows signs of cooling, the urgency for higher rates diminishes, reducing the dollar’s yield advantage. Market Expectations: Traders and investors are increasingly pricing in future rate cuts. When markets anticipate lower interest rates, the appeal of holding a currency that offers less return diminishes, leading to selling pressure. Global Economic Rebalancing: As other major economies, particularly in Europe and Asia, show signs of recovery or stabilization, the relative attractiveness of the dollar can wane. Capital may begin to flow towards regions offering better growth prospects or comparable yields. This evolving dynamic for the US Dollar is creating ripples across all asset classes, especially within the highly interconnected Forex Market . The Crucial Role of Recent CPI Data in Shaping Expectations The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, a key gauge of inflation, has been a game-changer for market sentiment. This economic release is meticulously scrutinized by central banks and investors alike, as it provides vital clues about the health of an economy and the potential direction of monetary policy. The recent CPI Data revealed: Slower-than-Expected Inflation: Both headline and core inflation figures came in softer than anticipated. This indicates that the Federal Reserve’s previous rate hikes are having the desired effect of cooling price pressures. Disinflationary Trend: The data reinforces a broader disinflationary trend, suggesting that the era of rapidly rising prices might be behind us. This gives the Fed more room to consider easing its monetary policy. Impact on Rate Cut Probabilities: Immediately following the release of the favorable CPI Data , market probabilities for a September Interest Rate Cuts surged significantly. Traders adjusted their positions, betting on a less restrictive monetary stance from the Fed. This report has undeniably shifted the narrative, providing tangible evidence that could pave the way for future policy adjustments. Are Interest Rate Cuts on the Horizon? Analyzing the Fed’s Dilemma The question on everyone’s mind is: Will the Federal Reserve indeed initiate Interest Rate Cuts in September? While the recent CPI Data certainly bolsters the case, the Fed operates under a dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and maintaining price stability. Here’s a look at the ongoing debate: Arguments for Rate Cuts: Cooling Inflation: As evidenced by the CPI, inflation is moving closer to the Fed’s 2% target, reducing the need for restrictive policy. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Some economists argue that prolonged high rates could tip the economy into a recession, making preemptive cuts necessary to ensure a ‘soft landing’. Global Synchronization: Other major central banks might also be contemplating or executing rate cuts, making it prudent for the Fed to align to prevent significant currency imbalances. Arguments Against Immediate Cuts (or for caution): Resilient Labor Market: Despite some softening, the US labor market remains relatively strong, which could still fuel wage-driven inflation. Sticky Core Inflation: While headline inflation has dropped, core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy) might remain somewhat ‘sticky’, warranting continued vigilance. Risk of Re-acceleration: Cutting rates too soon could risk reigniting inflation, forcing the Fed to reverse course later, which could destabilize markets. The Fed will carefully weigh these factors, along with other economic indicators like employment reports and retail sales, before making a definitive move. The market, however, is increasingly convinced of a September pivot. How Asian Currencies Are Reacting to Global Shifts in the Forex Market The potential for Interest Rate Cuts in the US has significant implications for Asian Currencies . A weaker US Dollar generally makes Asian exports more competitive and reduces the cost of dollar-denominated imports for these nations. Here’s how some key Asian currencies are responding within the broader Forex Market : Japanese Yen (JPY): The Yen has often been a barometer of global risk appetite. A weaker dollar, coupled with the Bank of Japan’s dovish stance, could provide some much-needed relief to the heavily depreciated Yen. Chinese Yuan (CNY): The Yuan’s movements are closely managed, but a weaker dollar eases pressure on China’s exporters and provides more flexibility for its monetary policy, especially as China navigates its own economic challenges. Indian Rupee (INR): For India, a weaker dollar could reduce its import bill, particularly for crude oil, which is a major component. This could help manage domestic inflation and provide room for the Reserve Bank of India. Korean Won (KRW) & Southeast Asian Currencies: These export-oriented economies often benefit from a weaker dollar as their goods become cheaper for international buyers. However, they also face domestic inflation pressures and geopolitical considerations. While a weaker dollar is generally positive, Asian Currencies also contend with their own domestic economic fundamentals, inflation outlooks, and central bank policies. The interplay of these factors will dictate their precise movements in the dynamic Forex Market . Navigating the Volatile Forex Market : Strategies for Investors In a period of such significant shifts, understanding the dynamics of the Forex Market is paramount for investors and businesses. The potential for Interest Rate Cuts presents both opportunities and risks. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and other major central banks. Their forward guidance is crucial. Diversify Currency Exposure: Consider diversifying portfolios to include a mix of currencies, especially those from economies with strong fundamentals and differing monetary policy trajectories. Hedge Currency Risk: For businesses engaged in international trade, consider hedging strategies to mitigate the impact of adverse currency movements. Focus on Relative Value: Look for opportunities where one currency might be undervalued relative to another, based on economic data and interest rate differentials. For instance, if the US Dollar continues to weaken, strong Asian Currencies might present attractive long positions. Stay Informed on Economic Data: Beyond CPI, keep an eye on employment figures, GDP growth, retail sales, and manufacturing data from major economies. These provide a holistic view of economic health. The Forex Market is a continuous flow of information and reactions. Agility and informed decision-making will be key to navigating the coming months. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the Global Economy The current fragility of the US Dollar , largely influenced by the latest positive CPI Data , has set the stage for what could be a pivotal shift in global monetary policy. The growing expectation of Interest Rate Cuts by the Federal Reserve in September marks a significant moment, potentially ushering in a new phase for the Forex Market and providing a fresh impetus for Asian Currencies . While optimism about lower borrowing costs is palpable, market participants must remain vigilant, adapting to evolving economic indicators and central bank communications. The coming months promise to be dynamic, challenging investors to refine their strategies and capitalize on the emerging opportunities in a world where monetary policy is once again taking center stage.

This crucial decision, set for August 15 at 03:00 UTC, directly impacts traders holding or interacting with ANIME/FDUSD, HYPER/FDUSD, and STO/BNB. Understanding these changes is vital for anyone involved in crypto trading pairs on the platform. Understanding the Binance Delisting Decision Why do exchanges like Binance decide to remove certain trading pairs? It’s a common practice in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Exchanges regularly review listed assets to ensure a healthy trading environment for their users. The reasons behind a Binance delisting can vary. Typically, these include factors such as: Low Liquidity: When a trading pair doesn’t see enough buying and selling activity, it can become difficult for users to execute trades efficiently. Project Inactivity: If the development team behind a cryptocurrency project becomes inactive or fails to meet certain milestones. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulations might require exchanges to delist certain assets to remain compliant. Poor Performance: Projects that no longer meet Binance’s listing standards or show consistent poor performance. This particular announcement from Binance concerns the ANIME/FDUSD, HYPER/FDUSD, and STO/BNB pairs. This reflects the exchange’s ongoing review process for all Binance spot trading pairs to maintain a robust and secure trading ecosystem. How Does This Binance Delisting Affect Your Holdings? For traders, understanding the implications of a delisting is paramount. When a pair is delisted, it means you will no longer be able to trade these specific assets against each other on Binance’s spot market after the specified date and time. Specifically, after August 15, 03:00 UTC, you will not be able to: Place new buy or sell orders for ANIME/FDUSD, HYPER/FDUSD, or STO/BNB. Any existing open orders for these pairs will be automatically canceled by Binance. It’s important to note that the assets themselves (ANIME, HYPER, STO, FDUSD, BNB) are not being delisted from the exchange entirely, only these specific trading pairs. However, if you hold these delisted crypto assets, you must take action. Binance typically allows users to withdraw the delisted assets for a period after the delisting, or to convert them to other assets if supported by other trading pairs. Navigating Future Crypto Trading Pairs on Binance The news of the ANIME FDUSD delisting , along with HYPER/FDUSD and STO/BNB, serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, and exchange listings can change. Therefore, staying informed is key to successful trading. Here are some actionable insights for traders: Check Your Portfolio: Immediately review your Binance portfolio to identify if you hold any of the affected assets in these specific pairs. Consider Your Options: Before August 15, decide whether to sell your ANIME, HYPER, or STO tokens against other available pairs (if any) or withdraw them to an external wallet. Stay Informed: Regularly check Binance’s official announcements page for updates on listings, delistings, and other critical news. This proactive approach ensures that you are always prepared for market changes and can manage your investments effectively. Binance strives to provide a transparent and efficient trading platform, and these delistings are part of their ongoing efforts to optimize the user experience. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance delisting of ANIME/FDUSD, HYPER/FDUSD, and STO/BNB on August 15 at 03:00 UTC is a significant event for affected traders. By understanding the reasons behind such decisions and taking timely action, you can effectively manage your crypto holdings and continue to navigate the exciting world of crypto trading pairs with confidence. Always prioritize staying updated with official exchange announcements to protect your investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Binance delisting these specific trading pairs? Binance regularly reviews all listed trading pairs to ensure a healthy and high-quality trading environment. Delistings typically occur due to factors like low liquidity, project inactivity, regulatory changes, or if the projects no longer meet Binance’s listing standards. Q2: What should I do if I hold ANIME, HYPER, or STO tokens in these delisted crypto pairs? You should review your portfolio immediately. Before August 15, 03:00 UTC, you must either sell your holdings in the affected ANIME/FDUSD, HYPER/FDUSD, or STO/BNB pairs or withdraw the tokens to an external wallet. After this date, trading in these specific pairs will cease. Q3: Will I lose my funds if I don’t act by August 15? You will not lose your funds, but you will no longer be able to trade these specific pairs on Binance’s spot market. Your tokens (ANIME, HYPER, STO, FDUSD, BNB) will remain in your wallet on Binance, but you will need to find alternative ways to trade or withdraw them if no other pairs are available for those specific tokens on Binance. Q4: How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance, like many other major exchanges, conducts periodic reviews of its listed assets. Delistings are not uncommon and happen as part of their ongoing efforts to maintain a high-quality trading environment and adapt to market changes and regulatory requirements.

Altcoins added to their rally during late Tuesday U.S. afternoon hours after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the Federal Reserve should consider a 50 basis point rate cut at its upcoming September meeting. Ether extended a strong week with gains of nearly 30%, nearing fresh highs that has historically preceded rotations and market frenzy in altcoins and microcap tokens. ETFs tied to the token registered $520 million in positive flows on Tuesday, data shows , on track to reach over $2 billion in weekly flows for the first time. Bitcoin (BTC) remained steady just under $120,000. Solana’s SOL (SOL) surged 12% to $198, BNB Chain’s BNB (BNB) added 5% to $837, and XRP (XRP) gained 4% to $3.25. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) rose over 8%, continuing a tendency of following ETH price action. Traders say recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump fueled sentiment after ordering regulators to “look into” the possibility of adding crypto — alongside private equity — to U.S. 401(k) retirement plans. While this prospect is currently exploratory, the possibility of retirement accounts gaining direct exposure to crypto would represent a significant structural shift in demand. “Ethereum has been the standout, with mainstream equity analysts now joining the FOMO trade,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “BTC implied volatility remains near all-time lows while ETH’s short-dated vol has jumped materially — that’s a sign traders see more upside and near-term action in ETH.” Implied volatility (IV) is the market’s forecast of how much a crypto’s price might move in the future, based on options prices. If IV is low, traders aren’t expecting big swings and if it’s high, they’re bracing for bigger moves. Short-dated volatility refers to the implied volatility of options that expire soon, typically within days or weeks. This reflects expectations for near-term price action rather than the long-term outlook. In this case, BTC’s IV is near record lows, indicating that traders expect its price to remain relatively stable. ETH’s short-dated volatility is jumping, which suggests that traders expect larger near-term price swings — and probably more upside — in ETH compared to BTC. Rate-cut bets added fuel to the move. Markets now price a high likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering rates before year-end, easing macro headwinds for risk assets. “Ethereum’s breakout past $4,600 reflects growing confidence in its institutional adoption,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin holding near $119,000 shows resilient demand. A dovish Fed pivot could further accelerate ETH’s outperformance, especially with ETF speculation and scaling upgrades ahead,” Ruck added. Meanwhile, FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich noted the rally is unusual in that altcoin strength appears to be pulling BTC higher, not the other way around. “Bitcoin is testing historical highs above $122,000 with the next major target at $135,000-$138,000. Ethereum is now in striking distance of its all-time high above $4,800,” he said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-13 05:09:46

The filings, dated Aug. 12, list the entities as the Grayscale Cardano Trust ETF and the Grayscale Hedera Trust ETF, both organized as general statutory trusts. The registrations appear on Delaware’s official corporate records portal and follow a pattern the asset manager has used before when preparing for ETF launches. Similar filings have often preceded S-1 submissions to the US SEC, a required step before a fund can begin trading. Earlier this year, the SEC acknowledged NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 form for Grayscale’s proposed spot Cardano ETF and Nasdaq’s form for a Hedera ETF. Those acknowledgments marked the first stage in the regulatory review process. [FILING] Grayscale Registers Hedera and Cardano Trust ETF in Delaware $HBAR $ADA — BecauseBitcoin.com (@BecauseBitcoin) August 12, 2025 Cardano and Hedera Trusts Mark Next Phase of Grayscale’s ETF Strategy These new trusts are Grayscale’s first altcoin ETF registrations in Delaware for Cardano (ADA) and Hedera (HBAR). The firm has already registered investment trusts for other alternative cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin , Filecoin, Avalanche and Bittensor. The move comes alongside the launch of two separate Grayscale trusts offering exposure to the native tokens of DeepBook and Walrus , projects that provide trading and data infrastructure on the Sui blockchain. Industry analysts view these steps as part of a broader push by US asset managers to expand into altcoin-based ETFs, building on the commercial success of spot Bitcoin and ether funds. That success has drawn increasing interest from institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to a wider range of digital assets. Regulatory Tailwinds Strengthen Case for Altcoin ETFs Cardano is known for its research-driven approach to blockchain development. It also focuses heavily on scalability. Meanwhile, Hedera offers an alternative distributed ledger model, and it is designed for enterprise use cases. Therefore, ETF listings for these tokens could open new access points for investors. They would appeal to those who prefer traditional market structures over direct token purchases. The regulatory environment is now shifting in favor of such products. Recently, the SEC approved in-kind redemption mechanisms for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. As a result, this decision has encouraged more filings linked to other cryptocurrencies. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are also working together on “Project Crypto.” This initiative aims to clarify how digital assets are classified under US law. As part of this effort, regulators are determining which tokens should be considered securities. Consequently, this addresses a long-standing uncertainty for potential issuers. Last month, Grayscale also confidentially filed for a US initial public offering with the SEC, underscoring its ambitions to broaden its market presence. If approved, spot Cardano and Hedera ETFs could boost liquidity and market engagement for both tokens, while providing institutional investors with new, regulated vehicles to gain exposure. The Delaware filings indicate Grayscale is laying the groundwork to bring these products to market once regulatory clearance is secured.

Traders now see a 94% chance of a Fed cut in September, up from nearly 86% the prior day and about 57% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Investors were especially alert to the inflation print because it followed a weaker-than-expected jobs report on August 1, a combination that had stirred talk about stagflation risks. Politics around the central bank also drew notice. Trump nominated White House adviser Stephen Miran to temporarily fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, prompting fresh debate over potential White House sway on monetary policy. Separately, the White House said it was “the plan” for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to keep releasing its monthly employment report after Trump’s choice to lead the agency, E.J.

This massive transaction highlights the influence large holders, often referred to as crypto whales, can have on market dynamics. Understanding these moves is crucial for anyone tracking the Ethereum whale activity and its potential impact on the broader market. Who is This Ethereum Whale and What Did They Do? The mysterious entity known as “7 Siblings” recently executed a remarkable sale. This particular Ethereum whale offloaded 19,957 ETH, converting it into 90.44 million USDC. This sale occurred at an average price of approximately $4,532 per ETH. Such a large-scale transaction by a single entity is always noteworthy, providing valuable on-chain analysis for market watchers. On-chain analyst @EmberCN on X was among the first to highlight this significant movement. Their analysis provides transparency into the actions of these major market participants. These insights are vital for understanding the flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem. What’s the History Behind This Crypto Whale’s Holdings? The “7 Siblings” crypto whale is not new to the Ethereum market. They made a substantial entry during last year’s market crash on August 5th, acquiring a staggering 100,000 ETH at an approximate price of $2,270 per coin. This strategic purchase positioned them to capitalize significantly on Ethereum’s subsequent price recovery. Even after this recent large-scale divestment, the whale’s holdings remain impressive. They are estimated to still possess around 280,000 ETH, which is currently valued at approximately $1.3 billion. This demonstrates their enduring conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite taking some profits. How Does a Large ETH Whale Sells Event Impact ETH Price? When an ETH whale sells such a significant volume, it naturally raises questions about its potential effects on ETH price . While a $90 million sale is substantial, the market’s absorption capacity for Ethereum is also considerable, given its multi-billion dollar daily trading volume. Often, such sales are executed over-the-counter (OTC) or through various decentralized exchanges to minimize direct market impact. However, the psychological effect can be profound. News of a major whale taking profits can sometimes trigger short-term bearish sentiment, especially among smaller investors who might interpret it as a signal of impending downturn. Conversely, the market might view it as healthy profit-taking, indicating maturity. Key considerations include: Market Liquidity: How easily can the market absorb such a large sell-off without significant price drops? Whale’s Intent: Is this a full exit, or strategic rebalancing? In this case, the whale still holds a large sum, suggesting rebalancing. Overall Market Sentiment: Is the broader crypto market bullish or bearish? This influences how a sale is perceived. What Can We Learn from This Crucial On-Chain Analysis? This event underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain analysis and whale movements. Tools that track large transactions provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential supply shifts. While not every whale move dictates future price, understanding their behavior can offer a more complete picture of market dynamics. For investors, this situation offers a few actionable insights: Diversify: Relying too heavily on a single asset, even Ethereum, carries risks. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow whale movements. Understand the context. Long-Term Vision: Whales often have a long-term strategy. Short-term price fluctuations from their sales might not reflect the asset’s fundamental value. In conclusion, the recent $90.44 million ETH whale sells event by “7 Siblings” provides a fascinating glimpse into the strategies of major cryptocurrency holders. While substantial, this profit-taking appears to be part of a larger, well-timed investment strategy, with the whale still retaining a significant Ethereum position. Monitoring such movements through on-chain analysis offers a deeper understanding of market forces, empowering individual investors to make more informed decisions amidst the ever-evolving ETH price . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the “7 Siblings” whale? A1: “7 Siblings” is a pseudonym for a large cryptocurrency holder who has executed significant trades in Ethereum, notably buying 100,000 ETH during the August 2023 market crash and recently selling a portion of their holdings. Q2: How much ETH did “7 Siblings” sell recently? A2: The “7 Siblings” whale recently sold 19,957 ETH for 90.44 million USDC, at an average price of approximately $4,532 per ETH. Q3: What impact do large ETH sales have on the market? A3: Large sales, like when an ETH whale sells a significant amount, can create short-term volatility or bearish sentiment. However, the overall impact depends on market liquidity, the whale’s intent (profit-taking vs. full exit), and broader market sentiment. Q4: How can I track crypto whale movements? A4: You can track crypto whale movements through various on-chain analysis platforms and tools that monitor large transactions on blockchain networks, often shared by analysts on social media platforms like X. Q5: What is on-chain analysis? A5: On-chain analysis involves examining data directly from a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet activity, and asset flows, to gain insights into market trends and participant behavior, including that of an Ethereum whale .

The move comes amid a surge in sophisticated hacks, with over $3 billion stolen in early 2025 and many funds laundered within minutes, leaving recovery rates at just 4.2%. While critics question the centralized control of stablecoin issuers, supporters argue these coordinated projects are vital when it comes to fighting crypto crime. Binance Enters Crime Fighting Crypto Alliance Tron, Tether, and TRM Labs announced that their joint T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) froze over $250 million in illicit crypto assets since launching less than a year ago. This is more than double the amount reported in its first six months. Established in September 2024, the unit works with law enforcement globally to track and disrupt illicit blockchain transactions tied to money laundering, investment fraud, blackmail, terrorism financing, and other crimes. Announcement from the T3 Financial Crimes Unit The group is now expanding its reach through the new T3+ program, which will enlist exchanges and financial institutions worldwide to share intelligence and respond to threats in real time, and Binance joined as its first member. Tron founder Justin Sun said that the expansion will broaden collaboration across the blockchain industry to fight illicit activity more effectively. The initiative is operating amid a surge in sophisticated crypto hacks. Data from Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger shows that more than $3 billion was stolen in the first half of 2025, with hackers moving funds faster than ever — in some cases laundering assets in under three minutes. (Source: Global Ledger ) More than 30% of stolen crypto is laundered within 24 hours, and in almost a quarter of cases, the process is complete before a hack is even disclosed. This very quick pace left recovery rates at just 4.2%, with about 15% of illicit funds passing through centralized exchanges, where compliance teams have only minutes to act. Many attacks have been linked to state-backed hackers, cybercrime syndicates, and transnational fraud networks, which only complicates recovery efforts even more. The growing role of stablecoin issuers in freezing funds sparked debate in the industry. Tether recently froze nearly $86,000 in stolen USDT, which reignited concerns over centralized control and its potential clash with crypto’s decentralization ethos. While critics warn about the risks to user sovereignty, others see these measures as essential. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino argued that only through collective action can the industry create a safer, more trusted environment for users as bad actors “have nowhere to hide on the blockchain.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-13 05:30:00

Over the past 24 hours, traders have spent more than $5 million on the $5,000 strike call option expiring on Sept. 26, per data tracked by Amberdata. The buyers are betting on an ETH breakout above $5,000 by the end of this quarter. As of writing, ether changed hands at $4,670, representing a 26% gain for the month, according to CoinDesk data. Traders also picked up calls at the $5,500 and $6,000 strikes and bull call spreads. OTC tech platform Paradigm said in a Telegram update that a market participant lifted the December expiry call at the $7,500 strike. According to analysts, there is plenty of upside in ether, which has lagged not only bitcoin but also XRP in setting record highs during this cycle. ""With everyone sidelined from ETH and sentiment being completely in the dumps, there remains a lot of room for ETH to catch up. Immediate targets are $5,000 (breaking into new ATH territory) and around $7,200 (given the mid-range ETH/BTC price of 0.06 with BTC around $120k),"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a weekly note. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, the price surge of ETH is characterized by persistent selling from retail traders. ""Prices historically move in the opposite direction of retail traders' expectations. There was an instance of extreme greed back on June 16, 2025 and July 30, 2025, which led to price corrections. But traders have shown FUD and disbelief as the asset makes higher and higher prices,"" Santiment said on X. ""With key stakeholders accumulating loose coins that small $ETH traders are willing to part with right now, prices are showing very little sentiment resistance from breaking through and making history in the near future,"" the firm added. ETH is now just 4.4% short of its all-time high of $4,861 hit in November 2021. It's peer, BTC, topped its 2021 peak in March last year and has rallied into six figures since then.

Its market value is therefore currently above 520 billion dollars. This growth makes ETH the 22nd largest asset in the world, ahead of Mastercard. An increase in trading volume propels this. Recent analysts now believe that there is a high likelihood that ETH will hit the $4,400 mark in the near future, and it could hit its all-time high of around $5,000 later in 2025. Meanwhile, institutional interest intensifies, evidenced by massive Ethereum ETF inflows totaling $461 million recently. Concurrently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates explosive presale growth, positioning it as a potential standout altcoin. Its current presale phase offers a critical entry point before further price hikes. Ethereum’s bullish trajectory and whale activity Ethereum continues its impressive rally, gaining over 1.45% in 24 hours. Technical analysts observe compelling patterns, including a breakout from a Wyckoff Accumulation formation. This pattern historically signals strong potential upward movement. Furthermore, ETH has broken free from a multi-year symmetrical triangle. Consequently, some forecasts target prices between $6,000 and an ambitious $20,000 within months. Significant whale accumulation underpins this optimism. On-chain data reveals one entity purchasing over $946 million worth of ETH within a single week. Major figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes are also actively accumulating ETH and select altcoins, reinforcing positive crypto predictions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing substantial investor attention during its ongoing presale. Currently in Phase 6, tokens are available at $0.035. This price reflects a remarkable 250% increase from the opening phase cost of $0.01. Investors have already committed over $14,300,000, securing more than 675 million tokens. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,150 individuals. Phase 6 is progressing rapidly and selling out fast. Therefore, the opportunity to acquire tokens at this level is diminishing quickly. Subsequently, Phase 7 will commence, raising the price by 14.3% to $0.04 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will ultimately launch at $0.06. This presents current Phase 6 participants with a potential 400% return on investment post-launch. Project utility and security assurance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility within decentralized finance. Its core platform will feature a dual-lending model: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C system allows tokenizing blue-chip assets like BTC and ETH, generating yield via mtTokens. Conversely, P2P enables direct lending agreements, often involving higher-risk assets like memecoins for greater potential returns. Security remains paramount. The team successfully finalized its CertiK audit, achieving an exceptional 95.00 security score. This result confirms a robust security posture. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. They allocated $50,000 USDT for rewards across four severity tiers (critical, major, minor, low). Community incentives and presale opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) actively rewards its growing community. They recently announced a major $100,000 MUTM token giveaway. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 worth of tokens. Furthermore, the project introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard. This tracks the top 50 token holders. These leading holders will earn bonus token rewards for maintaining their positions. Analysts monitoring crypto charts observe strong demand fundamentals. Post-launch price predictions suggest significant potential growth, with some forecasts indicating values could reach between $1 and $5 based on adoption and platform usage. Mutuum Finance stands poised for growth Ethereum’s impressive surge past Mastercard highlights crypto’s growing financial clout. Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages its successful presale and robust framework. Its unique dual-lending utility, proven security via CertiK, and attractive community incentives create a compelling case. Phase 6 offers a final window before the next price increase.

The metric, which measures Bitcoin’s crypto market share, has been trending downward since late June when Ether started to wake up. Since then, it has declined by 10% sparking renewed calls for altseason, which usually comes when BTC dominance drops to 50%. Bitcoin’s market share has been in an uptrend since the bear market of late 2022, which many altcoins have yet to recover from. Bitcoin dominance fell below 55% in December 2024 during the crypto market rally after the US election, but it resumed its uptrend shortly after, according to TradingView. Bitcoin Dominance Showing Weakness This was the biggest indicator of altseason witnessed in 2017 and 2021, “and it shows that mega altseason for this bull run is pending,” commented crypto research channel ‘Bull Theory’ on Tuesday. “Currently, BTC.D on the weekly chart shows clear weakness, and if it breaks down, we will see alts exploding randomly.” Bitcoin dominance can drop to the 45% level in the next six months, and this is where altcoins pump 10x to 50x, they added. The sentiment has been echoed by several analysts, all observing the same thing.

It hit 55 on June 21 during the market rally but has fallen back along with the prices of most altcoins. However, Blockchain Center’s altseason index is showing a much higher reading of 53, having jumped over the past week with the rise of Ether. $TOTAL2 is repeating history. ALTSEASON IS IMMINENT! pic.twitter.com/dt7I1Sip7J — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) August 12, 2025 Altcoins Stealing The Show Bitcoin has remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, trading around $119,350 at the time of writing. However, Ethereum has jumped more than 8% to reach $4,670, just 4.2% away from its 2021 all-time high, in Wednesday morning trading in Asia. Ether’s meteoric rise over the past month has eaten into Bitcoin’s market dominance. Solana is also performing very well today with a 12% pump as it closes in on $200, while Cardano was up over 9% as it reached $0.86. Chainlink was up 13% to reach $24.50, and Litecoin had gained 11% to hit a six-month high of $133 as altcoins stole the show today.

This dramatic jump follows an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump. His directive urges regulators to consider including bitcoin within 401(k) retirement plans. Consequently, anticipation of massive new institutional demand is fueling the rally. Meanwhile, another project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is experiencing explosive presale growth. Starting at $0.01, its token price has surged 250% to $0.035 in just six phases. This cheap crypto now targets a potential $2 valuation, attracting significant crypto investment. Bitcoin rally fueled by retirement access push Trump’s executive order is the primary catalyst for bitcoin’s surge. It specifically tasks the Labor Department with exploring digital asset inclusion in 401(k)s. Opening these retirement accounts could unlock billions in potential crypto investment. Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, confirms this news drove the rebound. Furthermore, consistent inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs underscore sustained institutional interest. Corporate treasuries adding bitcoin remain a critical driver for this cycle. However, macroeconomic indicators are being monitored by investors. Important inflation data (CPI and PPI) are expected this week. The current market pricing implies that there is an 88.4 percent likelihood of a Fed cut in September. This is the state of the crypto market where there is a fine line between bullish crypto news and macro risks. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing significant attention during its ongoing presale. Phase 6 is currently underway, offering tokens at $0.035. This represents a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase price. Demand is exceptionally high. Over $14,300,000 has been raised since the presale began. More than 675 million MUTM tokens have already been sold. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,150. Phase 6 is selling out quickly. Consequently, the opportunity to acquire tokens at this low price is diminishing rapidly. Immediately after this phase concludes, Phase 7 will commence. The price will then increase by 14.3%, rising to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will ultimately launch at $0.06. This presents current Phase 6 participants with a potential 400% gain post-launch. Analysts project further growth, targeting $2-$5 based on platform adoption and tokenomics. Robust security underpins investor confidence Security is paramount for Mutuum Finance. The project successfully completed a rigorous CertiK audit. This audit yielded an impressive 95.00 security score, confirming a solid security posture. Importantly, no vulnerabilities were discovered in the audited smart contracts. Moreover, no security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days. To further strengthen its defenses, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is available. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity: critical, major, minor, and low. This proactive approach significantly enhances trust within the crypto investment community. Additionally, the team launched a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard. The top 50 MUTM holders will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions, incentivizing long-term holding. Mutuum Finance targets major DeFi utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not merely speculative; it delivers tangible utility. The project is developing a decentralized lending platform featuring dual models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Furthermore, Mutuum plans to introduce an innovative overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will mint only upon loan issuance and burn upon repayment, maintaining its peg and avoiding inflation. The combination of real-world utility, strong tokenomics, and scalability underpins optimistic crypto predictions for MUTM’s value appreciation post-launch. Market shift highlights Mutuum Finance opportunity Bitcoin’s surge past $122,000 underscores crypto’s growing institutional acceptance. Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling early-stage opportunity. Consider exploring the Mutuum Finance presale and potential giveaway before Phase 6 concludes.

A massive USDC transfer , totaling over $339 million, recently flowed from an unidentified wallet straight into Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This significant whale transaction immediately sparked discussions about its potential implications for the broader crypto market. What Just Happened? The Massive USDC Transfer Explained Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, flagged an extraordinary event: 339,175,331 USDC was transferred. The sender’s wallet remains ‘unknown,’ adding a layer of mystery to this colossal sum. The destination, however, is clear: Binance. This particular Binance deposit represents a substantial injection of liquidity into the exchange. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its primary purpose is to provide stability in the volatile crypto market, acting as a digital dollar. Large movements of stablecoins like this USDC transfer often indicate significant activity from institutional players or very wealthy individual investors, often referred to as ‘whales.’ Decoding Crypto Whale Activity: Why Does This Matter? Understanding crypto whale activity is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space. Whales, by definition, hold substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, and their moves can significantly influence market dynamics. When such a large amount of USDC moves to an exchange, it can signal several things: Preparation for Buying: The whale might be positioning themselves to purchase other cryptocurrencies, potentially anticipating a market uptrend. Liquidity Provision: The funds could be intended to provide liquidity for large over-the-counter (OTC) trades, which don’t directly impact spot market prices. Portfolio Rebalancing: A whale might be consolidating funds or preparing to exit certain positions, though a stablecoin deposit usually suggests an intent to stay within the crypto ecosystem. Each major whale transaction offers a glimpse into the strategies of the market’s biggest players. While the exact intent remains speculative, the sheer volume of this stablecoin movement makes it noteworthy. Stablecoin Movement and Market Implications The movement of stablecoins like USDC is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment and future price action. A significant stablecoin movement into an major exchange like Binance typically suggests that a large player is preparing to engage with the market. This could involve buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins. Conversely, large withdrawals of stablecoins from exchanges might indicate a move to self-custody or an intention to deploy capital off-exchange. The fact that this particular USDC transfer went into Binance points towards active participation rather than withdrawal. While the ‘unknown wallet’ aspect adds intrigue, it is common for large entities to use multiple addresses for privacy or operational reasons. Pinpointing the exact identity behind such a large Binance deposit is often challenging, highlighting the pseudo-anonymous nature of blockchain transactions. What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Binance Deposit? The immediate impact of this Binance deposit is an increase in the exchange’s available USDC liquidity. This extra liquidity can facilitate larger trades without causing significant slippage. For the broader market, several scenarios could unfold: Increased Buying Pressure: If the whale intends to buy other cryptocurrencies, this could lead to an upward price movement for those assets. Market Stability: The presence of large stablecoin reserves can also contribute to market stability, as it provides a buffer against volatility. OTC Activity: As mentioned, it could be part of an OTC deal, which would not directly affect public order books but still represents significant capital deployment. For retail investors, observing such large transactions can provide clues, but they should always exercise caution. These movements are just one piece of a much larger puzzle. They serve as a reminder that significant capital is actively engaged in the crypto space, shaping its future. In conclusion, the recent USDC transfer of over $339 million to Binance is a compelling event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. This substantial whale transaction , originating from an unknown wallet, highlights the continuous flow of capital within the digital economy. While the exact intentions behind this large Binance deposit remain speculative, it undoubtedly adds a layer of intrigue and potential market implications for everyone watching the crypto landscape. Such crypto whale activity consistently provides valuable insights into the market’s pulse, making it a key area for observation. Frequently Asked Questions About Large Crypto Transfers Here are some common questions regarding significant cryptocurrency movements: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions, due to their size, can significantly influence market prices and sentiment. Why do large USDC transfers to exchanges happen? Large USDC transfers to exchanges often indicate an intent to engage in significant trading activity. This could be buying other cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity for large over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or preparing for portfolio rebalancing. How can an ‘unknown wallet’ transfer such a large sum? Blockchain transactions are pseudo-anonymous. While the wallet address is visible, the identity of the person or entity controlling it is not directly revealed unless they choose to disclose it. Large institutions or wealthy individuals often use multiple, unlinked wallets for various reasons. Does this Binance deposit mean prices will go up or down? A large Binance deposit of stablecoins like USDC typically suggests an intention to buy other cryptocurrencies, which could lead to upward price pressure. However, it is not a guarantee. Market dynamics are complex, and many factors influence price movements. How can I track crypto whale activity? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking large blockchain transactions. Following reputable crypto news outlets and blockchain analytics platforms can also provide insights into significant crypto whale activity .

The chart, created on TradingView using the Bitstamp monthly XRP/USD pair, is dated August 10, 2025, and outlines what the analyst identifies as three major market cycles. Cycle 1 is labeled as lasting “8 bars, 245 days,” Cycle 2 as “5 bars, 151 days,” and Cycle 3, the current cycle, as “8 bars, 243 days.” These cycles are visually separated by vertical blue lines, with the price movement contained within a rising trend structure illustrated by a thick ascending band. A large white wedge pattern is drawn across the chart, capturing much of XRP’s historical trading range. The projection itself is presented in magenta, showing a potential move of approximately 777%, a 7.77x increase from the current region. According to the chart, this would target a price level around $28.16 , with the measure extending from the current price of approximately $3.19. The technical structure suggests that this projection is based on recurring price behavior observed in previous cycles, combined with the breakout trajectory indicated by the wedge pattern. #XRP – The Chart Doesn’t Lie!

Peirce said that even tokenized versions of securities are still considered securities and that providing transparent information to investors is vital. One of the program's main agenda items, tokenization—the conversion of real-world assets (real estate, works of art, etc.) into digital tokens—is attracting increasing interest. Member Peirce noted that the SEC is closely monitoring developments in this area, saying, “Tokenizing a security doesn't mean it ceases to be a security. Companies should provide clear disclosures to investors about the nature of these assets.” Peirce also added that the SEC is open to collaborating with companies exploring new tokenization models and will facilitate market innovation in this area. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces Listing Amid Rally - Adds to Roadmap Peirce's statements came shortly after President Trump signed an executive order allowing 401(k) accounts to invest in crypto assets. This development has fueled expectations that cryptocurrencies will become more integrated into the mainstream financial system, but it has also sparked controversy. Peirce stated that the SEC believes that private assets offered to individual investors should be professionally managed and diversified within investment portfolios. Bloomberg columnist Allison Schrager, however, took a more cautious approach, warning that cryptocurrencies are inherently high-risk assets and that including them in retirement plans like 401(k)s could introduce unnecessary risks to investors. The program also reviewed regulatory announcements and recent developments in the crypto markets. Bitcoin reached all-time highs, approaching $120,000, while Ethereum surpassed $4,400, marking its best performance since 2021. *This is not investment advice.

The Bank Policy Institute (BPI), a leading voice for the U.S. banking sector, along with several other influential banking organizations, is urgently calling on Congress to address this issue. They warn that if left unaddressed, this particular loophole within the GENIUS Act could allow stablecoin issuers to pay interest through various channels, potentially destabilizing traditional financial systems. What is This Stablecoin Loophole All About? What exactly is this loophole that has banking giants so concerned? Essentially, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) points out that the current wording of the GENIUS Act could permit stablecoin issuers to circumvent restrictions on paying interest by doing so through exchanges or affiliated companies. This isn’t just a minor technicality; it’s a structural flaw that could have massive repercussions for the economy. According to a stark warning sent to lawmakers, the BPI highlighted a staggering potential outflow of up to $6.6 trillion from traditional bank deposits. Imagine the ripple effect this could have on lending, investment, and the overall financial stability we rely on daily. This makes robust stablecoin regulation absolutely crucial. Why is the Bank Policy Institute Raising the Alarm on Stablecoin Regulation? The Bank Policy Institute represents some of the largest banks in the United States, and their primary role is to advocate for policies that ensure a stable and competitive financial system. Their concern stems from the fundamental principle that payment stablecoins, unlike traditional bank deposits or money market funds, should not offer interest. When stablecoins offer interest, they directly compete with bank deposits, which are the bedrock of bank funding for loans and other economic activities. This situation presents a clear challenge to the existing financial framework. The BPI believes that such a mechanism could undermine the stability of the financial system, making it harder for banks to support the economy. Therefore, their push for stronger US stablecoin policy is not just about protecting banks, but about maintaining broader economic health. The GENIUS Act: Intent vs. Potential Pitfalls The GENIUS Act , or the “Greater Efficacy in Non-traditional Investments for the United States” Act, aims to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Its intention is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. However, the BPI argues that the current draft inadvertently creates a significant stablecoin loophole that deviates from these core objectives. For a regulatory framework to be effective, it must be comprehensive and prevent unintended consequences. The ability for stablecoins to offer interest through indirect means could create an uneven playing field and introduce systemic risks. Therefore, a careful revision of the GENIUS Act is essential to align its practical application with its foundational goals. What Are the Broader Implications of This US Stablecoin Policy Debate? The debate surrounding this stablecoin loophole extends beyond just banks and stablecoin issuers. It touches upon the very nature of money, financial stability, and consumer protection. If large sums of money migrate from insured bank deposits to potentially less regulated, interest-bearing stablecoin products, it could expose consumers to new risks and reduce the funds available for traditional lending that fuels economic growth. The BPI’s call to action is clear: payment stablecoins should be designed for efficient, low-cost payments, not as substitutes for interest-bearing bank accounts. This distinction is vital for maintaining the integrity of both the traditional financial system and the burgeoning digital asset space. Establishing a robust US stablecoin policy that prevents such arbitrage is paramount. Ultimately, addressing this stablecoin loophole in the GENIUS Act is not just about appeasing banking groups. It’s about ensuring a secure, stable, and equitable financial future for everyone. Lawmakers face the crucial task of balancing innovation in digital assets with the imperative of protecting consumers and preserving financial stability. The outcome of this debate will significantly shape the landscape of digital finance for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the primary concern of the Bank Policy Institute regarding stablecoins? The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) is concerned about a loophole in the GENIUS Act that could allow stablecoin issuers to pay interest, potentially drawing trillions of dollars out of traditional bank deposits. What is the “stablecoin loophole” in the GENIUS Act? It’s a provision that the BPI believes could allow stablecoin issuers to indirectly pay interest on their stablecoins through exchanges or affiliated companies, circumventing current restrictions. How much money could potentially flow out of traditional banks due to this loophole? The BPI warns that up to $6.6 trillion could flow out of traditional bank deposits if this stablecoin loophole is not fixed. Why do banking groups believe payment stablecoins should not pay interest? Banking groups argue that payment stablecoins are intended for efficient transactions, not as interest-bearing investments that compete directly with regulated bank deposits and money market funds, which could destabilize the financial system. What is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act (Greater Efficacy in Non-traditional Investments for the United States) is proposed legislation aiming to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

50012434,554990,1755064823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50012434.jpeg,Do Kwon’s Guilty Plea In US Fraud Case Sets Stage For 25-Year Sentence,https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwons-guilty-plea-in-us-fraud-case/,"Do Kwon, co-founder of the defunct blockchain firm Terraform Labs, has pleaded guilty to US fraud charges after a tumultuous three years following the company’s collapse. Do Kwon, who took part in creating and developing the TerraUSD stablecoin and the Luna (now Luna Classic) token lost an estimated $40 billion in value in 2022, entered his plea during a court hearing in New York on Tuesday. Do Kwon Admits Guilt In Conspiracy And Wire Fraud Case Kwon faced serious allegations stemming from a nine-count indictment that included securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to US authorities. As reported by Bitcoinist on Monday, after initially pleading not guilty in January, he ultimately changed his stance, agreeing to plead guilty to two charges: conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud as part of a deal with the Manhattan US Attorney’s office. The charges against Kwon were primarily related to misleading investors about TerraUSD, a stablecoin intended to be pegged to the US dollar. Prosecutors allege that when TerraUSD fell below its peg in May 2021, Kwon falsely assured investors that a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” would restore the coin’s value. Authorities claim that in reality, Do Kwon had “secretly arranged for” a high-frequency trading firm to buy millions of dollars’ worth of the token to artificially inflate its price and recover its value pegged to the dollar. This behavior led both retail and institutional investors to purchase Terraform products, inflating the value of Luna—a cryptocurrency closely tied to TerraUSD—to as much as $50 billion by early 2022. Banned From Crypto As Part Of SEC Settlement During the court proceedings, Kwon expressed remorse for his actions, admitting, “I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg. What I did was wrong.” As part of his legal troubles, Kwon has agreed to pay an $80 million civil fine and will be banned from engaging in crypto transactions as part of a broader $4.55 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Do Kwon, has been in custody since his extradition from Montenegro late last year by US authorities is also facing charges in South Korea on conspiring to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud Looking ahead, the crypto entrepreneur faces a potential prison sentence of up to 25 years, although prosecutors indicated they would recommend a maximum term of 12 years, contingent on Kwon accepting responsibility for his actions. Sentencing is scheduled for December 11. Following Do Kwon’s fall, Luna Classic recorded an 8% uptick on the weekly time frame. This recovery reached the $0.00006284 level after months of continuous drops from its yearly high of $0.00012, which was reached in January.

Right now, traders are comparing Cardano’s (ADA) price forecast and Dogecoin’s (DOGE) growth with a new project making waves — Cold Wallet. While ADA and DOGE bring proven market presence, Cold Wallet’s 4,900% ROI projection puts it in a league of its own when discussing the best options today. ADA and DOGE are both riding bullish setups. Cardano is forming a breakout pattern, eyeing $2.00 this year. Dogecoin is targeting $0.30 after a solid technical push. But even these strong moves fall short compared to Cold Wallet’s projected numbers and unique reward-driven design. Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast The 2025 outlook for ADA points to about 150% upside from current levels. Trading near $0.81, Cardano recently bounced from $0.7760 support, keeping its bullish structure intact. Analysts expect $1.00 to be the first major resistance. A move above it could set up a climb toward $2.00 if momentum stays strong. ADA’s growth is supported by whale accumulation and an expanding ecosystem. It has held firm through market swings, making it appealing to those who value stability. The chart shows higher lows, hinting at continued upward movement. For those seeking consistent progress, ADA offers a solid case. Still, the returns projected for Cold Wallet make ADA’s forecast look modest in comparison. Dogecoin (DOGE) Growth Potential DOGE, trading near $0.25, is pushing toward $0.30 as buying pressure builds. Technical signs such as golden crosses and rising channels back this move. Some analysts believe $0.35 is possible soon. Its main strength is the community’s ability to spark quick rallies. DOGE often jumps sharply during hype cycles, attracting traders who enjoy volatility. While this makes Dogecoin exciting for short-term moves, it doesn’t match the scale of returns Cold Wallet could bring. In terms of long-term upside, DOGE falls behind. Cold Wallet’s 4,900% ROI Advantage Cold Wallet is now priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17 of its presale. It has sold over 703 million coins and raised more than $5.9 million. With a planned launch price of $0.3517, early buyers could see returns of up to 4,900%. This potential easily outshines the Cardano and Dogecoin forecasts. The $CWT coin powers a self-custody wallet designed to reward users for on-chain activity. Cashback rewards of up to 100% apply to gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp transactions. This gives Cold Wallet real-world use alongside its growth potential. Its supply is structured for stability: 40% for presale, 25% for rewards, 12% for liquidity, 10% for ecosystem growth, 7% for the team and advisors, and 6% for the treasury. This setup encourages sustained value while funding further adoption. Looking forward, Cold Wallet plans to use Layer 2 or custom scaling to offer zero-gas rewards and instant transactions. This makes it not just a high-ROI project but also a functional tool for active crypto users. The mix of utility and growth puts it ahead in the conversation about the year’s best opportunities. The Final Verdict Cardano is set for steady progress, with a realistic shot at $2.00 if current momentum continues. Dogecoin is once again proving its ability to rally on community energy, aiming for short-term highs near $0.35. Both hold appeal for different trading styles. However, Cold Wallet’s projected 4,900% ROI for early buyers puts it in a league of its own. With cashback rewards, an advanced self-custody wallet, strong presale traction, and plans for zero-gas transactions, it combines utility with growth. In 2025, it could easily outpace ADA and DOGE.

With prices hovering near all-time highs and forecasts eyeing $150K, the market is heating up fast. While Bitcoin leads the charge, the real breakout potential lies in projects riding its momentum—like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a bold, community-driven crypto poised to capitalize on America’s surging blockchain adoption. Bitcoin’s Current Momentum Accelerates As of August 12, 2025, Bitcoin is trading between $118,000 and $119,000, showing a slight 2% dip after hitting $122,000 earlier in the week—its closest approach yet to the all-time high of $123,218 set in July. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin remains up 101% year-over-year with a $2.36 trillion market cap. Technical traders are laser-focused on the $122,000 resistance level. A breakout above it could push Bitcoin toward $130,000 and beyond, while support holds near $114,295. Citigroup analysts remain bullish, projecting a possible $199,000 Bitcoin by year-end in a strong market scenario. Institutional Adoption Is Exploding The big players aren’t sitting on the sidelines: Metaplanet just bought 518 BTC for $61.4 million, bringing its total to 18,113 BTC worth $1.85 billion. Harvard University’s endowment disclosed a $116 million Bitcoin ETF position—its fifth-largest holding. Corporate Bitcoin holdings now total $113 billion, and BlackRock’s IBIT ETF has ballooned to $86 billion in assets since launching in January 2024. This level of accumulation signals one thing: the smart money expects higher prices. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Wave While Bitcoin dominates headlines, savvy investors know the biggest gains often come from innovative projects in Bitcoin’s slipstream. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a politically-charged, community-driven financial ecosystem designed to capitalize on the current U.S. administration’s pro-crypto stance. With President Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, 401(k) crypto access, and the GENIUS Act setting the stage for unprecedented adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the token of choice for a new wave of American crypto investors. Some ROI analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver extraordinary gains, projecting it might grow up to 68x its launch value within the first year. That means an early investment could turn even a small amount into a life-changing profit if the project hits its growth targets and market demand surges. Bottom Line History shows that altcoins tend to explode in value after Bitcoin sets new highs. With institutional buyers like Metaplanet and Harvard driving Bitcoin toward the projected $150K–$199K range, the tide that lifts all boats is rising fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just riding that tide—it’s building the dock. By targeting both crypto-savvy traders and the massive, newly opened 401(k) market, it’s set to benefit from the largest capital inflow the space has ever seen. Given the political backing, market timing, and community momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the standout plays of the 2025 bull market.

ONDO is flashing a bullish chart pattern that could mirror a previous 300% rally. Avalanche (AVAX) is testing a make-or-break resistance level that could unlock new highs, and BlockDAG is pushing forward with major presale momentum, technology rollouts, and community adoption. ONDO: Could History Repeat with Another Big Rally? ONDO’s current price action has drawn comparisons to a setup that triggered a major rally in the past. The token appears to be breaking out from a bullish flag formation, similar to one that led to a 300% gain before. If this pattern holds, analysts believe a push toward $2 is possible with an outside chance of reaching $3 if buying strength accelerates. The coin is currently trading near $0.85, holding steady in a consolidation range. This kind of price stability can often precede a strong upward move, especially when it’s paired with gradual accumulation during periods of lighter trading activity. If liquidity returns and momentum builds, ONDO could replicate its earlier rally. Still, traders should keep in mind that pattern-based plays depend heavily on confirmation from market action, making timing and disciplined exits key to managing risk. AVAX: A Resistance Test That Could Open the Door to $36 Avalanche’s chart is pressing against a well-established resistance level at $27. This zone has turned back previous rally attempts, so a decisive close above it, especially on strong volume, could set the stage for a run toward $36, with $38 also in sight if buyers keep control. The recent technical backdrop has been encouraging. AVAX bounced off its 200-day moving average and cleared a long-standing downtrend line, both of which strengthen the bullish view. On the fundamentals side, the Avalanche network is seeing steady growth through subnet deployments and enterprise partnerships, which add depth to its use cases. For traders and long-term holders alike, the short-term focus is on breaking and sustaining levels above $27. A successful push past that ceiling could mark the start of a more sustained climb, while failure to do so might lead to another pullback and retest of support. BlockDAG: $371M Raised, 25 Billion Coins Sold, and a Growing User Base BlockDAG is taking a different route to market attention, not just price patterns, but infrastructure, adoption, and active user participation. The project’s presale has now crossed $371 million, with over 25 billion BDAG coins sold in Batch 29 at $0.0276 each. This funding gives BlockDAG the resources to keep building without relying on outside capital. One of the biggest drivers of engagement is its Dashboard V4, which turns presale participation into a live, interactive experience. Users can check real-time price charts, order book data, wallet balances, referral rewards, and even leaderboard rankings. Rather than being a one-off purchase, this setup keeps buyers involved until launch. The project also rolled out a live demo of its mining system in July 2025, showing that its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware units are already operational. The X10 can mine up to 200 BDAG daily, while the X1 app makes mining accessible from a smartphone. Partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas are helping connect with sports fans via NFTs, fan coins, and exclusive digital content. From a technical standpoint, BlockDAG blends blockchain and DAG technology, processing between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions per second. Its dual Proof-of-Engagement and Proof-of-Work system supports scalability and security. With over 2.5 million X1 app downloads and 20 confirmed exchange listings, the project is preparing for a strong entry into active trading backed by liquidity and community support. Final Take ONDO offers a speculative setup for traders who thrive on chart patterns and momentum bursts. AVAX presents a structured technical opportunity with a clear breakout target. BlockDAG, meanwhile, is pairing heavy presale demand with working tech, expanding partnerships, and a large active user base, all supported by $371 million in secured funding. For those looking beyond short-term chart moves, BlockDAG’s combination of funding, adoption, and working infrastructure could make it the most balanced choice in this lineup.

50012430,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=803397,1755064853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50012430.jpeg,"Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash Below $3, But There’s Good News",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-crash-below-3/,"After the announcement of the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC legal battle that began in 2020, the XRP price had surged by more than 12% in response. This brought the altcoin back above the $3 level to put the bulls back in charge of the price once again. However, there has been a slowdown in the price in the face of profit-taking, and a crypto analyst has suggested that the price could continue to decline toward the next major support level. Descending Trendline Break Not Enough To Hold Price Following the surge that was triggered by the Ripple-SEC announcement, the XRP price was able to break a descending trendline that had formed after its July peak. This break had seen the price push toward $3.4 before being beaten back down again, crypto analyst HAMED_AZ highlighted in a new analysis. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts ‘Near Term’ Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices, There’s Still Room To Run This was triggered by the resistance encountered just before $3.4 and has now sent the altcoin back into a corrective phase. So far, the bulls have been fighting off this correction as the $3.2 level has continued to serve as support. However, the analyst predicts that the correction is far from done. HAMED explains that it is likely that the XRP price will end up breaking back down to retest the previously broken trendline at around $2.9. This would mean another crash below $3 could be in the works, erasing all of the support that had been built up at this level. The Continuation Of The XRP Price Rally While a break toward the previously broken trendline is expected, the analyst’s chart suggests that the digital asset could find support just above $2.9. This level would mark the completion of the pullback and would serve as the lift-off point for a bullish continuation that could push the price higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Hit A Small Roadblock To ATH As CME Gap Threatens Crash This move would also put the XRP price on the path of an ascending trendline from the month of June, which would coincide with the $2.93 bottom. Once this is completed, HAMED expects the XRP price to pull upward toward brand-new all-time highs. From here, an over 35% increase is expected, which would put XRP over $4. If this happens, then it would clear the current peak of $3.84, which was recorded 8 years ago in 2018.

In a detailed post, All Things XRP argued that RLUSD could enhance XRP’s position rather than replace it. According to the post, XRP occupies a unique and irreplaceable role as the native asset of the XRPL. This status grants it specific privileges no other token, including RLUSD, can match. XRP is the only asset on the ledger that can be used to pay transaction fees, is held by every account without requiring trust lines, and operates without counterparty risk, freezes, or clawbacks. RLUSD , by contrast, is an issued asset with reliance on its issuer, Ripple, and cannot fulfill these same roles. EVERYONE’S ASKING: WILL RLUSD KILL XRP? The truth: RLUSD could supercharge XRP’s role on the XRPL. Here’s why XRP holders should be excited. pic.twitter.com/XokAphRkrZ — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) August 10, 2025 Transaction Fees and Constant Demand for XRP One of the key points highlighted is that every transaction on the XRPL burns a small amount of XRP , regardless of whether the transaction involves RLUSD or another token. This means that higher RLUSD adoption would still lead to more XRP being consumed through fees. Even if users are trading or making payments in RLUSD, XRP remains essential for completing these transactions, maintaining a baseline demand for the asset. Autobridging and Increased Liquidity Routes The XRPL’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) prioritizes XRP liquidity through a process called autobridging, which automatically routes trades through XRP to improve efficiency. All Things XRP explained that an increase in RLUSD trading pairs would naturally lead to more XRP being used in bridging operations, further supporting demand for XRP. While RLUSD could serve as a stable settlement tool in cases where volatility is a concern, XRP is positioned as the optimal choice due to its speed and global liquidity. In this view, the two assets complement each other. RLUSD could handle the stability aspect, while XRP remains central to transaction processing and cross-border movement of value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Addressing the Replacement Myth The post referenced Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who has stated that RLUSD will not replace XRP’s core functions. If any stablecoin had the potential to replace XRP, it would have to outperform XRP’s inherent advantages, which the post suggests is highly unlikely. This is due to XRP’s protocol-level integration and independence from any single issuer, making it universally accepted on the XRPL with no counterparty. Ripple’s Role and Network Decentralization All Things XRP also addressed concerns about Ripple’s influence over the XRPL , noting that Ripple operates only around one percent of validators. This means the company does not have unilateral control over the network and cannot phase out XRP, which is embedded in the ledger’s underlying code and function. The conclusion drawn is that RLUSD should be seen as an additional driver of XRPL activity rather than a threat to XRP. Increased RLUSD use would likely result in more trades, more tokenized assets, and more transactions overall, all of which require XRP for fees and often for liquidity bridging.

For the first time, an individual has made a substantial Bitcoin donation to a major charitable organization, setting a powerful precedent for future digital asset contributions in the nation. Pioneering Digital Asset Donation in South Korea South Korea has witnessed a historic moment with its first major individual cryptocurrency gift. On August 13, the Korean Red Cross announced it received 1 Bitcoin (BTC) from investor Kim Geo-seok. This generous digital asset donation was valued at approximately $119,000 at the time, as reported by local outlet Hankook Ilbo.

Under the government’s updated guidelines, the donated Bitcoin will not be held as a digital asset for long. Instead, it will be sold immediately. All proceeds from the sale of this BTC are earmarked for critical humanitarian efforts. Specifically, the funds will support flood recovery initiatives across the nation and provide essential medical aid to vulnerable communities. This swift conversion and direct application of funds underscore the practical utility of such donations. The Impact of Crypto Charity: A New Era? This landmark Bitcoin donation signals a potential new era for charitable giving. Cryptocurrencies offer unique advantages for philanthropy, including: Global Reach: Digital assets can be transferred across borders quickly and efficiently. Transparency: Blockchain technology can provide a transparent ledger of transactions, enhancing trust. Lower Fees: In some cases, crypto transactions can incur lower fees compared to traditional banking methods. The acceptance of this donation by the Korean Red Cross demonstrates a growing recognition of digital assets within established charitable sectors. It encourages other individuals and organizations to consider cryptocurrency as a viable means of supporting noble causes worldwide. Paving the Way for Future Digital Asset Donations While this is a positive step, the landscape for digital asset donation still evolves. Regulatory clarity, market volatility, and public understanding remain key factors. However, this pioneering move by investor Kim Geo-seok and the proactive stance of the Korean Red Cross are setting a strong example. This event could inspire more philanthropists in South Korea and beyond to leverage their crypto holdings for social good. It highlights the potential for blockchain technology to not only disrupt finance but also to revolutionize charitable giving, making it more accessible and efficient. In conclusion, the first individual Bitcoin donation to the Korean Red Cross is more than just a financial transaction; it is a symbolic moment. It signifies the maturation of the South Korea crypto ecosystem and opens doors for digital assets to play a crucial role in humanitarian aid and community support. This act of generosity truly paves the way for a future where crypto charity is a mainstream force for positive change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Key Takeaways: TUS banking groups want Congress to close a GENIUS Act loophole allowing stablecoin yield via affiliates. They warn yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger $6.6T in bank deposit outflows. Such outflows could raise interest rates, cut loan availability, and increase borrowing costs. In a letter sent Tuesday , the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) said the law’s current wording leaves room for stablecoin issuers to offer yield indirectly through affiliated exchanges or other partners. The BPI was joined by the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and the Financial Services Forum. GENIUS Act Bans Stablecoin Yield Payouts by Issuers, Leaves Affiliate Loophole The GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 18, bans issuers from directly paying interest or yield but does not explicitly prohibit related entities from doing so. The groups argue that such an arrangement could disrupt the U.S. financial system, citing a US Treasury estimate that yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger as much as $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from traditional banks. Banks rely on deposits to fund loans, and a large-scale shift into stablecoins could, they warn, drive up borrowing costs for businesses and households. “Payment stablecoins should not pay interest the way highly regulated and supervised banks do on deposits or offer yield as money market funds do,” the letter stated, emphasizing that stablecoins do not engage in lending or securities investment to generate returns. Yield remains a key draw for stablecoin adoption. Some issuers, such as Tether (USDT), have historically avoided offering interest directly, while others benefit from exchange-based rewards. So-called stablecoins are effectively zero-yield money market funds, created primarily for regulatory arbitrage. Why else own one when T-bills yield 4%+? Are ounterparty, regulatory, and depegging risks underestimated in today’s environment? #GENIUSACT $USDT $USDC $CRCL pic.twitter.com/rE7VTJij2k — Parker Evans, CFA, CFP (@HParkerEvans) August 7, 2025 For example, users holding Circle’s USDC on Coinbase or Kraken can earn returns, creating a competitive alternative to traditional savings accounts. The banking groups warn that the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins could heighten “deposit flight risk,” particularly during economic stress, leading to tighter credit conditions. “The corresponding reduction in credit supply means higher interest rates, fewer loans, and increased costs for Main Street businesses and households,” they wrote. Tether and USDC Control Over 80% of $280B Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market is currently valued at $280.2 billion, with Tether and USDC commanding more than 80% of the sector at $165 billion and $66.4 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko. While that figure is still small compared to the $22 trillion U.S. money supply, the Treasury projects the market could grow to $2 trillion by 2028. As reported, two of America’s largest crypto-linked companies, Coinbase and PayPal, are pushing forward with stablecoin yield programs , despite new US legislation explicitly banning such incentives for stablecoin issuers. In recent earnings calls, executives at both Coinbase and PayPal confirmed they will continue rewarding users who hold stablecoins on their platforms, arguing the law does not apply to them. “We are not the issuer,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said , responding to a shareholder question. “We don’t pay interest or yield, we pay rewards.” The post US Banking Groups Push to Close Stablecoin Yield ‘Loophole’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|GENIUS Act|Stablecoin|stablecoin regulation,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-13 06:13:05

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz as Bitcoin (BTC) experiences an urgent price drop, falling significantly below the $119,000 mark. This sudden shift has captured the attention of investors and analysts across the entire cryptocurrency market. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading around $118,964.36 on the Binance USDT market. This movement highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets and prompts a closer look at what drives such fluctuations. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop The recent Bitcoin price drop below a key psychological level of $119,000 is a notable event for the digital asset space. While such downturns can feel unsettling, they are a regular feature of the volatile crypto landscape. Bitcoin, as the leading cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the broader market. When BTC experiences a significant dip, other altcoins frequently follow suit, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the ecosystem. Market observers are closely watching the hourly charts and trading volumes to gauge the strength of this downward momentum. A break below such a significant support level can trigger further sell-offs, as traders adjust their positions based on technical indicators and market sentiment. What’s Driving This BTC Market Analysis? Several factors typically influence a BTC market analysis and can contribute to a sudden price decline. Understanding these elements helps investors make informed decisions. These can include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions can push investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create fear and lead to sell-offs. Investors often react quickly to potential government interventions. Whale Movements: Large holders, often called ""whales,"" can significantly impact prices with massive buy or sell orders. A coordinated sell-off by a few whales can trigger a domino effect. Technical Breakdowns: When Bitcoin breaks below crucial support levels on price charts, it can signal to algorithmic trading systems and technical analysts that further declines are likely, prompting more selling pressure. These elements, individually or in combination, can exert considerable pressure on the Bitcoin value, leading to rapid price adjustments. Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Market Trends How should investors navigate the current cryptocurrency market trends when Bitcoin faces a significant correction? Volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. For many, a price dip can be a chance to ""buy the dip,"" acquiring assets at a lower cost. However, it also carries risks, especially if the downturn continues. It is crucial to differentiate between short-term fluctuations and long-term potential. While the immediate Bitcoin price drop might seem alarming, Bitcoin has a history of recovering from even more substantial corrections. Maintaining a diversified portfolio and avoiding impulsive decisions are key strategies during such periods. Smart Crypto Trading Strategies Amid Volatility During periods of high volatility, adopting smart crypto trading strategies becomes paramount. Panic selling often leads to losses, while a disciplined approach can help mitigate risks and even capitalize on market movements. Consider these actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, commit to investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This strategy averages out your purchase price over time. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price continues to fall beyond your comfort level. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, but avoid reacting to every minor fluctuation. Focus on fundamental developments and broader economic shifts. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Use market dips as an opportunity to re-evaluate your asset allocation. You might consider adjusting your holdings to maintain your desired risk profile. These strategies help build resilience in your investment approach, especially when the Bitcoin value is experiencing pressure. The Enduring Bitcoin Value Proposition Despite the recent Bitcoin price drop , many long-term investors remain confident in the enduring Bitcoin value proposition. Bitcoin’s foundational principles—decentralization, scarcity, and a fixed supply—continue to underpin its appeal. It remains a store of value for many, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Moreover, institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, with more companies and financial institutions exploring its integration into their portfolios and services. This increasing mainstream acceptance suggests a maturing market, even with its characteristic volatility. History shows that Bitcoin has always rebounded, often reaching new all-time highs after significant corrections, demonstrating its resilience in the face of market challenges. In conclusion, the urgent Bitcoin price drop below $119,000 serves as a stark reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While short-term fluctuations can be unsettling, a thorough BTC market analysis reveals underlying factors and offers opportunities for those prepared with solid crypto trading strategies . By staying informed, managing risk, and understanding the long-term Bitcoin value , investors can navigate these cryptocurrency market trends with greater confidence. The journey of digital assets is rarely a straight line, but for many, the potential rewards outweigh the inherent volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why did Bitcoin fall below $119,000? Bitcoin’s price drop can be attributed to a combination of factors including macroeconomic headwinds like inflation and interest rate concerns, regulatory uncertainty, large sell-offs by ""whales,"" and technical breakdowns on price charts. 2. Is this a good time to buy BTC? Whether it’s a good time to buy BTC depends on individual risk tolerance and investment strategy. While price dips can offer opportunities to acquire Bitcoin at a lower cost, further declines are possible. Many long-term investors use strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging during such periods. 3. How does a Bitcoin price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and its price movements often influence the broader cryptocurrency market. A significant Bitcoin price drop typically leads to other altcoins also experiencing declines, reflecting the interconnected nature of the crypto ecosystem. 4. What are the best strategies during market downturns? Effective strategies during market downturns include Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), setting stop-loss orders to manage risk, staying informed with reliable news, and avoiding emotional or impulsive trading decisions. Diversifying your portfolio also helps. 5. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin? Despite short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains positive for many investors.

Recently, a major headline emerged, drawing attention to the substantial challenges faced by a prominent crypto investment firm . Abraxas Capital, a well-known name in the digital asset space, is currently grappling with considerable crypto short losses . Reports indicate the firm is facing an estimated $244.78 million in unrealized losses from various short positions. This situation highlights the inherent risks involved when betting against market trends in the fast-paced cryptocurrency environment. What Led to Abraxas Capital’s Significant Unrealized Losses? According to data shared by Onchain Lens on X, Abraxas Capital’s portfolio includes short positions across several major cryptocurrencies. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Sui (SUI). The bulk of these unrealized crypto losses , over $188.7 million, reportedly stems from their Ethereum (ETH) short positions. Shorting involves borrowing an asset and selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price later to profit from the difference. However, if the asset’s price rises instead, the short seller faces losses. This is precisely what appears to have happened, leading to these substantial figures for Abraxas Capital . Understanding the Impact of Bitcoin Ethereum Shorts The significant portion of losses coming from Ethereum shorts is particularly notable. Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often influences broader market sentiment. When a crypto investment firm takes large short positions on such a foundational asset and the market moves unfavorably, the financial repercussions can be immense. This scenario involving significant Bitcoin Ethereum shorts illustrates the high stakes. While Bitcoin (BTC) also contributed to the losses, the sheer scale of the ETH-related impact underscores the challenge. This scenario serves as a powerful reminder that even sophisticated firms can encounter unexpected market movements. Therefore, careful risk management remains paramount in the volatile digital asset landscape. What Do These Crypto Short Losses Mean for the Market? Abraxas Capital’s situation offers a glimpse into the broader dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It demonstrates that even when firms anticipate a downturn, market resilience or unexpected rallies can quickly turn speculative positions into significant liabilities. Consequently, other firms might re-evaluate their own short-selling strategies. This incident could also prompt discussions around transparency and risk exposure within the digital asset investment space. As the market matures, understanding the vulnerabilities faced by large players becomes crucial for overall market stability. Ultimately, this event highlights the unpredictable nature of crypto, even for seasoned participants dealing with potential unrealized crypto losses . Key Takeaways from Abraxas Capital’s Short Positions Significant Exposure: Abraxas Capital held substantial short positions across major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s Role: The majority of the $244.78 million in losses stemmed from ETH short positions. Market Volatility: The incident underscores the inherent unpredictability of crypto markets, even for experienced firms. Risk Management: It serves as a crucial reminder for all investors about the importance of robust risk management strategies when engaging in leveraged or speculative trades. The substantial crypto short losses reported by Abraxas Capital, a notable crypto investment firm , serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in cryptocurrency investing, particularly when engaging in complex strategies like shorting. This incident, largely driven by unfavorable movements in Ethereum and Bitcoin, underscores the volatility and rapid shifts that characterize the digital asset market. It emphasizes the critical importance of robust risk management and the unpredictable nature of even the most established cryptocurrencies. The challenges faced by Abraxas Capital with their Bitcoin Ethereum shorts provide valuable lessons for the wider crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

A short position in cryptocurrency involves borrowing a digital asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) and immediately selling it, with the expectation that its price will fall. The goal is to buy the asset back later at a lower price, return it to the lender, and profit from the price difference. 2. Which cryptocurrencies contributed most to Abraxas Capital’s losses? According to reports, the majority of Abraxas Capital’s unrealized losses, over $188.7 million, stemmed specifically from their short positions in Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Sui (SUI) also contributed to the total. 3. What does “unrealized loss” mean? An unrealized loss is a loss that exists on paper but has not yet been finalized through a sale. In the context of shorting, it means the price of the asset has risen since the short position was opened, making the current value of the borrowed assets higher than the price they were sold for, but the position has not yet been closed. 4. How does this incident affect the broader crypto market? While one firm’s losses may not directly crash the entire market, incidents like this highlight the inherent volatility and risks of certain trading strategies. They can lead other investment firms to re-evaluate their risk management practices and potentially influence overall market sentiment regarding short-selling or leveraged positions in crypto.

50014718,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=803812,1755068440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50014718.jpeg,"Ethereum Flashes Once-In-A Decade Bull Signal, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-once-in-a-decade-bull-signal/,"Ethereum’s chart is lighting up with what crypto analyst Kevin of Kev Capital calls a “once-in-a-decade” confluence of bullish signals — patterns and indicators that he says have not appeared together in the asset’s history. In a video update on August 12, Kevin revisited his May forecast for “ETH season” and detailed why the rally is unfolding almost exactly as projected, while warning that the final technical barrier is still intact. Ethereum Faces On Last Hurdle Two months ago, when sentiment toward Ethereum was at its most pessimistic in years, Kevin issued an alert based on the ETH/USD, ETH dominance, and ETH/BTC monthly charts. “We were probably the first people flashing these warning signals on ETH… it was so blatant and so obvious… something historical,” he said. Since that call, ETH has gained more than 150%, with related “beta plays” such as Chainlink, Uniswap, and Ethereum Classic seeing triple-digit percentage gains from their lows. The catalyst, Kevin explained, began with a rare monthly demand candle at major support — a formation that in past cycles preceded massive rallies. That was backed by multiple momentum indicators turning from extreme oversold levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Surge To $8,500? The Mechanics Of The Current Bull Run The monthly Stock RSI showed what he described as an unprecedented “V-shaped turnaround,” the MACD histogram had been coiling tighter since late 2019, and whale money flow was reversing from the lowest readings in Ethereum’s history. “You’re now just seeing the monthly MACD cross at the apex of this pattern… right at the zero line,” he noted, framing it as the technical ignition point for a sustained breakout. On ETH dominance, Kevin pointed to the same multi-indicator alignment: oversold RSI and Stock RSI, an imminent MACD cross, and price hitting the same support that underpinned the 2019–2020 cycle. In his view, that bottom signaled the start of a durable phase of ETH outperformance, one that would lead altcoins higher. The ETH/BTC chart, he argued, confirmed the timing: “The lead altcoin showed the way… the bottom is obviously in.” Still, Kevin stressed that Ethereum is not yet in open price discovery. The key resistance remains its previous all-time high at roughly $4,850. “We’re not in the clear… don’t be buying into four-year major historical resistance levels. That’s never smart. That will get you hurt,” he warned, noting that on the broader “Total 2” market cap chart for all altcoins excluding Bitcoin, the $1.71–$1.72 trillion zone is the last major “line in the sand.” Until those levels are broken on high time frames, he sees the market in a high-risk, high-reward posture. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $4,600 With Unprecedented $1 Billion In Spot ETF Inflow Macro conditions may tip the scales. With CME FedWatch now pricing in a 90%+ probability of a US interest rate cut in September, and additional cuts projected for October and December, Kevin believes the mix of easing monetary policy and technical breakout structures creates a “perfect recipe” for altcoin outperformance. Even so, he cautioned that macro shocks could derail momentum and that traders should position with pullbacks in mind rather than chasing into resistance. For now, Kevin is content to acknowledge a rare technical alignment that he believes has already made history. “The ETH dominance call, the ETH versus Bitcoin call that we made a few months ago has played out beautifully… I think there will be pullbacks, but overall, we are on the back half of this bull market,” he said. Whether that back half erupts into price discovery hinges on one number: $4,850. Until then, Ethereum’s once-in-a-decade bull signal remains charged — but not yet fully unleashed. At press time, ETH traded at $4,624.

Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Timeline,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-to-explode-160/,"The Shiba Inu price has seen a rollercoaster few months characterized by crashes after seeing a moderate rally. This time around, the meme coin’s price has begun to move upward once again, and this could sustain if the market continues to rise alongside Bitcoin. Keeping up with this trend, the machine learning algorithm at the CoinCodex website has predicted that the Shiba Inu price will continue to rally. What’s more, the price could be hitting a new yearly peak soon. Shiba Inu Rally To Push Price By 160% The predictions on the website have shown a rather bullish roadmap for the Shiba Inu price going forward. This ranges from the very short term to mid-ter,m with each one expected to see an increase in price from here. The first of these is the 5-day prediction that already suggests that the Shiba Inu price is on the right path . The machine learning algorithm puts the Shiba Inu price at $0.00001441 in 5 days, which is a 6.6% increase from the current price. Next on the list is the one-month prediction that would enter into the month of September from here. The machine learning algorithm suggests that the price would only be slightly up, with a 6.15% increase to $0.00001434. However, looking at the longer timeframe, moving into the month of September, the Shiba Inu price is expected to more than double from here. Most of this move is forecasted to happen in the month of September, triggering a rally to $0.00003549. Reaching this level would mean a 160% increase in price, with the algorithm predicting that this would happen toward the end of the month of September, with a September 22 date set as the peak. From here, though, the price is expected to reverse and decline after peaking at $0.00003549, and then dropping back to $0.00001955 by October 2025. SHIB’s September Movements Could Align Shiba Inu has seen varying performances in the month of September since its creation. So far, there have been a total of two months over the years closing in the green and two months closing in the red. This has brought its average return to +4.15%, according to the CryptoRank website . Given this, where the Shiba Inu price could be headed in the next month could very much be dependent on the general market sentiment. If the current bullish trend continues, then it could bleed into September, and if the machine learning algorithm is correct, then it would see the third quarter of the year completed in the green for SHIB.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB prediction|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu prediction|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-13 07:00:55

This decline occurs as SHIB tests resistance at its 200-day Simple Moving Average. Furthermore, key chart patterns suggest substantial upside potential. Confirmed MACD divergence and a recent breakout from a falling wedge pattern signal possible price gains exceeding 150%. Meanwhile, another altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is mirroring early SHIB enthusiasm during its surging presale. Shiba Inu navigates crucial resistance Shiba Inu’s current price movement is critical. Overcoming the 200-day SMA resistance is vital for sustaining its nascent bullish momentum. Analysts highlight the confirmed MACD divergence as a powerful technical indicator. This divergence previously hinted at an 180% upside potential. Javon Marks notes this pattern remains active, suggesting SHIB could still surge over 156%. Adding to the optimism, pseudonymous analyst Army Shiba reported SHIB breaking free from a falling wedge. This classic reversal pattern strengthens the case for upward movement. Consequently, market watchers are monitoring whether SHIB can maintain its position above key levels. Success here could validate the bullish crypto charts and propel prices towards predicted targets. Whale movements underscore this pivotal moment, reflecting heightened interest among large holders. Mutuum Finance presale draws massive investor interest Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating remarkable presale traction, reminiscent of early altcoin success stories.

The surge coincides with heightened institutional activity, propelling Ether to $4,670 on Wednesday and bringing it within 5% of its Nov. 2021 record high. Google’s data shows sharp growth in search traffic over recent weeks, culminating in a steep rise that eclipses all peaks from the past three years. North Macedonia, Switzerland, Singapore, Slovenia and Austria led search interest, indicating a diverse spread of global curiosity. Source: Google Trends Institutional Demand Pushes ETH Higher as Treasuries Grow to $16.4B This rise in attention coincides with an 8% jump in Ether’s price in a single day, propelled by mounting demand from institutional investors and corporate treasuries . Figures from strategicethreserve.xyz show Ethereum-focused treasuries now hold $16.4b worth of ETH. At the same time, Ethereum’s network activity has reached an all-time record, with daily transactions hitting about 1.875m, according to CryptoQuant . Ethereum Approaching Price ATH While Transaction Count Hits Record High “Ethereum’s network activity has surged to unprecedented levels, with daily transactions reaching an all-time high of approximately 1.875 million.” – By @CryptoOnchain pic.twitter.com/IdZkVHAdTZ — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 13, 2025 Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, said more companies are integrating Ethereum into their treasuries as a strategic financial tool, not just a speculative bet. By staking ETH, firms can earn passive returns while supporting the network’s security, he said. However, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has cautioned that overleveraging these holdings could destabilize the ecosystem if forced liquidations occur. BlackRock, Fidelity Lead Record-Breaking ETH ETF Inflows Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, noted that spot Ethereum ETF inflows exceeded $1b on August 11, led by BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH. He attributed the inflows to Ethereum’s growing role in DeFi and Web3, and to improved macro sentiment following softer US inflation data. Lee also pointed to the potential long-term impact of President Trump’s executive order allowing cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. Such policy changes, combined with ETF momentum and corporate accumulation, could expand crypto’s role in mainstream investment portfolios, he said. Piyush Walke, derivatives research analyst at Delta Exchange, noted Ethereum has significantly outperformed Bitcoin in recent weeks, gaining 25% in August versus Bitcoin’s 3% rise. Walke credited the rally to strong institutional inflows, technical breakouts and optimism surrounding Ether ETFs. Monday marked the highest ever daily net inflows for spot Ether ETFs at $1.01b, coinciding with a 90% price gain over the last 40 days, he noted. “Often seen as a bellwether for altcoins, Ethereum’s momentum could be an early signal of broader capital rotation into the wider altcoin market,” he added. BitMine and SharpLink Drive Bullish Momentum With Major ETH Purchases Institutions such as BitMine and SharpLink have sharply increased their ETH holdings, in some cases by several hundred percent. These purchases have reinforced bullish technical signals and driven prices through key resistance points. Analysts say its current momentum could foreshadow capital rotation into other digital assets. With search interest climbing and institutional engagement deepening, Ethereum’s approach to its all-time high is being watched closely by both retail traders and large investors. Many will be looking to see if the current wave of demand can sustain the rally and potentially push the cryptocurrency to new records.

Crypto exchange OKX recently announced a monumental OKB token burn , a strategic move that has immediately captured the market’s attention. This isn’t just a routine event; it’s a bold declaration about the future of the OKB token and its underlying OKX tokenomics . Investors and enthusiasts are watching closely to understand the full implications of this development. Understanding the OKB Token Burn Strategy OKX officially communicated its plan to conduct a one-time burn of a staggering 65.25 million OKB tokens. This massive incineration event will permanently alter the token’s availability. After this burn, the total supply of OKB will be fixed at precisely 21 million tokens. What does this mean? It signifies a dramatic reduction in the overall OKB circulating supply . Why is this important? Reducing supply can create scarcity, which often influences market dynamics. This action is a clear signal of OKX’s commitment to enhancing the value proposition of its native token. The Immediate Impact: OKB Price Surge The market’s reaction to the announcement was swift and emphatic. Data from CoinMarketCap quickly reflected a significant positive shift. OKB was observed trading at $86.58, marking an impressive 87.74% increase within a single day. This immediate OKB price surge highlights the market’s positive reception to OKX’s strategy. Such price movements are not uncommon following major token burn announcements. They reflect investor confidence in the long-term potential of a token when its supply is intentionally limited. It suggests that market participants believe this cryptocurrency supply reduction will lead to increased demand relative to available tokens. How Does OKX Tokenomics Benefit from This? Tokenomics refers to the economic model governing a cryptocurrency. The OKB token burn is a powerful tool within OKX’s tokenomics framework. By permanently reducing the total supply to 21 million, OKX aims to create a more deflationary asset. Key benefits for OKX’s tokenomics include: Enhanced Scarcity: A fixed, lower supply can make each remaining OKB token potentially more valuable over time. Increased Demand: As the token becomes scarcer, demand might increase, especially if the platform continues to grow and offer utility for OKB. Long-Term Value Proposition: This move signals a commitment to sustainable growth and value appreciation for OKB holders. It aligns OKB with a strategy often seen in successful cryptocurrencies aiming for long-term stability and growth. Why Cryptocurrency Supply Reduction Matters Token burns, a form of cryptocurrency supply reduction , are a common practice in the blockchain space. Projects undertake them for various reasons, primarily to manage token economics and potentially boost value. When a significant portion of tokens is removed from circulation, it directly impacts the supply-demand equation. Consider the broader implications: Deflationary Pressure: Burns can introduce deflationary pressure, counteracting inflationary tendencies. Investor Confidence: Such actions can signal a project’s health and commitment to its token’s value. Ecosystem Health: A well-managed supply can contribute to a healthier and more robust ecosystem around the token. The reduction in OKB circulating supply is a testament to OKX’s proactive approach to its token’s future. Looking Ahead: The Future of OKB The recent OKB token burn is a pivotal moment for OKX and its native asset. By drastically cutting the supply and fixing it at 21 million, OKX has positioned OKB for a new phase of development. The immediate OKB price surge demonstrates market confidence, but the long-term success will depend on continued utility, platform growth, and sustained demand for the now scarcer token. This strategic decision by OKX underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets and the innovative ways exchanges are managing their digital assets to create lasting value for their communities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the OKB token burn? The OKB token burn is a one-time event where OKX will permanently remove 65.25 million OKB tokens from circulation, fixing the total supply at 21 million. Why did OKX decide to burn OKB tokens? OKX decided to burn OKB tokens to reduce the total supply, create scarcity, and enhance the long-term value proposition of the token within its OKX tokenomics strategy. How does the token burn affect the OKB price? Reducing the OKB circulating supply typically creates scarcity, which can lead to increased demand and, consequently, a positive impact on the OKB price, as seen with the recent OKB price surge . What is the new total supply of OKB after the burn? After the 65.25 million OKB token burn, the total supply of OKB will be fixed at 21 million tokens. Is a cryptocurrency supply reduction common in the market? Yes, cryptocurrency supply reduction through token burns is a relatively common practice among projects aiming to manage their token’s economics, control inflation, and potentially increase value.

Seattle Federal Court Judge Robert Lasnik sentenced them to 16 months in prison, but they had already spent that time in custody following their 2022 indictment. However, Judge Lasnik ordered the defendants to pay a $25K fine each and complete 360 hours of community service under supervised release. The sentence also included the forfeiture of over $450M worth of real estate, cars, crypto, and crypto mining gear seized by the U.S. government and its foreign crime-busting partners. Details about the victim compensation remission process will be shared later, but the two will serve their supervised release back in Estonia. Potapenko and Turõgin had previously asked for time served, which was granted, but prosecutors feel a 10-year sentence would do better justice. The Department of Justice said on August 12 that it was also considering filing an appeal. Seattle prosecutors led by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew Friedman and Sok Jiang said this was the largest crypto fraud they had ever tried. They used this argument in court to push for the 10-year jail term they sought. Miller says victims were hurt financially and emotionally Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Miller said “the vast majority” of victims in this case suffered losses that impacted them both financially and emotionally. The Ponzi scheme hurt unsuspecting customers who bought “a mirage of cryptocurrency mining” involving a non-existent “glitzy asset.” Miller felt it was wrong that the two used these millions of dollars to buy their own crypto, hire private jets, buy expensive jewelry, luxury cars, and real estate while their victims suffered. However, Judge Lasnik seemed to agree with Potapenko and Turõgin’s argument that the 440K customers did not suffer significant losses. The two also noted that about 390K of the customers who had bought nearly $487 million worth of HashFlare mining contracts had withdrawn roughly $2.3 billion. Turõgin’s attorney, Andery Spektor, claimed that no customer had suffered any harm, but acknowledged that HashFlare may have lied about the amount of crypto it mined. “These defendants were operating a classic Ponzi scheme … And just like a classic Ponzi, they diverted millions of dollars to their own benefit … Meanwhile, the vast majority of their victims suffered losses — in many cases, losses that had a serious impact on their financial and emotional well-being.” – Teal Miller , Acting U.S. Attorney The initial indictment asserted that the two had swindled HashFlare customers using false information about its mining capacity. The company allegedly mined less than 1% of what it claimed but stole more than $550 million from customers between 2015 and 2019. HashFlare also raised around $25 million from investors in 2017 under the guise of opening the Polybus digital bank. Bini claims ‘zero financial harm’ to anyone Defense counsel and partner at Reed Smith, Mark Bini, claimed that Potapenko and Turõgin were committed to ensuring “zero financial harm” to anyone. According to Bini, HashFlare returned over $350 million in crypto payments to victims between 2022 and 2025. However, prosecutors argued that the harm suffered by HashFlare victims could not be more real. The prosecutors also argued that the defendants had admitted that the data they had provided to discredit their victims’ claims was fabricated. They added that the expert opinion presented as evidence for the defense was substantially based on HashFlare investor earnings, not victim losses. The defendants repeatedly claimed in previous court filings that HashFlare customers did not suffer significant losses since $400 million worth of crypto had already been paid back to them. However, the prosecutors argued that this assumption was wrong. The forfeited assets will be available to compensate the victims at a later date, which has not yet been confirmed.

This dramatic upward movement followed a significant announcement from the OKX exchange regarding a massive OKB token burn . This strategic move, which saw 65.25 million OKB tokens permanently removed from circulation, sent ripples through the market, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the OKB crypto token quickly reached a trading price of $120.30, marking a phenomenal 161.02% increase within just 24 hours. Such rapid appreciation highlights the powerful effect that supply-side economics can have on digital assets, particularly within the dynamic realm of decentralized finance. What is an OKB Token Burn and Why Does It Matter? A token burn is a process where a specific amount of cryptocurrency tokens are intentionally and permanently removed from circulation. Think of it like a company buying back its own shares to reduce the total number available. For OKB, this means those 65.25 million tokens are gone forever, making the remaining tokens scarcer. Why do exchanges or projects perform a cryptocurrency token burn ? The primary goal is often to create deflationary pressure. By reducing the total supply, each remaining token theoretically becomes more valuable, assuming demand stays constant or increases. This can be a strong signal of commitment from the project, indicating a focus on long-term value for its holders rather than simply increasing the supply. Scarcity: Reduced supply can lead to increased demand and value. Value Proposition: Signals a commitment to token appreciation. Deflationary Mechanism: Counters potential inflation from new token issuance. The Mechanics Behind OKB’s Incredible OKB Price Surge The immediate and significant OKB price surge following the announcement wasn’t a coincidence. It’s a direct result of market dynamics reacting to the sudden reduction in supply. When a large quantity of tokens is burned, it immediately impacts the supply-demand balance. With fewer tokens available on exchanges and in wallets, the price per token tends to rise, especially if there’s sustained buying interest. This particular OKB token burn was substantial, representing a significant portion of the circulating supply. Such a large-scale event naturally triggers strong investor confidence, as it demonstrates a clear effort by OKX to enhance the value of its native asset. Traders and investors often view these events as bullish indicators, leading to increased buying pressure and, consequently, higher prices. The swiftness of the 160% increase within an hour underscores the market’s rapid response to such impactful news. This highlights how crucial official announcements from major exchanges like OKX can be in shaping immediate price action for their associated tokens. Understanding the Broader Impact of Cryptocurrency Token Burn While the OKB event is a prime example, token burns are not unique to OKX. Many blockchain projects and exchanges utilize this mechanism to manage their tokenomics. The concept is rooted in traditional finance principles of share buybacks, adapted for the digital asset space. However, it’s important to remember that while a token burn can provide a significant short-term boost, long-term sustainability depends on several factors beyond just supply reduction. These include the utility of the OKX token , the overall health of the OKX ecosystem, user adoption, trading volume, and broader market sentiment. A successful token burn should ideally complement a robust project roadmap and active development. Investors should always consider the underlying fundamentals of a project, not just isolated events like token burns, before making investment decisions. Due diligence remains paramount in the volatile crypto market. What Does This Mean for Existing OKX Token Holders? For those already holding OKB, the recent surge represents a substantial increase in their portfolio value. This event reinforces the potential benefits of holding exchange tokens, which often derive value from the success and operations of their parent exchange. The OKB crypto token specifically benefits from its integral role within the OKX ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, access to exclusive features, and participation in new token sales. Moving forward, the success of OKB will continue to be tied to OKX’s growth and innovation. The exchange’s commitment to regularly burning tokens, as indicated by this recent event, suggests a proactive approach to maintaining token value. This strategy aims to reward loyal holders and attract new investors by signaling a long-term vision for the token’s economic model. As the crypto landscape evolves, such deflationary mechanisms may become increasingly vital for tokens seeking to maintain or grow their value in a competitive market. The dramatic OKB token burn and subsequent OKB price surge serve as a powerful reminder of how targeted supply management can profoundly impact cryptocurrency valuations. OKX’s decisive action to burn 65.25 million OKB tokens not only led to an immediate market reaction but also reinforced the token’s position as a valuable asset within its ecosystem. This event underscores the importance of understanding tokenomics and the strategic decisions exchanges make to foster growth and stability for their native tokens. While impressive, remember that market dynamics are complex, and continuous research is key to navigating the crypto world effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an OKB token burn? An OKB token burn is a process where a specific quantity of OKB tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing the total supply of the token. This is done by sending them to an unrecoverable wallet address. 2. Why did OKB’s price surge after the burn? The price surged because the massive reduction in supply, coupled with sustained demand, created scarcity. This often leads to increased value per token, as fewer tokens are available in the market. 3. Are token burns common in cryptocurrency? Yes, token burns are a relatively common mechanism used by many cryptocurrency projects and exchanges to manage their tokenomics, control inflation, and potentially increase the value of their tokens. 4. What are the benefits of holding OKB? Holding OKB can offer benefits such as trading fee discounts on the OKX exchange, access to exclusive features, participation in OKX Jumpstart (new token sales), and potential value appreciation due to mechanisms like token burns. 5. Is OKB a good investment after the burn? While the token burn led to a significant price increase, investment decisions should always be based on thorough research of OKB’s long-term utility, the OKX ecosystem’s growth, overall market conditions, and your personal risk tolerance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Did you find this analysis of the OKB token burn and its impact insightful?

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-says-1000-xrp-price-wont-be-the-ceiling-but-the-floor-heres-why/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has reiterated his highly bullish stance on XRP’s long-term value, arguing that a $1,000 price point would represent a baseline rather than an upper limit. His projection is tied to a vision in which XRP becomes the primary bridge asset for the global financial system. At the time of his comments, XRP is trading slightly above $3. $1,000 as the Baseline for a Global Bridge Asset According to Aljarrah, the price of XRP would have to increase substantially from its current level to serve its intended function in a future, fully integrated financial infrastructure. He believes that when XRP is adopted as the settlement layer for cross-border transactions and institutional flows, a $1,000 valuation would be the “floor,” not the “ceiling.” This, he says, would reflect the asset’s role in enabling global liquidity rather than speculative trading. Aljarrah connects this to the evolution of finance toward tokenized assets, real-time foreign exchange settlements, and sovereign debt swaps. When $XRP becomes the bridge for tokenized assets, real-time FX, and sovereign debt swaps, $1,000 won’t be the ceiling, it'll be the floor. A fixed max supply combined with transaction burns means supply shrinks as demand grows. That’s simple economics driving $XRP much higher. pic.twitter.com/b9oQEyorLw — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) August 4, 2025 In such an environment, trillions of dollars could move efficiently across jurisdictions, with XRP facilitating these transfers as the bridge currency. He maintains that the current price range would not be sustainable for such a role, as the liquidity available would be insufficient to handle the scale of activity. Liquidity Requirements in a Tokenized Economy Aljarrah has previously argued that an XRP price of only a few dollars would be incompatible with a tokenized financial market worth trillions. In his view, much higher valuations—possibly in the hundreds or thousands of dollars—would be required to provide the necessary liquidity for large-scale settlements, central bank operations, and institutional transactions. This is because higher prices enable more value to be transferred with fewer tokens, increasing efficiency. The argument also takes into account XRP’s fixed supply of 100 billion tokens and the transaction burn mechanism that permanently removes a small amount from circulation with each transfer. Over time, this reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand, could place upward pressure on price. Aljarrah has stated that burning XRP is “unnecessary” given his expectation that demand will eventually outpace supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Views from Other Analysts This perspective aligns with claims from other XRP advocates. Crypto founder Jake Claver has said XRP is “programmed” to reach $10,000 for institutional efficiency. He has cited Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who explained that moving $1 billion at $1 per XRP requires 1 billion tokens, whereas a single token could achieve the same transfer if worth $1 billion. Claver has suggested that $10,000 XRP could provide over $500 trillion in theoretical liquidity, sufficient for trillion-dollar transfers, and has projected that such prices could be reached within two years. Skepticism and Timeline Considerations Despite the confidence of supporters like Aljarrah and Claver, their projections face skepticism. Critics note that such valuations would result in market capitalizations far exceeding total global wealth, which may not be realistic under current economic models. Nonetheless, some analysts believe that a $1,000 XRP price could be possible within the next decade if adoption, liquidity, and utility grow at the anticipated pace.

Key Takeaways: Pantera Capital has invested $300M in digital asset treasury companies. Its portfolio includes firms like BitMine, now the largest Ether treasury holder. BitMine’s shares have surged over 1,300% since June, far outpacing Ether’s 90% gain in the same period. In a note on Tuesday , Pantera general partner Cosmo Jiang and content head Erik Lowe said digital asset treasuries (DATs) “can generate yield to grow net asset value per share, resulting in more underlying token ownership over time than just holding spot.” They argued that owning shares in a DAT could deliver higher returns than holding tokens directly or through an ETF. Pantera Backs DATs Using Strategies to Boost Per-Share Token Holdings The firm has backed DATs in the US and the UK that hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and other altcoins. Jiang and Lowe said these companies use their unique position to “employ strategies to grow their digital asset holdings in a per-share accretive way.” Crypto treasury companies have emerged as one of the hottest trends on Wall Street, drawing billions from investors and sending share prices soaring. However, industry voices caution that the market could become overcrowded, leaving some players vulnerable to collapse. One of Pantera’s first investments from its DAT Fund was BitMine Immersion Technologies, chaired by Tom Lee. In just two and a half months, BitMine has become the largest Ether treasury company and the third-largest crypto holder among public firms globally. It now holds nearly 1.2 million ETH, worth about $5.3 billion, and has set a goal of acquiring 5% of Ether’s total supply.

Learn why DATs may be a more effective vehicle for crypto exposure than owning an ETF or holding the underlying token directly. pic.twitter.com/cvAPzorx3e — Pantera Capital (@PanteraCapital) July 3, 2025 BitMine’s strategy includes issuing stock at a premium to net asset value, using convertible bonds to monetize volatility, and generating staking and DeFi yields. Pantera noted that the company’s ability to sustain these tactics “will play out over time,” but its approach has already drawn high-profile backers, including Stan Druckenmiller, Bill Miller, and ARK Invest. Since launching its ETH acquisition plan in late June, BitMine’s shares (BMNR) have surged over 1,300%, compared to Ether’s nearly 90% gain in the same period. “We expect that the growth story of the highest quality DATs will come to be appreciated by more institutional investors,” Pantera said.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has warned that overleveraging could sink some treasury companies if markets turn. Framework Ventures co-founder Vance Spencer recently suggested much of the ETH bought by treasuries will end up in on-chain lending markets to loop or farm yields, adding to systemic risk. Standard Chartered analysts also cautioned in June that Bitcoin-focused treasury firms could face trouble if BTC prices fall sharply, underscoring that the boom in DATs comes with significant downside potential. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, has also raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help.

Briefly, the platform stopped its PUMP buybacks to cash in on SOL. Pump.fun sent SOL to Kraken, despite its commitment to buying back PUMP tokens with most of its fees. On-chain data showed the meme launchpad deposited a total of 86,254 SOL, its first deposit since June 10, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. Pump.fun paused the PUMP buybacks and tapped some of its renewed SOL inflows. | Source: Pump.fun fees . So far, Pump.fun has deposited 3.93M SOL to Kraken, selling at various price ranges, including as low as $158. There is no guarantee all the SOL would be liquidated or traded. Currently, the intermediary wallet used to send SOL to Kraken has emptied its entire balance, though Pump.fun holds at least 898K SOL in its other public wallets . The funds may be used to support PUMP, as well as a selection of memes and communities. The buybacks still had an effect on the price of PUMP, which recovered to $0.004, adding 9.8% in the past day. So far, Pump.fun has also allocated 197,739 SOL to buybacks, with a pause in the past days. The platform achieved fees of up to $3.27M, reviving from recent lows of days with under $500K. Fees spiked to a weekly high as more meme tokens were deployed. Pump.fun rivalry intensifies The rivalry between meme launchpads on Solana has intensified. In the past week, token launches on Solana picked up again, with over 50K assets deployed from all launchpads. On-chain investigators have noticed a shift in the behavior of token launches. Most of the new activity in content creation and subsequent trading is linked to a list of deployer addresses, which are most probably automated with various strategies. The presence of deployers also leads to a rotation between meme platforms, where the same large-scale token launchers shift to the best available markets. This has led to a more diverse market share, where every few days the dominance of platforms changes. Pump.fun is back to 74.5% of the market share, while the previously hot LetsBonk.fun is down to 10%, as deployers moved away. Bags is now taking the second place, with a market share of 11.2% . Smaller platform contenders are also fighting for market share, with Meteora and Jupiter adding the feature to their product mix. Platforms are also incentivizing deployers, leading to a constant watch for the best conditions to launch new memes and tap liquidity. Launchpads see increased competition, with changing market share caused by the rapid movement of the top deployer wallets to the platform with the best short-term conditions. | Source: Dune Analytics . The deployers are debunking the myth of ‘trenches’ coming from organic user participation. While Pump.fun still aims at retail users, the deployers may be responsible for over 95% of activity. The best deployers are also followed for their connection to successful tokens and available liquidity. Pump.fun aims to bring back cult tokens During the 2024 meme boom, Pump.fun produced several top cult memes, including GIGACHAD. However, the cult status emerged from social media, mostly linked to the activity of Murad Mahmudov, as previously tracked by Cryptopolitan. Now, Pump.fun itself aims to create its own cult tokens, claiming that the age of belief is back. The ability to select coins for their cult status may boost the PumpSwap DEX volumes and add more to the platform’s daily fees. Alon Cohen, the co-founder of Pump.fun, recently hinted at the emergence of cult tokens. “Hold and believe season is back”, he said on X in the past week. The recently selected tokens by the Glass Full Foundation are trying to gain cult status. Spirit of Gambling (TOKABU) maxed out at $0.06 and is now consolidating at $0.05. Housecoin (HOUSE) also cooled down at $0.02.

Source: Trading View If bullish momentum continues, the chart signals a potential 18.19% surge, targeting the $0.26 zone. Besides, the rally is spurred by strong institutional interest, following whale accumulation of 1 billion DOGE ($200 million) in recent sessions. The large-holder ownership nears 50% of the supply. Whales bought over one billion Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/qdGrIE6Gez — Ali (@ali_charts) August 6, 2025 This means that the concentrated buying reduces sell-side liquidity and signals institutional confidence. Further, the DOGE turnover ratio suggests sufficient market depth that would sustain momentum for the short term. Per a trader, the DOGE price is now pushing toward the 0.28 target zone inside a bullish channel structure. “A break above 0.28 could open the path toward the higher 0.38 resistance area.” Potential Dogecoin ETF Approvals and Wider Adoption Institutional investors have assigned odds as high as nearly 80% in the Polymarket for a potential Dogecoin ETF approval. Besides, the political and regulatory landscape has also changed significantly this year toward a crypto-lenient approach. In June, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised odds of spot Dogecoin ETF approvals to 90%. They noted that altcoin ETFs, including DOGE and XRP, have a better chance of being approved by the SEC by the end of 2025. The increase in the ETF speculation, along with whale activity and policy developments, suggests a possible higher price target in the coming months. DOGE Technical Momentum Dogecoin has reclaimed its 30-day simple moving average (SMA) with relative strength index (RSI) within the neutral zone at 57. This means there is room for an upside trend. Key resistance is at $0.263. Bulls are expecting a breakout above $0.242–$0.245, which could unlock a secondary leg toward $0.25–$0.26. holding above the support zone would keep DOGE’s bullish thesis intact, setting up trends for a potential surge.

Meanwhile, the breakout comes with potential targets between $0.25 and $0.28 based on Fibonacci extensions.

This “golden cross” happened after a period of range-bound trading. Trader Tardigrade noted that the last crossover, in late 2023, was followed by a notable rally. The crossover level near $0.20 now serves as an area of support for the market.

50017040,555084,1755072036,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Ethereum Bet Deepens: Billionaire Peter Thiel Takes 7.5% Of ETHZilla,https://bitcoinist.com/peter-thiel-ethereum-treasury-company/,"Peter Thiel is doubling down on the emerging “corporate Ethereum treasury” trade. A fresh Schedule 13G filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows entities affiliated with Thiel’s Founders Fund have amassed a 7.5% passive stake in 180 Life Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: ATNF), which is rebranding as ETHZilla and pivoting its business to accumulating Ether and generating on-chain yield. Peter Thiel Doubles Down On Ethereum The disclosure, signed “/s/ Peter Thiel” on August 11, confirms beneficial ownership across multiple Founders Fund vehicles totaling roughly 11.6 million ATNF shares—7.5% of the float. The market reaction was immediate. ATNF shares more than tripled on Tuesday, closing near $10.24—about 207% above Monday’s close—before cooling in after-hours trading. ETHZilla’s pivot is not theoretical. In a press release furnished to the SEC on August 12, the company disclosed “total holdings of 82,186 Ether (‘ETH’) at an average acquisition price of $3,806.71,” valuing the position at approximately $349 million as of August 11. It also reported about $238 million in US dollar cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Executive chairman McAndrew Rudisill framed the strategy as a purpose-built, institutional ETH reserve that will be actively deployed into staking and on-chain yield strategies run by an external manager: “At ETHZilla we have put over $350 million in capital to work since the PIPE transaction we completed last week… as we seek to deliver on our on-chain yield generation program through our external asset manager Electric Capital.” Those disclosures cap a rapid financing sequence backing the accumulation plan. On August 4, ETHZilla closed a $425 million private placement, followed one week later by approximately $156 million of senior secured convertible notes due 2028. Each financing explicitly cited the goal of “rapidly” increasing the company’s ETH holdings. Thiel’s move into ETHZilla arrives less than a month after his group revealed a 9.1% passive stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR), the most aggressive of the public “ETH treasury” cohort. That earlier 13G similarly listed Thiel as signatory and helped ignite a rally in BMNR. Notably, The BitMine drumbeat grew louder again this week. On Tuesday, the company filed to enlarge its at-the-market equity program by another $20 billion—lifting total capacity to $24.5 billion—to finance additional ETH accumulation. The expansion was memorialized in a same-day Form 8-K and prospectus supplement. Tom Lee , co-founder of Fundstrat and Chairman of the Board of Directors at BitMine, is pursuing one of the largest Ethereum accumulation strategies in history through his company. BitMine has already amassed about 1.2 million ETH—roughly $5 billion worth—putting it 20% of the way toward its target of controlling 5% of Ethereum’s total supply. Taken together, the signal from Thiel is unambiguous. After the 9.1% BitMine disclosure in mid-July, the 7.5% ETHZilla stake marks his second material bet on an Ethereum-first corporate treasury in less than a month, displaying the kind of high-conviction wager that ETH’s appreciation will outpace dilution, financing costs, and mark-to-market volatility—justifying aggressive balance-sheet accumulation now for outsized upside later.

According to analyst Axel Adler Jr., August’s 30-day change in the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) went above +0.4 for the first time since 2020, a level that has historically come before periods of volatile price moves and sudden liquidations. Elevated Risk as Market Awaits Macro Catalyst The ELR spike comes with BTC hovering near record territory towards $120,000, setting the stage for potentially more violent swings should the market tip in either direction. “This indicates a rapid and large-scale influx of leveraged positions in futures while the price remains near historical highs,” Adler posted on X, warning that such positioning often leaves the market vulnerable to “sharp liquidations.” Bitcoin started the week on strong footing, briefly touching $122,000 on August 11 before reversing below $118,500 later that day. The price has since retraced its steps near the all-time-high level, trading at $119,169 at press time, up 0.4% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the OG crypto has climbed 4.4%, while its monthly gain sits at 2.6%. It is roughly 3.1% off its all-time high above $123,000 set on July 14. Technically, BTC is consolidating within an ascending triangle, with the Ichimoku Cloud offering near-term support, according to chart analysis from The Crypto Express. However, traders are eyeing the horizontal supply zone above as a hurdle; a confirmed breakout or breakdown could dictate the next major move. Altcoin Strength Erodes Bitcoin’s Market Share While Bitcoin’s price has held relatively steady, its dominance is currently at 57.5% per CoinGecko, up slightly after slipping to 55% earlier, the lowest since January, following Ethereum’s 8% pump on August 13 to $4,670, just shy of its own ATH. Analysts say the slide in the number one cryptocurrency’s market share is a hint of an early-stage altcoin season, especially if the trend deepens toward 50%. For now, market sentiment is mixed, with CoinMarketCap’s altseason index at 37 out of 100, while Blockchain Center’s gauge shows a more aggressive 53 reading. The convergence of historically high futures leverage, technical compression, and shifting capital flows toward altcoins leaves Bitcoin’s short-term outlook finely balanced. If history is any guide, the coming days could deliver either a decisive breakout or a painful shakeout for overleveraged traders.

Nach seiner Analyse befindet sich der Markt bereits im Schlussspurt des laufenden Bullenzyklus. Das mögliche Hoch erwartet er in einem Zeitfenster von sechs bis acht Wochen, mit einer Spanne zwischen 140.000 und 150.000 US-Dollar als Zielbereich. Die jüngste Kursentwicklung liefert dafür erste Signale. Die Unterstützung bei 112.000 US-Dollar hat gehalten, woraufhin der Kurs über 120.000 US-Dollar steigen konnte. Dennoch schließt Michel eine kurze Korrektur auf etwa 117.500 US-Dollar nicht aus, um ein offenes CME-Gap zu schließen. Anschließend wäre die Basis für einen weiteren Aufwärtsimpuls gegeben. Im Chartbild erkennt Michel Parallelen zu früheren Phasen, in denen der Markt zunächst seitwärts tendierte, um dann dynamisch anzuziehen. Der jüngste Ausbruch über 120.000 US-Dollar habe viele Short-Positionen aus dem Markt gedrängt. Ein dauerhafter Aufwärtstrend werde jedoch erst erwartet, wenn sich der Kurs stabil über dieser Marke etabliert. Technische Lage und Marktstruktur Eine Schlüsselrolle spielt derzeit die Entwicklung der Bitcoin-Dominanz. In den vergangenen Wochen gab es Anzeichen einer Trendwende. Sollte der Anteil von Bitcoin weiter sinken, könnte dies Kapital in den Altcoin-Markt lenken und den Start einer Altcoin-Season beschleunigen. Bitcoin Dominanz sinkt deutlich, Quelle: www.tradingview.com Michel erinnert an frühere Marktzyklen, in denen längere Konsolidierungen mit mehreren kleineren Rücksetzern dem Ausbruch vorausgingen. Auch diesmal rechnet er nicht mit einem durchgehenden Anstieg, sondern mit einer Bewegung in Etappen. Die wöchentliche Trendstärke (MACD) zeigt trotz leichter Abschwächung weiterhin ein positives Signal. Solange der Indikator im grünen Bereich bleibt, sieht Michel den Aufwärtstrend intakt. Entscheidend sei, dass Bitcoin nicht unter die jüngst eroberten Zonen zurückfällt. Altcoins mit Potenzial Ethereum hat gestern die Marke von 4.600 US-Dollar überschritten. Für Michel war die Hürde bei 4.100 US-Dollar seit Wochen ein entscheidender Prüfpunkt. Der Sprung könnte den Weg zu einem Angriff auf das Allzeithoch bei 4.868 US-Dollar ebnen. Langfristig hält er auch 8.000 US-Dollar für möglich. Rückenwind erhält die Entwicklung durch steigende Kapitalzuflüsse in Ethereum-Spot-ETFs und die Bestätigung der US-Börsenaufsicht, dass Liquid Staking nicht als Wertpapier gilt. Solana bewegt sich stabil in einem Aufwärtstrendkanal und könnte in einer dynamischen Marktphase Kursbereiche zwischen 800 und 1.000 US-Dollar erreichen. Damit ebnet sich auch der Weg für das neue Projekt Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), welches die Blockchains von Bitcoin und Solana miteinander verbinden will. $HYPER knows where it's going. https://t.co/VNG0P4FWNQ pic.twitter.com/SeH6rDfkUO — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 12, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper: Beschleunigung für das Bitcoin-Netzwerk Parallel zu den Kursbewegungen am Markt sorgt der Presale von Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) für Interesse. Das Projekt will eine Layer-2-Lösung für Bitcoin schaffen, die auf der Solana Virtual Machine basiert. Ziel ist es, Bitcoin-Transaktionen mit der Geschwindigkeit und Skalierbarkeit von Solana dApps zu ermöglichen – und das ohne Abstriche bei der Sicherheit. Kernstück ist eine Bridge-Technologie: Bitcoin wird auf der Hauptchain hinterlegt, während auf der Layer 2 ein Wrapped BTC verfügbar gemacht wird. Dieser lässt sich für sofortige Zahlungen oder Anwendungen nutzen. Die Rückführung erfolgt durch das Verbrennen der Wrapped Tokens. Der Presale hat bereits mehr als 9 Millionen US-Dollar erreicht, das nächste Etappenziel sind 10 Millionen. Zuletzt kaufte ein Großinvestor HYPER-Tokens im Wert von 110.000 US-Dollar. Bekannte Krypto-Influencer wie Aiden Crypto sehen in dem Projekt langfristig ein Potenzial, das weit über den aktuellen Presale hinausgeht – in Einzelfällen sprechen sie sogar von möglichen vierstelligen Multiplikatoren, wobei bei Memecoins auch immer das Risiko im Auge behalten werden sollte.

South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has issued an important announcement concerning NEAR Protocol (NEAR) that could affect your transactions. Staying informed about such updates is crucial for managing your digital assets effectively. Upbit recently confirmed on its official website that it will temporarily suspend NEAR deposits and withdrawals. This measure is a standard procedure to ensure a seamless transition during an upcoming blockchain event. What Does the Upbit Suspension Mean for NEAR Users? The Upbit suspension for NEAR Protocol is scheduled for August 18, at 03:00 UTC. This means that from this specific time, you will not be able to deposit or withdraw NEAR tokens on the Upbit platform. Date & Time: August 18, 03:00 UTC. Affected Services: NEAR deposits and withdrawals. Reason: To support the upcoming NEAR Protocol upgrade . It is vital for all users holding NEAR on Upbit, or planning to move NEAR to or from the exchange, to take note of this deadline. Any transactions initiated close to or after this time may not be processed until services resume. Understanding the NEAR Protocol Upgrade Why do exchanges need to suspend services for a network upgrade? A blockchain network upgrade is a significant event that often introduces new features, improves performance, or enhances security. For the NEAR Protocol upgrade , this involves technical changes to the blockchain’s underlying infrastructure. These upgrades are essential for the long-term health and evolution of the network, ensuring it remains robust, scalable, and efficient. During such upgrades, exchanges like Upbit temporarily halt deposit and withdrawal services to prevent potential issues. This includes avoiding lost funds, incorrect transaction statuses, or other discrepancies that could arise from interacting with a network in transition. Navigating Crypto Exchange Upbit’s Announcement For users of Crypto exchange Upbit , preparation is key. If you have immediate needs to deposit or withdraw NEAR, make sure to complete these transactions well before the August 18 deadline. This proactive approach helps avoid any last-minute rushes or potential complications. It’s always recommended to: Check Official Channels: Always refer to Upbit’s official website or announcements for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the resumption of services. Plan Ahead: Consider your NEAR holdings and any planned transactions. If you need to move NEAR, do so with ample time before the suspension. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and the official NEAR Protocol channels for updates on the upgrade’s progress. Why is Network Upgrade Support Crucial? Providing network upgrade support is a critical responsibility for cryptocurrency exchanges. By temporarily suspending services, Upbit is prioritizing the safety of user funds and the integrity of the NEAR Protocol network. This action ensures that when the upgrade is complete, all user balances and transaction histories are accurately reflected. The duration of the suspension typically depends on the complexity of the upgrade and the time required for the exchange to verify the stability of the upgraded network. While temporary suspensions can be inconvenient, they are a necessary part of maintaining a secure and reliable cryptocurrency ecosystem. In conclusion, Upbit’s upcoming suspension of NEAR deposits and withdrawals is a standard, protective measure to facilitate the NEAR Protocol network upgrade. Users are encouraged to act promptly and stay informed through official channels. This proactive approach helps ensure a smooth experience for all participants during this important technical evolution of the NEAR blockchain.

In his post, he wrote, “Mean reversion for XRP. We’re just getting started!” The message was accompanied by a detailed monthly chart of XRP against the U.S. dollar on Bitstamp, illustrating price action from the early years of the asset through to the present, along with a projection extending into the future. The chart features a white ascending trendline running through multiple major lows across the years, encapsulated within a shaded upward channel. It also includes red arcs highlighting previous market peaks and projected future highs, as well as green curves denoting rounded bottoms where the price reverted toward the trendline before moving higher. Mean reversion for #XRP We're just getting started! pic.twitter.com/8fMGYeqOBK — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 12, 2025 Technical Structure Displayed in the Chart Steph Is Crypto’s chart outlines a recurring pattern across XRP’s historical price movements . In each cycle, price experiences a significant rally followed by an extended corrective phase, which gradually moves price back toward the long-term trendline. These consolidation phases tend to precede a new impulsive move higher. The most recent data on the chart shows XRP trading above the long-term trendline following a period of consolidation, with the green curve illustrating the rounded recovery phase. The red projection arc suggests that the next stage in this sequence would be a substantial upward move, continuing the pattern observed in previous cycles. The shaded channel provides visual context for this analysis, showing that despite fluctuations, XRP has maintained an overall rising trajectory over the years. The analyst’s focus on the trendline as a central mean value reinforces the view that XRP’s current position represents a favorable stage in the cycle from a technical standpoint. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Mean Reversion as the Basis for the Outlook The principle of mean reversion underpins the analysis in Steph Is Crypto’s tweet. In this context, mean reversion refers to the tendency of an asset’s price to return to its long-term average or trendline after significant upward or downward deviations. According to the annotated chart, XRP has repeatedly demonstrated this behavior over multiple market cycles, with each reversion to the trendline historically leading to an extended rally. Steph Is Crypto’s statement, “We’re just getting started,” signals a belief that XRP is at the beginning of such a rally phase. This view is the historical pattern of price returning to the trendline before embarking on substantial upward moves. Outlook and Considerations If XRP’s price action continues to follow the historical mean reversion structure, the analysis implies that a major multi-year rally could follow the current market positioning. However, it is important to note that while this interpretation is grounded in historical observations, actual market outcomes depend on various factors, including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic shifts, and regulatory developments.

A major milestone has been reached with the successful Bullish IPO , signaling a new era of mainstream acceptance for digital assets. This development is not just a win for one company; it represents a powerful step forward for the entire industry. What Does the Bullish IPO Signify for the Market? Crypto exchange Bullish recently made headlines by pricing its initial public offering (IPO) at $37 per share. This figure exceeded the expected range of $32–$33, showcasing strong investor confidence. The company successfully raised an impressive $1.11 billion by offering 30 million shares, which values the firm at a remarkable $5.41 billion, according to Reuters reports. Strong Valuation: The $5.41 billion valuation underscores the growing interest in regulated crypto entities. NYSE Listing: Bullish is set to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “BLSH,” making it accessible to a broader range of traditional investors. Over-subscribed: The IPO was priced above its initial range, indicating robust demand from the market. This achievement positions Bullish as a significant player and sets a precedent for future crypto ventures looking to go public. It is indeed a landmark crypto exchange IPO . Powering Forward: Institutional Crypto Investment Takes Center Stage A key highlight of this landmark event is the substantial backing from prominent financial institutions. The firm, which is led by former NYSE president Tom Farley and supported by tech titan Peter Thiel, attracted significant commitments from major players. BlackRock and Ark Invest, two of the world’s leading asset managers, committed to investing up to $200 million in Bullish. This commitment is a powerful vote of confidence in the future of digital assets and the platform Bullish is building. This level of institutional crypto investment from such established names sends a clear message: cryptocurrencies are moving from the fringes to the financial mainstream. Their involvement can help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The Broader Impact of a Bullish Crypto IPO: A New Era? The success of the Bullish crypto IPO could trigger a wave of similar moves by other digital asset companies. As the market matures and regulatory clarity improves, more crypto exchanges and blockchain firms may consider traditional public listings to raise capital and gain legitimacy. What does this mean for the industry at large? Increased Legitimacy: Public listings on major exchanges enhance the credibility of the entire crypto sector. Greater Accessibility: It provides traditional investors with a regulated pathway to gain exposure to the crypto market. Enhanced Scrutiny: Being a publicly traded company means increased transparency and regulatory oversight, which can foster greater trust. This significant crypto IPO could pave the way for a more integrated financial ecosystem where digital assets play a crucial role alongside traditional securities. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Bullish While the successful IPO is a monumental achievement, Bullish, like any public company in a nascent industry, will face its share of challenges and opportunities. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and market volatility remains a factor. However, the capital raised and the institutional backing provide a strong foundation for Bullish to innovate and expand its offerings. The company’s unique blend of a centralized exchange with decentralized finance (DeFi) principles positions it to capture a wide range of market participants. The journey ahead for Bullish will be closely watched, as its performance post-listing could influence how other crypto firms approach their own public offerings and overall growth strategies. The success of this Bullish IPO marks a pivotal moment for the industry. In conclusion, the Bullish IPO is more than just a financial transaction; it is a powerful affirmation of the crypto market’s maturation and its increasing integration into the global financial system. With significant capital raised and the backing of institutional giants, Bullish is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital asset trading. This event truly ignites confidence in the crypto space, signaling exciting times ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the significance of Bullish pricing its IPO above the expected range?

These include Peter Thiel, a well-known tech investor, and institutional giants like BlackRock and Ark Invest, which committed up to $200 million. 3.

It could encourage more traditional investors to consider crypto assets and potentially pave the way for other crypto companies to pursue public listings. 4.

This can enhance investor trust and broaden the company’s appeal to institutional and retail investors who prefer regulated avenues. 5.

A significant move is underway as venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the DeFi Education Fund have formally urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a safe harbor for dApp developers . This proposal aims to provide much-needed clarity and foster innovation, potentially reshaping the future of digital finance. Why is an SEC Safe Harbor Crucial for dApp Developers? Currently, dApp developers face significant uncertainty regarding their legal standing. Many worry about being inadvertently classified as broker-dealers, which would subject them to stringent and often ill-fitting traditional financial regulations. This ambiguity can stifle creativity and slow down the development of groundbreaking decentralized technologies. The proposed SEC safe harbor seeks to address this by offering a temporary exemption. This would allow developers to build and iterate without the immediate threat of regulatory enforcement, provided they meet specific criteria designed to protect users and maintain market integrity. It’s about creating a sandbox where innovation can flourish responsibly. Unlocking DeFi Innovation: The Vision Behind the Proposal The core idea behind this petition is to unlock further DeFi innovation . Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, self-custodial wallets, and NFT marketplaces are integral to the crypto ecosystem. However, their unique, permissionless nature often clashes with existing regulatory frameworks built for centralized entities. A safe harbor could pave the way for more robust and user-friendly dApps. Developers would have the confidence to experiment with new protocols and services, knowing they have a clear path to compliance. This would not only benefit developers but also expand access to decentralized financial tools for a broader audience, fostering economic inclusion. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Specifics of the Proposed Exemption The petition outlines clear criteria for developers to qualify for this exemption from crypto regulation . While the exact details would need to be finalized by the SEC, the general premise is that developers would not be treated as broker-dealers even if their dApps facilitate transactions involving tokenized securities. This applies as long as they adhere to specific rules. Key aspects likely include decentralization thresholds, robust disclosure requirements, and perhaps limitations on direct control over user assets or protocols. The goal is to differentiate true decentralized systems from centralized platforms that merely use blockchain technology, ensuring the exemption benefits genuine decentralized efforts. Shaping Future Blockchain Policy: What’s Next for the SEC? This initiative by a16z and the DeFi Education Fund is a significant step in shaping future blockchain policy in the United States. It signals a proactive approach from the industry to engage with regulators and provide constructive solutions. The SEC’s response will be closely watched by the entire crypto community. Should the SEC adopt such a framework, it could set a global precedent for how governments approach decentralized technologies. It emphasizes the need for tailored regulations that understand the unique characteristics of blockchain and DeFi, rather than trying to fit square pegs into round holes. This dialogue is essential for responsible growth. In conclusion, the call for an SEC safe harbor for dApp developers represents a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It highlights the urgent need for regulatory clarity to foster DeFi innovation and ensure the United States remains a leader in the digital economy. By providing a clear path, this framework could unleash a new wave of creativity and growth in decentralized applications, ultimately benefiting users worldwide and shaping progressive blockchain policy . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “safe harbor” in the context of crypto? A safe harbor is a legal provision that exempts certain activities or entities from liability or regulation, provided they meet specific conditions. In crypto, it would temporarily shield dApp developers from certain SEC oversight. Why are a16z and the DeFi Education Fund proposing this? They believe current crypto regulation is unclear for dApps, stifling innovation. A safe harbor would provide clarity and allow for responsible development without immediate regulatory burdens. How would a safe harbor benefit dApp developers? It would reduce legal uncertainty, encourage experimentation, and accelerate the development of decentralized technologies, leading to more robust DeFi innovation . What types of dApps would this safe harbor apply to? It would primarily apply to decentralized exchanges, self-custodial wallets, and NFT marketplaces, exempting them from being classified as broker-dealers under specific criteria. What are the next steps for this proposal? The proposal has been formally submitted to the SEC. The next step involves the SEC reviewing the petition and deciding whether to initiate a rulemaking process to establish such a framework.

This marks their first major liquidation since accumulating 1.21 million ETH valued at $5.6 billion. The massive sell-off comes as Ethereum trades near $4,600, just 5% below its November 2021 all-time high, raising questions about whether institutional profit-taking could derail the current rally. The timing coincides with record-breaking institutional demand, as Ethereum ETFs recorded their sixth consecutive day of inflows totaling $523.9 million on August 12, following a historic $1 billion single-day haul. Corporate treasury holdings also reached $16.4 billion worth of ETH across 64 entities, with BitMine Immersion Technologies leading with 1.2 million ETH valued at $5.27 billion. The mysterious group ""7 Siblings"" with 1.21M $ETH ($5.6B) is selling $ETH ! Over the past 15 hours, 7 Siblings has sold 19,461 $ETH ($88.2M) at an average price of $4,532. Earlier this year, they bought 103,543 $ETH ($229.7M) at $2,219 between Feb 3–Apr 7. https://t.co/zbJlsNo6NA pic.twitter.com/ddvsXueVsH — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 13, 2025 Profit-Taking Pressure Emerges as Short-Term Holders Cash Out Short-term ETH holders are realizing approximately $553 million in daily gains according to Glassnode data , far outpacing long-term holders who remain relatively inactive. Source: Glassnode Despite ETH’s 43% monthly surge, current profit-taking levels remain 39% below last month’s peak when prices traded near $3,500. Aside from the “7 Siblings” Whale Group, the Ethereum Foundation also executed significant sales, disposing of 2,795 ETH worth $12.7 million in two transactions as prices hit yearly highs. The sales reduced the Foundation’s holdings to just 99.9 ETH and 11.6 million DAI. The community was divided on this sale, with some criticizing it and others viewing it as a strategic exit at peak prices. Notably, global search interest for “Ethereum” has soared to its highest level since 2021, according to Google Trends data, with North Macedonia, Switzerland, Singapore, Slovenia, and Austria leading search activity. The surge coincides with Ethereum’s network reaching an all-time transaction record of 1.875 million daily transactions. While some whales are selling the top, some remain highly bullish. Arthur Hayes, for instance, reversed his bearish stance with an aggressive $8.4 million crypto buying spree , accumulating 1,500 ETH alongside substantial DeFi token positions in LDO, ETHFI, and PENDLE. His purchases follow earlier predictions that ETH would drop to $3,000. Record Corporate Adoption Drives Institutional FOMO Corporate Ethereum holdings posted their largest monthly increase on record in July, climbing 127% to more than 2.7 million ETH worth $11.6 billion. Twenty-four new entities joined the ranks, bringing the total now to 71 companies holding significant ETH positions. BitMine Immersion Technologies filed for an additional $20 billion in at-the-market equity offerings, lifting total issuance capacity to $24.5 billion to fund further Ethereum purchases. SharpLink Gaming follows with 598,800 ETH worth $2.74 billion, while The Ether Machine holds 345,400 ETH valued at $1.58 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA led ETF inflows with $640 million during the record-breaking session, while Fidelity’s FETH captured $277 million. Cumulative historical inflows reached $10.806 billion for ETHA and $2.797 billion for FETH, which indicates significant institutional capital commitments. Source: SosoValue During this first ETH rally of the year, Ethereum’s market capitalization reached $523 billion, overtaking Mastercard’s $519 billion valuation. Gas fees also dropped to $0.53, historically signaling massive on-chain activity and price explosions, while ETH addresses holding over 10,000 tokens hit 868,886 on Saturday. Technical Breakout Signals Historic Rally Despite Whale Sales Technical analysis reveals Ethereum breaking out of an 8-year triangular consolidation pattern against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio reaching 0.03917. Looks like $ETH will break-out from this 8 year old triangle on the BTC pair. Historic times. pic.twitter.com/ihveG8xM6p — Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) August 13, 2025 The pattern encompasses nearly half of Ethereum’s existence. If the current rally persists, it could be one of the most significant technical breakouts in crypto history. The daily chart shows ETH completing its fifth major parabolic cycle, with each cycle reaching progressively higher peaks while establishing higher lows. The current breakout above $4,600 confirms escape from multiple long-term consolidation patterns simultaneously. Ethereum has decisively broken above a 4-year sideways consolidation range with implications for explosive upside potential. Historical precedent suggests similar breakouts resulted in 54x gains, transforming ETH from $80 to over $4,000 in previous cycles. Despite the 7 Siblings whale sales, technical patterns indicate continued upward momentum, with immediate targets at $5,000-$6,000, as Ethereum breaks free from years of consolidation. Long-term projections suggest $10,000-$15,000 remains achievable if institutional demand sustains and the 8-year breakout pattern follows historical precedents of 4x-10x moves from major triangle resolutions.

The groups wrote in a letter to Congress that existing provisions do not extend to cover crypto exchanges or other crypto businesses, which presents a possible loophole through which issuers can bypass the law. In digital asset market structure legislation, it is important that the requirements in the GENIUS Act prohibiting the payment of interest and yield on stablecoins are not evaded. The latest from BPI, @ABABankers , @ConsumerBankers , @FSForum and @ICBA : https://t.co/YOta4d4UDA — Bank Policy Institute (@bankpolicy) August 12, 2025 The GENIUS Act does not allow issuers of stablecoins to pay interest to token holders. Nevertheless, unless this prohibition is also extended to allied services, banks claim that issuers may collaborate with exchanges and create rewards, which would defeat the purpose of the law. The banking groups warned that this could disrupt the traditional deposit markets, and that it would result in the estimated $6.6 trillion outflow of banking market, as cited by the U.S. Treasury. Risk to the U.S. credit system The signatories, including the American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and the Financial Services Forum, stated that stablecoins that bear yields are not comparable with bank deposits or money market funds. They neither lend nor invest in securities, which are the operations that enable controlled financial institutions to make profits. As per the letter, a sudden boom in stablecoin usage may elevate the danger of deposit flight during financial turmoil. This would cause a decline in the amount of capital available to lend and result in an increase in interest rates, as well as providing less of a credit outlet to households and small businesses. The groups cautioned that the effect would be serious and would interrupt economic growth. One of the charts attached to the letter, provided by the Treasury Department, showed what the money supply could look like in case the yield restrictions were not enforced. BPI reported that mass flooding of capital into stablecoins may accelerate in the case of financial uncertainty, increasing the risks to the credit system. Stablecoin yield practices under scrutiny The stablecoin yield offering has emerged as the major marketing strategy. Some issuers pay holders directly, and some work with exchanges that compensate customers who retain tokens on their exchanges. USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle, is pegged at $0.9997 but can accrue interest in storage in exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. Banking executives emphasized that interest payments are a valid instrument to attract deposits in a regulated banking system, but can destabilize when used as interest on stablecoins. They claim that stablecoins must be a steady payment-oriented asset, without yield functionalities competing with conventional deposits. According to the Treasury Department, the stablecoin market may expand up to $2 trillion by 2028, against the current volume of approximately $280.2 billion. Over 80% of those accounts are Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which have market caps of $165 billion and $66.4 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Even with the limits of the GENIUS Act , significant crypto enterprises are still providing incentives to stablecoin holders. Examples include Coinbase and PayPal, where both companies have said they will continue operating their yield schemes, claiming that the legislation only covers issuers and not platforms that host customer assets. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, recently told shareholders that the company does not consider its payouts as interest. Armstrong said, “We don’t pay interest or yield, we pay rewards.” Get seen where it counts.

The company also announced that the returns of these companies will be better than cryptocurrency ETFs. Pantera partner Cosmo Jiang and content manager Erik Lowe stated in their published report that they have invested over $300 million to date in publicly traded DAT companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Stating that DAT companies will offer higher returns, Pantera executives stated that BitMine Immersion, one of Pantera's most important shares, increased by 330% with the Ethereum (ETH) strategy and surpassed the initial performance of the Bitcoin bull Strategy. “DATs can generate returns that increase net asset value per share, resulting in greater underlying token ownership over time than simply holding spot. Therefore, owning a DAT may offer the potential for higher returns compared to holding tokens directly or through an ETF.” It was stated that Pantera's DAT portfolio includes eight cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Toncoin (TON), Hyperliquid (HYPE), Sui (SUI) and Ethena (ENA).

This isn’t just a minor adjustment; the projection has soared from an already substantial $7,500 to an astounding $25,000. This bold new ETH price prediction , initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, indicates a profound shift in institutional confidence regarding the future of Ethereum. Why the Astounding Ethereum Price Forecast? Standard Chartered is a global banking giant, and its insights often carry significant weight in financial circles. Their revised Ethereum price forecast isn’t based on speculation alone; it reflects a deeper analysis of Ethereum’s foundational strengths and its evolving role in the digital economy. This new target for 2028 suggests a belief in Ethereum’s continued dominance and growth. The previous forecast of $7,500 was already bullish, but the leap to $25,000 signals an even greater conviction. What factors could be driving such an optimistic outlook from a traditional financial institution like Standard Chartered Ethereum? Factors Fueling This Optimistic Standard Chartered Ethereum View Several key elements contribute to this revised ETH price prediction . Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand at an unprecedented rate, hosting the vast majority of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The network’s ongoing technical upgrades are also crucial. Technological Advancements: Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake and subsequent upgrades like Dencun have significantly improved its efficiency, scalability, and security. These enhancements make the network more robust and attractive for developers and users alike. Growing Utility: Beyond DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum is increasingly vital for enterprise solutions, supply chain management, and digital identity. Its versatility drives demand and adoption. Institutional Adoption: More traditional financial players are exploring and integrating Ethereum-based solutions. This growing institutional interest solidifies its position as a legitimate and valuable digital asset investment . These developments collectively paint a picture of a maturing and expanding ecosystem, justifying a more bullish long-term perspective. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Outlook While the Standard Chartered forecast is incredibly positive for Ethereum, it’s essential to consider the broader crypto market outlook . The cryptocurrency space is known for its volatility, and various macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures can influence prices. However, Ethereum often acts as a bellwether for the altcoin market. A strong Ethereum price forecast from a reputable institution can instill confidence across the entire digital asset landscape. It suggests that institutional money views cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, as a viable long-term asset class, moving beyond speculative trading. Investors should always conduct their own research and understand the inherent risks. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and while long-term predictions are valuable, short-term fluctuations are inevitable. Actionable Insights for Your Digital Asset Investment Strategy Given this remarkable ETH price prediction , what should investors consider? Here are some actionable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Standard Chartered’s forecast is for late 2028, emphasizing a long-term investment horizon. This suggests that short-term price movements might be less relevant for those aiming to capitalize on this growth. Diversification: While Ethereum is a strong contender, a balanced portfolio that includes other promising cryptocurrencies and traditional assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of Ethereum’s technological roadmap, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends that could impact the crypto market outlook . Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind Ethereum’s value, alongside expert analysis like Standard Chartered’s, empowers more informed investment decisions. In conclusion, Standard Chartered’s astonishing Ethereum price forecast of $25,000 by late 2028 marks a significant milestone in the institutional acceptance and valuation of digital assets. This revised ETH price prediction is rooted in Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, continuous innovation, and increasing mainstream adoption. While the path to $25,000 may involve market fluctuations, this bold projection from a leading financial institution underscores the immense potential that lies ahead for Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Standard Chartered’s new Ethereum price forecast? Standard Chartered has raised its price forecast for Ethereum (ETH) to $25,000 by late 2028, a significant increase from its previous projection of $7,500. What factors are driving this optimistic ETH price prediction? The optimistic forecast is driven by Ethereum’s ongoing technological advancements, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake and subsequent upgrades, its growing utility across DeFi and NFTs, and increasing institutional adoption as a viable digital asset investment . How reliable are long-term crypto price predictions like this? While forecasts from reputable institutions like Standard Chartered provide valuable insights and reflect deep analysis, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Investors should consider these as informed projections, not guarantees, and always conduct their own due diligence. What does this mean for the overall crypto market outlook? A strong Ethereum price forecast from a major bank can positively influence the broader crypto market outlook , suggesting growing institutional confidence in digital assets as a legitimate and valuable asset class for long-term investment. What are the main risks associated with investing in Ethereum? Key risks include market volatility, potential regulatory changes, competition from other blockchain platforms, and technological vulnerabilities. Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations and only invest what they can afford to lose. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

One-time burn of 65M OKB reduced supply to 21M, fueling a rapid price surge and a record high. RSI at 94.73 shows strong buying pressure, while the Balance of Power reading favors bullish market control. Price Jumps on Token Burn and Upgrade OKB stole the show today after a massive triple-digit surge that drove it to a new all-time high of $135. This spectacular rally has materialized mostly in the past day as OKB’s weekly and monthly gains are similar to today’s surge. The total trading volume has risen to over $2.2 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Although OKB has retraced since its peak, it’s still 132% up daily and sits well above $100. Perhaps the most probable reason behind the token’s surge is OKX’s decision to burn more than 65 million OKB in a one-time event. After the burn, the total supply will stand at 21 million. OKX also announced an upgrade to X Layer, its zkEVM blockchain built with Polygon. The change, called the PP upgrade, adds new Polygon CDK features. Throughput will rise to 5,000 TPS, gas fees will drop, and Ethereum compatibility will improve. X Layer will link with OKX Wallet, OKX Exchange, and OKX Pay for features such as gasless withdrawals. Token Structure and Chain Changes OKTChain will be retired, and OKT trading will end on August 13, 2025. Remaining tokens will convert to OKB on August 15 using an average price. The chain will remain open for deposits until January 1, 2026. OKB stays as the native gas token for X Layer. The Ethereum L1 version will be phased out. Holders must bridge tokens to X Layer before L1 withdrawals are closed. Plans also include an ecosystem fund, liquidity rewards, and upgrades to bridges, oracles, and compliance systems. Technical Readings and Trader View RSI is at 95, which shows strong buying pressure and an overbought market. Such levels are uncommon but can last when moves are driven by news. The Balance of Power is 0.62, showing buyers have control. High readings like this often appear during periods of heavy accumulation. Source: TradingView Trader Efloud said, “Perhaps I am a market maker. I don’t know yet… we need to enjoy our profits.” He had earlier noted that a pullback into the $43.3–$42.4 range would have him watching for a bullish structure on lower timeframes. $OKB | Update Nothing much to say.

Whales snapped up a staggering $161K Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and $105K TOKEN6900 ($T6900) in one day. That’s a 265K thunderclap landing in presales just as Ethereum popped above $4.5K for the first time since 2021. It’s the sort of moment that makes wallets sweat, and watch out for runaway trains. If you’ve been itching to breed some meme-coin mania or ride the next wave of ‘ best altcoins to 10x after Ethereum $4.5k rally,’ this might be your ticket. Let’s zoom out, sniff the market, and spotlight three presales that just might light up your portfolio. The Market Context Ethereum ’s push beyond $4,5K has shifted the market’s tone. Traders are scanning for new crypto projects that could deliver 10x returns. The excitement is feeding into crypto presales , where lower entry prices are tempting buyers before tokens reach exchanges. Whale purchases of $161K Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and $105K TOKEN6900 ($T6900) in one day are adding fuel to the optimism, suggesting that large investors see strong upside potential. This mix of price action, fresh capital, and growing retail interest is stirring a sense of FOMO across the market. As more money flows into early-stage projects, the next wave of high performers could be forming right now – setting the stage for a busy and potentially lucrative season for altcoin hunters. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 with Meme Energy Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the fastest Bitcoin Layer 2, built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This setup delivers sub-second transactions, near-zero gas fees, and full compatibility with the Solana ecosystem. With this upgrade, Bitcoin gains the scalability needed for high-speed payments, meme coins , dApps, and DeFi. The platform serves as an execution layer where assets can move across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other chains without delays. Developers, traders, and community builders can launch projects and transact at speeds that make everyday blockchain use practical. $HYPER powers every part of the network – from transactions and staking to governance and launch access. Early participants can earn staking rewards of up to 150% APY and gain priority for airdrops and token launches. You can buy $HYPER for $0.01265 right now, with more than $9M already raised. Yesterday’s whale purchase of $161K worth of tokens adds weight to the growing momentum, especially alongside Ethereum’s climb past $4,5K. Market attention is shifting toward projects that combine real utility with cultural relevance, and Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself at that intersection. 2. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) – Meme Coin That’s Taking no Prisoners TOKEN6900 ($T6900) has quickly become one of the loudest meme coins on the market, raising nearly $1.9M in its presale with each token priced around $0.00695. Eighty percent of the total supply is available before launch, capped at $5M, creating a fair entry point for the community. Branded as the ‘standard for brain-rot finance,’ TOKEN6900 rejects the pretenses of traditional finance. There’s no roadmap, no promises, and no fake utility – just pure meme-fueled liquidity. Inspired by early 2000s internet culture, the project is themed as a parody of the S&P 500 and SPX6900, but with one extra token in supply. Its appeal lies in honesty. It doesn’t track markets, GDP, or oil reserves – it thrives on collective delusion as a feature, not a flaw. Investors aren’t here for fundamentals, they’re here for the cultural moment. Yesterday’s whale buy of $105K shows that even large holders are willing to back a project built on community momentum. $T6900 is feeding the current wave of speculative energy head-on. 3. Arctic Pablo ($APC) – A Mythical Meme Coin with Real Mechanics Arctic Pablo ($APC) combines meme coin culture with an ongoing adventure narrative. The project’s presale price is currently $0.0008, with over $3.3M raised so far. It has reached its 36th presale stage, known as Horizon Haven, and is aiming for a listing price of $0.008. Each stage represents a new chapter in Pablo’s journey, and the tokenomics include a weekly burn of unsold tokens to increase scarcity. The total supply is capped at 221.2B tokens. Early backers can access staking rewards of 66% APY during the first two months after launch, adding a yield component to the presale. This approach blends community engagement with a structured rollout. Recent whale activity in Bitcoin Hyper and TOKEN6900 shows there is appetite for early-stage projects with strong narratives and active presale performance. Arctic Pablo is benefiting from the same market sentiment. With Ethereum trading above $4,5K and investor interest in meme coins growing, the project’s mix of storytelling, staking, and scarcity is attracting attention ahead of its exchange debut. Riding the Whale Wave Whale buys in Bitcoin Hyper and TOKEN6900 are showing where big money is moving as Ethereum’s rally pushes sentiment higher. Arctic Pablo is also drawing attention, fueled by its narrative-driven presale and strong community momentum. Together, these projects cover the spectrum from high-speed Layer-2 tech to pure meme energy and story-backed scarcity. In a market charged with FOMO, they’re all positioned to benefit from early-stage hype. This is not financial advice.

On July 13, search interest stood at just 5 on Google’s scale of 0 to 100. By August 13, it is projected to hit 100, the highest level in at least a year, marking a 1,900% increase, according to Google Trends data retrieved by Finbold. Geographically, the United Arab Emirates recorded the highest interest with a score of 100, followed by New Zealand (92), India (62), Australia (42), and the United States (38). Global interest in buying Ethereum. Source: Google Trends It’s worth noting that search interest does not directly translate to buying activity. However, such spikes in online attention often precede periods of heightened market volatility. If the trend continues, Ethereum could face increased upward pressure, potentially testing key resistance levels in the near term. ETH price analysis This surge comes after Ethereum rallied past the $4,600 mark. As of press time, ETH traded at $4,618, up over 6% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset has gained 27%. ETH one-week stock price chart. Source: Finbold Additionally, technical setups suggest Ethereum could extend this momentum. Specifically, analysis by Gert van Lagen, shared in an X post on August 13, indicated that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has broken out of a four-year inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, potentially paving the way for a rally toward $22,000. Ethereum price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to the analyst, Ethereum is on track to complete its 2019–2025 bull market cycle with a textbook Expanding Diagonal formation. This bullish structure signals sustained upside potential if the pattern continues as expected. At the same time, for sustained momentum, Ethereum will likely require continued inflows from institutional investors through exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). In this regard, Coinglass data retrieved by Finbold on August 13 shows that Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $523.9 million in net inflows on August 12, led by BlackRock’s ETHA with $318.7 million and Fidelity’s FETH with $144.9 million. Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE products added $44.3 million and $9.3 million, respectively, while other issuers posted smaller gains. The previous day saw an even larger $1.02 billion inflow.

The initiative will begin with the inclusion of the RYT token—backed by a licensed traditional asset management company—into KuCoin’s Off-Exchange Settlement (OES) system. The integration will be phased in and adjusted based on market feedback. The partnership introduces tokenized units from the ""ChinaAMC USD Digital Money Market Fund,"" issued by China Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited, into KuCoin’s credit system. The effort marks an early attempt to bridge Web2 and Web3 assets by incorporating traditional fund-backed tokens into an exchange credit model. Introducing Collateral Use for Regulated RWA Tokens China Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of China Asset Management Co., Ltd., is among the first Chinese asset managers to operate overseas. The company issues the underlying assets for RYT, a tokenized representation of the ""ChinaAMC USD Digital Money Market Fund."" This fund is one of Asia’s first tokenized USD funds aimed at retail investors, with fund units that can be subscribed to and redeemed on-chain. Under the new mechanism, KuCoin users holding RYT will be able to apply for credit lines using the token as collateral. This approach combines secure collateralization with yield-generating assets, enabling users to treat RWA tokens similarly to other on-chain assets. In doing so, the exchange aims to diversify asset allocation and unlock leverage utility within compliant parameters. The RYT token’s asset structure has undergone compliance design, with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong serving as custodian, administrator, and registrar—reflecting a traditional financial framework adapted to on-chain environments. Statements from Leadership KuCoin CEO BC Wong stated: “KuCoin has always been committed to bridging traditional finance and the crypto world through innovation. This collaboration with AlloyX to explore RWA tokens as collateral mechanisms exemplifies our dedication to providing users with secure and compliant solutions. We emphasize trustworthiness and risk control—this partnership not only elevates the platform's innovation level but also delivers reliable asset appreciation opportunities to global users, helping them manage digital assets more confidently in dynamic markets.” AlloyX Co-Founder and CEO Thomas Zhu remarked: “Our focus has always been on how RWA, as an asset form, can deliver more authentic and sustainable economic functions on-chain. This cooperation with KuCoin is a pragmatic attempt centered on 'collateral mechanisms and scenario building,' not only offering users more possibilities for asset utilization but also providing the industry with opportunities for structural validation.” Shaping RWA Adoption Through Exchange Infrastructure The partnership reflects a broader industry trend toward recognizing the utility of tokenized traditional assets. By integrating a fund-backed token into an exchange’s credit system, KuCoin and AlloyX are laying the groundwork for future structural models, potentially influencing standards for asset issuers, platforms, and regulators. As institutional interest in RWA continues to grow, KuCoin has signaled that it will pursue additional collaborations to advance the application and liquidity of RWA assets on-chain. .Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to individuals briefed on the discussions, commercial passenger flights between the two countries might restart as early as next month. Bloomberg shared, the announcement could coincide with Modi’s planned visit to China later this month for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, his first trip there in seven years, where he is expected to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Air connections had been suspended since the Covid-19 pandemic began, alongside a rapid deterioration in relations triggered by a 2020 Himalayan border clash that left 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops dead. The move toward restoring flights comes after a major change in India’s trade position. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Indian products to 50 percent, penalizing New Delhi for continuing to purchase oil from Russia. He coupled the decision with sharp criticism, describing India’s economy as “dead” and calling its trade barriers “obnoxious.” Tariffs hit India’s economy hard The increased duties dealt a significant blow to India, whose largest trading partner is the U.S. Modi had earlier shown strong public support for Trump, even being one of the first foreign leaders to visit Washington following Trump’s return to the White House. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, China had already been moving to strengthen trade with India in anticipation of Washington’s tariff escalation Henry Wang, who leads the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said the current phase represents an “up cycle” in bilateral ties. As influential members of the Global South, he noted, “They have to really speak to each other.” Wang also said Washington’s tariff actions have reinforced India’s need to retain “strategic autonomy and strategic independence.” China, which has also faced Trump’s trade measures, has responded with gestures of cooperation. Earlier this month, Beijing loosened controls on fertilizer exports to India, the world’s top buyer of urea. Though shipments remain small, the trade could grow and help stabilize both supply and prices worldwide. Commercial cooperation may expand in other areas as well. Sources say Adani Group is in negotiations with Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD Co. to produce batteries in India, a move that would strengthen Adani’s clean-energy operations. Indian tourist visas for Chinese citizens restored On the travel side, the Indian government has recently reinstated tourist visas for Chinese visitors after years of restrictions. China is still India’s second-largest trading partner after the U.S., and provides vital components for India’s manufacturing industries. Nonetheless, mutual confidence is unlikely to return quickly. The two nations have been strategic competitors for decades, and tensions resurfaced earlier this year when China supplied Pakistan with arms and intelligence during its standoff with India. Ties with Washington have also cooled. Officials in New Delhi say part of Trump’s irritation stems from Modi publicly rejecting his claim to have mediated in an India-Pakistan dispute. Modi is said to have directly disputed that assertion in a June phone call, after which Indian officials noticed a shift in tone from the White House. At the same time, Modi is building closer links with other BRICS members . In August, he invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit India, despite U.S. objections to New Delhi’s ongoing purchases of discounted Russian oil. Earlier this month, India and Russia signed fresh trade-boosting agreements. Trade discussions have also progressed with Brazil. In July, Modi met President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia to focus on expanding commerce between the two countries. The two leaders agreed in an August call to broaden India’s trade pact with Mercosur, the South American trade bloc including Brazil.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis While only slightly in the green today, Bitcoin’s price action is bullish, which is great because it shows that the token is holding steady after a ~10% rally over the past couple of weeks. From a technical standpoint, today’s daily candle is sitting neatly inside yesterday’s high-low range. This ‘inside bar’ formation is a well-known trading pattern that often signals consolidation before a breakout. And if $BTC pushes above the range, it could spark a fresh wave of bullish momentum. Adding to the optimism, $BTC has once again bounced cleanly off its upward-sloping support trendline (orange in the chart) and remains firmly above key short-term EMAs like the 10 and 20. The recent calm after such a strong rally often marks the accumulation phase, where institutions quietly open fresh positions. If that’s the case here, Bitcoin could be on track to challenge – and possibly even break – new all-time highs within the week. Ethereum Bounces Back to $4,600, May Pave Way for ERC-20 Token Surge Like Bitcoin Hyper August 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Ethereum ($ETH) is showing no signs of slowing down as it breached the $4,600 level for the first time since 2021. Continued interest from institutional investors like BitMine Immersion and SharpLink helped push $ETH to its highest price yet this year. BitMine—the world’s largest Ethereum treasury—announced that it grew its $ETH holdings from 833,137 to 1,150,263 in only a week. Meanwhile, SharpLink revealed that it raised $400M from global institutional investors to stockpile more $ETH. This bullish sentiment on Ethereum could also help fuel demand for ERC-20 tokens, especially among $ETH investors looking to put a portion of their earnings into other promising projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This project aims to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2 that promises to make transactions faster and cheaper, while enabling $BTC to be used for things such as staking, trading, and interacting with dApps. Read our comprehensive guide on what Bitcoin Hyper is and what its plans are in more detail. 100K Token6900 & 150K Bitcoin Hyper Whale Buys Spark Investor FOMO August 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto whales made waves yesterday, scooping up 105K TOKEN6900 ($T6900) and 150K Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) in massive single-day buys. The combined haul signals growing conviction among deep-pocketed investors ahead of what many see as a volatile Q3. On-chain data shows the $T6900 accumulation came from two separate addresses, both linked to wallets that have previously timed market bottoms. Meanwhile, $HYPER’s latest whale inflow coincides with the project’s presale momentum, which has already captured the attention of retail traders hunting for high-growth altcoins. The timing is notable – Ethereum just broke above $4,5K for the first time since 2021, adding fuel to the market’s risk-on mood. Analysts suggest whales are positioning early in anticipation of a broader altcoin rally. If this buying pace holds, both TOKEN6900 and Bitcoin Hyper could see significant liquidity spikes in the weeks ahead, potentially setting the stage for sharp upside moves.

50021690,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=803835,1755079230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50021690.jpeg,"Two Forces Can Launch Bitcoin To $1 Million, Says Mike Novogratz",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/two-forces-bitcoin-to-1-million-mike-novogratz/,"Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin’s path to $1 million is powered by two engines—grassroots adoption and an unforgiving macroeconomic backdrop—and he would rather the ascent be measured than manic. “Bitcoin has two vectors that drive its valuation. One is adoption, right? How many people get orange-pilled? And the other is the macro environment,” the Galaxy CEO told Natalie Brunell in an August 12 interview on Coin Stories, adding that persistent fiscal profligacy across major economies remains a powerful tailwind. Novogratz Sees $1M Bitcoin Ahead Novogratz framed today’s market as the product of a decade of cultural and institutional conversion. On the cultural side, he argues that the social consensus around Bitcoin is now self-sustaining: “Some collection of first kooky people and then less kooky people and then all of us a little have successfully orange-pilled enough people that Bitcoin has value because we say it does.” On the institutional side, he singled out the moment the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager embraced the asset class. “There’s before Larry Fink and after Larry Fink,” he said, praising the conversion of a once-skeptical standard-bearer as the symbolic turning point: “He blessed it as a real asset and it’s on the screen of every macro trader in the world.” Related Reading: Bitcoin-Money Supply Link Is A Myth, Glassnode Researcher Reveals The second engine is macro. Here Novogratz is blunt. He expects continued fiscal deterioration—regardless of political promises—to keep debasing fiat and, by extension, underwriting Bitcoin’s scarcity premium. “We have governments that can’t keep their pants on. They spend more money than they should… And you know what? The deficit’s going to be higher, not lower,” he said. In his telling, Bitcoin functions as both “report card” and governor on policymaking: the worse the stewardship, the stronger the bid for digital gold. The destination, in his view, is not in doubt. The route matters. “I think we will get to a million. I just hope we get there slowly,” Novogratz said. A disorderly sprint to seven figures, he warned, would likely reflect domestic or global dislocation: “People that cheer for the million-dollar Bitcoin price next year… it only gets there if we’re in such a [shitty] place domestically.” He prefers a glide path where adoption compounding meets macro drift, not panic. That stance informs his take on Bitcoin’s role and narrative. He wants Bitcoin to “stay in its lane” as digital gold—“the blockchain tailor-made for money”—and resists efforts to make it all things to all use cases. “The narrative is so clean when you say it’s digital gold,” he said, arguing that clarity invites the broadest acceptance from institutions and the public. That clarity has already translated into infrastructure: spot ETFs and traditional-market rails that deepen liquidity and lower frictions for allocators. Liquidity, he noted, has scaled to the point where even very large transfers can be absorbed with limited impact. Without naming the client, he acknowledged Galaxy’s execution of a high-profile sale of 80,000 BTC in the interview and observed that “the market held up very well… it barely made a blip.” For him, the episode illustrates the maturing of Bitcoin’s market structure—precisely the condition needed for large treasuries, lenders, and derivatives desks at “traditional firms [that] are going to start by lending against Bitcoin and Ethereum” to participate without destabilizing prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retraces Below $120,000: Is Coinbase Selling To Blame? Cycle-wise, Novogratz still sees room to run, though he is watching for signs of froth. “We’re getting five calls a week on new… balance sheet companies. At one point that’s what bubbles feel like,” he said. Even so, his “gut feeling” is for “one more leg up” with a potential ramp into the fourth quarter, helped by perceptions of an increasingly dovish Federal Reserve. He also reminded listeners that “the last gasp of the bull market is often the most violent upward… and we’re not there yet.” Despite his decades as a macro trader, Novogratz anchors his own crypto allocation with conservative asymmetry: “People ask me all the time… I’ve been roughly 70/30—70% Bitcoin, 30% other.” For newcomers outside crypto, he now sees room for materially higher exposure than in years past, citing the industry’s maturation. But all roads, in his framing, still lead back to Bitcoin’s dual-engine thesis: broaden the tent and let macro do the rest. “Adoption means orange-pilling people,” he said. “The more people we have bringing people into the tent, the price goes up.” The macro engine is unlikely to stall any time soon. The combination, he argues, is what ultimately propels Bitcoin to seven figures—ideally by steady climb, not crisis. At press time, BTC traded at $119,743.

The token has surged nearly 12% in just two days and is now charging toward its July highs. However, the road ahead isn’t without hurdles. $DOGE has entered a key resistance zone (highlighted by the blue box on the chart), which is the same range from which it tumbled 45% in May. Even if the current momentum clears this area, the next challenge will be breaking the upper boundary of a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. On the bright side, short-term momentum indicators like the EMAs and RSI are both trending upward, reinforcing the short-term bullish case. All in all, the overall verdict here is that while investors can enjoy the upside for now, they must tread with caution, keeping significant long-term resistances in mind. $ETH’s 4.6K Rally Sends Doge Higher as Maxi Doge Presale Gains Traction August 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Ethereum’s surge past $4.6K for the first time in four years is driving a fresh wave of risk-on sentiment across crypto markets.

50021741,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78154,1755079242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,From $0.035 to $1? Why Some ADA and SOL Insiders Are Predicting This Token Will Outpace the Market Before 2027,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-035-to-1-why-some-ada-and-sol-insiders-are-predicting/,"Investors who have followed the rise of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) understand the transformative impact that Layer-2 scaling solutions bring to blockchain ecosystems. These enhancements dramatically increase transaction speeds, reduce costs, and open the door to mass adoption. Now, insiders in the ADA and SOL communities are turning their attention to a promising newcomer: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This project is building to leverage Layer-2 technology to create a decentralized lending and borrowing platform paired with a unique stablecoin and an innovative buy-and-distribute mechanism. These elements position MUTM not just as a utility token, but as a serious contender with the potential to outpace many established players by 2027. Layer-2 Power Meets Real-World DeFi Utility The foundation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal lies in its use of Layer-2 scalability. Unlike many Layer-1 blockchains struggling with network congestion and high fees, MUTM’s Layer-2 integration will deliver near-instant transactions with minimal costs. This infrastructure improvement is vital for decentralized finance, where rapid and affordable interactions are essential for user adoption and protocol efficiency. ADA and SOL investors recognize these technical advantages because they have witnessed how scaling solutions helped those ecosystems evolve from niche projects into widely used platforms. Beyond technical upgrades, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a robust suite of DeFi utilities that address real user needs. Its lending and borrowing system allows users to lock collateral—such as ETH—and borrow a stablecoin that always aims to stay pegged at $1. This stablecoin is minted only against overcollateralized loans, with strict issuer limits and governance controls to manage systemic risk carefully. This design helps maintain price stability and reduces the chance of sudden devaluation, which is crucial for institutional-grade finance products. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s buy-and-distribute model further differentiates it from typical DeFi projects. Once lending and borrowing operations generate revenue, part of the income will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed as rewards to users staking mtTokens, creating a powerful cycle of demand and incentive that supports token price growth over the long term. This mechanism combines real economic activity with tokenomics, giving MUTM a solid foundation for sustainable value appreciation. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $14.3 million and counts more than 15,100 holders. Around 15% of the total token supply is sold, and the price will rise from $0.035 to $0.040 in the next phase. This progression offers a timely entry point for investors who want to secure tokens at favorable prices before broader market exposure and institutional interest drive demand higher. To illustrate the potential upside, consider a conservative investment scenario: a $5,000 allocation in MUTM at $0.035 would purchase roughly 142,857 tokens. If MUTM reach the $1 mark by 2027, this holding would be worth approximately $142,000. Even more aggressive price targets, such as $5 or higher, remain in sight given the token’s utility, tokenomics, and upcoming exchange listings. Roadmap Milestones Set the Stage for Explosive Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s carefully structured roadmap gives investors confidence in its growth trajectory. Phase 2 focuses on engineering core smart contracts and UI/UX development with a strong emphasis on risk parameters and security reviews. These efforts will reassure larger investors and institutions that the protocol meets the highest standards. Phase 3 will introduce a beta testnet featuring liquidation mechanics, multi-firm audits, and exchange listing preparations. This stage will serve as a critical proof-of-concept, demonstrating MUTM’s real-world functionality and readiness for mass adoption. Investors with technical insight often value this phase as a turning point where speculative interest begins converting into tangible demand. Finally, Phase 4 will launch the full mainnet platform, token claims, and activate institutional partnership lanes. Planned listings on major exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken will unlock global demand and liquidity, dramatically increasing token accessibility and attracting new buyers worldwide. This institutional onboarding will mark MUTM’s transition from a promising project to a mature market player. Final Words The long-term growth potential for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aligns with the early trajectories of Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), both of which began with strong technical fundamentals, community support, and innovative scaling solutions. By combining Layer-2 speed and efficiency with solid DeFi use cases and a compelling tokenomics model, MUTM offers a credible roadmap to outpacing many existing altcoins over the next several years. For investors who have tracked ADA and SOL’s rise and now seek the next opportunity with real upside and solid fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a chance to position themselves ahead of the curve. The ongoing presale phase, currently priced at $0.035 with a forthcoming increase to $0.040, offers a limited window to enter before wider market recognition takes hold.

50021977,555102,1755079257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50021977.jpeg,"XRP–ISO 20022 Narrative Is A ‘Complete Charade,’ Warns Ex-Ripple Developer",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-iso-20022-complete-charade-ex-ripple-developer/,"A fresh flare-up over XRP’s oft-repeated “ISO 20022 compliance” claim is forcing a basic but consequential distinction back into view: Ripple, the private company that builds enterprise payment software, is not the XRP Ledger, the open, decentralized network that settles XRP transactions. The latest round was ignited by investor Jake Claver, who asserted that “before any other cryptocurrency, XRP prioritized… ISO 20022 compliance,” adding that “the network processes more than $434 billion in transactions every day,” and casting ISO 20022 as the bridge that will let Ripple “tokenize and transfer massive volumes of assets” across banking rails. Claver’s post went viral. It also drew a categorical rebuttal from Matt Hamilton, Ripple’s former Director of Developer Relations. XRP–ISO 20022 Claims Debunked Hamilton did not mince words. “XRP did not prioritise ISO20022 whatsoever. There is literally nothing in the XRP Ledger codebase or network that has anything at all to do with ISO20022. It has been entirely a charade perpetuated by scammers like yourself,” he wrote on August 12. The stark phrasing reprises a line he has taken for years against the meme of “ISO-compliant coins,” arguing that ISO 20022 is a financial messaging standard used by institutions—not a property a token can possess. The pushback did not stop there. After another account claimed that “to be able to initiate [ISO 20022], [cryptocurrencies] need to have an API and only selected few have that API ready,” Hamilton agreed with the premise about messaging but drew the same boundary line: “Correct. And the XRP Ledger does not have that API.” When a separate user argued that Ripple is a member of the ISO 20022 standards community and uses the format on RippleNet, “primarily for ODL,” Hamilton replied that such interoperability belongs to Ripple’s software stack , not to the ledger itself: “RippleNet can work with ISO20022 compliant messages. But the XRP Ledger has no such functionality.” Claver subsequently acknowledged that “the post should have said ‘ Ripple ’ in the first sentence,” accepting the core correction while defending the broader thesis that ISO 20022-aligned infrastructure can funnel value into crypto settlement layers. Hamilton wasn’t persuaded: “Replace ‘XRP’ with ‘Ripple’ and the tweet makes even less sense,” he countered, objecting to the leap from enterprise messaging alignment to claims about tokenization and XRP’s role by default. Underneath the social-media heat is a definitional point the industry has struggled to communicate. ISO 20022 is an international methodology and data dictionary for financial messages—think payments, securities, trade, FX—that enables richer, structured, machine-readable payloads across banks and market infrastructures. It standardizes how messages are modeled and carried, not how value is represented on a blockchain. That is why standards bodies and market infrastructures— SWIFT for cross-border payments , central banks for high-value domestic rails—speak about ISO 20022 in terms of message schemas, migration timelines, and coexistence windows, not tokens. That context also explains why Ripple’s corporate announcements reference ISO 20022 at the network-integration layer. Ripple joined the ISO 20022 Registration Management Group in 2020, billing itself as the first DLT-focused participant and positioning RippleNet’s single API and data model to interoperate with banks’ ISO-native flows. None of that turns the asset into an “ISO-compliant coin,” because compliance, in this domain, attaches to message formats, systems integration, and operational processes. None of this means XRP cannot be used in workflows that originate from ISO 20022-formatted instructions. Hamilton himself has repeatedly said anyone can make payments on the ledger, and that RippleNet can translate ISO 20022 messages into whatever internal calls are needed to orchestrate settlement, including ODL-style flows that source and settle liquidity with the token. What he objects to is the rhetorical shortcut that collapses corporate messaging compliance into token-level attributes, particularly when it is leveraged to imply privileged regulatory status or inevitable valuation upside.

The post revealed that Crypto.com will provide XRP yield through Flare Networks. While this move is yet to be fully noticed by the market, the announcement describes a new opportunity for XRP holders and a closer link between the ecosystems. BREAKING: @cryptocom is going to provide $XRP yield through FLARE!! YOU ARE NOT BULLISH ENOUGH ON $FLR !! https://t.co/HA2clKk5Rv — 𝕂𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕂𝕒𝕣𝕒𝕟 (@KingKaranCrypto) August 12, 2025 Understanding Flare and XRP Flare is a blockchain network that enables smart contract functionality for assets that do not natively support it, such as XRP. Built with Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, it allows these assets to interact with decentralized applications and participate in DeFi markets. This is achieved without requiring changes to the original blockchain of the asset, making it an important tool for expanding utility. XRP is widely used for fast, low-cost international transactions. While it has built a strong reputation in cross-border payment solutions , it lacks built-in smart contract capabilities. Flare bridges that limitation, giving XRP holders access to features traditionally reserved for Ethereum-compatible tokens. The Mechanics of XRP Yield via Flare The information shared includes access to XRP restaking via Flare on Crypto.com. Restaking generally involves using staked assets to secure additional protocols , generating further returns. In this case, XRP holders would be able to place their assets in a Flare-powered environment that enables yield generation while maintaining exposure to XRP itself. This development means XRP can now be utilized in more complex DeFi strategies without leaving its original network. It expands the earning potential for holders, making the asset more than just a medium for fast transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The yield mechanism could also serve as a retention incentive for investors who may otherwise move funds to assets with higher earning capabilities. Why This Is Positive for XRP Yield opportunities can significantly influence asset demand. Until now, XRP’s utility was primarily centered on payments and liquidity provision within Ripple’s ecosystem. With Flare integration, it has gained a new role in the broader DeFi economy. The fact that this feature will be available through Crypto.com increases its impact. As a globally recognized exchange, it can offer easy access to millions of users, removing technical barriers that might prevent participation in on-chain yield programs. This evolution is a game-changer for XRP and could attract users who value passive income generation alongside liquidity and speed.

Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, recently announced a significant expansion for its users. They are introducing new Binance perpetual contracts for two intriguing tokens: AIO and XNY. This development is set to go live very soon, offering traders an incredible opportunity to engage with these assets using up to 50x leverage. This move signals Binance’s continuous effort to provide diverse and dynamic trading options for its vast user base, allowing for potent strategies in the fast-paced digital asset market. What Are Binance Perpetual Contracts and 50x Leverage? Understanding the core concepts is crucial before diving into these new opportunities. A perpetual contract is a type of futures contract without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, you can hold them indefinitely, as long as you meet the margin requirements. This flexibility makes them popular in the volatile crypto market. Binance’s introduction of these contracts for AIO and XNY means traders can speculate on their price movements without owning the underlying asset directly. Furthermore, the 50x leverage offering is a powerful tool. Leverage allows you to trade with more capital than you physically possess. For instance, with 50x leverage, a $100 investment can control a position worth $5,000. While this amplifies potential profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. Therefore, approaching crypto leverage trading with a clear understanding of its mechanics and risks is absolutely essential. Diving Into AIO and XNY Contracts: What You Need to Know Binance confirmed that the AIO/USDT perpetual contracts will become available on August 13 at 11:30 UTC. Shortly after, the XNY/USDT perpetual contracts will launch at 11:45 UTC on the same day. Both AIO and XNY tokens are already listed on Binance Alpha, indicating their established presence within the Binance ecosystem. The availability of these new AIO XNY contracts on the perpetual futures market provides a fresh avenue for traders to engage with these specific digital assets. For traders looking to diversify their portfolio or capitalize on specific market trends, these new additions offer compelling possibilities. It is important to research AIO and XNY individually to understand their projects, use cases, and market dynamics before engaging in high-leverage trading. Due diligence remains paramount in any investment decision, especially in the cryptocurrency space. Navigating High-Risk, High-Reward: Understanding Perpetual Futures The allure of 50x leverage is undeniable, promising significant returns on even small price movements. However, this level of leverage also introduces substantial risk. A small adverse price swing can lead to rapid liquidation of your position, resulting in the loss of your entire initial margin. This makes risk management strategies incredibly important when trading perpetual futures . Key considerations for managing risk include: Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss to limit potential losses. Position Sizing: Do not over-allocate capital to a single trade, especially with high leverage. Market Volatility: Be aware that crypto markets are highly volatile, and prices can change quickly. Education: Continuously educate yourself on market analysis and trading strategies. Responsible trading is not just about chasing gains; it is fundamentally about protecting your capital. Getting Started with Binance Trading for Perpetual Contracts If you are keen to explore these new Binance trading opportunities, here are some actionable steps. First, ensure you have an active and verified Binance account. Next, familiarize yourself with the Binance Futures interface, which is separate from the spot trading platform. You will need to transfer funds to your futures wallet to begin trading perpetual contracts. Binance provides extensive tutorials and guides on its platform to help users understand futures trading. It is highly recommended to utilize these resources, perhaps even starting with a demo account if available, to practice strategies without real financial risk. Remember, knowledge is your strongest asset in this dynamic environment. In summary, Binance’s launch of AIO and XNY perpetual contracts with up to 50x leverage presents an exciting, albeit high-risk, opportunity for crypto traders. While the potential for amplified gains is significant, the importance of understanding leverage, conducting thorough research on AIO and XNY, and implementing robust risk management strategies cannot be overstated. Approach these new trading instruments with caution, informed decisions, and a commitment to continuous learning to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of crypto futures.
