Hayes began his essay by setting a vivid scene from Japan’s Hokkaido ski resorts, likening dangerous backcountry conditions caused by insufficient snow cover over sharp bamboo grass (sasa) to potential market obstacles that could cut short crypto rallies. He observes that 2025 has kicked off amid robust snowfall in Hokkaido—an apt metaphor for what he sees as a liquidity “dumping” that could propel digital asset prices upward. Nonetheless, he warns that the political and fiscal environment in the United States may introduce unexpected hazards. Why March Could Mark The Next Peak For Crypto “As we begin 2025, the question on crypto investors’ minds is whether the Trump pump can continue,” Hayes writes, referencing the initial optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s second term. While Hayes believes “the high expectations for policy action out of the Trump camp set up the market for disappointment,” he maintains that any short-term negativity could be offset by a powerful “dollar liquidity impulse.” Related Reading: Crypto Trader Nets $17 Million From AI Coins: Here’s What He’s Buying Now Hayes underscores that the Fed’s RRP has been critical for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Since the third quarter of 2022, the facility’s unwinding has correlated positively with crypto and equities prices. “Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 when the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) reached its zenith,” he explains, noting that US Treasury Secretary Janet “Bad Gurl” Yellen facilitated a shift from issuing longer-dated coupon bonds to issuing shorter-dated T-bills. This approach, he argues, effectively drained more than $2 trillion from the RRP, injecting liquidity into global markets. Now, with the RRP falling to almost zero, the Fed has “belatedly changed the policy rate of the RRP” to make it less attractive. Hayes points out that it still represents a potential $237 billion injection into markets once the remaining RRP funds move into higher-yielding Treasury bills. Meanwhile, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) removes $60 billion per month, totaling $180 billion between January and March. Netting both factors yields a $57 billion injection over the quarter. Another major focus in Hayes’s thesis is the Treasury General Account. As debt ceiling negotiations loom, the Treasury’s inability to issue new debt means it can only cover expenses by spending down the TGA—an action that releases liquidity. “Because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling, the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account, the TGA,” Hayes writes, noting that the balance stands at around $722 billion. Related Reading: This Week’s Top Crypto Catalysts: What Investors Need To Watch He estimates that without a debt ceiling resolution, the TGA could be exhausted by May or June. For crypto markets, the crux of the matter is the timescale for a deal in Congress. The essay highlights Trump’s narrow majority and the likelihood that Republicans who position themselves as fiscally conservative will not grant quick or easy consent. Democrats, Hayes adds, are unlikely to facilitate enabling more spending for a president they oppose—further fueling legislative brinkmanship. According to Hayes’s calculations, TGA drawdowns could release an additional $555 billion from January through March. If combined with the $57 billion net liquidity from the Fed’s RRP and QT adjustments, total dollar liquidity could rise by as much as $612 billion in the first quarter. Hayes zeroes in on March as the critical juncture—when this liquidity surge might begin to wane and expectations for new federal spending or pro-crypto legislation from the Trump administration may not materialize on schedule. “I believe I answered the question I posed at the outset. That is, the sasa of a letdown by team Trump on his proposed pro-crypto and pro-business legislation can be covered by an extremely positive dollar liquidity environment,” he states, before concluding that peak liquidity could subside quickly once the market anticipates the debt ceiling’s resolution and the subsequent refilling of the TGA. From a historical lens, Hayes cites Bitcoin’s price action in 2024, which peaked in mid-March around $73,000, then drifted sideways and tumbled just before the April 15 tax deadline. The reasoning, he suggests, is straightforward: as soon as TGA spending has run its course, the net positive liquidity picture reverts to neutral or negative, leaving risk assets vulnerable. While Hayes acknowledges that Chinese credit expansion, Bank of Japan interest rate policies, and the Trump administration’s potential dollar devaluation strategy against other major currencies or gold could upend his timeline, he trusts that RRP and TGA mechanics are reliable near-term gauges. Crucially, these twin sources of liquidity appear powerful enough to overshadow any disappointment about Trump’s policies until at least the end of March. “None of these major macroeconomic issues can be known a priori, but I have confidence in the math behind how the RRP and TGA balances will change over time,” he says, underscoring that the surging crypto and stock markets since late 2022 align with the massive drain in the RRP. Hayes concludes by suggesting that, historically, markets often provide significant selling opportunities in the first quarter. By springtime, investors might want to take profits and “chill on the beach” while waiting for improved liquidity conditions to re-emerge in the second half of the year. “Right on schedule, just like almost every other year, it will be time to sell in the late stages of the first quarter,” Hayes concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $101,344.

Join One of The Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today,https://thecoinrise.com/couldnt-jump-on-the-popcat-bandwagon-join-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-buy-today/,"If you’ve been anywhere near the crypto world recently, you’ve probably noticed one thing: meme coins are more than just a joke. They’re a cultural phenomenon, a chance to invest in something fun with explosive potential. Over the years, meme coins have turned everyday investors into millionaires, from Dogecoin’s viral rise to Shiba Inu’s domination of the market. And now, the buzz is all about BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new meme coin making waves with its jaw-dropping features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a referral program, and staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY. But hang on, what about POPCAT, the meme coin that went viral overnight? Let’s dive in and compare these two to see why BTFD Coin deserves the spotlight as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s Breaking All the Rules BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a full-blown ecosystem designed to reward investors from the moment they get in. The presale has been a masterclass in building FOMO, raising over $5 million so far and selling more than 63 billion coins to over 7,800 holders. With a starting price of just $0.000004, BTFD raced through its first 10 presale stages in just two weeks. Now in Stage 13, you can snag it for $0.000142, but don’t sleep on this—the final listing price is $0.0006, meaning there’s still a massive opportunity for early birds. Picture this: a Play-to-Earn game where you’re not just gaming but stacking up real-world rewards. BTFD’s Bulls Squad game brings NFTs to life with interactive gameplay that’s more than just pretty pictures. You collect, trade, and use these NFTs to earn $BTFD, making it a solid win-win for gamers and investors. Who needs regular games when you can make bank while having fun? Alright, let’s talk staking. At a staggering 90% APY, this isn’t just another staking pool. It’s a money machine. Every $1,000 staked could earn you $900 in a year, and that’s without touching the principal. Plus, the BTFD staking program is super easy to use, meaning you don’t need to be some blockchain wizard to start earning. Want to bring your friends along for the ride? With BTFD’s referral program, you can earn extra tokens for every person you convince to join. It’s like getting paid to help your buddies level up—how cool is that? Here’s where it gets juicy. Imagine you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin. That’d get you about 52,816,901 $BTFD. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash would be worth a staggering $31,690. That’s a 322% return. Tell me, where else can you get returns like that? POPCAT (POPCAT): The Viral Challenger POPCAT is another meme coin that’s been turning heads lately, but it’s playing a slightly different game. Launched with a bang thanks to its viral marketing campaigns, POPCAT has quickly captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, especially those who love its playful homage to internet culture. The coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity. POPCAT’s creators leaned into its meme-worthy origins, using the famous Popcat meme to spark curiosity. Think of it as Dogecoin’s cheeky cousin—cute, relatable, and undeniably viral. And while it’s undoubtedly fun, the question remains: Does it have the depth to go the distance? Unlike BTFD, POPCAT doesn’t offer a robust ecosystem. Sure, it’s fun to hold and watch your portfolio grow when the market gets hyped, but the lack of tangible use cases—like staking or a P2E game—makes it more of a speculative play. That said, its community is passionate, and in crypto, that can sometimes be enough. Crypto analysts are mixed on POPCAT. While some see potential for short-term gains due to its viral nature, others warn of its lack of utility and staying power. Current forecasts suggest modest growth if the hype continues, but it’s not offering the kind of returns BTFD is projected to deliver. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to jump in?

From its 90% APY staking to the Bulls Squad, P2E game, it’s building a meme coin ecosystem that delivers real value, not just laughs. Add to that its referral program and stellar presale performance, and it’s clear why BTFD is topping the charts as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. The window to get in at a discounted price is closing fast. With the presale already in Stage 13 and a listing price of $0.0006 around the corner, the time to act is now.

Ethereum price analysis suggests a potentially significant shift, as the symmetrical triangle formation on the chart may either surge to $3,980 or fall to $2,920, drawing keen interest from market watchers. In the meantime, the Dogecoin price remains near the critical $0.300 mark, leading to discussions on whether it can rebound if this level remains intact. BlockDAG (BDAG) is on an upward path with its Refer & Earn program, which rewards users with 6% to 10% USDT cashback on each transaction, with no limit to how much they can earn. BlockDAG’s impressive presale, which gathered over $176.5 million, along with its scalable rewards and potential for high returns, firmly establishes it among the best crypto to buy right now! Dogecoin Price Stable Amid Potential for Upward Movement The Dogecoin price has recently fallen by 23% over ten days but now teeters at the pivotal $0.300 support. Observers are watching to see if this marks a temporary decline or a move to lower levels. Current trading suggests an effort to maintain the $0.300 level, which could indicate an impending bullish shift if it holds. Trader Tradigrade’s insights on X point to a potential recovery for Dogecoin price, with signs of an upward trend on the horizon. If the price remains above its 20-day EMA, it could draw renewed buying interest, possibly leading to a price increase. However, a drop below $0.300 might trigger increased selling pressure, marking a critical moment for DOGE. Ethereum Price Analysis Indicates a Possible Major Shift Significant attention is on Ethereum price analysis as it currently navigates a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. Technical analyst Carl Runefelt’s recent X post suggests a likely substantial movement. Ethereum price analysis forecasts either a push to $3,980 or a decline to $2,920. The price stabilization around $3,419 shows resilience despite market fluctuations, with critical levels at $3,300 support and $3,550 resistance. The outcome of this pattern could define Ethereum’s immediate market direction, with anticipation building around these pivotal points. BlockDAG’s Cashback Rewards Through Its Refer & Earn Program BlockDAG has revamped the way users benefit with its Refer & Earn USDT system, offering immediate cashback that ranks as one of the most beneficial in the cryptocurrency sphere. Referrers get a 6% cashback on their first referral transaction, which increases to 10% for any additional purchases within the next 24 hours. Buyers also enjoy a steady 6% cashback, ensuring rewards for everyone involved. Since its launch, BlockDAG has collected over $176.5 million from its presale and has distributed over 17.7 billion coins. Currently, each BDAG is valued at $0.0248, providing an impressive 2,380% ROI to early participants. The Refer & Earn system allows unlimited referral rewards with immediate USDT payouts, making it a seamless opportunity for earning. The structure of the referral program is clear-cut, resetting daily at 00:00 UTC to ensure fairness and transparency. The time-sensitive nature of these increased cashback rates has led to strong engagement as users take advantage of the growing rewards for repeated transactions. As the 27th presale batch of BlockDAG nears a sellout, its mix of affordability, community-focused incentives, and scalable rewards mark it as a leading choice among cryptocurrency ventures. The strong metrics from BlockDAG’s performance, combined with the lucrative referral program, highlight it as one of the best cryptos to buy right now for those looking for significant rewards and cashback opportunities. The Bottom Line The crypto market wraps up the fourth quarter with cautious optimism and promising opportunities. Ethereum price analysis points to a crucial moment, with its current symmetrical triangle pattern suggesting a possible major price shift. This could lead to a significant rise to $3,980 or a fall to $2,920, shaping its short-term direction. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price stays in the spotlight, maintaining around the $0.300 support level, with ongoing debates about its potential rise or further drop. BlockDAG continues to draw interest with its interesting Refer & Earn program, known for its unmatched cashback rewards and enhancing its status as the best crypto to buy right now . As 2025 nears, BlockDAG offers numerous opportunities for traders to explore as they strategize on maximizing their returns.

If the U.S. digital assets exchange can get the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to take its appeal and agree that the SEC was wrong about its accusations that Coinbase improperly handled the trading of unregistered securities, such a decision would echo throughout the wider crypto industry. Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York decided on Tuesday to approve a request from Coinbase to ask the higher court to consider one core question in the dispute, in a process known as an interlocutory appeal. And while Coinbase is chasing that matter, the rest of the case will sit idle. Failla noted she doesn't appreciate the company's ""efforts to cast aspersions on the SEC’s approach to crypto-assets,"" but she pointed out the clash in rulings from different federal courts on similar questions and decided that ""conflicting decisions on an important legal issue necessitate the Second Circuit’s guidance."" At the heart of the legal clash between the U.S. securities regulator and the leading U.S. crypto exchange is whether certain tokens traded on the platform should be considered securities, and thus be seen as breaching the law. Coinbase has argued, among other points, that the issuers of crypto tokens traded on its secondary market don't owe anything to the buyers, so the tokens don't tick the boxes of the legal standard for what makes a security, the so-called Howey test. The judge said she's granting the April 2024 request ""because it presents a controlling question of law regarding the reach and application of Howey to crypto-assets, about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and the resolution of which would advance the ultimate termination of the SEC’s enforcement action."" ""We appreciate the court's careful consideration,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal posted on social-media site X . ""On to the Second Circuit we go.""

In the end, this and other court disputes over what constitutes a crypto security could head toward the Supreme Court but finally run into irrelevance if Congress passes a new law to define how the assets and their trading should be regulated in the U.S. That's what the industry is aiming for with its political operations and lobbying efforts, focusing on steering this year's new Congress toward more industry-friendly legislation. The SEC's leadership is also about to change hands to Republican control, which is likely to mean more openness to the crypto industry.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 22:42:00

The AI firm also reportedly closed a deal with Panasonic to integrate its artificial intelligence models into the legacy electronics maker’s products. Artificial Intelligence firms had a strong year in 2024, and they look to have picked up the pace already in 2025. AI has become an umbrella that can include so many specialties and disciplines. AI Agents now operate X (formerly Twitter) accounts, can solve complex issues, and some, like Anthropic’s Claude, can browse Chrome as a human would. Anthropic is the latest beneficiary of the FOMO as it steals some of the shine from global leaders like OpenAI and Gemini. Panasonic teams up with Anthropic to release AI-enhanced family wellness coaching app Panasonic announced its partnership with Anthropic during the CES 2025 event. The app will be called Umi, and it is designed to help family members “care, coordinate, and connect” with one another. It is also supposed to help the family as a whole set goals like spending mealtime together or being more physically active, creating routines, and managing communal tasks. The user can preset goals via the app’s natural language voice interface. Panasonic reportedly aims for the app’s target audience to be families with members of all ages. The company stated during its CES demo that Umi can easily support caregivers by keeping them informed of the habits of elderly family members. Claude will not have autonomy over recommending advice because Panasonic plans to incorporate a wide range of wellness experts to help users establish and maintain healthy habits and routines. Umi will reportedly hit US markets later this year. Panasonic will make the app available to other members of its Panasonic Well’s Partner Collective, including Aaptiv, Precision Nutrition, SleepScore Labs, Addition Wealth, BlueApron, and Calm, so it is likely users will see its AI capabilities integrated into related products as well. The electronics company also plans to integrate Claude into other customer-facing systems like customer service, sales, and marketing. Panasonic also introduced its new “Panasonic Go” initiative, which is supposed to fast-track “AI-driven innovation” within the company. The firm has what some users on X have called ambitious plans, as it expects 30% of its revenue to come from “AI-driven hardware, software, and solution businesses” by 2030. Anthropic in advanced talks to raise $2 billion According to a Tuesday WSJ report , the AI startup is in advanced talks to raise $2 billion in a deal that would raise its valuation to $60 billion. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, revealed in 2023 it had secured a $500 million investment from Alphabet, which promised to invest another $1.5 billion over time. Amazon has also now invested a total of about $8 billion into Anthropic, with the latest investment being an immediate pledge of $1.25 billion, with the remaining $2.75 billion in funding expected to arrive this year. Amazon has serious stakes in the AI firm. Anthropic named Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. It is also using AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its models. This new investment means Amazon retains its minority stake in the startup. In November 2024, Anthropic revealed its model context protocol. It is a flagship product that allows Claude to integrate with tools like Google Maps and Google Calendar, meaning it can create an app or chatbot to take care of tasks like locating lunch spots, scheduling meetings, or even making restaurant reservations, according to Mike Barret, founder and chief strategy officer at ad agency Supernatural AI. “Anthropic is finding ways to make their AI more useful,” Barret said. This development pushes the company closer to making large language models more than just information providers but also doers that can take actionable steps across platforms.

A widely followed business survey data release, meanwhile, came in stronger-than-expected, suggestive that the dominant US service sector remains in rude health. As traders upped their bets on continued US economic strength, higher inflation ahead and fewer rate cuts from the Fed, long-term US bond yields jumped, with the US 10-year hitting its highest levels since April 2024 near 4.7%. That weighed on risk assets across the board – high yields in the market’s benchmark “risk free” asset tends to weigh on assets, and the riskier these assets are viewed, the more they are likely to decline. That explains why major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , which many traders view as a risk/liquidity play, are so sensitive to macro repricing events like this. With the Ethereum price now down roughly 10% from Monday’s highs in the mid-$3,700s, traders are asking is a new price collapse is here. Will Ethereum soon dump below $3,000, threatening an end to the post-Trump election victory bull run? Will Macro Headwinds Drive Ethereum Price Under $3,000? Macro has certainly been a major headwind to the crypto market, and broader risk assets, since the Fed’s hawkish policy meeting in mid-December. The central bank is clearly now more sensitive now to data that implies stickiness in inflation and economic strength, as Tuesday’s data did. The argument for more rate cuts in 2025 is increasingly weak, and could yet weaken further if Friday’s official US jobs report for December also comes in stronger than expected. That could add to the current market headwinds, and keep major cryptocurrencies, like the Ethereum price, on the defensive. In the medium-term, its tough to argue that easing liquidity conditions will be a major tailwind for crypto in 2025. The Fed continues to shrink its balance sheet following its 2020/2021 QE splurge. And indices of US liquidity show conditions have been broadly unchanged since around mid-2022. Arthur Hayes USD Liquidity Index , which is calculated by taking the Fed’s balance sheet minus the US Treasury General Account balance at the NY Fed plus the amount of accepted reverse repo bids at the NY Fed, shows US liquidity of currently around $6 trillion, still well below its late 2021 peaks in the $7 trillion region. US economic conditions, at least how they seem right now, likely mean the Fed won’t embark on substantial easing, and liquidity will likely remain around current levels in 2025. Analysts expecting 2025 to be a repeat of the kinds of moves seen during 2020/2021’s zero interest rate/QE fueled bull run may be left disappointed. All said, should financial conditions continue to tighten (seen by a further rise in US yields), then yes, Ethereum could certainly crash back below $3,000 in the short-term. But does a lack of incoming liquidity in 2025 mean the bull market is dead? Probably not. Here’s why. Ethereum Under $3,000, Buy The Dip? If the Ethereum price was to dump below $3,000 in the short-term, this could be a great opportunity for investors to accumulate more aggressively. Yes, liquidity conditions right now aren’t likely to be a big tailwind for crypto in 2025, but that could change in the coming years. More important, however, is the upcoming pro-crypto shift in the regulatory and adoption landscape in the US this year. Simply put, the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration is set to usher in a new golden age for the US crypto industry and markets more broadly. The US might be on the cusp of the establishment of an official Bitcoin reserve , which could kickstart a global race to accumulate the asset. This would be a huge headwind to the whole market. And even if that doesn’t happen, the Trump administration is packed with pro-crypto advocates that are set to create a better environment in the US for innovation and growth. 13 days until Gary Gensler steps down. 13 days until the most pro-crypto administration in history takes office. Trump’s cabinet is set to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital of the world.' Here’s everything you need to know about it pic.twitter.com/xVJLnzOoLN — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) January 7, 2025 Most importantly, anti-crypto zealot SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to leave the agency in under two weeks, and Trump’s proposed replacement is expected to end the agency’s crusade to destroy the industry. INTEL: Gary Gensler will step down as SEC Chair in 13 days — Solid Intel (@solidintel_x) January 7, 2025 This is particularly good news for the altcoin sector, which was hit hardest by the SEC’s regulation by enforcement drive in recent years. Trump and his family are also known supporters of Ethereum, owning the crypto in substantial amounts, and even launching a token on its blockchain. So yes, liquidity might not be a major factor this year, but 2025 could be crypto’s best-ever year in terms of gaining broader adoption and acceptance. Ethereum’s position as the only major altcoin with a spot ETF in the US, BlackRock’s anointed altcoin of choice, and the still undisputed kind of DeFi sets it up for a strong year.

Tokyo-based SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Japan’s SBI Group, has announced an agreement with a community of Solana supporters on the archipelago to give away an exclusive Solana-based NFT. SBI to give away Solana NFT to wallet holders The financial giant has agreed to give an NFT “present” to users of its SBI Web3 Wallet, with the aim of promoting the growth of Solana in Japan in 2025, in a joint campaign with Solana Superteam Japan , which is supported by the Solana foundation. The campaign is currently active and lasts until January 20th. “New Year NFT Present Campaign” Source: SBI Holdings. According to SBI’s press release (translated by Google): “This NFT represents the construction of the Web3 world centered on the Solana economy with a fortress-like structure, and the first sunrise viewed from the structure represents the dawn of a new Web3.” The NFT was designed by Solana Superteam Japan. Interestingly, the design is somewhat dystopian in appearance, with what appears to be “TOKYO STUPID GAMES” written in orange on the underside of the fortress balcony. SBI’s Web3 Wallet allows users in Japan to trade NFTs using Japanese yen, opening the market even to those who are not crypto-savvy. While the news is indeed bullish for fans of SBI and Solana, there are some caveats. Anons, true NFT degens, and fans of permissionless peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in the nation can count themselves out, as SBI’s Web3 Wallet requires an SBI VC Trade account, identification documents, and a stringent KYC (know-your-customer) process. For Solana fans looking for fun, volatile speculation, or just a middle finger to everyone (including themselves?), Fartcoin might be a better option for the new year.

WEMIX token prices since 2021. (Source: CoinGecko) The employees, some of whom still work at WeMade, are seeking damages of around $11 million. The group comprises members of the Wemade Tree subsidiary, WeMade’s former blockchain arm. The firm successfully developed WEMIX, which was first listed on crypto exchanges in 2020. WeMade then merged with WeMade Tree in February 2022.

They also claimed that the company had sent an email to the staffers “clearly promising them token compensation.” But WeMade’s attorney said that the plaintiffs’ claims centered on “a verbal contract” regarding token bonuses. However, the WeMade legal team denied that any such “verbal contract was concluded.” It also claimed the firm “only provided guidance” on “basic compensation plans.” The WeMade legal team lawyers said that “at the time, there were no established industry standards” for “firms to handle accounting conducted in crypto.” The same team said that “after discussing various matters at the company,” executives “realized that [crypto bonuses] would be burdensome” because “accounting standards were so unclear.” The WeMade legal team suggested the firm still intends to launch a WEMIX token bonus program “through consultation with company employees.” However, the plaintiffs said there had been a “criminal breach of trust” on the part of the company.

It’s vital to track the current positions of Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Hedera has recently reached a peak of about $0.40 but is now adjusting. Meanwhile, Toncoin price has slid below its average after hitting $7.20, but it’s expected to recover to around $6.20. In the spotlight, BlockDAG (BDAG) has captured the community’s attention with its proactive steps, highlighted in a recent AMA. The event showcased the launch of an incubator, a substantial grants program, and a new launchpad, among other initiatives. Dive into these developments to get a full grasp of the competitive edge BlockDAG is bringing to the table. Toncoin Price Outlook: A Dip Before a Potential Rise Toncoin price has been on a rollercoaster lately, dipping below its average after a peak at $7.20, hinting at a challenging road ahead. After a decline to $4.78, Toncoin fought back, climbing over $5.00 though still under the average thresholds. A surge above these levels could signal a bullish comeback. On the flip side, a drop beneath the 50-day SMA could ramp up sell-off actions, possibly driving its value down to $3.65. Currently, Toncoin trades around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past the average lines, possibly aiming for $6.20. If it sustains above these lines on the daily chart and overcomes the $6.50 barrier, the upward trend might kick back into gear. Hedera’s Price Movement: A Leap Over $0.40 Hedera’s price has recently surged past a crucial resistance after reaching near $0.40, suggesting the start of a potential upward trajectory. However, it still seeks further confirmation. Just days ago, Hedera bounced from its foundational level, making a significant breakout. The daily chart indicates the beginning of the fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci levels marking essential supports and resistances. After rallying from the 0.382 mark at $0.24, Hedera’s price soared 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI indicating rising momentum from previously high levels, keeping an eye on the Fibonacci resistances becomes essential for anticipating its next moves. BlockDAG Ignites the Blockchain Scene with New Growth Tools BlockDAG, an emerging leader in the layer-1 blockchain arena, has captured the spotlight with its latest AMA, positioning itself as a top trending crypto. This event showcased ambitious plans to enhance its ecosystem and spur development, echoing the early expansion seen in networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is forging ahead with a new launchpad designed to foster the creation of decentralized applications and other projects on the BlockDAG network. This platform is set to catalyze a wide array of initiatives, enhancing engagement and participation across the community. In a bold move, BlockDAG, in collaboration with Hacker Earth, will organize four significant hackathons in 2025, anticipated to attract over 15,000 developers and spark hundreds of projects. Additionally, a robust $10 million grants program is slated to begin in February, offering financial support from $5,000 to $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that meet the criteria. Moreover, an ambassador program is being launched to incorporate global representatives, and a strategic partnership with an incubator will provide mentorship, resources, and guidance, all aimed at propelling promising projects to success on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG’s recent milestones underscore its trajectory of progress. Its ongoing crypto presale has amassed over $176.5 million and distributed over 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in presale batch 27, early participants have seen a staggering 2380% ROI. These initiatives underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to building a robust ecosystem and shaping its path as a prime choice heading into 2025. Wrapping Up: BlockDAG Steals the Spotlight Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to be prominent in the domain of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently surpassing $0.40 and Toncoin price stabilizing around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s strategic endeavors, like the $10 million grants program, a global incubator, and a launchpad for new projects, that are enhancing its allure. The success of the project’s crypto presale , which raised $176.5 million and delivered an impressive 2380% ROI since its inception, positions BlockDAG as an attractive proposition as we move towards 2025. For those keen on engaging with a project that combines solid growth with extensive community involvement, staying updated on these top trending cryptos and grasping the market shifts are crucial.

More than that - the same software that can win the math olympics and write novels can also control physical robots, allowing one digital persona to operate across the digital and physical worlds. So yes, robots walking around your neighborhood, or working alongside you, will have consistent opinions and actions on X/Twitter, on prediction markets, and in the real world. But there’s a major gap. How do we integrate thinking machines into human society, from schools, hospitals, factories to our homes and daily life? Most of the systems we’ve built are for other humans and make strong assumptions of having a fingerprint, parents, and a birthdate, none of which are true for thinking machines. There is also broad uncertainty about how to regulate thinking machines - do we outlaw them, pause their development, or try to limit their ability to synthesize human-intelligible emotions (as in the European Union)? Which regional laws apply to a 200B parameter LLM running on a computer in low earth orbit, that’s controlling the actions of a trading bot, or a physical robot in the New York SEC office on Pearl Street? What is needed is a global system that supports financial transactions, allows humans and computers to come together to vote and set rules, is immutable and public, and is resilient. Fortuitously, thousands of innovators and developers have spent the last 16 years building exactly that - a parallel framework for decentralized governance and finance. From the very beginning, the point was to support “non-geographic communities experimenting with new economic paradigms” by building a system that “doesn't much care who it talks to” ( Satoshi 2/13/09 ). It’s now more clear what that meant - unlike the rest of the human-focused tech, financial, and regulatory stack, blockchains and smart contracts don’t much care if they are being used by humans or thinking machines, and gracefully accommodate all of us. For this reason, decentralized crypto networks offer the vital infrastructure that's needed to allow this burgeoning sector to flourish. The benefits will be tangible across healthcare, education and defense. Several hurdles will need to be overcome. Seamless human machine and machine machine collaboration is essential — especially in high-stakes environments such as transportation, manufacturing, and logistics. Smart contracts enable autonomous machines to discover one another, communicate securely, and form teams to complete complex tasks. Presumably, low latency data exchange (e.g. among robot taxis) will happen off chain, for example in virtual private networks, but the steps leading up to that, such as discovering humans and robots able to drive you to the airport, are well suited for decentralized markets and actions. Scaling solutions such as Optimism will be critical to accommodate these transactions and traffic. The fragmented regulations around the world is another factor slowing innovation. While some jurisdictions such as Ontario are ahead of the curve when it comes to autonomous robotics, most are not. Decentralized governance tackles this by establishing programmable, blockchain-based rule sets that deliver much-needed uniformity. Creating global standards for safety, ethics and operations is critical for ensuring that autonomous robots can be rolled out across borders at scale, without compromising safety or compliance. Decentralized autonomous organizations, otherwise known as DAOs, help accelerate research and development in robotics and AI. Traditional sources of funding are both slow and siloed, holding the industry back. Token-based models such as DeSci DAO platform remove these bottlenecks, while giving everyday investors potential incentives to get involved. Likewise, some of the developing business models for AI involve micropayments and sharing of revenue with data- or model- providers, which can be accommodated with smart contracts. Combined, these advantages will help fast-track the development of autonomous robots, with a plethora of compelling use cases. A new paradigm for robotics and thinking machines It’s easy to fear that cognition is a zero sum game, and that the broad availability of smart machines will directly compete with humans. But the reality is that there are severe shortages of well educated humans in education, healthcare, and many other sectors. Research by UNESCO recently revealed a worldwide teacher shortage that there's an ""urgent need for 44 million primary and secondary teachers worldwide by 2030"" — and that's before you consider the assistants who offer one-on-one support in classrooms and help struggling students to keep up with their peers. Autonomous robots can deliver huge advantages here, tackling significant shortages across the education sector. Imagine a child being able to learn about a complicated concept with a robot sitting next to them, to walk them through a new concept of skill — reinforcing their understanding about a subject while enhancing their social skills. We are used to humans teaching robots, and this being a one way street, but that is changing. Meanwhile, the WHO has warned of a ""health workforce crisis."" There's a total shortfall of 7.2 million professionals across 100 countries — and given the world faces an aging population, this gap is expected to accelerate to 12.9 million by 2035. The industry is facing shortages in critical areas like nursing, primary care, and allied health. This crisis is affecting the quality of care patients receive and threatening the ability of healthcare professionals to do their jobs. From monitoring patients with chronic diseases, assisting surgical procedures, to offering companionship for the elderly, autonomous robots can play a crucial role in alleviating the workloads of nurses and doctors. Without being prompted, they can monitor supplies of medicines and equipment — ordering in additional stock when required. When you factor in other use cases such as transporting medical waste, cleaning treatment rooms and assisting in surgeries, it's clear to see that robotics can drive greater productivity — and consistency — at a time when the healthcare sector needs it. Autonomous systems are already reshaping the defense sector, primarily involving swarms of drones and naval surface assets, and we're barely scratching the surface when it comes to the advantages robotics can bring — executing tasks that may be unsafe or impossible for humans. From prototypes to practical use All of this may seem abstract and straight out of the 22nd century, but Ethereum is being used today to store decision and action guardrails for AIs and robots, and as reported by Coinbase , AI agents are using crypto to transact amongst themselves. The open and auditable structure of decentralized crypto networks allows robotics developers to securely share data, models, and breakthroughs. This accelerates the transition of autonomous robots from prototypes to real-world applications, enabling their deployment in critical areas like hospitals and schools faster than ever. When you walk down the street with a humanoid robot, and people stop and ask - “Hey aren’t you scared” you can tell them - no I’m not, because the laws governing this machine’s actions are public and immutable, and then you can give them the a link to the Ethereum contract address where those rules are stored. Decentralized ledgers can also act as coordination hubs, allowing robots in heterogeneous systems to find one another and coordinate without centralized intermediaries. This is conceptually similar to the standard defence C3 technology (command, communication, and control), except that the infra is decentralized and public. Immutable records ensure that every exchange and action is traceable, creating a trusted foundation for collaboration. For robot-to-robot interactions, smart contracts streamline task allocation and resource sharing, enabling efficient coordination. In robot-to-human interactions, privacy-centric decentralized systems can secure sensitive data, such as biometric or medical information, fostering trust and accountability. This new world may invoke fear - what does this all mean for us? - but everyone reading this article has been working on making it come true for almost 2 decades now, by building the infrastructure that will handle governance, teaming, communication, and coordination of humans with thinking machines.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 23:58:02

However, while Dogecoin gains attention, RCO Finance (RCOF) , a cutting-edge DeFi project is projected to skyrocket from $0.07 to $2, an impressive 28x growth, long before Dogecoin reaches its target. Let’s explore why Dogecoin remains a strong contender, how RCO Finance’s features and market potential make it a standout, and why investors are flocking to this emerging DeFi powerhouse. Dogecoin’s Gradual Ascent to $0.7 Dogecoin has evolved into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, backed by a loyal community and prominent figures like Elon Musk. With its increasing adoption for payments and growing ecosystem, Dogecoin is slowly but steadily working its way toward a price of $0.7. Key Drivers of Dogecoin’s Price Increase Community Support The Dogecoin community remains its strongest asset, driving demand and keeping the project relevant even in bear markets. Elon Musk’s Influence Musk’s frequent mentions of Dogecoin and Tesla’s acceptance of it for certain products have boosted its credibility. Wider Adoption Businesses integrating Dogecoin as a payment option, combined with its low transaction fees, are further solidifying its position in the market. While the Dogecoin price’s journey to $0.7 is promising, its gradual growth rate leaves room for faster-moving projects like RCO Finance to take the spotlight. RCO Finance: From $0.07 to $2, The DeFi Giant in the Making Unlike the Dogecoin price, which relies heavily on hype and community momentum, RCO Finance (RCOF) is an advanced financial platform built on substance, offering revolutionary features that appeal to both novice and expert investors. AI-Powered Investment Strategies RCO Finance uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create personalized investment strategies tailored to individual user goals.

KYC-Free Privacy Operating within a KYC-free ecosystem, RCO Finance prioritizes user privacy while offering seamless access to decentralized financial products. Comprehensive Asset Options The platform supports over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, allowing for unparalleled portfolio diversification. High ROI Potential With its token price currently at $0.07 in presale, RCO Finance is expected to reach $2 soon after its launch on major exchanges, a growth trajectory that far outpaces Dogecoin’s projected gains. The RCOF Presale: A Golden Opportunity RCO Finance’s ongoing presale is one of the most talked about in the crypto space. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to hit $2; a remarkable 28x return, shortly after its launch. Why Invest in the Presale? Early Entry Advantage : You get to secure tokens at the lowest possible price. High Growth Potential : A projected jump to $2 ensures exponential returns. Access to Exclusive Features : Early investors gain priority access to RCO Finance’s suite of tools. As the presale progresses, the price will increase, with the next stage set at $0.2142. The time to act is now for investors seeking to maximize their returns. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price is expected to rise above $0.7, its growth trajectory remains gradual, driven by community support and mainstream adoption. On the other hand, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unparalleled ROI potential, with a clear path to $2 from its current presale price of $0.07. For investors, the choice doesn’t have to be binary. A balanced portfolio that includes both Dogecoin for steady gains and RCO Finance for exponential growth ensures exposure to the best of both worlds.

In December 2024, the volume of BTC acquired through Spot Bitcoin ETFs more than tripled the amount mined during that same month, underscoring the severe imbalance between supply and demand. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Trigger Supply Shock Risks In December 2024, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased an astonishing 51,500 BTC. On the other hand, BTC miners produced only 13,850 coins during the same period, according to data from Blockchain.com. This indicates that Bitcoin ETFs alone purchased nearly four times the amount BTC miners generated and supplied to the market that month. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent According to reports, the demand for ETFs in December was nothing short of extraordinary, exceeding the available supply by approximately 272%. This massive increase in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has raised concerns about a potential BTC supply shock, with analysts suggesting that it could happen soon. Specifically, Lark Davis, a crypto analyst, announced earlier in December that “a massive supply shock is imminent.” The analyst based this alarming forecast on the significant accumulation of BTC from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Davis disclosed that at some point in December, BTC ETFs had bought 21,423 BTC; meanwhile, miners had produced only 3,150 BTC around the same time. The analyst also noted that BTC ETFs globally held approximately 1,311,579 BTC as of December 17, 2024. This amount, valued at $139 billion, accounts for 6.24% of BTC’s total supply of 19.8 million. Given this staggering figure, Davis projects that during peak bull market phases, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could hold 10-20% of BTC’s total supply, raising more concerns about a major supply shock. Concentration Of Spot BTC Inflows In December Data from Glassnode has revealed that Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $4.63 billion in December, almost doubling their 2024 monthly average of $2.77 billion. Notably, Glassnode disclosed that the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows was more concentrated during the first half of the month, while the second half saw outflows, with December 26 being the exception. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Not surprisingly, the timing for this surge and subsequent decline in Bitcoin ETF inflows aligns with BTC’s price movements in December. At the beginning of the month, BTC experienced upward momentum, skyrocketing to a new ATH above $108,000 on December 17, fueled by the bull market hype and soaring demand. However, following this peak, BTC’s price saw a sharp decline, a drop that coincided with the timing of significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, as reported by Glassnode. Despite the surge in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs in December, new data shows that investors have extended their accumulation trend into January 2025. On January 3, investors purchased over $900 million worth of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs acquired an additional 9,500 BTC, worth over $966 million at the current market price.

Although, experts caution that a drop below $400 could indicate a negative trend. Meanwhile, Atua.ai and Bitgert are joining forces to bring AI innovations to Bitgert’s decentralized system, aiming to broaden their role in the web3 ecosystem. In addition, Web3Bay is innovating in Web3 e-commerce with its platform that lets users control the sale and purchase of digital assets, cut down on transaction costs, and participate in governance through its 3BAY token, which is in its presale phase. The token’s anticipated starting price is $0.195, presenting a significant 6430% potential gain for early participants. Bittensor Continues to Trend as Prices Rise \Bittensor’s market performance shows a robust 30% increase over the past three days, driven by strong market interest. The price has crossed the 200-day EMA, with bullish signs from both candlestick formations and RSI divergence suggesting further potential increases. If Bittensor maintains its upward trajectory, the price might exceed $1000. However, given the unpredictable nature of the market, a fall below $400 could lead to a downturn. Despite the positive signs, analysts urge investors to proceed with caution. Atua.ai and Bitgert Collaborate to Boost the Web3 Ecosystem Atua.ai has partnered with Bitgert to integrate AI into Bitgert’s decentralized cryptocurrency platform, enhancing the web3 ecosystem. This partnership is expected to improve trading tools and user experiences by offering AI-driven solutions. Atua.ai users will have easier access to a diverse range of digital assets, which helps increase adoption. Furthermore, Bitgert’s extensive reach will open new opportunities for Atua.ai across various industries such as education, advertising, and entertainment, setting the stage for both entities to expand their brand influence within the web3 space. From Shopping to Governance: How Web3Bay is Shaping the Next Era of E-commerce Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by providing users with authentic ownership and governance. It operates on layer-1 blockchain technology, enabling users to manage their data and transact digital assets, actively shaping the platform’s evolution. In contrast to centralized platforms, Web3Bay empowers its users to make crucial decisions through voting with the 3BAY token, promoting a community-led development that enhances transparency and trust. A major advantage of Web3Bay is its reduced transaction fees. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform significantly lowers the costs usually associated with centralized e-commerce services. This reduction in fees facilitates a more conducive environment for small businesses, fostering a truly global marketplace where users can engage in buying and selling digital assets more affordably. Web3Bay further incentivizes its community by rewarding active users with the 3BAY token. Participation in transactions, staking, and active engagement on the platform are all ways users can earn rewards, contributing to a dedicated and vibrant community. Moreover, Web3Bay accommodates both seasoned crypto users and beginners by supporting widely-used payment methods like PayPal, merging traditional Web2 commerce dynamics with the innovative, decentralized Web3 ecosystem, thus widening its user base. Currently, the 3BAY token is in its presale phase, having already gathered over $460,000. Priced at $0.0039675 during its 3rd stage, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering an astounding potential for a 6430% return on investment for early participants. With Web3Bay poised to revolutionize practical applications, the value of the 3BAY token is expected to see significant growth, promising substantial returns for early investors. Final Thoughts The recent trends in Bittensor suggest growth potential, yet caution is advised due to the market’s instability. Meanwhile, the partnership between Atua.ai and Bitgert is set to enhance the web3 ecosystem with innovative AI applications. However, Web3Bay is making notable progress in the Web3 sector by offering a platform that is community-driven, has lower fees, and connects Web2 with Web3 commerce. With the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.0039675, it is an opportune moment to engage with the Web3Bay ecosystem and potentially benefit from substantial future gains.

The meme coin world has always been full of surprises. From Dogecoin’s rise to fame to Shiba Inu’s record-breaking journey, the crypto space has seen coins go from mere jokes to massive investment opportunities. Shiba Inu made history as one of the most recognised meme coins, backed by its strong community and ecosystem. But as the crypto world evolves, new players like BTFD Coin ($BTFD) are emerging with innovative features that could make them the best new meme coins to join this week. BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s shaping the future of the space with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking programme, and a strong community known as the Bulls Squad. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin might be your next big opportunity and how it stands out in a market once dominated by Shiba Inu. BTFD Coin: Combining Innovation and Community Power BTFD Coin is creating buzz not only because of its $5 million presale milestone but also for its groundbreaking Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that launched on January 1, 2025. This P2E game is a central piece of its ecosystem, offering players the chance to earn $BTFD tokens by completing challenges, competing on leaderboards, and unlocking rewards. It’s more than a game—it’s a platform where investment and entertainment merge seamlessly. The 90% APY staking programme is another major highlight, giving investors an unmatched opportunity for passive income. For instance, if you invest $12,000 during Stage 13 at $0.000142 per token, you’ll secure approximately 84,507,042 $BTFD tokens. By staking these tokens for a year, you could earn an additional 76,056,337 tokens. If BTFD reaches its projected listing price of $0.0006, the total value of your investment could soar to $96,339. Beyond these features, the Bulls Squad—a growing community of over 7,800 holders—is the backbone of BTFD’s success. With a vibrant network of supporters driving the project’s visibility, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Buying $BTFD is quick and easy. Start by setting up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Visit the official BTFD Coin presale page , connect your wallet, and select your investment amount. Confirm your purchase, and once the presale ends, your tokens will be available to claim. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That Made History Shiba Inu entered the crypto space in 2020 as a community-driven token with big ambitions. Over time, it has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem with features like ShibaSwap, its decentralised exchange, and strategic initiatives like token burns to manage supply. These efforts have cemented its place as a pioneer in the meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s growth is a testament to the power of community and innovation. Its ability to transform from a simple meme coin to a recognised digital currency shows the potential that lies within this space. But while Shiba Inu continues to thrive, newer coins like BTFD are stepping in with fresh ideas, signalling that the meme coin landscape is far from static. The Final Thoughts Based on market trends and the growing excitement around BTFD Coin, it’s clear that this project has all the ingredients for success. Shiba Inu might have set the stage for meme coin dominance, but BTFD Coin is ready to take things to the next level. With its P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a dedicated community, it’s shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Don’t miss out on this chance to secure your spot in one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the revolution.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 00:22:00

The Seychelles based parent company made this announcement as the platform continues to expand its presence across the Latin American region. Bitfinex Gains DASP License in El Salvador, Strengthening Latin America Presence As reported on X recently, Bitfinex Derivatives has become the latest to obtain a DASP license in El Salvador. With this license, the platform is able to offer its derivatives service through a new subsidiary called Bitfinex Derivatives El Salvador S.A. de C.V. The company statement adds that the users have to agree to the terms in order to continue using the service. The move to El Salvador aligns with Bitfinex’s strategy to strengthen its foothold in Latin America. The company noted its mission to deliver advanced trading solutions. This further reinforces Bukele’s government position as a key player in the crypto economy. The trading platform stated, “To continue to use the Derivative Services on or after this date, you will be required to accept the Bitfinex Derivatives El Salvador S.A. de C.V. terms of service. “ Enhanced Trading Solutions Through Bitfinex Derivatives With the DASP license, Bitfinex will provide innovative derivatives trading services to its users.

El Salvador’s Role in the Global Crypto Economy El Salvador has solidified its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. The country pioneered Bitcoin adoption as legal tender in 2021 and continues to grant licenses to crypto platforms. Bitfinex was the first crypto exchange to secure DASP registration in El Salvador in 2021, followed by Bitfinex Securities obtaining a Digital Assets License. Nayib Bukele’s government has been providing encouraging policies and making sound investments in the crypto industry. By the end of December 2024, the Bukele’s government had bought more than 6,000 BTC, which proves it’s focus on the cryptocurrency. Moreover, El Salvador plans to accelerate Bitcoin accumulation, adding to its current reserves valued at approximately $596 million. Despite retiring the Chivo wallet and IMF restrictions limiting Bitcoin use in public transactions, the government remains committed to advancing Bitcoin education and capital market development as part of its strategy.

Wald said “This new position in Solana will enable the further development of the ecosystem, and enhance our staking operations.” The credit line is being extended by company chairman and director Antanas Guoga and will be valid until January 6, 2027. Guoga was also optimistic about the capabilities of both Sol Strategies and Solana, focusing on the future of the blockchain. Pivot to Solana Following Rebranding Sol Strategies, formerly called Cypherpunk Holdings, repositioned its business in 2024 and shifted its focus to only build products within the Solana ecosystem. The rebranding was a part of the process when the company aimed to become one of the biggest Solana validators and participants of the ecosystem. During Wald’s tenure at the firm, it sold off non-strategic investments, including its equity interest in Animoca Brands that was once a major investment. Sol Strategies has been able to divert its capital and put it towards buying Solana tokens and its validator business. At the end of the year 2024, the firm had invested in more than 1.5 million SOL tokens, which was worth approximately CAD $450 million. HODL’s symbol has changed to match the company’s focus on Solana, allowing investors to indirectly invest in the blockchain. The analysts have compared this approach to that employed by the firms such as MARA and Riot Platforms where clients get exposure to Bitcoin through mining. SOL’s Growing Role in Web3 Innovation The main advantage of Solana is the high speed of transactions, the prospect of scaling and the possibility to work with DeFi and NFT. As more firms shift their focus to particular blockchain platforms, Solana has become one of the most popular destinations for businesses that want to expand within the Web3 ecosystem. Sol Strategies has already invested more than 140000 SOL tokens that are owned by the company directly, to strengthen Solana network. In this case, the company engages in validator operations to reinforce the blockchain and, at the same time, gain rewards and increase the amount of holdings. The company also detailed its intention to increase its activity in the decentralized finance and liquidity provision space. This strategic expansion is in synergy with the general market dynamics as companies with a focus on blockchain technology direct their investments to high growth platforms. Solana Price Analysis Points To Breakout Solana (SOL) is among the assets that have shown significant rebound over the past few months with the price of the asset forming a V-shaped pattern. At the time of writing, Solana price is trading at $254 with the first barrier at $254.35. According to market analysts, SOL prices could rise to $302 and further to $345.76 if the buying pressure continues. The investment from Sol Strategies comes as Solana is experiencing a surge in investor interest in the blockchain due to its use in DeFi and NFTs. Solana’s ecosystem could be further supported by the company’s CAD $25 million, which may also improve the liquidity and staking of the ecosystem. In its recent announcement, Sol Strategies is also set to gain from the price rise of Solana. The company has high expectations that the blockchain can create sustainable shareholder value owing to its potential for growth.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,200 followers on the social media platform X that FLOKI appears to have completed an ABC correction on the daily chart. Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to ignite a five-wave upside move after completing an ABC retracement. “FLOKI is another major meme looking turbo bullish in my opinion and heading to ATHs. Price action from the November highs looking like another high timeframe ABC with a fresh impulse looking underway, ATH before the end of the cycle is inevitable in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will surge close to $0.0004 by March. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.0002. The analyst is also watching the US dollar index (DXY), which traders use as a barometer for investors’ risk appetite. According to Bluntz, the DXY looks bearish after respecting a key Fibonacci resistance level and concluding an ABC upside correction. He now expects the index to drop below 100. “DXY looks topped now, hit 108 as I expected, wicked a major 0.618 level, and looks like a long slow ABC up after an impulsive move to the downside. Risk assets held up extremely well while DXY pumped which was counterintuitive. I think we start heading back below 99 in 2025.” Source: Bluntz/X A bearish DXY chart typically suggests that investors are unloading their US dollars to accumulate risk assets such as crypto and stocks. At time of writing, the DXY is hovering at 108.

Table of Contents When the crypto cop packs up From hater to believer When memes meet government Crypto and AI walk into the white house Michael Saylor’s mega Bitcoin stack SEC gets a slice of humble pie CZ vs. the meme coin craze Inverse cramer still working Peter Schiff’s bubble talk When the crypto cop packs up The first and foremost — and arguably the best crypto tweet of 2024 came from none other than Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Nov. 21, he announced his resignation via a concise thread on Twitter, stating, “On January 20, 2025, I will be stepping down as SECGov Chair.” On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as @SECGov Chair. A thread 🧵⬇️ — Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) November 21, 2024 Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair, which began in 2021, has been nothing short of polarizing for the crypto industry. Known for his no-nonsense approach, he led an aggressive regulatory crackdown, describing the sector as “rife with fraud and hucksters.” Under his leadership, the SEC launched a record-breaking 46 enforcement actions against crypto-related entities in 2023 alone, marking a sharp 53% increase compared to 2022. In his post, Gensler credited the SEC’s staff as “true public servants” and emphasized the Commission’s focus on “protecting investors” and “enforcing the law without fear or favor.” However, the crypto community viewed this announcement through a very different lens. Many perceived it as the end of what they considered an overly harsh era of regulation. Social media, particularly the sphere of crypto Twitter influencers, reacted with outright relief. Adding to the intrigue, Gensler’s resignation sets the stage for Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance, to take the helm. Atkins’ nomination by President-elect Donald Trump has fueled speculation about a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto, presenting a stark contrast to Gensler’s approach. From hater to believer The next major entry in the best crypto tweets of 2024 came from Donald J. Trump on Oct. 31, just days before the U.S. presidential elections. I would like to wish our great Bitcoiners a Happy 16th Anniversary of Satoshi’s White Paper. We will end Kamala’s war on crypto, & Bitcoin will be MADE IN THE USA! VOTE TRUMP! #Bitcoin #FreeRossDayOne — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2024 In this tweet, Trump celebrated the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) white paper, extended his best wishes to the Bitcoin community, and vowed to “end Kamala’s war on crypto” while ensuring that Bitcoin would be “Made in the USA.” Trump’s message marked a striking departure from his earlier views on crypto. During his first presidential term, he frequently dismissed crypto as speculative and unreliable, raising concerns about its use in illegal activities. By mid-2024, however, his stance had shifted dramatically. Trump’s promises go beyond rhetoric. During a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, he met with Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. The discussions reportedly included ambitious proposals, such as establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to be managed by the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund—an idea Trump had previously floated during his Nashville speech in July. Trump has also outlined plans to ensure Bitcoin mining is “Made in the USA,” with the goal of positioning the U.S. as a global hub for crypto infrastructure. He has even expressed support for controversial measures, such as pardoning figures like Ross Ulbricht. When memes meet government The next best crypto tweet came from none other than Elon Musk. On Nov. 13, Musk shared a striking graphical image of a dog with the acronym “DOGE” prominently displayed. The image header read “Department of Government Efficiency.” pic.twitter.com/4K0ruu7UMS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 13, 2024 The tweet wasn’t just a playful nod to Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the meme coin Musk has famously supported for years — it also carried a deeper connection to real-world events. President-elect Trump had recently announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative aimed at reducing bureaucratic waste and streamlining federal operations. Musk, along with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, was named as one of the leaders of this new department. The choice of acronym, DOGE, seemed to be a deliberate, Musk-like move to merge his well-documented love for Dogecoin with his new governmental role. For those who have followed Musk’s crypto journey, his association with Dogecoin comes as no surprise. He’s long been referred to as the “Dogefather,” a title earned through his relentless promotion of the DOGE. Elon Musk’s tweets about cryptocurrency have repeatedly influenced Dogecoin’s price, transforming it from a joke coin into a legitimate player in the crypto market. His history with DOGE includes everything from calling it “the people’s crypto” to suggesting it could become the currency of Mars. Crypto and AI walk into the white house The fourth entry in our top crypto tweets of 2024 features Donald J. Trump’s repost from his Truth Social account, announcing the appointment of David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David… — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 6, 2024 Trump’s announcement stated, “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas… and will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for.” This announcement makes clear how far crypto and AI have come from their early days as fringe industries met with skepticism. Today, these sectors are acknowledged as critical pillars of the future economy. With this new position, Trump continues his push to bring crypto-friendly voices into the policy-making process, signaling a clear intent to promote growth and leadership in both fields. As the founding-era COO of PayPal, Sacks was part of the legendary “PayPal Mafia,” a group of tech leaders who went on to create some of the most iconic companies of their time. Additionally, Sacks has been a prominent figure in Silicon Valley for over two decades. His crypto journey began as early as 2017, when he described Bitcoin as the cornerstone of a “decentralized web” and the “internet of money.” Michael Saylor’s mega Bitcoin stack The next entry comes from Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, a company renowned for its relentless acquisition of Bitcoin. In a Dec. 15 tweet, Saylor announced the latest milestone, stating, “MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin… As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin.” MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in 2020, MicroStrategy has steadily increased its holdings through a combination of cash flow and debt financing. With 439,000 BTC in its reserves, the firm now stands as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the fourth-largest holder overall. For perspective, the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains the largest entity, controlling over a million BTC. Following Satoshi is BlackRock’s IBIT BTC ETF, which holds 553,460 BTC. Saylor’s tweet also points to impressive returns. With a quarter-to-date yield of 46.4% and a year-to-date yield of 72.4%, MSTR has cemented itself as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. SEC gets a slice of humble pie The next crypto tweet of 2024 comes from Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple ( XRP ), following a key development in the company’s legal battle with the SEC. On Nov. 29, Garlinghouse tweeted: “The SEC asked for $2B, and the Court reduced their demand by ~94%, recognizing that they had overplayed their hand. This is a victory for Ripple, the industry, and the rule of law. The SEC’s headwinds against the whole of the XRP community are gone.” The SEC asked for $2B, and the Court reduced their demand by ~94% recognizing that they had overplayed their hand. We respect the Court’s decision and have clarity to continue growing our company. This is a victory for Ripple, the industry and the rule of law. The SEC’s… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 7, 2024 Ripple’s legal saga with the SEC began in December 2020, when the agency accused the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. The case quickly became a flashpoint for the broader crypto industry, reflecting the growing tensions between regulators and the sector. Ripple consistently argued that XRP should not be classified as a security, citing its utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. The SEC, under Gary Gensler’s leadership, pursued the case aggressively as part of a broader crackdown on the industry. In July 2023, Ripple secured an initial partial victory when a court ruled that certain XRP sales — particularly those on secondary markets — did not constitute securities transactions. However, the case was far from over. The SEC continued its push, demanding an unprecedented $2 billion in penalties from Ripple. The turning point came in August 2024, when a court drastically reduced the SEC’s demand, ordering Ripple to pay a $125 million civil penalty — just under 6% of the original amount sought. Despite this significant win for Ripple, the SEC’s subsequent appeal indicates that the legal battle may not yet be entirely resolved. CZ vs. the meme coin craze The next standout in the top crypto tweets of 2024 comes from Changpeng Zhao, or simply CZ, the founder and ex-CEO of Binance. On Nov. 26, CZ expressed his unease with the booming meme coin trend, tweeting, “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ‘a little’ weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain.” I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ""a little"" weird now. Let's build real applications using blockchain. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 26, 2024 Meme coins have taken 2024 by storm, dominating crypto conversations and becoming the hottest sector in the space. While classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) set the stage, today’s frenzy is fueled by platforms like Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL ) based ecosystem designed to make launching and trading meme coins as simple as posting a tweet. The stats back up the hype. According to Dune Analytics, meme coin trading on Pump.fun made up a jaw-dropping 62.3% of all decentralized exchange ( DEX ) activity on the Solana blockchain in November — a figure that’s been climbing steadily for months. Among the most buzzworthy tokens are Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ), Just a Chill Guy ( CHILLGUY ), and Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ). Each of these coins has tapped into quirky narratives and speculative excitement, drawing in traders from all corners of the crypto world. Inverse cramer still working The eighth noteworthy entry in the top cryptocurrency tweets of 2024 comes from Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money and a polarizing figure in the financial world. On Aug. 5, Cramer waded into the age-old debate between traditional assets and crypto, tweeting, “Remember this: gold held up a lot better than crypto…” Remember this: gold held up a lot better than crypto… — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) August 5, 2024 The post immediately sparked reactions, particularly from fans of the infamous “Inverse Cramer” phenomenon. The idea is simple: do the opposite of what Cramer advises, and you’re more likely to profit. Cramer’s August tweet proved to be another classic example. At the time, gold was trading at $2,411 per ounce, while Bitcoin sat around $54,000. Fast forward to Dec. 20, and gold has inched up to $2,606 — a respectable but modest 8% gain. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has skyrocketed to $98,000, delivering a jaw-dropping 81% return in just a few months. If you followed the Inverse Cramer playbook this year, it’s safe to say you’ve had a very profitable year. Peter Schiff’s bubble talk The final entry in our top crypto tweets of 2024 fittingly comes from Peter Schiff, Bitcoin’s most persistent critic and a vocal advocate for gold. On Dec. 16, Schiff took yet another jab at Bitcoin, tweeting, “Congratulations Bitcoiners on blowing the biggest bubble ever!” About 400 publicly traded dot-com companies went bankrupt when the bubble popped. At their peak, those 400 companies had a market cap of $1.7 trillion. The current market cap of #Bitcoin alone now exceeds $2 trillion. Congratulations Bitcoiners on blowing the biggest bubble ever! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 16, 2024 His post drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap and the $1.7 trillion valuation of dot-com companies at their peak before the infamous bubble burst. The crypto community, predictably, wasn’t about to let this slide. Jeff Park of Bitwise Investments fired back with a sarcastic reply: “Thank you for your insights, Peter. Keep up the good work!” Thank you for your insights Peter. Keep up the good work! — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) December 16, 2024 Schiff’s disdain for Bitcoin is nothing new. He’s been calling it everything from a “Ponzi scheme” to “fool’s gold” since its early days. Despite his dire warnings, Bitcoin has defied expectations, climbing to new all-time highs and achieving widespread institutional adoption. Ironically, Schiff’s relentless pessimism has made him something of an unofficial mascot for Bitcoin rallies. His critiques are often met with memes and tweets celebrating his uncanny ability to be wrong at the worst possible times. While it’s unlikely Schiff will ever change his tune, his comments have become a source of amusement for Bitcoin enthusiasts.",Feature|Changpeng Zhao|Donald Trump|Gary Gensler|Twitter|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-08 01:23:00

The psychological milestone had been a key resistance level, with many investors and analysts closely monitoring BTC’s price action for clues about its next big move. The recent breakout above $100K signals renewed market optimism, yet the question remains: can Bitcoin maintain its momentum? Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting a critical pattern forming in Bitcoin’s 1-hour time frame. According to Runefelt, Bitcoin is currently shaping a symmetrical triangle, a classic chart pattern that typically precedes a significant price movement. The pattern suggests that Bitcoin is coiling for a decisive breakout or breakdown, with the next few days—or even hours—potentially shaping its short-term trajectory. This pivotal moment for Bitcoin comes as the broader crypto market experiences renewed energy following a sluggish end to the previous year. Investors are optimistic yet cautious, as the technical setup could signal either a continued rally or a temporary setback. With BTC back in six-figure territory, the stage is set for a critical period that could define the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Breaks Above $100K But Faces Risks Bitcoin has surged to $102,700 with impressive strength, fueling optimism for a highly bullish year ahead. Investors are closely watching the market leader, which continues to show resilience after reclaiming the $100K mark. However, BTC is not without risks; any loss of current levels could result in a significant pullback, potentially shaking confidence in the ongoing rally. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s formation of a symmetrical triangle on the hourly timeframe. This classic chart pattern often precedes a sharp breakout or breakdown, signaling heightened market activity. Runefelt emphasized that the next move could occur as the price consolidates tightly within the triangle. Runefelt outlined key price targets for traders to watch. A close below the $100K mark would act as a bearish signal, potentially invalidating the bullish structure built over recent weeks. Conversely, a breakout above $103K would confirm bullish momentum and set the stage for a continuation of the rally.

While optimism surrounds the possibility of a sustained bull cycle, the potential for increased volatility underscores the need for caution in this pivotal period. Testing Fresh Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $101,400 after a decisive 4-hour breakout above the critical $100K mark, sparking renewed optimism among investors. This clean breakout has pushed BTC into fresh liquidity above the psychological level of $100K, a sign of strength as the market leader attempts to maintain bullish momentum. However, the battle is far from over. While Bitcoin’s price action remains promising, bulls need to push the price higher to assert full control. The next major hurdle lies at $103,600, a key resistance level that, if broken, could pave the way for a massive rally. A strong move above this mark would confirm Bitcoin’s bullish structure and likely attract more buyers, driving the price into new all-time highs.

Recognized as some of the most profitable crypto miners, these units have surpassed 15,200 sales. As the 2025 launch approaches, these miners are set to deliver unmatched scalability and benefits for early adopters. SHIB Price Climbs as Major Transactions Increase On Tuesday, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price saw a significant rise, spurred by a 265% boost in whale transactions and improved sentiment across the crypto market. Market experts like Ali Martinez have identified buying opportunities on SHIB’s daily chart, suggesting potential price increases to $0.000026 or $0.000029. Crypto analyst The Moon Show noted a bullish ascending triangle formation, setting a conservative target of $0.000056 in the current cycle. Accompanying this, large transactions exceeding $100,000 jumped from 118 to 180, coupled with a steady flow of 4.7 million daily transactions on Shibarium, emphasizing growing interest in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price from major players. SUI Price Forecast for 2025: Potential for Up to 359% Growth The SUI price prediction for 2025 reveals strong upward potential, with price targets ranging from $6.13 to $21.36. Analysts are forecasting an average price of $12.25 for the year, with January expected to show the most significant increase, possibly reaching a 359% rise from current levels. In the near term, SUI is expected to grow by 27.7%, aiming for a price of $5.94 by January 2025.

BlockDAG Miners: 15.2K Units Sold, Gearing Up for 2025 Launch BlockDAG miners are transforming the domain of cryptocurrency mining through a blend of high performance and sustainable practices. These miners are engineered to use less energy while increasing earnings, achieving a new level of efficiency with exceptional hashing power per watt. Their advanced hybrid consensus protocol enhances both scalability and security, providing a competitive advantage in the fast-changing cryptocurrency market. As the 2025 launch of BlockDAG approaches, the emphasis on environmentally friendly technology positions these miners as essential tools in modern crypto mining. The upcoming 2025 launch has propelled BlockDAG to new heights, with sales topping 15,200 miners. The X30 model stands out for its efficiency, with the capability to mine up to 600 BDAG coins daily. Situated between the smaller X10 and the more robust X100, the X30 strikes an ideal balance of performance and scalability, suiting a broad spectrum of mining operations. Its effective return on energy makes BlockDAG’s offerings some of the most profitable crypto miners on the market. The strong presale results underscore the rapid appreciation of the coin’s value, offering a unique chance for those who get involved early. With more than $176.5 million accumulated in the presale and a dramatic 2,380% increase in BDAG’s value, the excitement for BlockDAG miners is unwavering. As we move closer to the 2025 launch, miner availability is dwindling, and demand is surging. For those aiming to establish a position in the crypto market, the opportunity to act is now—before the increase in mining difficulty and the addition of BDAG to major exchanges potentially heightens the competition. Closing Insights As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price continues to rise, bolstered by increased activity from large-scale traders, it highlights the persistent popularity of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Likewise, the SUI price prediction for 2025 suggests a promising future, with the potential for substantial growth driven by market dynamics and analytical indicators. Yet, it is BlockDAG that captures the most attention with its advanced mining technology, setting new standards for profitability. Having sold over 15,200 units, BlockDAG’s miners are acclaimed as among the most profitable crypto miners currently available. With the 2025 launch on the horizon and demand increasing, securing a BlockDAG miner now might be the most prudent strategy for those looking to benefit from future developments.

DeFi developers will also be able to integrate RLUSD support into their applications for several use cases, such as lending and trading. Ripple’s press release disclosed that RLUSD stablecoin users would also extensively use Chainlink’s decentralized data feeds to monitor smart contracts. RLUSD users can connect their smart contract applications to any API through Chainlink’s ‘request and response’ model, facilitating interoperability between on-chain and off-chain systems. Chainlink will provide RLUSD with the essential infrastructure and ecosystem to power the movement of secure data and tokenized real-world assets. With Chainlink, RLUSD will tap into the $867 trillion tokenized real-world asset industry through exchanges like Uphold, Bullish, Keyrock, Bitso, and Coinmena. Chainlink’s infrastructure has reportedly enabled over $18 trillion in transaction value so far. Ripple’s RLUSD uses Chainlink to provide fair market asset prices . @Ripple x @Chainlink : $RLUSD has adopted the Chainlink standard for verifiable data to fuel DeFi adoption with real-time, secure pricing data. The future of stablecoins is here: https://t.co/mq3cThLGQJ pic.twitter.com/993Ac0o282 — Ripple (@Ripple) January 7, 2025 Ripple chose Chainlink Price Feeds after reviewing several Oracle solutions because it provided opportunities for RLUSD-supporting DeFi applications to access fresh asset prices. The data will be supplied directly on-chain via a reliable tamper-proof system. According to Ripple, the fair market asset prices will reflect a volume-weighted average from off-chain and on-chain trading environments. The decentralized Oracle network infrastructure will fetch, aggregate, and deliver financial market data onto the Ethereum blockchain. Ripple claimed that Chainlink Price Feeds sourced high-quality data from premium data aggregators. The data aggregated from hundreds of exchanges is weighted by volume and cleaned of ‘wash trading.’ According to Ripple, Chainlink’s data was, therefore, inherently resistant to inaccuracies and manipulation of any single or set of exchanges. “As RLUSD scales across DeFi ecosystems, reliable and transparent pricing is essential to maintaining stability and building trust in its utility within decentralized markets.” -Jack McDonald, SVP, Stablecoin at Ripple McDonald said Ripple was bringing trusted data on-chain to further strengthen Ripple’s stablecoin utility across institutional and DApps by leveraging the Chainlink standard. Eid echoed McDonald’s sentiments, saying that having access to critical on-chain data would accelerate the adoption process for the RLUSD stablecoin. Chainlink provides secure node operators in a decentralized network Chainlink Price Feeds node operators were secured by independent, security-reviewed, and ‘Sybil-resistant’ oracle nodes run by blockchain DevOps teams, traditional enterprises, and data providers. Ripple said the Chainlink nodes remained reliable even during infrastructure outages or high gas prices. The Chainlink Price Feeds were also decentralized at the data source, Oracle node, and Oracle network levels. They generated robust protections against downtime and manipulation by the Oracle network or data provider. Chainlink provided a strong reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allowed users to independently verify node operators’ historical and real-time performance. Ripple reduced RLUSD’s on-chain, counterparty, credit, and liquidity risks by using Chainlink’s ‘Proof of Reserve’ to verify the protection of cross-chain tokenized assets against over-minting. Enabling automated risk management unlocked the programmatic utility for the RLUSD stablecoin, which was launched only last month. The token, issued on the Ethereum blockchain and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has a market cap of $72.3 million, according to Coingecko’s data . Ripple believes Chainlink will play a crucial role in ensuring that RLUD’s off-chain data is credibly neutral for all users. Ripple believes combining multiple layers of decentralization and cryptoeconomic incentives will ensure high accountability. Chainlink’s decentralized infrastructure could help prevent ‘black swan events’ like the recent NYSE glitch. Listed prices of several securities dropped by up to 99% due to the failure of NYSE’s centralized infrastructure. Chainlink’s viable and future-proof approach will use the CCIP to solve the interoperability problem. Ripple highlighted that Chainlink can also retrieve data from off-chain sources and deliver it on-chain promptly and securely. The decentralized blockchain oracle network is expanding its presence in the MENA region, creating opportunities for more RLUSD adoption.

In a surprising development, JPMorgan analysts have turned their attention to PropiChain , an emerging competitor to Dogecoin. According to their analysis, PropiChain could deliver staggering returns of 67,089%, provided its ambitious roadmap and market adoption goals come to fruition. This unexpected endorsement from a traditional banking titan signals a seismic shift in the way mainstream financial institutions perceive blockchain innovations, particularly those with real-world applications like PropiChain. Dogecoin’s Journey: A Tough Act to Follow Before diving into why JPMorgan is bullish on PropiChain, let’s reflect on the enduring appeal of Dogecoin . What began as a lighthearted meme token evolved into a cryptocurrency juggernaut, fueled by a passionate community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s widespread adoption as a payment method and its playful branding have given it a strong foothold in the crypto market. However, critics often point to its limited utility or robust infrastructure as limitations for long-term growth. This is where PropiChain excels. With a laser focus on disrupting the trillion-dollar real estate industry, PropiChain combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and fractional ownership to offer a utility that Dogecoin lacks. What is PropiChain, and Why is JPMorgan Bullish? PropiChain is a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to revolutionize real estate investments. By tokenizing physical properties, it enables investors to buy and sell fractional shares of real estate assets. This innovation solves major challenges in the traditional real estate market, such as high entry costs, lack of liquidity, and limited accessibility. Key Features Driving JPMorgan’s Optimism Fractional Ownership : PropiChain makes it possible for anyone to invest in premium real estate properties with as little as $100. AI-Powered Insights : The platform uses artificial intelligence for property valuation and market analysis, ensuring investors make informed decisions. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain integrates with the metaverse, offering virtual property tours and enabling global investors to collaborate seamlessly. Rental Income : Token holders earn proportional rental income, providing a steady stream of passive earnings. These features make PropiChain a unique player in the crypto space, blending blockchain innovation with tangible financial opportunities. JPMorgan’s Forecast: Why 67,089% Growth Is Possible According to JPMorgan analysts, PropiChain’s potential lies in its ability to tap into the $300 trillion real estate market. If the platform achieves even a fraction of this market, the returns for early investors could be astronomical. What Needs to Happen for the Prediction to Materialize Widespread Adoption : PropiChain must secure partnerships with real estate agencies, developers, and property management firms. Regulatory Clarity : Like all blockchain projects, PropiChain’s success hinges on favorable regulations, particularly in major markets like the US and EU. Presale Success : The ongoing presale is critical. With tokens currently priced at $0.011, the price will rise to $0.023 in the next stage. Early participation could yield exponential returns. Presale: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. As the presale transitions to Stage 3, the price will jump to $0.023, offering early investors a significant advantage. This price hike mirrors the early days of Dogecoin, which saw meteoric rises after initial adoption. However, PropiChain’s real-world utility positions it for sustained growth rather than short-term hype. For those considering entry, the presale represents a rare opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before the project gains mainstream traction. The endorsement from JPMorgan isn’t the only vote of confidence for PropiChain. The project has undergone a BlockAudit review , ensuring the security of its smart contracts, and is listed on CoinMarketCap , adding credibility to its offering. Conclusion While Dogecoin will always hold a special place in the crypto community, PropiChain’s real estate investments approach sets it apart as a high-growth opportunity. JPMorgan’s bullish forecast underscores its potential to deliver life-changing returns for early adopters. With the presale in full swing and the price poised to increase, there’s no better time to invest. A small investment today could yield huge gains, making PropiChain a no-brainer for smart investors.

They intend to do this by introducing a “lattice-based” hashing system that reduces the effort needed to keep track of the state of every user account. Hashing is the cryptographic process of turning data into a standardized 64-character code that can’t be reverse-engineered, while the state is a snapshot of the data stored in a blockchain. So instead of taking a snapshot of every user on the entire blockchain, and “recalculating everything, it will only update accounts that have changed,” explained research firm Republik Labs in an X post. “This is faster, simpler, and uses fewer resources, letting Solana handle millions (or billions) of accounts more easily.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|SOL|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-08 02:02:02

The meeting that happened at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort is an important beginning to the year 2025 for Ripple especially with the current changes happening in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple CEO and CLO Meeting with Donald Trump On Monday evening, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed his meeting with Donald Trump and Stuart Alderoty on the platform X (previously Twitter). “Had a great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty. ”Great start to 2025!” he posted indicating that things are looking good for Ripple. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s legal head, also commented on the event, joking about the dinner’s menu: “The beef bourguignon was really good.” The dinner at Mar-a-Lago takes place at a time when Ripple has been building up its steam with wins against the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court.In line with the optimism, crypto analysts have provided bullish signals for XRP, some of whom have forecasted a price surge to $3. John Deaton Breaks Silence on Ripple CEO Meet Up Ripple has recently come into the limelight for its legal victory against the SEC where the latter had alleged that the company and Garlinghouse sold unregistered securities via XRP. The lawsuit that lasted for more than two years concluded with the victory of Ripple, which opened up new possibilities for the future of the cryptocurrency market. John E. Deaton, a pro XRP lawyer and following the case commented on X that Ripple’s win means that the company has remained unshaken. He also pointed to the SEC’s aggressive approach in the litigation process, which involved serving Garlinghouse with personal subpoenas to produce financial information. ”Ripple and Brad disclosed every XRP transaction that has ever taken place, but the SEC acted misconduct when it came to discovery,” Deaton said. However, Ripple has come out even stronger, suggesting that more positive outcomes are in the offing for the company and the sector as a whole. Cynthia Lummis Chats With US SEC Potential Chairman Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse has also noted recent expansion of Ripple’s activities within the United States which shows that the focus has shifted back to the domestic market.He disclosed that three quarters of the new positions at Ripple are based in the United States, something that was not the case in the past given the company’s focus on the international market. Furthermore, the company signed up more US business contracts in the last six weeks of the year 2024 than it had in the six months prior to that period. The dinner comes after several meetings between politicians and crypto enthusiasts. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for blockchain technology, has also been engaging with Paul Atkins, the man expected to be named SEC chairman by President-elect Trump. These discussions focus on the need to reform the SEC’s rule making process and to advance the use of digital assets. Ripple’s Growing Market Influence Ripple is also coming up strongly in the blockchain space with new products being introduced. Ripple President Monica Long stated that the stablecoin, RLUSD, which was recently launched, is expected to be listed on multiple platforms. At the same time, the company has joined Chainlink to work on the integration of secure and accurate pricing of RLUSD into the DeFi ecosystem. In these developments, Ripple has witnessed a rise in its valuation due to the increased prices of XRP and the increasing adoption of its solutions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has earlier stated that the $11 billion valuation of the company is quite dated given the current situation.

Despite this bearish outlook, long-term holders appear to be accumulating the tokens and seem to be taking advantage of the recent price decline, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. XRP Fails to Hold Bullish Outlook Before this crash, the overall market sentiment appeared bullish , with XRP seeming poised for a mega rally. However, the recent price decline has shifted the overall market sentiment, including for XRP. On January 2, 2024, XRP broke out from a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and subsequently moved into a consolidation zone, which the altcoin maintained for four trading days. However, the recent price crash has breached XRP’s consolidation zone and suggests a major price decline in the near future. $60.7M in XRP Outflow from Exchanges Amid this price decline, whales and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the asset, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $60.7 million worth of XRP in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinglass In cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which is often seen as a sign of accumulation. Additionally, outflows may indicate a potential buying opportunity and the possibility of an upside rally.

It’s crucial to stay updated on the latest from top trending cryptos—Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Recently, Hedera hit a high near $0.40 but is now adjusting, while Toncoin has slipped below its usual range after peaking at $7.20, with projections pointing towards $6.20. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has been making waves with its bold initiatives, revealed during a captivating AMA session. This session introduced a slew of exciting new developments including an incubator, a grants program, and a launchpad, marking it a key player in the blockchain field. Delve into these updates to get a handle on what’s heating up in this competitive space. Toncoin Price Insights: Potential Dips Could Set the Stage for Gains Toncoin has been on a wild ride, dipping below its average after hitting $7.20, suggesting some bearish trends ahead. The price fell to $4.78 but rebounded slightly above $5.00, still under the moving averages. Should Toncoin surge past these averages, we might see a resurgence. Conversely, if it dips below the 50-day SMA, the price could plummet to as low as $3.65. Currently, Toncoin is priced around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past average levels, aiming for $6.20. On the daily chart, maintaining positions above these averages and breaking through the $6.50 resistance could signal a bullish revival. Hedera Price Momentum: Soaring Past $0.40 Hedera’s price dynamics are heating up, recently breaking out from a descending triangle pattern after touching near $0.40, suggesting the start of an upward trend, awaiting further validation. Just a few days back, Hedera rallied from its base, breaking through significant resistance. The daily chart now hints at an upcoming fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci tools spotlighting critical support and resistance areas. After a robust rebound from the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.24, the price surged 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI climbing from high levels, the growing momentum could lead to critical movements in the near future, keeping all eyes on Fibonacci barriers. BlockDAG’s Latest AMA Reveal BlockDAG, a rising layer-1 blockchain project, is now among the top trending cryptos, following its recent AMA that unveiled new initiatives to boost its ecosystem and expand growth opportunities. These developments echo the formative stages of well-known networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is eagerly developing a new launchpad to support the roll-out of decentralized applications and projects on the BlockDAG network, poised to enhance participation and energize the ecosystem. BlockDAG is gearing up to host four significant hackathons in 2025, expecting to attract over 15,000 developers and catalyze hundreds of new projects. To bolster these efforts, they are introducing a $10 million grants program in February, awarding amounts between $5,000 and $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that qualify. Moreover, an ambassador program is being set up to integrate global representatives, and a collaboration with an incubator will provide essential mentorship, resources, and guidance to promising projects, ensuring they thrive on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG continues to impress with its significant milestones. Its ongoing crypto presale has successfully raised over $176 million and distributed more than 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in the 27th presale batch, early participants have seen an astonishing 2380% ROI. These achievements underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem and its readiness to be a leading choice for participants as we approach 2025. Final Say Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to hold strong in the list of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently exceeding $0.40 and Toncoin maintaining around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s targeted initiatives, including a robust $10 million grants program, a worldwide incubator, and a dedicated launchpad for new projects, that are raising its profile. The initiative’s crypto presale has not only raised $176 million but also achieved a phenomenal 2380% ROI from the first batch, showcasing BlockDAG’s dynamic approach to growth. This strategy sets BlockDAG apart as a standout opportunity for those aiming to engage with a project that combines consistent expansion with significant community involvement.

Investors are closely watching both of these well-established tokens, anticipating further gains. However, while DOGE and XRP continue to capture attention, there’s a new altcoin gem emerging with the potential to deliver even bigger gains – Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.004875 during its presale, Lightchain AI presents a fresh opportunity for investors to secure significant returns in 2025 and beyond. Dogecoin and XRP Strong Price Movements, But Can They Sustain Growth? Dogecoin and XRP has shown big price jumps, with Dogecoin going up more than 30% to about $0.30 and XRP getting up to near $2.43. These actions are mostly linked to hopes of a better crypto-supportive rule setup under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he wants to cut back on digital-asset rules. Also, the choice of crypto backer Elon Musk to run the Department of Government Efficiency has made market hope grow. Bu͏t, the durability of this rise stays unclear; as it really relies on the true use of good rules and the fixing of current legal fights like Ripple’s battle with the SEC. Investors should exercise caution, as the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market can lead to rapid changes in asset values. Lightchain AI New Altcoin with Explosive Potential While Dogecoin and XRP have their moments in the sun, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a major contender for the next big altcoin surge. Lightchain AI is a blockchain-based platform that integrates artificial intelligence and decentralized solutions to address real-world challenges across industries such as data processing, AI model training, and data privacy. Unlike DOGE, which is largely driven by community speculation, and XRP, which is limited to the cross-border payments space, Lightchain AI offers real-world applications with massive potential for adoption across various sectors. The presale of Lightchain AI , priced at $0.004875, has already raised significant investor interest. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI is poised for exponential growth, with predictions for 1000% returns by 2025. The project’s real-world use cases in decentralized AI solutions for industries that require secure, scalable infrastructure make it one of the most promising altcoins to invest in this year. Road Ahead for Lightchain AI Looking ahead to 2025, Lightchain AI is set to disrupt the blockchain and AI markets. As demand for decentralized AI solutions and blockchain scalability continues to rise, Lightchain AI’s platform will be well-positioned to meet these needs. The project’s combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world applications, and strong investor backing makes it one of the most exciting altcoins for investors looking for significant returns. As the crypto market matures, projects like Lightchain AI , which focus on delivering real value and addressing real-world problems, will gain prominence. For those looking for an investment that goes beyond the hype, Lightchain AI offers a rare opportunity to get in early and benefit from its explosive growth.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Crossed Above Its 14-Day SMA In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed a pattern that has recently formed in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The “Coinbase Premium Index” is an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This indicator is useful for determining how the buying or selling behaviors differ between the userbases of the two cryptocurrency exchange titans. Positive values imply the users on Coinbase are buying at a higher rate or selling at a lower rate than the ones on Binance. Similarly, negative values imply that Binance users have pushed the BTC price higher than on Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Breaks Equilibrium: Whales Scoop Up 240,000 BTC Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index, as well as its 14-day simple moving average (SMA), over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index plunged under its 14-day SMA and into the red territory last month. The cryptocurrency’s price plummeted alongside this venture into the negative zone for the indicator, suggesting the shift in the metric occurred not because of Binance users buying more, but rather due to Coinbase investors taking to selling. The activity of Coinbase users, who are predominantly from the US, has actually played a key role in BTC price action this year, with the asset’s value often finding itself closely mimicking the trend in the Coinbase Premium Index. Thus, it’s not surprising to see that these investors were the drivers for the recent crash as well. From the chart, it’s visible that users on the exchange continued to sell into the new year, but during the last few days, the metric has finally shown a reversal. With this surge, its value has crossed back above the 14-day SMA, potentially implying a return of momentum in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 20%, But Social Media Still Bearish: Green Signal For Rally? CryptoQuant has pointed out that the last time the cryptocurrency showed a similar trend was back in November. Following this previous crossover, the indicator saw a break into the positive region, alongside which Bitcoin enjoyed a rally from the $69,000 level to the new all-time high of $108,000. It now remains to be seen whether this is the start of a fresh wave of buying from American traders and if it would be similarly bullish for BTC this time as well. Signs have been looking positive so far, as the asset has witnessed recovery above the $100,000 mark since the crossover appeared. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $100,900, up over 7% in the last week.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 03:07:00

Fusing AR, AI, and GPS technology into a stylized low-poly world, this upcoming MMORPG invites players to explore real-world locations, conquer lands, and meet heroes spanning from ancient legends to futuristic warriors. The finish line is in sight, with the final stretch of development planned over the coming months, and excitement is already building for what promises to be a genre-defining launch. At its heart, Chaos on the Chains is all about strategic depth wrapped in an ever-evolving narrative. From forging alliances to launching full-scale invasions, every decision made leaves a lasting mark in multiple realms. Thanks to GPS and AR, the borders of the in-game world intersect with the player’s own neighborhood—meaning they can literally expand their empire by stepping outside their front door. This real-world immersion is further enhanced by AI-driven NPCs and surprise appearances from the development team itself. One moment, they could be battling a historically inspired knight; the next, they might find themselves in a showdown with a developer—or even the CEO. Each season unveils new story arcs, quests, and in-game events, so there’s always a fresh challenge on the horizon. Whether players specialize in stealthy raids or prefer taking territories head-on, the open-world approach ensures they can progress on their own terms. And because Chaos on the Chains runs on mobile devices, their next great conquest is never more than a swipe away. Being Part of the Chaos: TGE In anticipation of our Token Generation Event (TGE), we’re excited to welcome new community members. Early adopters of the Chaos on the Chains token will enjoy exclusive perks, from limited-edition gear to priority access in future expansions.

Not much, especially when projects like Book of Meme (BOME) are pushing boundaries with decentralised storage for meme culture, and Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) keeps it lowkey with its relaxed vibe and growing community. With meme coins on everyone’s radar, these new contenders are grabbing attention, but can they deliver the same excitement as BTFD Coin, which is rewriting the rules with its high-yield staking and play-to-earn game? Meme coins have come a long way from their humble beginnings, evolving into a cultural phenomenon that blends entertainment, community, and financial opportunities. Among the newest contenders, BTFD Coin stands out as a potential game-changer with its impressive 90% APY staking rewards, the launch of its play-to-earn game on January 1, and a rapidly growing community of over 7,800 holders. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin, BOME, and CHILLGUY are the best new meme coins to buy this week . BTFD Coin: 90% APY Staking Creates a Bullish Buzz Have you ever wished for a meme coin that doesn’t just ride the hype but offers actual rewards for holding? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin ($BTFD) brings to the table. Currently, in its 13th presale stage at $0.000142, the project has already raised over $5 million, selling more than 63 billion tokens. Investors are drawn to its jaw-dropping staking programme, promising an annual percentage yield of 90%. Why does this matter? Let’s crunch the numbers. Imagine you invest $7,000 in BTFD Coin today. At the presale price, that fetches you approximately 49,295,774 coins. By the end of the presale, when $BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $29,577.46—a whopping 322% return! And that’s without factoring in staking rewards. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is among the best new meme coins to buy this week. Beyond staking, the coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has captured the community’s imagination. Released on January 1, it’s already being hailed as a fun and engaging way to earn tokens. With these robust features and an ethos of “buying the dip” with strategic investments, BTFD Coin is more than just another meme project—it’s a movement. Buying $BTFD is easy: Set up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Head to the BTFD presale page , connect your wallet, and buy. Claim your tokens after the presale ends. The 16-stage presale is moving fast, and if you’re looking to run with the bulls, now’s the time to join the BTFD revolution. Book of Meme (BOME): Weekly Gains Spark Renewed Interest If memes are the language of the internet, Book of Meme (BOME) aims to create its ultimate library. Trading at $0.006871, BOME has seen a modest 11.22% weekly gain despite a 35.8% dip over the last month. Its trading volume is up by 7.89%, indicating renewed investor interest. What sets BOME apart is its ambitious plan to immortalise memes on decentralised platforms like Solana, Arweave, and IPFS. The project’s experimental nature seeks to redefine how we think about web3 culture, merging the worlds of memes, degenerate trading, and decentralised social media. Imagine a future where your favourite memes are forever etched into the blockchain—this is BOME’s vision. However, BOME has faced challenges. Its all-time high of $0.5106 from March 2024 feels like a distant memory, but with its unique use case, there’s potential for recovery. Analysts suggest that as blockchain adoption grows, so will interest in BOME, especially with its planned expansions into Bitcoin inscriptions. If you’re a meme lover who believes in the power of decentralisation, BOME might just be your ticket to combining culture with investment. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Analysts Predict $0.70 and Beyond For those who love a bit of fun without the fuss, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is all about keeping things, well, chill. The coin, currently trading at $0.1952, has experienced a 25.27% rise over the past week, though it’s still down 54% for the month. Despite this, CHILLGUY is building a loyal fan base, particularly among Gen Z and TikTok users who resonate with its laid-back “lowkey” attitude. The meme character behind CHILLGUY—decked out in a grey sweater, jeans, and red shoes—embodies a vibe that’s casual and unbothered. It’s a vibe that’s caught on, with predictions that the coin could hit $0.45, $0.70, or even $1 if the community continues to grow. CHILLGUY is a great example of how meme coins can capitalise on cultural trends to build their value. Its community-driven approach and relatable branding make it a fun addition to any meme coin portfolio. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that meme coins continue to dominate the crypto space, each with its unique flair. Book of Meme (BOME) offers a creative, decentralised spin on preserving internet culture, while Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) captures the zeitgeist of laid-back, lowkey vibes. With 90% APY staking rewards, live P2E game, and a presale price primed for massive returns, BTFD Coin shines as one of the best new meme coins to buy this week. Don’t miss out on this chance to join the bulls and own the dip. The presale is heating up, and opportunities like this don’t come around often.

They’re not just about digital money anymore; they’re transforming industries like finance, gaming, and even real estate. With blockchain technology evolving at a breakneck pace, the question isn’t whether you should invest in crypto but which ones deserve your attention. This year, one name stands out: Qubetics ($TICS). While Bitcoin and Ethereum paved the way, Qubetics is addressing real-world problems in ways its predecessors couldn’t. From tokenizing assets to enhancing liquidity, Qubetics offers solutions that could redefine how we invest. Let’s dive into the top 7 leading cryptos to invest in this year. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Unlocking Real-World Asset Tokenization Imagine owning a piece of prime real estate or rare art without shelling out millions. Qubetics makes this possible through its tokenized asset marketplace, where physical and digital assets are converted into tradable tokens. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about accessibility. Fractional ownership means investors can access opportunities that were once reserved for the elite. Want a slice of a luxury hotel? Or perhaps a share in a promising startup? Qubetics turns these dreams into reality. By addressing the issues of limited liquidity and lack of transparency, Qubetics is a game-changer for investors and businesses alike. Its secondary market ensures seamless trading, making it easier to manage and grow your portfolio. The presale numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics has sold over 405 million tokens to 13,600 holders, raising $9 million. At $0.0455 per token, it’s one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. But don’t wait too long—prices jump 10% in the next stage this weekend. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Gold Standard You can’t talk about crypto without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the gold standard of digital assets. Its reputation as a store of value makes it a go-to for both seasoned and new investors. Bitcoin’s scarcity is its superpower. With only 21 million BTC ever to exist, it’s digital gold for a digital age. Whether you’re hedging against inflation or diversifying your portfolio, Bitcoin is as reliable as it gets. Sure, it’s not the fastest or most efficient blockchain out there, but its widespread adoption and network security are unmatched. If stability is your jam, Bitcoin is still one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. 3. Ethereum (ETH): The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that powers decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Think DeFi, NFTs, and even metaverse projects—all roads lead back to Ethereum. The move to Ethereum 2.0 has been a game-changer, reducing energy consumption and introducing staking rewards. This makes ETH not just a utility coin but also a lucrative investment. While gas fees can still be a pain, Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is hard to beat. If you’re looking for a versatile crypto with endless potential, ETH should be on your radar. 4. Polygon (POL): Scaling Ethereum Ethereum’s biggest problem? Scalability. Enter Polygon, the Layer 2 solution that makes Ethereum faster and cheaper. Whether you’re trading NFTs or using DeFi platforms, Polygon ensures smooth sailing without breaking the bank on gas fees. Its ecosystem is massive, hosting everything from decentralized exchanges to gaming platforms. And with partnerships from major global brands, Polygon isn’t just a crypto—it’s becoming a mainstream tech solution. If you believe in Ethereum but want something more cost-effective, Polygon is one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): The Fast and Scalable Blockchain Avalanche is all about speed. With transaction finality in less than a second, it’s perfect for applications that need high performance. From DeFi to enterprise solutions, Avalanche’s subnets make it easy to create custom blockchain networks. What sets Avalanche apart is its scalability without sacrificing decentralization. As demand for blockchain grows, AVAX is well-positioned to handle the load. Analysts are bullish, predicting significant price growth this year. If you’re looking for a crypto with both speed and scalability, AVAX should be on your list. 6. Ripple (XRP): Revolutionizing Payments Ripple’s XRP is a crypto with a mission: making cross-border payments faster and cheaper. Traditional banking systems are slow and expensive, but RippleNet is changing the game for financial institutions worldwide. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges, XRP’s utility keeps it in the spotlight. With partnerships in the banking sector and a focus on global adoption, Ripple is one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year if you’re looking for real-world use cases. 7. Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Blockchain Cardano is like the academic of the crypto world. Its research-first approach ensures that every upgrade is robust and sustainable. From energy efficiency to security, ADA checks all the boxes. Hydra, its Layer 2 scaling solution, promises to handle millions of transactions per second, making Cardano ready for mass adoption. Its ecosystem is growing, with projects in DeFi, NFTs, and social impact. If you value innovation and sustainability, Cardano is a no-brainer for your portfolio. Wrapping It Up Crypto investments can be overwhelming, but these seven projects stand out for their innovation and potential. Qubetics is leading the charge with its tokenized asset marketplace, solving real-world problems and democratizing investment. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational picks, while Polygon and Avalanche push the boundaries of scalability. Ripple and Cardano round out the list with their focus on payments and research-driven growth. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Ripple, and Cardano as the leading cryptos to invest in this year. Don’t wait—opportunities like these don’t last forever. Make your move today!

ETH is back to $3,350 and might struggle to start a fresh increase. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,750 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,675 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,450 resistance level. Ethereum Price Dips Over 8% Ethereum price remained stable above the $3,650 level and extended its upward move like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,680 and $3,700 resistance levels. However, the bulls failed to push the price above the $3,750 resistance. A high was formed at $3,742 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear move below $3,650 and $3,550. There was also a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,675 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $3,356 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,356 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,500 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,356 low. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,750 resistance zone or even $3,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,450 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The price is now battling to stay above the $2.30 mark and if the price breaks below key support levels, particularly $2.24, it may hint at a change in market structure. The current range has shown key phases like the automatic rally, secondary tests, and now a spring phase, where XRP is aiming for a breakout. This pattern has been observed before in other charts, like Binance Coin’s price action in 2023. We’re essentially waiting for the final breakout from the current range, which could happen soon. The accumulation phase that began in early December seems to be nearing its conclusion. While the breakout may take some time to fully unfold, the range is close to completing, and the next move appears to be to the upside. Support Levels to Watch The key support levels to observe are $2.23, $2.21, $2.17, $2.29, and $2.24. These areas should be monitored for signs of reversal, but a clear breakout above certain levels will confirm further bullish movement. Breakout Signals and Market Outlook A breakout above the 50% Fibonacci level at $2.35 would signal the end of the immediate downside and potentially mark the start of an upside move. XRP is known to react quickly to such breakouts, so traders should stay alert. The Patience Game After over a month of range-bound movement, the end seems near.

The question you should ask yourself this January is simple: which project offers the best crypto investment opportunity? Toncoin (TON), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) all present unique advantages, but only one is set to truly shine. Presale Token Remittix Stands Out For its Practical Focus Remittix takes a different approach by addressing real-world issues in the $150 trillion global remittance market. It uses blockchain technology to simplify cross-border payments and offers speed and cost-efficiency that traditional systems like SWIFT can’t match. The presale price is still only $0.0193 and already raised over $2.1 million highlighting the massive demand for Remittix in today’s financial landscape. Remittix’s unique PayFi protocol bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance and allows for seamless global transactions without hidden fees or delays. What sets Remittix apart is its ability to combine innovation with inclusivity. It targets underbanked populations and so brings financial services to regions that are often overlooked by traditional banking systems. Toncoin Shows Promise But Raises Questions Toncoin is attracting attention thanks to significant whale activity, with over 1.55 billion TON coins, valued at $8.86 billion, exchanged in a single day. This surge has pushed TON’s price to $5.744, with trading volumes climbing 4.94% over the past week. Analysts predict a potential test of the $6 resistance level if the current bullish sentiment continues. However, Toncoin’s reliance on large-scale transactions raises concerns. Whale activity often leads to volatility, making TON a less predictable option for those seeking stability. Despite being just 32% below its all-time high of $8.24, the token’s sideways trading pattern suggests it lacks the consistent momentum needed to sustain growth. Memes Meet Payment Potential in Dogecoin Dogecoin is in the spotlight once again. This time, it’s fueled by speculation surrounding its integration into Elon Musk’s X Payments platform. If realized, its inclusion in X Payments could revolutionize the coin’s use case and drive adoption among creators and users. Despite this optimism, DOGE remains heavily influenced by media hype and the endorsement of figures like Musk. While it has the potential to reach $1—requiring a 261% increase—technical indicators hint at short-term corrections. A declining RSI and negative MACD suggest a cooling period before further gains. Although speculative assets like DOGE can yield high returns, they come with increased risk, making them less attractive for those seeking a balanced portfolio. Why Smart Investors Favor Remittix While Toncoin offers short-term gains and Dogecoin rides on speculative hype, Remittix presents a balanced, utility-driven investment. Its focus on addressing inefficiencies in cross-border payments aligns with the growing demand for practical blockchain solutions. Furthermore, the ongoing presale allows investors to secure RTX tokens at an attractive entry point, maximizing potential returns. Institutional investors often prioritize projects with clear value propositions and scalable market potential. Remittix meets these criteria, leveraging blockchain’s strengths to deliver real-world impact. In comparison, Toncoin’s reliance on whale activity and Dogecoin’s dependence on media-driven rallies make them less predictable choices for long-term portfolios. The Smarter Crypto Investment For those seeking sustainable growth and a tangible market impact, Remittix offers a compelling alternative to speculative assets. With its presale providing early entry, January is the time to explore RTX as a cornerstone of your crypto investment portfolio with its price projected to climb a massive 600% before the presale completion!

Starting January 8, 2025, DEEP is available for trading in the Korean Won (KRW) market. The trading will commence at 3:00 PM with a base price of 230 KRW, giving users the opportunity to trade the token directly against the national currency. Bithumb Launches DEEP Token Trading on Sui Network According to the Bithumb notice , DEEP token will work only on the Sui network, and the token deposits from other networks will not be accepted. The deposits and withdrawals were opened right after the announcement of the official timing limit which was two hours. According to Bithumb, it takes 20 network confirmations for deposits to be credited to users’ accounts. To foster a fair and secure trading process during its launch, some certain measures have been put in place. New buy orders are not accepted in the primary market during the first five minutes of trading session. The sell orders are also limited to within ±10% and ±100% of the base price during this time period. Additionally, the automated trading will be allowed only after the first trade has occurred. An official said in an interview, “These measures are put in place to protect the market and prevent price manipulation during the initial trading period.” The listing of DEEP comes after Bithumb added other tokens like PEAQ and Vana to its KRW market in recent days. Deposit and Withdrawal Guidelines In compliance with the Travel Rule, Bithumb has observed that deposits and withdrawals shall only be made through supported exchanges. Tokens received from other unsupported platforms will not be credited to users’ accounts and the refund process may extend to several months. Before transferring their DEEP tokens, users are recommended to double-check the deposit address as well as the network. The exchange also informed its users that dealings through restricted exchanges may result in account limitations in accordance with the exchange’s terms of service. “More specifically, when making deposits or withdrawals, please confirm that the token is on the same network and has the same address as your Bithumb account,” the exchange said. DEEP Token Performance and Technical Analysis The DeepBook Protocol (DEEP) has been quite bullish, with the price sitting at $0.1741 and a 24-hour trading volume of $56.1 million as of the time of writing. On the DEEPUSD 3-hour chart, the market has formed a rising wedge pattern, which is a bearish pattern. During the rally, the price is trading close to the resistance level of $0.1750 with the support levels being at $0.1536(50 MA) and $0.1174 (200 MA). DEEP/USD (source: TradingView) On the DEEP price chart the short-term 50 moving average is currently positioned above the long-term 200 moving average. This crossover is usually seen as a buy signal, meaning that the token has continued to rise in the short-term. Nevertheless, it seems that this momentum is slowing down as the price nears the upper border of the wedge. If the price falls downward from the pattern, analysts believe that it may continue to decline to $0.10 levels. On the contrary, if the $0.1750 level is breached on the upside, then there could be an upward trend.

The crash in crypto prices today was attributed to a significant rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the past decade. Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a report showing the December Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the private sector reached 54.1, up from November’s 52.1, adding to market volatility. Major altcoins also witnessed sharp declines, with most falling by 5% to 10% in the past 24 hours. Meme coins faced similar pressure, as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by 8% to 10% within the same timeframe. The global crypto market fell approximately 6%, now standing at $3.38 trillion. However, trading volume surged by 27%, reaching $162 billion as investors reacted to the market downturn. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL Down Major Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) saw sharp declines during the market crash.

Czech Central Bank Governor Opens the Discussion,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-as-a-reserve-asset-czech-central-bank-governor-opens-the-discussion/,"Governments and central banks, from the United States to Switzerland, are giving Bitcoin serious consideration as an alternative to traditional reserve assets, with the Czech Republic being one of the latest to signal interest. The governor of the Czech National Bank (ČNB), Aleš Michl, has floated Bitcoin as a potential diversification strategy for the country’s foreign exchange reserves. The latest comments signal a growing government interest in cryptocurrency as a savings tool. Czech Republic Joins The Bitcoin Conversation In an interview with CNN Prima News, Michl mentioned the possibility of acquiring “a few Bitcoin” for diversification purposes. However, he went on to clarify that such an acquisition would not constitute a significant investment for the bank. Any decision to purchase BTC would require approval from the ČNB’s seven-member board. The narrative surrounding Bitcoin has shifted significantly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2024. Once a skeptic, Trump has voiced support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset and proposed establishing a US BTC reserve to boost economic stability. Advocates of this plan suggest that Bitcoin’s finite supply could act as a hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar, with prominent supporters like Senator Cynthia Lummis arguing its potential as a valuable addition to national reserves. While critics in Congress have raised concerns, the idea continues to gain traction. Global Shift Toward Bitcoin Internationally, Switzerland is considering a similar step, with the Swiss National Bank exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin alongside gold in its reserves. A referendum could make Switzerland the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as an official reserve asset, aligning with its tradition of being a hub for financial innovation. In Germany, figures like former Finance Minister Christian Lindner have proposed that Bitcoin could help reduce dependency on the US dollar if adopted by the European Central Bank or the Bundesbank. Similarly, Hong Kong is also engaging in this global trend, as legislator Wu Jiezhuang advocated for integrating Bitcoin into financial reserves to ramp up economic resilience in December. This comes months after Legislative Council Member Johnny Ng stated that Hong Kong should follow the United States’ lead if the latter decides to implement a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Russia, too, has taken concrete steps to leverage Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international transactions in a bid to bypass Western sanctions and reduce reliance on the dollar. Meanwhile, Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People Party, officially proposed setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country.

His resignation marks the end of his tenure, during which he tirelessly pushed for the CFTC to have broader authority over cryptocurrency markets, though his efforts largely went unfulfilled. Behnam’s resignation date coincides with Trump’s inauguration, allowing the administration to appoint its Chief to drive its crypto policy agenda. Today, I announced my departure from @CFTC . After more than seven years at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, I will be stepping down from my position as Chairman on January 20th. My final day at the Commission will be Friday, February 7th. A 🧵 — Rostin Behnam (@CFTCbehnam) January 7, 2025 The CFTC has been in charge of commodity derivatives markets but has had little say regarding financial policy. The situation is about to change, and the agency is expected to be a critical player in President Trump’s administration, eager to advocate for more crypto-friendly policies. Behnam strongly pushed for CFTC to become the primary US crypto regulator While at the helm of CFTC, Behnan pushed for his commission to become the main Bitcoin regulator and have powers to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges. The entity also examined and sometimes tried to obstruct firms that allowed Americans to bet on US election outcomes. Behnan’s advocacy to give the commission legislative authority over crypto failed during his tenure. However, things look promising with the Republicans taking control of Congress and the White House. The CFTC could become more vibrant, expanding its jurisdiction to include major tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The CFTC chair joined the commission in 2017 as a member, and by 2021, he assumed the chairmanship position in an acting capacity. A year later, he was sworn in to become the official chairperson of the agency. Previously, he worked as an aide to former Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow. Several candidates have been suggested to replace Chairperson Behnam As Behnam prepares to leave, attention has turned to who will replace him. Many expect President Trump to elevate one of the two Republican commissioners, Summer Mersinger or Caroline Pham, to the role of chair. However, the president transition team has also fronted external candidates , including former Republican Commissioner Brian Quintenz, Josh Sterling, a former official, and Neal Kumar, an industry attorney. According to sources, the permanent chair must be approved by the Senate. The CFTC, as a crypto “regulator” under Behnam, appeared soft to the crypto industry and operated differently from the Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Gary Gensler. The SEC chair is a hardliner who made regulation decisions that were not comfortable for the industry. Despite its soft approach, the commission brought several lawsuits against crypto firms, including one that targeted the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX after it imploded in 2022. In 2023, it also charged Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao.

The price is now trading below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $204 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Solana Price Dips Again Solana price struggled to clear the $220-$225 zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $212 and $205 support levels. The price even dipped below the $200 handle. A low was formed at $196.73, and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $196 low.

The next major resistance is near the $210 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $196 low. The main resistance could be $213.

In a tweet published by José Maria Macedo, co-founder of Delphi Labs, BiG, which will manage assets close to €7 billion (about $7.2 billion) by 2023, announced this policy change.

He said, “Cryptocurrency is inevitable, banks are dead, and these abuses of power will only red pill more ppl (people) into moving their wealth on-chain.” You might also like: Merely 2.6% of Portugals own crypto assets, data shows It is noteworthy that this restriction seems to be exclusive to BiG. Fiat payments to cryptocurrency platforms are still possible through other Portuguese banks, such as Caixa Geral de Depósitos , the biggest bank in the country, according to user reports. Portugal has long been seen as a country that welcomes cryptocurrency. The Portuguese Tax & Customs Authority announced in 2019 that cryptocurrency purchases and sales were tax-free, meaning they were not subject to value-added tax or capital gains tax. However, Portugal implemented a new crypto tax scheme in 2023 that imposed a 28% capital gains tax on short-term (less than 365 days) cryptocurrency holdings while leaving long-term (more than a year) holdings tax-free, except some tokens, such as securities, and those from particular jurisdictions. This action by the BiG is part of a larger trend in Europe where regulations are becoming more scrutinized of cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions’ interactions with cryptocurrency platforms will be impacted by the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which attempts to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets throughout the European Union. Countries throughout the world are regulating cryptocurrencies in a variety of ways. For example, in September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, requiring that it be used for payments. However, according to recent sources, El Salvador has consented to reduce its Bitcoin ( BTC ) projects in order to obtain a loan of $1.4 billion from the IMF . Businesses will no longer be required to utilize BTC as part of the arrangement, and the government will buy fewer BTC. As countries attempt to strike a balance between innovation and financial stability and security, these developments highlight the dynamic and changing global environment of cryptocurrency regulation.

This news has sparked excitement, especially considering the ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple. With the January 15 deadline fast approaching, along with Trump’s inauguration and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s upcoming resignation, the next few weeks hold significant importance. Enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting to see how these events will impact Ripple and its future. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton took to social media and shared his thoughts on the incredible comeback of Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, in the past two years. Deaton highlighted Garlinghouse and Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty, as key figures in the industry’s turnaround. I love America, warts and all!

Deaton criticized the SEC for using harsh and unfair tactics during the case, including pressuring Ripple’s customers and partners overseas. Despite Ripple providing full records of every XRP transaction, the SEC still tried to force Garlinghouse to hand over his personal financial details, including credit card statements. “Not only was Ripple unfairly sued, Garlinghouse was individually sued (in a non-fraud case). Anyone familiar with the Ripple litigation, and I am, knows the SEC played dirty, pushing ethical limits,” Deaton wrote. Deaton said that Garlinghouse fought back against the SEC’s bullying and refused to give in. His efforts, along with the support of Ripple’s legal team, led to a victory for the company.

These playful, quirky digital assets have turned the crypto world upside down, and they’re offering huge potential for investors willing to ride the wave. But which meme coins should be on your radar for 2025? We’ve got the inside scoop on the top new meme coins for massive return potential. Starting our discussion with BTFD Coin, which features an eye-popping 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on staking. The presale raised over $5 million to this day, and analysts are predicting big things for the coin. At today’s presale price of $0.000142, BTFD Coin has already sold over 63 billion tokens, and it’s gaining momentum fast. With this level of interest and staking rewards that have heads turning, BTFD Coin stands out as one of the top new meme coins for massive return potential —but don’t take our word for it. Let’s see why it makes the cut alongside Notcoin, Neiro, and Simon’s Cat. 1. BTFD Coin: Staking at 90% APY – The Meme Coin Investors Are Raving About BTFD Coin has burst onto the scene and is making a major splash in the meme coin universe. What sets BTFD apart? Well, the secret sauce is its insanely high staking rewards—90% APY. That’s not just an attractive number; it’s a game-changer for anyone looking to maximise their crypto returns. By simply staking your BTFD Coin, you could see your holdings grow by nearly 90% annually. Talk about a way to make your investment work for you! Aside from staking, BTFD Coin offers a robust ecosystem that includes a community-driven project, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and some seriously bullish predictions from analysts.

Based on the beloved animated character, Simon’s Cat has captured the hearts of millions of fans around the globe. And with its focus on community-driven initiatives, this meme coin has solidified its place in the ever-growing meme coin market. What makes Simon’s Cat so appealing?

What truly sets Neiro apart is its connection to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In August 2024, Vitalik made headlines by donating over $500k to an animal welfare fund, marking his second-ever interaction with a meme coin.

38682011,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54025,1736313421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Spots Something Weird about XRP Pump,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-something-weird-about-xrp-pump/,"Market analysts are closely monitoring XRP’s price trajectory as its recent rally raised discussions about a potential extended bull run. According to cryptocurrency analyst Dom, significant shifts in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) could help XRP’s future price movements. In January 2025, XRP reached $2.45, marking a notable recovery that revived investor optimism. Based on historical market trends, Dom suggests that while the token recent gains are impressive, the true price surge might still be forthcoming. Relationship Between Bitcoin Dominance and XRP Performance Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market, is considered a key indicator for altcoin performance. Historically, significant drops in BTC.D have corresponded with periods of substantial growth for altcoins like XRP. Dom’s analysis said during the last two market cycles, Bitcoin dominance decreased by approximately 30%, leading to asset price increases exceeding 1,000%. In contrast, the current market cycle has only seen a modest 5% decline in BTC.D, suggesting the potential for further altcoin price appreciation if Bitcoin dominance falls further. Despite the relatively small decline in BTC.D, XRP has already achieved a remarkable 500% price increase since November 2024. The analyst believes this rally may be the early stage of a more substantial upward trend, driven by new capital entering the market. Altcoin Season Indicators The concept of “altcoin season” refers to a market phase where altcoins outperform Bitcoin, typically coinciding with a decline in Bitcoin dominance. Analysts are now anticipating the start of such a season, especially as BTC.D decreases gradually. XRP’s recent performance has fueled these expectations. In November 2024, the token surpassed the $1 mark for the first time in three years. This occurred despite Bitcoin dominance remaining high at around 58%. Dom described this as an anomaly, noting that the token’s growth usually aligns with a significant BTC.D drop. Market observers are now optimistic that a further decline in Bitcoin dominance will create favorable conditions for altcoins. Michaël van de Poppe, another prominent analyst, has emphasized the potential for significant altcoin gains during this phase. He attributes the current market strength to reduced regulatory uncertainty and the broader bullish momentum within the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Outlook Van de Poppe views the current market conditions as the onset of a new cryptocurrency bull cycle, offering substantial growth opportunities for altcoins. He believes the asset’s resilience during the extended bear market positions it well for potential gains in the coming months. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.43, reflecting a 10.77% increase over the past week. Analysts remain optimistic about its continued upward trajectory, particularly if Bitcoin dominance experiences further declines. In conclusion, the token’s performance demonstrates its capacity for substantial growth, even in the early stages of market shifts. Analysts expect the combination of declining Bitcoin dominance and increased market participation to soon drive significant opportunities for altcoin investors.

Coinbase Premium Index reveals bullish trends but hints at short-term dips ahead. Market capitalization rises as Bitcoin’s trading volume grows, signaling increased interest. Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone, drawing attention from investors globally. The cryptocurrency recorded a 1.65% gain, pushing its price to $100,894.81 with a market capitalization of $1.99 trillion. This upward movement highlights the influence of the Coinbase Premium Index , a critical metric reflecting U.S. investor demand. The index shows how market behavior impacts Bitcoin’s trajectory and could point to further price increases. Coinbase Premium Index: A Key Market Signal In November 2024, when the Coinbase Premium Index turned positive, Bitcoin surged from $69,000 to $108,000. This trend signaled increasing interest from U.S.-based investors using Coinbase. 3 days ago, Coinbase Premium Index crossed SMA14 for the 1st time in 26 days—Bitcoin is now up 4% to $102K.

Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin gained attention in 2024 after its launch. Most crypto lovers scrutinized the digital currency pegged to the US dollar. Initially, the stablecoin was deployed in the Ethereum blockchain and XRP Ledger (XRPL). So far, 58,823,317 . 55 RLUSD is in supply , with a total of 795 holders. RLSUD has experienced 1761 transactions since launch, pointing to activeness in the market. Of the token supply, 40,000,043.01 tokens, accounting for 68% of the supply, remain in the Ripple deployer account. XRP ETF is next online after Bitcoin and Ether ETF approval Monica Long showed optimism about the XRP ETF, stating that 2025 may see the launch of several ETFs, but XRP might be in line with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. She said there are already filings for the XRP ETF that are only waiting for approvals. The approval of the XRP ETF will be delayed further as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the approving authority, is undergoing a transition. XRP and the SEC locked horns in a legal battle in 2020, during which the regulator accused XRP of engaging in unregistered securities offerings. Ripple won the case, and despite the SEC suggesting a fine of $2 billion, the judge only fined them $125 million. The RLUSD has also gained access to DeFi through Chainlink. Integrating Chainlink Price Feeds provides RLUSD with the essential infrastructure it needs to deliver accurate and decentralized pricing data to DeFi applications. This ensures that protocols using RLUSD for a broad range of financial activities can operate reliably and transparently. XRP adoption in Japan could drive market growth The Ripple stablecoin launch was timely. It happened when banks in Japan were set to adopt Ripple’s XRP Ledger, which would tilt the financial technology landscape. As SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao announced, the integration will improve cross-border payments and simplify currency exchanges. The XRP Ledger is among the most efficient and low-cost solutions for international remittance. It has the potential to revolutionize global banking systems. If the system is adopted by only 1% of Japan’s $6.372 trillion banking sector, XRP’s market capitalization could rise by $63.72 billion, resulting in XRP trading at $3.50. The widespread adoption of XRP in Japan could be the trigger.

Recent developments include a strategic partnership with Chainlink to enhance the adoption of its RLUSD stablecoin in decentralized finance (DeFi) and predictions from Ripple President Monica Long about the potential approval of an XRP spot ETF in 2025. Ripple and Chainlink Join Forces to Advance RLUSD Stablecoin Adoption in DeFi Ripple, the blockchain-based payment protocol, has announced a strategic partnership with Chainlink, the decentralized oracle network, to enhance the adoption and utility of Ripple USD (RLUSD), its enterprise-grade stablecoin. The collaboration, unveiled on Jan. 7, will introduce Chainlink’s decentralized price feeds for RLUSD on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger. This integration is expected to bolster the stablecoin’s presence in DeFi by providing tamper-proof, real-time market data, ensuring reliability, and mitigating risks associated with price manipulation and downtime. RLUSD, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is designed to facilitate secure and cost-effective transactions across payments, trading, lending, and various DeFi applications. Ripple’s integration with Chainlink enables developers to leverage accurate and consistent pricing data, empowering them to build more robust and reliable decentralized applications (dApps) using the stablecoin. Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization and Alliances at Chainlink Labs, expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating that the integration “is a great signal for the market” and that the team is excited to support the RLUSD launch. RLUSD represents Ripple’s vision for blockchain-based finance, offering a bridge between traditional financial systems and decentralized technologies. The stablecoin's integration with Chainlink is expected to address common challenges in DeFi, such as unreliable market data, by ensuring seamless data flow across its decentralized nodes. Ripple emphasized that consistent and high-quality data will support smart contracts and reduce manipulation or inaccuracies in price feeds. By incorporating RLUSD into dApps, developers can create more efficient and secure DeFi solutions that cater to enterprise needs. Stablecoins like RLUSD are increasingly recognized as vital components of the DeFi ecosystem. They provide a stable store of value, serve as a hedge against market volatility, and enable low-cost, borderless payments. Ripple’s foray into DeFi through RLUSD demonstrates the growing intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology. The partnership with Chainlink also positions Ripple to accelerate the adoption of RLUSD, empowering developers to integrate the stablecoin into various financial services. According to Cunningham, Ripple’s ability to endure market volatility and regulatory challenges is evidence of its role as a leader in the blockchain industry. Chainlink’s Expanding Influence in Blockchain Integration This collaboration is another milestone for Chainlink, which has been actively expanding its network to support blockchain interoperability. On Dec. 10, 2024, Chainlink integrated with Project Diamond, a digital asset platform for global institutions launched by Coinbase. This integration provided data feeds and full lifecycle management for tokenized assets, further showcasing Chainlink’s capabilities in connecting public and private blockchains with existing financial systems. Through its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, Chainlink has established itself as a crucial player in bridging blockchain networks and traditional financial institutions, enabling seamless data transfer and secure transactions. Ripple’s partnership with Chainlink signifies a shared commitment to advancing blockchain’s role in mainstream finance. With RLUSD’s integration into DeFi supported by Chainlink’s trusted infrastructure, both companies aim to set new benchmarks for stablecoin adoption and utility. The collaboration aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to expand its influence in the DeFi sector, offering innovative solutions that cater to both retail and institutional users. By leveraging Chainlink’s decentralized oracle technology, Ripple is well-positioned to lead the next wave of DeFi innovations, further solidifying RLUSD as a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. Ripple President Monica Long Predicts XRP Spot ETF Approval in 2025 In related news, Monica Long, President of Ripple, has expressed optimism about the future of cryptocurrency spot ETFs in the United States, predicting that XRP could be the next digital asset to secure regulatory approval for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Speaking during a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg, Long forecasted that 2025 could mark a breakthrough year for cryptocurrency ETFs, with several launches anticipated. Long highlighted the growing momentum in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly around spot ETFs. Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in recent years, she believes that XRP is well-positioned to join this select group. Ripple’s confidence in the approval of XRP spot ETFs aligns with broader trends in the cryptocurrency market. Institutional interest in digital assets has surged, with spot ETFs offering a regulated and familiar framework for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. The launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs marked a pivotal shift in the regulatory landscape, setting a precedent that could pave the way for other cryptocurrencies like XRP to follow. Long’s comments suggest that Ripple is positioning itself to capitalize on this momentum, further driving XRP adoption in the financial sector. In addition to her predictions for XRP, Long emphasized that 2025 could be a transformative year for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Ripple anticipates increased demand for stablecoin products as adoption of blockchain-based solutions accelerates globally. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which was officially launched in December 2024, has already made its debut on several trading platforms, including Bullish. The stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, is designed to enable seamless transactions across payments, trading, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Long revealed that RLUSD is expected to secure additional listings on major exchanges in the near future, further expanding its accessibility and utility. Ripple has also hinted at forthcoming announcements regarding RLUSD’s availability, signaling continued growth in the stablecoin’s adoption. The integration of RLUSD into more platforms could enhance its role in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Positioning Ripple for Growth Ripple’s proactive approach to regulatory developments and its commitment to expanding its product offerings reflect its broader vision for blockchain-based finance. By advocating for XRP’s inclusion in spot ETF offerings and driving the adoption of RLUSD, Ripple is positioning itself as a leader in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Long’s comments shed light on the company’s strategic focus on both institutional and retail markets. With the anticipated approval of XRP spot ETFs and the growing adoption of RLUSD, Ripple aims to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to mature, Ripple’s leadership believes that regulatory clarity and innovation will be key drivers of growth. The potential approval of XRP spot ETFs in 2025 could mark a significant milestone, further legitimizing digital assets as an integral part of the global financial system. With its RLUSD stablecoin gaining traction and its efforts to secure regulatory approval for XRP ETFs, Ripple is poised to capitalize on the increasing demand for blockchain-based financial solutions.

Ripple’s executives meet the US President-elect Donald Trump According to a photo shared by Brad Garlinghouse on X, Stuart Alderoty and Garlinghouse dined together with Donald Trump. Garlinghouse used the caption, “Strong start to 2025!” Although it is evident that the three met, the meeting details are still unclear, but could be more inclined towards crypto legislation. The meeting comes at a crucial time for Ripple, the eve of a critical deadline for the case between the U.S. regulator and the blockchain venture specializing in cross-border payments. Great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty . Strong start to 2025! pic.twitter.com/UjM6lahUG4 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 8, 2025 Garlinghouse has recently expressed optimism about Trump’s future impact on the crypto industry. On January 5th, the executive highlighted on X that Trump’s bull market is real. Garlinghouse said Trump’s effect on the crypto industry is personal for Ripple. He cited the years-long battle Ripple had with the U.S. financial watchdog (The US SEC) under Gary Gensler’s reign. According to the X post, Garlinghouse explained that Gensler’s SEC effectively froze business opportunities for Ripple in the United States. He also emphasized that the optimism behind Trump’s involvement in the digital asset landscape is “obvious and well deserved.” Garlinhouse also explained that 75% of Ripple’s open roles originate from the U.S., compared to the last four years when a vast majority of Ripple hires were outside the U.S. Garlinghouse also detailed that Ripple has garnered more US deals since Trump won the elections than in the preceding six months. Garlinghouse said that Trump and his incoming administration, including crypto-oriented appointments Scott Bessent, David Sacks, and Paul Atkins, are already jumpstarting innovation and job growth in the US despite the fact that he has yet to be sworn in. Garlinghouse also expressed his belief that the “Trump effect” is already making crypto great again. During an interview with 60 Minutes, Brad Garlinghouse said Trump embraced crypto, and crypto embraced Donald Trump. According to crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, Ripple’s XRP has shed 3.19% in the last 24 hours, bringing its seven-day gain to 10.58%. The digital asset boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $8.2 billion and a market capitalization of $133.4 billion at the time of this publication. Trump meets crypto exchange CEOs Brian Armstrong and Kris Marszalek The Trump-Garlinghouse-Alderoty dinner is Trump’s latest meeting with leading crypto figures since his re-election on November 5th. On November 19th, Trump’s newfound influence in the crypto industry resulted in a call between the president-elect and Coinbase’s founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong. Sources familiar with the meeting anonymously revealed that Armstrong and Trump mainly touched on crypto appointments, although the two did not discuss specific individuals and appointments. During the campaign period, Armstrong and his company donated nearly $50 million to support pro-crypto candidates, including the president-elect, who once claimed crypto and Bitcoin were scams. On November 18th, The Wall Street Journal reported that Armstrong and Trump were going to meet privately, but no further reports have surfaced to confirm if the meetup happened. On December 17th, Trump also met Kris Marszalek, the CEO of crypto exchange Crypto.com, at the Florida golf course. According to an anonymous lead from a source familiar with the meeting, the two discussed crypto-related appointments and Trump’s plan to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the U.S. Treasury. In October, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after receiving a Wells notice indicating the regulator’s intention to bring an enforcement action against the Singapore-based crypto exchange. However, the exchange voluntarily withdrew the suit, citing its intentions to work with Trump’s incoming administration.

As BTC price faced a 5.46% plunge, Ethereum price marked an 8.97% drop, trading at $3,348 while XRP & SOL recorded 4.25% & 9.12% loss, respectively. Dogecoin & Cardano also faced massive pullbacks of over 10% & 9%, with the other altcoins marking a similar pullback. The global trading volume has reached above $170 billion with a rise of over 33.12%, while the market capitalisation dropped to $3.36 trillion, a 6.38% squeeze. What went wrong? Why are crypto markets plunging hard? Two prominent events are scheduled for a short while now: ADP Nonfarm Employment and the FOMC minutes. While ADP is a sneak peek into the labour market’s health, setting the tone before the big reveal, the FOMC minutes dive into the minds of the Fed. It sheds light on their perspective about the rates that will have an impact on the BTC price. What’s next for the BTC price and the entire market? Considering the liquidations, they have again reached the peak of around $558 million in long, with Bitcoin alone recording close to $100 million. However, the pressure has not waned yet as the tokens continue to face equally for either side. The above liquidation heatmap by Coinglass suggests the bears are setting up shorts at interesting levels. If the Bitcoin price rebounds to $98,600, then over $35 million will be liquidated, and if it further reclaims levels above $103,300, then more than $66 million will receive the same fate. In short, the traders still appear to be either pessimistic or are unsure of the sustainability of the start token. However, the volatility rollercoaster is always good to maintain a healthy trend and hence, a potential drop is expected to attract significant volume onto the platform. The start of 2025 has been recorded as one of the most bullish one’s in recent history, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, & other altcoins managing to hold above the pivotal range. Regardless of the corrections, some of the altcoins, like XRP, XLM, BNB, etc., and a few more are demonstrating strength, suggesting a rebound could be nearby. Meanwhile, the BTC dominance continues to remain within daire straits, which indicates a potential altseason may also be on the horizon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 05:46:23

Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, dropped to $96,000 from $102,000, marking a significant fall. Here are the key reasons why Bitcoin’s (BTC) price drops. Key Reasons for the Drop Bitcoin’s price dip coincided with a rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, driven by December’s stronger PMI data. The Institute for Supply Management reported a jump to 54.1 , up from 52.1 in November, signaling unexpected growth in the U.S. services sector This raised fears of inflation staying high, which could delay the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cuts. However, higher yields often hurt risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the November JOLTS report showed an increase in job openings, although hiring slowed down. Meanwhile, Worker confidence also dropped, as seen in the lower quit rate, which fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Impact on the Market The drop in the crypto market added significant pressure on traders, leading to the liquidation of $561 million worth of long positions in just a single day. The largest liquidation order came from Binance, involving $17.74 million in ETHUSDT. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies also suffered, with Ethereum losing over 8% and Solana falling more than 9%, and XRP by 5%. Bitcoin ETF Recorded an Outflow The price drop also negatively affected Bitcoin ETF inflows. After two consecutive days of inflows, Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows of $543.7 million on 7 January. The biggest outflows came from companies like Ark Investment, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity, all of which had previously invested large amounts into Bitcoin ETFs. What’s Next for Bitcoin? According to Glassnode analyst James Check , Bitcoin’s sell pressure is easing, but fresh demand is also slowing. Spot trading volumes have dropped by 53% since November, showing reduced market activity. However, if the market regains momentum, reaching $100,000 again remains a key target for traders. On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $95,668 support level the price could drop further to $93,625.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 05:57:51

Table of Contents Rollblock presale bringing web3 disruption to the gaming masses Solana ‘stupid bullish’ according to seasoned analyst Sui rises 600%: Is this just the start? Rollblock taking the lead to disrupt the GambleFi space Sui has recently emerged as a worthy contender to take on the speed of Solana. While it will likely find a place in the crypto top 10 before long, many investors are instead allocating to the GambleFi platform Rollblock (RBLK) , which is being tipped for astonishing 50x growth as it scales this year. Rollblock presale bringing web3 disruption to the gaming masses Rollblock solves a fundamental problem at the heart of the $500 billion online gambling industry: being manipulated or changed behind closed doors. Rollblock delivers a blockchain-backed alternative to traditional gaming, securely inscribing all transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain and allowing its gamers to verify that everything is as it should be with a couple of clicks. Thanks to this disruptive potential, Rollblock has enjoyed phenomenal growth recently, recording a 600% surge in deposits and signups for the month of December. This is expected to double in January as word of mouth spreads. Rollblock recently introduced a sports betting league, allowing for live bets across thousands of international sporting events. There are also over 700 fully immersive, AI-powered gaming experiences that deliver truly memorable gaming experiences. All payouts are made using the native currency RBLK, which offers holders a huge range of rewards, including the ability to stake coins for up to 30% in risk-free passive income. These staking rewards are not printed out of thin air, as is so often the case in crypto gaming. Instead, each week, the platform will buy up RBLK on the open market, creating a deflationary supply that means RBLK grows scarcer over time. 60% of these purchases are immediately burned, while the rest reach the diamond-handed staking community through staking rewards. It looks likely that stage 9 coins will sell out in the coming days, leading the RBLK price to rally from the current level of $0.0445. You might also like: Here are the expected bull market top prices for XRP, Solana and Rollblock Solana ‘stupid bullish’ according to seasoned analyst Solana has enjoyed a double-digit gain this week, rising by over 12% to reach $215. For a brief time, Solana was trading over $220 this week, following its bounce from $175 in recent weeks. Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal remains incredibly bullish on Solana, commenting that “the long-term Solana chart is stupid bullish…” He shared a chart on X to show that Solana has broken out of its channel and flipped resistance to support. This could be enough to send Solana convincingly above $300 in the weeks ahead. Sui rises 600%: Is this just the start? Pal is also exceptionally bullish on Sui , claiming that this upstart layer-1 chain is “pressing its nose against the ceiling… After this, it should go into hyperspace.” Sui is regarded as a potential Solana killer, offering rapid transaction speed and effortless DApp deployment. Sui has been on a tear recently, gaining 23% this week as the Sui price hit $5.16. After a 600% rally in 6 months, Sui is possibly due for a period of consolidation here but could continue to surprise in Q1. Rollblock taking the lead to disrupt the GambleFi space Going into 2025, Sui and Solana will continue to dominate the layer-1 space this year. However, Rollblock has the momentum and potential to disrupt the GambleFi niche offering massive returns in the process. Early adopters have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this project, and many have already reaped the rewards of Rollblock’s rapid ascent with over 300% gains to date.

Related Reading: Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon Binance Netflow Data Signals Accumulation Phase A recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, sheds light on Binance’s Netflow data from the past 90 days. According to Kesmeci, whenever the Netflow SMA14 moves into positive territory, Bitcoin tends to face short-term selling pressure, leading to temporary corrections. Conversely, when this indicator turns negative, it suggests a shift in investor sentiment toward accumulation, potentially signaling a short-term bullish trend. On January 6, 2025, Binance’s Netflow metrics revealed some notable insights. The Netflow on Binance recorded a value of -5,407 BTC, while the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA14) for Netflow stood at -483 BTC. These negative readings indicate that more Bitcoin is leaving the exchange than entering it, a behavior commonly associated with investor accumulation. Binance Netflow SMA14 Turns Negative “Both metrics confirm that investor behavior on Binance is leaning toward accumulation. This trend strongly supports the case for upward movement in Bitcoin’s price over the short term.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/jSkRZ2TjLk pic.twitter.com/Rau37VjBQN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 7, 2025 Historically, such trends have acted as early indicators of potential upward price movement, as reduced Bitcoin availability on exchanges reduces immediate selling pressure. When Bitcoin holders move their assets off exchanges, it usually signals their intent to hold long-term rather than sell. This pattern of behavior contributes to a supply squeeze scenario, where lower liquidity on trading platforms creates upward price pressure. The fact that Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume gives this indication more credibility as the platform often serves as a barometer for broader market sentiment. Kesmeci concluded: In summary, both metrics confirm that investor behavior on Binance is leaning toward accumulation. This trend strongly supports the case for upward movement in Bitcoin’s price over the short term. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to be losing steam, as recent price action shows limited strength to sustain a rally. Just 24 hours ago, Bitcoin was trading above $102,000 after a 4% uptick. However, the asset has since retreated, erasing most of those gains and stabilizing just above the $100,000 threshold.

Accompanied by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, the dinner highlights Ripple’s expanding influence amidst the changing regulatory environment in the US, sparking optimism for the crypto market in 2025. With plans to slay 2025 with IPO and stablecoin Ripple is all set to acquire its lost territory. This closed-door meeting could be much more than just what we can imagine. Are we expecting an XRP ETF too? https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1876783603603939438 Ripple’s Dinner Date with Trump, What’s Cooking? On the social media platform X, Garlinghouse shared his excitement about the meeting, describing it as a “great start to 2025.” Alderoty also commented on the event with a lighthearted remark about the menu, but the dinner carries weighty implications. It comes as Ripple celebrates recent court victories against the U.S. SEC, solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto space. The meeting hints that Ripple can get through the legal battle with SEC and this meeting is very crucial since Ripple and the wider industry are manifesting for a dismissal of Ripple vs SEC setting a crypto milestone. Ripple is not losing ground Ripple’s groundbreaking legal victory against the SEC, which had accused the company of selling unregistered securities via XRP, continues to shape its future. Attorney John E. Deaton, a pro-XRP advocate, noted that Ripple’s transparency throughout the case underscored the SEC’s aggressive litigation tactics. Despite these challenges, Ripple emerged stronger, opening doors for further advancements in the cryptocurrency sector. Amid this legal progress, analysts are optimistic about XRP’s potential. Some forecasts predict the token could surge to $3, driven by increasing adoption and confidence in Ripple’s solutions. XRP currently trades at $2.44, with a 14% rise over the past week, signaling strong market momentum. Expanding U.S. Operations Ripple is also shifting focus back to the U.S. market, with 75% of its new positions now based domestically. The company secured more U.S. business contracts in late 2024 than in the previous six months combined, signaling robust growth. At the same time, political discussions, including those between Senator Cynthia Lummis and SEC chairman candidate Paul Atkins, emphasize the importance of regulatory reform to foster digital asset innovation. Ripple is currently holding its market position with new product launches, such as the RLUSD stablecoin, which is set to expand across multiple platforms. The company has also partnered with Chainlink to integrate secure pricing into the DeFi ecosystem, further boosting its valuation. As Ripple enters 2025, this epic meeting with Trump symbolizes a transformative year ahead, both for the company and the broader crypto space. With legal wins, product innovation, and strategic collaborations, Ripple is poised to lead the blockchain industry.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 06:05:47

Ripple’s Bold Predictions for 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market is manifesting for new crypto ETFs in 2025 which can help the market to recover the December losses. The top focus right now is XRP, Ripple President Monica Long has sparked fresh excitement in the crypto world, predicting that XRP could be next in line for spot ETF approval in the U.S. Following the SEC’s green light for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, the potential approval of an XRP ETF is gaining momentum, fueling speculation about Ripple’s future dominance in the market. XRP ETFs are crucial to bring fresh capital since Ripple needs financial backing to support its crypto plans this year. Ripple has lost over $150 million in the legal battle with the SEC over the years and with changing political scene they are confident that XRP will be back in again. Moreover, ETFs have given the market an option to diversify their investment with Bitcoin’s price touching $100K, new ETFs with low cap could bring more investors to the crypto space. Ripple’s Bold Vision for XRP In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Long revealed that several companies have already filed for spot XRP ETFs. Ripple expects these filings to gain traction in 2025, marking a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. Ripple’s ambitions extend beyond ETFs, with plans for an IPO, stablecoin expansion, and broader market influence, all of which signal its determination to solidify XRP’s position as a leading asset. Stablecoin Expansion with RLUSD Ripple’s recently launched RLUSD stablecoin is another key part of its growth strategy. Already listed on big platforms like Uphold, RLUSD is set to expand its reach further, with more major exchange listings expected soon. Long emphasized that 2025 is shaping up to be a significant year for the crypto industry, with stablecoins playing a vital role in driving adoption and growth. XRP ETF: Hype or Reality? Despite the positive sentiments so far, XRP has failed to touch its previous ATH of $3. Yet the market has high expectations with XRP ETFs as this could give the coins an instant boost like it did for Bitcoin last year. With recent developments, including Brad Garlinghouse’s meeting with Donald Trump and Ripple’s continued legal victories, the company is positioning itself as a major player in the next phase of cryptocurrency adoption. Ripple’s bold moves and strategic plans could make 2025 a defining year for XRP, potentially setting the stage for it to compete with Bitcoin and Ethereum as regulatory clarity unfolds.

This Altcoin Looks Primed for a Massive Price Rally in January 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/intelmarkets-intl-is-making-headlines-in-the-crypto-arena/,"The post Regret Not Buying Ethereum (ETH) & Solana (SOL) Early On? This Altcoin Looks Primed for a Massive Price Rally in January 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is one area where trailblazers are often the biggest beneficiaries. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are perfect examples—those who entered early have seen big returns. Nevertheless, IntelMarkets (INTL) is causing a lot of talk, and it may be one of the top crypto coins for 2025. This phase eight presale star has already soared 710%, and this number will continue rising. Since it aims to revolutionize crypto trading by launching the first AI-powered smart trading platform, experts hint it may be the next 3x token in 2025. Although market analysts like Crow and Iced have made some bold price predictions for ETH and SOL, all eyes are on INTL as it may have higher upside potential. IntelMarkets (INTL) Gains Traction As Price Surges 710% While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) show some good price growth, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making headlines in the crypto arena. It has managed to raise over $5M in its crypto ICO event so far. Projections indicate this number reaching $10M before January ends. With over 14M INTL tokens already sold in phase eight of its presale alone, it is clear interest is high. This altcoin will power the upcoming IntelMarkets platform , which aims to become the top crypto trading platform. It will be built with AI technology supporting every layer to accomplish this. Therefore, traders will use self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time and up to 1000x leverage on capital. These features could make IntelMarkets a fan-favorite for millions of traders. By holding the INTL token, people will get governance voting rights and up to 30% discounts on trading fees. Currently, one INTL costs just $0.073, which is a 710% rise from its starting price of $0.009. But phase nine of the presale will bring this altcoin price to $0.082. A Tier-1 CEX listing is also expected to bring INTL to $0.11. This could make INTL one of the altcoins to watch for fast returns. Crow: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) Will Hit $10,000 Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best cryptos right now. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has jumped nearly 10% in the past week alone. During that time, the Ethereum price surged from around $3,400 to over $3,600. Market analyst Crow remains bullish on Ethereum (ETH). According to his X post, this altcoin will trade at $10,000 in 2025. This Ethereum price prediction has excited many traders. However, the high market cap of the Ethereum coin, which now stands at $438B, may slow its growth. Since ETH will need a lot of new money for its price to surge, many traders are sidestepping it for tokens like INTL, which will not face this issue. Solana (SOL) Price Could Reach $300, Expert Claims As one of the top 10 altcoins, Solana (SOL) has also been showing some good price growth. On the one-week chart, the Solana price increased from around $190 to over $210. In other words, it saw over a 10% surge in just a few short days. Thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Iced, the crypto community is excited about Solana (SOL). In a recent X post, he told his followers that this token may soar to $300 as his Solana price prediction. Nevertheless, even if the Solana crypto manages to see a price surge, many traders think its highest upswings have passed. On the YTD chart, its value has soared over 120%. This could make a lot more investors turn to INTL instead. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Like Ethereum (ETH) & Solana (SOL)? The crypto market hardly ever allows do-overs, but IntelMarkets (INTL) could be one of those rare opportunities for those who missed out on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). In 2025, INTL is seen to become a game-changer with its groundbreaking technology, strong fundamentals and upside potential. Since it will also tap into the AI market, which could be worth $826B by 2030, as per Statista, its long-term growth potential may stand out. Due to all these factors, experts foresee a potential 3x surge in 2025 for this altcoin.

DOGE plunged 10%, with Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, BNB Chain’s BNB and ether (ETH) down at least 7%. Bitcoin fell 5.5%, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, fell 7.1%. Crypto-tracked futures betting on higher prices saw liquidation of $560 million, data shows , setting a relatively high level at the start of the year. Losses in crypto tracked those in U.S. stocks. The latest Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on U.S. service providers was stronger than anticipated, with the prices-paid measure reaching its highest point since early 2023. Concurrently, U.S. job openings rose more than forecasted. These developments led to a decline in Treasury securities across various maturities, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May. A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the inability to meet the margin requirements. When many traders are forced to sell at the same time due to long liquidations, it creates a cycle where falling prices lead to more liquidations, which in turn causes prices to drop more. As such, market watchers consider Tuesday’s drop to be a blip in the long term. “Markets took a hit yesterday, with Bitcoin and Ethereum dropping hard, mostly because stronger-than-expected U.S. job data dimmed hopes for more rate cuts this year,” shared Vince Yang, CEO and cofounder of zkLink in a Telegram message. “It’s the kind of broader sentiment shift we’ve seen before, nothing unusual for crypto.” “That said, we are still optimistic. History shows these dips often pave the way for bigger bullish movements, especially with where we are in the market cycle now, and with a more crypto-friendly administration in the US coming in, there’s every reason to believe we’re heading for some exciting times ahead,” Yang added. Singapore-based QCP Capital, however, sticks to their view of a shaky period for crypto markets in January. “It won’t be smooth sailing into January, as structural risks loom,” QCP said in a Telegram broadcast on Wednesday. “The U.S. Treasury debt ceiling reinstatement is projected to be reinstated mid-month, requiring the Treasury to adopt ""extraordinary measures"" to fund government expenditures.” “This could trigger market volatility as discussions around the issue intensify,” QCP added.",Markets,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-08 07:11:06

This coalition intends to support over 4 million users who were adversely impacted by the WazirX hack that occurred in July 2024, in which the exchange lost $230 million . Protection for the Sufferers of the Grand Theft The WazirX WazirX - legal@wazirx.com Centralised Exchange Crypto trading and Information security breach brought down about 45% of the entire crypto assets of the exchange and made the users unhappy. The most important element of the recovery plan developed by coinswitch coinswitch - Centralised Exchange is to enable victims to reclaim their funds, receive some of the rewards, and get back into the cryptocurrency trading business. The program , which is being run completely from scratch with the funds that CoinSwitch has on its balance, speaks about the sincere desire of the platform to create trust in the Indian crypto market . The crypto exchange CoinSwitch which has recently garnered investments from Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and Coinbase Ventures has $300 million in its funding pool and has registered over 20 million users. Staples of the Recovery Program The ₹600-crore recovery plan, valid for 24 months, offers affected WazirX users: Upfront signup rewards: On this basis, qualified users will be able to earn up to 10 per cent of the deposited funds within 2 years. Referral benefits: This is good news to users as it means they can be able to reclaim up to 5% of the deposited amount, by providing information to other victims of the hack. Revenue redistribution: The trading revenues that will result from the program will be collective trade that will be recovered proportionally in different user losses. Accordingly, the users of the platform must produce their WazirX account balance statements to validate their statements. CoinSwitch will keep track of such losses, compute them, and disburse them. Co-founder of CoinSwitch Ashish Singhal stated that the company continues working to support the crypto community even in the moments it is under pressure. He said, Once WazirX starts allowing withdrawals from crypto, such claims can be analyzed, AUM ascertained and the subsequent rewards calculated. The exchange platform that hosts 33% of Indian crypto consumers noted that 87% of its consumers contribute roughly 8% towards claims on any of the platforms it has. However, the exchange said that it incurred a loss of more than ₹1,900 crore because of the hack. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : CoinDCX Users Slam Exchange Over Withdrawal Restrictions and Delayed Support , This relief, CoinSwitch expects users to regain within 6-8 months of WazirX unlocking funds.

Beyond these, CoinSwitch is also actively helping the affected community and, in the process, ensuring that the platform is also supporting the sustainable development of the sector. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Let’s discuss how this meeting impacts XRP price and price prediction for January 2025. Read More: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Confirms Mar-a-Lago Meeting with Donald Trump Impact of Ripple CEO & President-elect Donald Trump’s Meet on XRP Price A recent X post revealed that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghosue and CLO Stuart Alderoty met with President-elect Donald Trump for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. This development for Ripple comes after Brad Garlinghouse’s recent comment about the most “ pro-crypto congress ” ever. It shows that things are falling into place for the crypto space but more so for Ripple and XRP. Ripple CEO Meets President Donald Trump This meeting could be considered one of the most bullish developments for Ripple and XRP after their win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two reasons. Reason 1: Crypto has been in the crosshairs of regulators under Biden’s administration. Digital asset companies and developers were being sued. However, with Trump winning the US presidential elections, the outlook has flipped on its head. The recent dinner with Trump is a subtle hint that 2025 will be a good year for Ripple with the “backing” of Trump and US regulators. Reason 2: Ripple’s win in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit propelled XRP’s value to double in under 24 hours. Unlike this situation, the meeting with Trump will likely serve as a foothold that helps XRP, the remittance token, flourish in the long run. These reasons will open the door for partnerships that could positively impact the price of Ripple (XRP) . How will this development affect XRP price prediction for January 2025? Will it help raise the targets or reduce them? XRP Price Prediction This XRP price prediction for January is divided into two phases. The initial phase involves a correction that allows investors to accumulate XRP. The next phase will see Ripple skyrocket to new highs. The four-hour chart shows that XRP rose 126% between November 26 and December 3, pushing the price from $1.28 to $2.91. After this impulse move, a lack of bullish momentum coupled with profit-taking pushed Ripple to consolidate between the $2.17 and $2.91 range. XRP price today trades at $2.30 after 6.17% on Tuesday, but it’s likely to continue its descent. The key support levels for a short-term buying opportunity include the demand zone, extending from $1.99 to $2.13 and the 62% Fibonacci retracement level at $190. Investors must note that Bitcoin will be crucial in determining bias for XRP and the rest of the crypto markets. A recent CoinGape article noted that Bitcoin could sweep December lows before kickstarting a bull run. This drop in BTC aligns with the aforementioned correction thesis for Ripple, making these dips an opportunity to accumulate XRP. XRP/USDT 4-hour Chart XRP Price Targets For January 2025 Ideally, the timeline for a dip into $2 to $1.90 territory should occur around January 20, 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated. The last week of January 2025 should see a comeback in Bitcoin and altcoin season, allowing XRP to flourish. Investors who accumulated dips in the aforementioned zone should consider booking profits at 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $3.36, just under the all-time high of $3.40. From late January to early February, XRP price could set up a new ATH at around $3.5 to $4.0. Concluding Thoughts The meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President-elect Donald Trump could have a positive impact on XRP’s price. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the recent win against the SEC, Ripple is poised for a bullish run. The predicted correction in January 2025 will provide investors with an opportunity to accumulate XRP, which could then skyrocket to new highs, potentially reaching $3.5 to $4.0 by early February 2025.

On Tuesday, Jan. 7, the asset topped $102,000 after gaining 10% over the past week. However, most of those gains have now been wiped out . Nevertheless, BTC remains within its rangebound channel, which started to form in mid-December when it fell from its all-time high. Liquidations Near $700M Over the past 24 hours, over 235,000 traders were wrecked, with total liquidations coming in at $695 million, according to Coinglass. Around 90% of those were in long positions, with over $300 million being liquidated in both BTC and ETH trades. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance, with an ETH/USDT position valued at $17.7 million. “Cryptocurrencies saw a sharp correction due to plummeting US stocks such as Nvidia and Tesla,” commented derivatives provider Greeks Live, adding that market sentiment has turned pessimistic. It noted that the “mainstream view is affected by the strong dollar and the decline of US stocks, the trend of Bitcoin has not changed, the bull market is still there.” Others have suggested that the market nuke was due to hotter-than-expected jobs data in the US. The long end rallying is due in part to hotter than expected job openings, but maybe the real reason it is going up is due to ISM prices paid which also just came in: Actual: 64.4 Estimated: 57.5 Prior: 58.2 Has not been this high since Feb. 2023, making the market wonder if… — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 7, 2025 It was a “nasty reaction to the ISM PMI,” said CEHV partner Adam Cochran, who added: “This pushed investors over the edge to no longer expecting a high likelihood of rate cuts moving forward.” In a note on Jan. 8, 10x Research restressed the importance of macroeconomic data in predicting Bitcoin price movements. “The strengthening of the US dollar and the rise in US bond yields have been clear manifestations of these emerging headwinds,” for global liquidity and Bitcoin’s relationship with it, they stated. Altcoin Bloodbath Total capitalization has fallen by 7% to $3.53 trillion at the time of writing as the altcoins took the brunt of the losses and $225 billion exited the space. Ethereum took a massive hit, slumping 8% in a fall below $3,400, where it remains at the time of writing. ETH has now wiped out all gains over the past five days. The altcoins are a bloodbath as usual, with double-digit losses for Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche (AVAX), Hyperliquid (HYPE), Pepe (PEPE), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Bittensor (TAO).

In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $17.16 and $18.59, with an average price of $17.87. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily, it remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions.

The bearish swing remained high yesterday as the bears secured the lead. However, today the technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to support the cryptocurrency buyers. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise within global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, increasing the price to $2.284. The RSI, however, has risen above 52, the continual upside in the past week lead to a considerable improvement. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to nearly double from its current level. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Will XRP reach $10? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a high chance of reaching $10 by 2028. It is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.91T trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. Currently, the coin is trading at five times its value last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $18.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network A substantial XRP transfer valued at over $1 billion coincided with a 12% surge in XRP’s price on January 2, 2025. On-chain analysis showed Ripple transferred 500 million XRP from its escrow account to a different Ripple-owned wallet. Read more about it here .

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In 2025, XRP is trading near the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-08 07:21:00

There’s a lot of support from experts for both top altcoins, but a third token is getting the more popular backing. FXGuys ($FXG) is a new crypto project that intends to raise the bar on trader welfare and newfound profits in the market. Think of it as a DeFi token sporting the bullish potential of a meme. Here is more on SOL, XRP, and $FXG and if they can turn $100 into $10,000. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Solana Prediction: SOL Price Set to Hit $260 Solana is one of the more vibrant networks in the crypto-verse, and last year was proof. While its SOL token didn’t have much going for it in terms of development, the meme coin frenzy that started with BONK and WIF sparked quite the run for the top DeFi token . And no, SOL might not be able to turn $100 into $10,000, but its price movements are promising, and investors are anticipating an uptrend. Currently, several analysts are backing SOL for a surge close to its ATH. The trend features a reversal from its descending channel, one that would see the already bullish Solana price hit $260 from its current $207. With SOL so close to its ATH at $263, the next stage from there is price discovery. SOL might not be able to turn $100 into $10,000, but FXGuys has the potential. FXGuys: Proprietary Trading to Propel New Crypto $FXG traders are about to become the biggest winners in the market, and the reason is not far-fetched. FXGuys is fronting a new development in crypto trading–proprietary trading. Proprietary trading is a concept where traders get to access capital funding to maximize their trading potential. In other words, FX Guys will be giving its traders capital funding so that they make more profits than they would have with their limited portfolios. The traders only have to buy trading challenges on the platform (the packages run from $25 to about $1100) and pass the objectives on the challenges to qualify for capital funding. The capital ranges from $2,500 to about $100,000, and traders get to keep 80% of their trading profits, while investors get the remaining 20%. Traders can access a range of trading instruments, as the FX Guys platform features the most diverse range of trading instruments\. About 120,000 trading instruments are available from the stock, Forex, crypto, and tokenized assets markets, giving any trader quite the list to choose from for their portfolios. With a portfolio that diverse, trading risks are at the barest minimum. The FXGuys project promises a paradise for crypto traders, and it’s no wonder that most of them are investing in $FXG tokens from the presale. You should be too, trader or not. Ripple (XRP) Could Be In for a Meteoric 2025 Ripple has had four difficult years so far, as its drawn-out lawsuit with the SEC saw the project stagnate significantly. Donald Trump’s administration promises a conducive regulatory environment for the crypto-verse, and tokens like Ripple’s XRP might be seeing some relief after all. XRP is preparing for better times ahead, too, as the on-chain metrics have improved greatly. Open Interest and Relative Strength Index are showing strong investor interest, with an 80% spike on the card. The most recent forecast saw XRP go 80% up if the token got past its $2.34 resistance. Ripple’s XRP is currently trading at $2.4 , 11.07% up on the weekly timeframe, and raring to rise rapidly. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Is the Best Bet to Turn $100 Into $10,000! After the dismal performances of many top altcoins like Solana and XRP. However, the SOL token has started the new year with an impressive momentum. Ripple’s XRP token is also getting positive shouts, especially following the change in government in the US. Both top altcoins and the new $FXG DeFi token have been predicted to turn $100 into $10,000 by mid-year. Meanwhile, $FXG is offering 150% in its presale to start off in the short term. The presale gains the short-term potential on SOL and XRP, and investors have now invested more than $3.3 million in the new crypto’s ongoing presale. New investors can get $FXG tokens now in Stage 2 at $0.04 and anticipate the launch date when the price goes up to $0.10. Join the bullish movement and lock in potential gains to turn $100 into $10,000.

Với mức ATH (mức giá cao nhất) mới đây của Bitcoin vượt $108.000, chúng ta thấy thị trường vẫn đang rất mạnh mẽ. Mặc dù khả năng điều chỉnh sâu hơn trong quý 1/2025 vẫn còn đó, nguồn cung thì ngày càng thắt chặt hơn, nhưng tâm lý lạc quan của các thợ đào cho thấy Bitcoin có vị thế tốt để tiếp tục tăng trưởng trong trung hạn. Tỷ lệ dự trữ thanh khoản , chỉ số theo dõi thời gian nguồn cung hiện tại đã giảm mạnh từ 41 tháng xuống chỉ còn 6,6 tháng, tức là lượng Bitcoin sẵn có trên thị trường chỉ đủ đáp ứng nhu cầu trong 6,6 tháng. Điều này cho thấy nguồn cung Bitcoin đang cạn kiệt nhanh chóng, đặc biệt rõ ràng trong các đợt tăng giá mạnh vào quý 1 và quý 4 năm 2024. Các thợ đào Bitcoin, những người thường bán ra lượng lớn Bitcoin trong những năm diễn ra halving, đã giảm lượng Bitcoin chuyển lên sàn giao dịch kể từ tháng 4/2024. Lượng Bitcoin mà thợ đào gửi lên sàn đang ở mức thấp nhất trong nhiều năm, vì họ đang nắm giữ lợi nhuận chưa thực hiện lớn và hold Bitcoin thay vì bán. Áp lực bán tổng thể từ các thợ đào, nhà đầu tư dài hạn và các nhóm khác đã giảm đáng kể . Việc giảm nguồn cung vào thị trường đã làm giảm bớt tác động của đợt điều chỉnh gần đây. Kết thúc năm 2024, nền kinh tế Mỹ với những bằng chứng tiếp tục cho thấy sự phục hồi , tuy nhiên, điều này cũng đi kèm với một số bất ổn kéo dài trên một số lĩnh vực chính. Thị trường lao động vẫn duy trì mạnh mẽ , khi số đơn xin trợ cấp thất nghiệp giảm xuống mức thấp nhất trong 8 tháng là 211.000 vào cuối tháng 12, bất chấp những dự đoán và củng cố niềm tin vào sức mạnh của nền kinh tế. Sự sụt giảm bất ngờ này, cùng với sự sụt giảm trong các yêu cầu tiếp tục, cho thấy thị trường lao động đang hạ nhiệt với tốc độ vừa phải mà không báo hiệu một cuộc suy thoái trên diện rộng. Dữ liệu lao động tích cực đã thúc đẩy tâm lý thị trường, củng cố đồng đô la và thúc đẩy mức tăng khiêm tốn trên Phố Wall. Ngược lại, lĩnh vực xây dựng lại cho thấy một bức tranh ảm đạm hơn, với chi tiêu bị đình trệ trong tháng 11 sau mức tăng trưởng khiêm tốn trong tháng 10. Lợi nhuận trong xây dựng nhà ở cho một gia đình đã bị bù đắp bởi sự sụt giảm trong nhà ở nhiều gia đình và đầu tư công. Lãi suất thế chấp tăng cao, do thị trường dự đoán những thay đổi trong chính sách tài khóa dưới thời chính quyền sắp tới, đang đè nặng lên nhu cầu nhà ở và các dự án mới. Ngành xây dựng phải đối mặt với những khó khăn đi kèm , bao gồm cả thuế quan tiềm năng, tình trạng thiếu lao động và bất ổn thương mại, có thể cản trở tăng trưởng bền vững bất chấp khả năng thúc đẩy từ chi tiêu cơ sở hạ tầng trong tương lai. Trong khi đó, lĩnh vực sản xuất cho thấy dấu hiệu phục hồi nhưng vẫn chịu áp lực. Chỉ số nhà quản trị mua hàng (PMI) đã tăng lên 49,3 trong tháng 12, mức cao nhất kể từ tháng 3, nhưng vẫn dưới ngưỡng tăng trưởng là 50. Mặc dù sản xuất và đơn đặt hàng mới được cải thiện, nhưng ngành sản xuất đã phải vật lộn để phục hồi hoàn toàn sau một thời gian dài suy thoái do chi phí vay cao hơn từ việc Cục Dự trữ Liên bang tăng lãi suất trước đó. Việc cắt giảm lãi suất gần đây và triển vọng kích thích tài khóa dưới thời chính quyền sắp tới mang đến một tia hy vọng, nhưng những lo ngại về chính sách thương mại và nhu cầu toàn cầu biến động tiếp tục phủ bóng đen lên triển vọng của lĩnh vực này. Cập nhật về các tin tức tiền điện tử tuần trước: Nghị sĩ Hoa Kỳ Mike Collins đã tiết lộ các khoản đầu tư vào tiền điện tử Ski Mask Dog (SKI), với tổng giá trị mua vào từ 1.001 đến 15.000 USD. Hồ sơ của ông, một trong những hồ sơ đầu tiên cho năm 2025, nhấn mạnh sự giao thoa ngày càng tăng giữa tài sản kỹ thuật số và chính trị, dấy lên nghi vấn về tính minh bạch và giám sát theo quy định. Trong khi đó, sàn giao dịch tiền điện tử FTX đã ngừng hoạt động vừa khởi động kế hoạch tái cấu trúc để hoàn trả cho những người dùng trước đây bị ảnh hưởng bởi sự sụp đổ năm 2022 của sàn. Khách hàng đã nộp đơn yêu cầu có thể mong đợi được hoàn trả trong vòng 60 ngày, với các yêu cầu nhỏ hơn sẽ được ưu tiên. MicroStrategy cũng đã công bố kế hoạch huy động tới 2 tỷ USD thông qua việc chào bán cổ phiếu ưu đãi vĩnh viễn. Sáng kiến ​​này là một phần trong “Kế hoạch 21/21” đầy tham vọng của công ty nhằm đảm bảo 42 tỷ USD trong ba năm để mua lại Bitcoin. Là công ty nắm giữ Bitcoin lớn nhất, với hơn 145.000 BTC, công ty tiếp tục củng cố vị thế của mình trên thị trường tài sản kỹ thuật số. Chúc các bạn một tuần giao dịch thành công!

The price of Bitcoin dropped drastically after topping $100K the day prior. The dip also affected major cryptocurrencies and caused over $150 million in liquidations. As of the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 4% in the last 24 hours and hovers around $97,000. Ethereum also experienced an 8% dip in the last 24-hour period, while Solana dropped by more than 7% and XRP dropped by around 5%.

Crypto market correction leads to major liquidations Crypto Market Suffers Biggest Drop In A Month The crypto market experienced its largest sell-off in nearly a month today. Bitcoin dropped over 5%, Ethereum fell around 8%, and Solana and XRP also saw declines. The total market cap decreased by 7.6% to $3.6 trillion, with $507… pic.twitter.com/f8nXKWbDat — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 8, 2025 The crypto market correction led to major liquidations, as data from CoinGlass showed that $388 million worth of long and short positions were nuked over the last 24 hours. The data also revealed that $230 million worth of liquidations came in the last four hours alone, with long positions making up the vast majority of the liquidations at $212 million. The data indicated that the figure was lower than the single largest 24-hour or hourly liquidation seen in the last month, which was around $856.7 million. The figures also revealed that more than 129,900 cryptocurrency traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours. The CoinGlass data highlighted that the largest single liquidation order was an ETHUSDT position on Binance, valued at more than $11.9 million. Crypto stocks MicroStrategy and Coinbase also dropped by more than 9% and 8%, respectively, while Bitcoin miners Core Scientific and MARA Holdings fell more than 6% and 7%, respectively. U.S. job openings data causes share drop in crypto prices “TLDR on why the market is dipping: US data came in hot, causing a bond yield spike. ISM index higher than expected, JOLTS job openings increased. We’re in the “good data is bad data” phase of the market for risk assets ahead of FOMC in 2 weeks.” ~ Miles Deutscher , Crypto analyst. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released new data on Tuesday showing 8.1 million job openings at the end of November, the highest level since May 2023 and an increase from the 7.84 million released in October. Data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also revealed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. Tuesday’s report also disclosed that the quitting rate, a sign of confidence among workers, dropped to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The hiring rate also dropped to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Consensus Cloud Solutions also revealed that it expects the U.S. economy to add 163,000 jobs, down from the 227,000 additions seen in November. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the signs of slowing in the labor market as “loser than pre-pandemi,” as the quitting and hiring rates fell lower than before the pandemic. The drop in crypto prices also came amid a sudden increase in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which climbed six basis points to 4.69%. Data released by the Institute for Supply Management indicated faster-than-expected growth in the U.S. service sector in December, which added to concerns about stickier inflation. Bank of Corp. strategists also predicted that traders could return to perceiving strong economic data as negative because it signaled that the Fed will need to keep rates elevated for longer. The central bank signaled last month that although it was cutting rates a third time, it may make fewer rate cuts in 2025 than investors had anticipated. Rate cuts have historically had a positive effect on Bitcoin, while hikes have had a negative impact. Thomas Tzitzouris at Strategas disclosed that this is bad news, and it is not just for Treasuries. With corporates trading at their tightest levels of the cycle adjusted for default risk, we’re entering a “danger zone” for both risk assets and safe havens.

However, at the time of writing, Ethereum has declined by more than 9% and is now trading below $3,350. Ethereum’s 1-month high is at $4,098.29, while the 1-month low is $3,103.37, showing the current range within which Ethereum has been trading. According to experts, a break below $3,540 could signal the end of the bullish momentum and favor a bearish scenario. In this case, Ethereum could experience a correction, with support levels between $2,400 and $3,160. If these levels hold, Ethereum may be able to recover and move higher. If the price continues to rise from here, the bullish Scenario would gain strength, and Ethereum could potentially reach $4,000 or more. A Look At The Technicals: Currently, the price action is stuck near the 3-standard deviation resistance at $3,620.49, which indicates a significant barrier to further upward momentum. Additionally, the 3-10-16 day MACD moving average has stalled around $3,613.10, signaling potential indecision in the market. Analyst Weighs In Analyst Josh of Crypto World said that Ethereum is currently forming a potential bullish pattern called an inverse Head and Shoulders on the weekly chart. However, this pattern is not yet confirmed. To confirm it, Ethereum needs to break above the $4,000 to $4,100 level with a weekly close. If that happens, it could set a price target near $7,000, offering a major trading opportunity. Right now, Ethereum is trading in a range. The resistance is between $3,900 and $4,100. For the short-term trend, the analyst said that Ethereum appears more bullish than bearish as it is making higher lows and higher highs, and has recently broken above a key resistance level.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 07:26:31

Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the price ranges inside which these few addresses still underwater bought their coins. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the amount of BTC that the holders last purchased inside the corresponding price range. Evidently, there are only very small dots associated with the levels ahead of the current spot price. In total, these ranges contain the cost basis of approximately 380,000 addresses. This may sound like a lot, but given the sheer size of the BTC userbase, this number makes up for less than 1% of all holders of the asset. Address cost basis levels are considered important in on-chain analysis due to the fact that investors are more prone to making moves whenever their profit-loss status is about to flip. Holders who were in loss prior to the retest (that is, when the retest takes place from below) might respond by selling, as they could fear the price would go down again in the future, making this potentially their only opportunity in the near term to get their money back. This selling can visibly affect Bitcoin if the level being retested contains the acquisition level of a large amount of investors. At present, though, the ranges ahead of the asset are clearly quite thin with addresses, meaning they should likely offer little in the way of resistance from such panic sellers.

The more lopsided the market gets, the higher is the probability of a mass selloff happening. With almost all Bitcoin investors sitting in gains right now, some of them are bound to exit their positions. It only remains to be seen whether demand would be strong enough to offset this selling pressure or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $97,900, up 3% over the past week.

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, surged past $102,000 yesterday, sparking renewed optimism among investors anticipating a market rally ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration. However, the gains were short-lived as Bitcoin dropped by 5.7% within 24 hours, weighed down by rising U.S. bond yields and investor caution ahead of key economic updates, including the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes and nonfarm payroll data. The increase in bond yields has fueled expectations of a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. Officials have already signaled plans for only two interest rate cuts in 2025, fewer than previously anticipated. Investors are now awaiting the Fed’s meeting minutes, set to be released on Wednesday, Jan. 8, for more clarity on policymakers’ deliberations. Further pressure on Bitcoin came from a U.S. Labor Department report revealing job vacancies had climbed to a six-month high, driven by growing demand in the services sector. It precedes the crucial nonfarm payroll report scheduled for Friday. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could solidify expectations of prolonged Fed tightening, as a resilient labor market may continue to fuel inflationary pressures.

Notably, this figure represents a 94% drop compared to the $987 million inflows recorded the previous day. According to data from SoSoValue, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only BTC ETF to record an inflow on Tuesday. The asset manager’s spot Bitcoin ETF drew in $596.11 million of inflows managing to offset the collective outflows seen from the other BTC ETFs. ARK and 21Shares’s ARKB logged the highest outflows of the day with $212.55 million exiting the fund. Grayscale’s two Bitcoin ETFs tickered GBTC and BTC also contributed to the negative momentum with $125.45 million and $113.85 million outflows respectively. Fidelity’s FBTC reported an outflow of $86.29 million while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw a more modest outflow of $5.58 million. The remaining BTC ETF saw “0” flows on the day. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume for these investment products stood at $4.62 billion on Jan. 7 a jump from the $3.96 billion witnessed a day before. AT press time Bitcoin ( BTC ) was exchanging hands at $96,145 per coin.

Pro-Bitcoin Pierre Poilievre is favored to become the next prime minister. Poilievre proposes policies to make Canada a global blockchain hub. Justin Trudeau’s resignation as Canada’s Prime Minister marks a crucial political moment, potentially opening the way for a pro-crypto agenda under Pierre Poilievre. Trudeau announced his decision to step down after 11 years as Liberal Party leader and eight years as Prime Minister since 2015. His tenure, marked by controversies such as imposing sanctions on cryptocurrency wallets during the 2022 Freedom Convoy protests, has often been viewed as anti-crypto. Aaron Arnold, host of the popular YouTube channel Altcoin Daily, analyzed how Trudeau’s departure could herald a new era for blockchain innovation in Canada. With Poilievre now emerging as the frontrunner for the prime minister’s role, as predicted by Poly Market with an 87% probability, Canada could become a global leader in the digital asset space.

Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin dropped by nearly 7% after reaching a three-week high. Ethereum followed closely, experiencing a nearly 10% drop. Bitcoin Faces Strong Selling Pressure Binance, the largest crypto trading platform by volume, showed a sharp rise in Bitcoin selling. According to Cryptoquant on-chain analyst Darkfost Binance’s hourly Net Taker Volume , a key indicator of market sentiment, turned significantly negative, hitting $325 million, the highest recorded in 2025. This drop happened after disappointing U.S. economic reports, including weaker-than-expected PMI and job openings data. These reports made risky assets like Bitcoin less attractive, leading to higher sell-offs. While some fear this could signal a long-term bearish trend, others believe it might just be a short-term reaction. Ethereum Sees Its First Big Drop of the Year Meanwhile, Ethereum didn’t escape the pressure, recording its first major price dip in 2025. The price dip comes amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve might skip an anticipated rate cut in its upcoming January 29 meeting Even though there’s no panic among Ethereum investors, yet ETH ETF flow into the exchange has seen an outflow of 86 million . Despite this, some positive signs are emerging, like Coinbase, another leading exchange, has seen buying momentum, likely supported by strong ETF data earlier in the week. If this trend continues, Ethereum could bounce back. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? While Bitcoin and Ethereum are under pressure, there’s still hope for a potential recovery if ETF inflows and buying interest rise. For now, experts advise caution, especially with upcoming events like Trump’s inauguration adding uncertainty to the market. Currently, Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 6.5% , trading at $95,433, showing a 6.5% decrease over the last 24 hours. This has also caused its market cap to fall to $1.89 trillion. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline, with its price now at $3,339, marking a 9% drop in the last 24 hours.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 07:40:03

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 07:43:00

The mid-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.6 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $2 billion, dropped over 11 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00001816 on Wednesday, during the early European session. As a result of the heightened volatility, more than $5.6 million was liquidated from the leveraged Pepe market, with over $4.9 million involving long traders. Moreover, the majority of the memecoin projects registered a double percentage digit loss in the last 24 hours. Major Factors that Attributed to Pepe Price Drop Today The notable decline of Pepe’s price in the recent past is majorly attributed to the whale shakeouts. For instance, a whale investor with 1 trillion Pepe units, worth over $18 million, deposited over 427 billion Pepe units, with around $8.45 million to Kraken in the last two days. Worth noting that the Pepe whale has accrued an estimated profit of about $13.45 million. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Dexscreener, Pepe traded in the past 24 hours majorly involved more sellers than buyers. Out of the $3.3 million Pepe traded on DeFi protocols, around $2 million involved sellers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Struggles: Bitcoin and Ethereum Face Selling Pressure , Midterm Targets After dropping below the 50-day Moving Average (MA), Pepe’s price has entered a slippery slope that could lead to further losses in the coming days. Although Pepe’s price is in a macro bull run in the weekly time frame, the memecoin faces a midterm drop of between 10-20 percent before rebounding towards a new all-time high (ATH). Furthermore, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) slipped below the 50 percent level, suggesting the sellers have overtaken the buyers in the midterm. However, Pepe and the rest of the crypto industry are highly anticipating the inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President to kickstart the next bullish trend phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 81,300 YouTube subscribers that based on historic precedence the TOTAL3 chart may soon have an astronomical breakout. The TOTAL3 chart tracks the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. “[In 2021] Bitcoin got to a really high price and just started chopping. And when it was chopping around, the TOTAL3 went to the moon.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Svenson predicts that the most explosive season for the alts will start around the 40th week after the halving event in April 2024, when miners’ rewards were cut in half, which would be around the end of January. “So in this cycle right now the altcoins are currently not even the 40th week post-halving. We haven’t even gotten the all-time high break. In the last cycle, when you broke that high, it was 170% for the TOTAL3 as a whole, 170% up. Maybe it won’t be as much a percent, but still, there’s a major move ahead of us… The most bullish part of the cycle has not even started yet, hasn’t even begun yet. So we have multiple more weeks to go where Bitcoin could get really, really bullish and continue to be bullish. And the altcoins also will look for a major pump over the next couple of months, in my opinion.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests the TOTAL3 market cap may reach around $2 trillion for the cycle peak, up from the current $982.2 billion. Svenson also believes that the flagship crypto’s dominance level (BTC.D) will soon start to decline. The BTC.D is the ratio between the market cap of BTC versus the market cap of all crypto assets combined. “What you’ll notice in previous cycles is that right after the 40th week – the halving takes place, 40 weeks later – that’s when [Bitcoin] dominance really starts to plummet… Once we get into this green zone past the 40th week that’s when I think Bitcoin dominance is going to start to take a big tumble, and altcoins are going to take over in dominance.” Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that BTC.D may dip to around 42% within six months.

This has resulted in top tokens breaking down their important support levels. Moreover, the SOL price has recorded a similar price action by dropping below its $200 watch level. Will the self-claimed “Ethereum-Killer” regain momentum and surpass the Binance (BNB) token to become the 05th most valued crypto token by this weekend? In this article, we present the possible short-term possibilities of the Solana (SOL) token. SOL Price Loses ~10%, Stands Below $200! The Solana price has plunged below its important price level of $200 with an intraday drop of 9.62%. Notably, with a trading volume of $5.243 billion, this altcoin has experienced a significant setback this week, indicating an increase in the bearish influence. TradingView: SOL/USDT With a Year-to-Date (YTD) return of +3.48% and a market capitalization of $94.719 billion, the Solana crypto is currently the 06th largest cryptocurrency by valuation. Solana (SOL) Technical Sentiments The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a sharp decline below the neutral point of the SOL price chart in the daily time frame. Further, with its average trendline recording a bearish convergence, this altcoin may continue losing value this week. The EMA 50-day shows a negative curve in the Solana price chart, indicating a bearish price sentiment. However, the 200-day EMA is strong support, highlighting room for a potential bullish reversal in the upcoming time. Is Solana A Hold Or Sell? If a bullish reversal occurs, the SOL coin price could reclaim the $200 mark and head toward its important resistance level of $209. Suppose, the bullish sentiment sustains at that point, this could push the price of this altcoin toward its upper high of $225. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, the Solana token could drop toward its support level of $190. Moreover, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could pull the price toward its crucial support level of $181. Curious to find out if the SOL crypto coin will ever reach $1000?

He also alleged that the current system restricts competition and creates barriers for validators outside the initial testnet participants. In so doing, Hyperliquid released a press statement in response to the accusations. The platform emphasized that all validators earned their positions based solely on testnet performance, rejecting accusations that seats could be purchased. Hyperliquid noted that such allegations trivialize the effort taken, by validators who dedicated a lot of time to learning and aiding to evolve the system. In an effort to further decentralize the network, the exchange has announced plans to develop the validator set as the blockchain ages. The Foundation Delegation Program is introduced to back the high-level validator and build up a more decentralized ecosystem. The group also dispelled the misconception about API server availability, that it is possible to run any server pointing to any node. Hyperliquid addressed concerns about the closed-code status of its existing node. The platform assured users that open sourcing will happen once development stabilizes and becomes secure. Hyperliquid’s Stance on Testnet Tokens and Market Innovation Responding to calls about testnet tokens, Hyperliquid restaffed the company’s position against a black market for testnet HYPE. This also presented current work to better the participation onboarding of subjects. The platform reaffirmed its commitment to fast innovation. It aims to put all financial transactions on-chain in a transparent and inclusive way. At the same time, dYdX’s CEO, in another statement, commented on the current controversy in that the criticisms against Hyperliquid’s validator model. He added that it is common for early-stage projects to face scrutiny regarding centralization as they scale and mature. He acknowledged the criticisms but stressed the need for robust technical systems. HYPE Token Price Drops Amid Concerns HYPE token has dropped sharply by 15% over the 24 hours to date and was trading at $21.62. The 24-hour low and high were $21.25 and $26.29, respectively. The market cap of the token was $7.24 billion and the trading volume was $213 million. As per Coinglass data, Hyperliquid Futures’ trading volume reached $7.45 billion, with $3.47 billion in open interest. HYPE Price Meanwhile, this Hyperliquid concern also comes amid soaring interest in the HYPE token. Notably, despite the recent dip, the token has added about 64% over the last 30 days. Besides, a recent CoinGape report showed that Solana’s price fell after a whale dumped its Solana reserves and exchanged them for HYPE . On the other hand, Hyperliquid mainnet has recently revealed a major update, which has also fueled market optimism. In a recent announcement, the project introduced the HYPE token staking feature on its decentralized exchange.

Trump wasted no time hyping up the announcement. The project’s first phase targets eight states: Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. These AI-powered data hubs, according to Trump, will put America at the top of the global tech ladder. “This is how we stay on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and advanced technology,” Trump said, standing in front of cameras at his luxury resort. What $20 billion buys Sajwani said, “We’re planning to invest $20 billion, maybe even more if the market allows.” The hubs will handle everything from powering advanced machine learning systems to crunching massive datasets for industries ranging from healthcare to self-driving cars. But the deal wasn’t just about the cash. Trump promised to cut red tape, fast-tracking the permitting and environmental approvals to get these projects moving. He claimed his return to power has inspired foreign investors like Sajwani to pump money into the U.S. economy. Trump is already pointing to this deal as evidence of the “economic revolution” he promised during his campaign. This isn’t the first tech megadeal the president has closed since winning the election. In December, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, to announce a mind-blowing $100 billion investment plan over the next four years. Trump’s message was clear: under his leadership, America will become the ultimate destination for tech and innovation. His economic playbook is basically, slash corporate taxes, roll back regulations, and push foreign companies to build on American soil. Trump’s hardline approach—using tariffs to protect U.S. industries and threatening penalties on companies that manufacture overseas—is scaring some business leaders. But others, like Sajwani and Son, see it as a golden ticket to tap into the world’s largest consumer market. Trump has also pledged to unleash all forms of energy—fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables alike—to meet the surging demands of AI infrastructure. Nvidia’s CEO joins the party While Trump and Sajwani are pouring billions into infrastructure, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, is eyeing how these developments could affect his company’s monster growth. Nvidia is the world’s top AI chipmaker, and has been at the forefront of AI hardware innovation. In a recent Bloomberg interview , Huang said he’s eager to work with the new administration, which hasn’t reached out to him yet. “We’ll provide as much insight as we can,” he said. Trump’s trade policies could make or break Nvidia’s global ambitions. The company already faces tight restrictions on selling its high-powered chips to China. If Trump doubles down on tariffs, Nvidia may have to rethink its strategy. What Biden is leaving behind In its final weeks, the Biden administration is rushing to roll out new rules to make it easier for companies to get permits for geothermal energy projects. These rules are part of a bigger push to boost infrastructure for AI data centers, according to insiders. The plan, which could drop as early as next week, includes setting up a competitive system for building data centers on federal land and speeding up approvals for geothermal and nuclear energy projects. The details are still being finalized, and the timeline might shift, said sources who spoke anonymously. But Trump has hinted he may reverse these policies with the stroke of a pen. Biden’s executive orders on AI safety and security are also in Trump’s crosshairs. While Biden sought to regulate the industry, Trump’s approach focuses on growth, competition, and speed.

This move comes as part of the region’s ongoing involvement with blockchain technology, which includes initiatives like Bitcoin mining. New Legal Framework for Digital Assets This decision comes just after the introduction of GMC Law No. 1 of 2024, known as the ‘ Application of Laws Act 2024’ . The law sets a clear legal and regulatory framework for businesses dealing with digital assets in GMC. This law, along with the decision to add Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB to the city’s reserves, strengthens the digital ecosystem in GMC. The region aims to foster a balance between technological innovation and regulation, offering a secure environment for digital assets to grow. Bhutan’s Bitcoin Holding Bhutan has been investing in cryptocurrency for a while, and its Bitcoin holdings have now surpassed $1 billion as the market rises . It ranks fifth in Bitcoin holdings, following the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. In addition to buying Bitcoin, the country has formed partnerships with Bitcoin miners. In May 2023, Bhutan allocated 5% of its GDP to Bitcoin mining, signaling its growing commitment to the digital asset space. What’s Next For GMC? Looking ahead, GMC is planning an international summit in March 2025 in Bhutan.

He has repeatedly warned of the crash in several prior posts on social media, which has sparked discussions in the market, especially as the market awaits the upcoming Fed’s FOMC minutes . However, in his recent X post, he has shared the potential reasons behind the crash, but still maintained his bullish outlook on Bitcoin. So, let’s take a look at his recent comments and see his intake on the recent market fundamentals. Robert Kiyosaki Shares Insight On Market Crash Renowned Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reiterated his prediction of a massive market crash, confirming that it is now a reality. In a recent X post, Kiyosaki referenced his 2013 book “Rich Dad’s Prophecy,” which forecasted the impending stock market crash. This has fueled crypto market concerns, as stocks and crypto often move in tandem, with investors awaiting the Fed’s FOMC Minutes from December. Reasons Behind The Recent Crash The author attributes the crash to the actions of leaders in 2008, particularly former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , who prioritized banker bonuses over the welfare of ordinary citizens. Besides, he notes that various sectors, including the car market, housing market, and retail, are currently experiencing a downturn. However, despite the grim outlook, Kiyosaki sees opportunities for savvy investors. He predicts that valuable assets like houses, gold, silver, and Bitcoin will become more affordable, presenting a chance to accumulate wealth. He also emphasized capitalizing on this by investing in real assets, including gold and silver mines. Lastly, the author advises readers to remain calm and informed, highlighting that market crashes can be a catalyst for growth and wealth accumulation. Why Is Bitcoin Crash A ‘Great News’? In a separate post, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has maintained his bullish stance on Bitcoin. As BTC price today slipped nearly 6% to $95,845 while its trading volume soared 36% to $66 billion, Robert Kiyosaki urged investors to buy more. Robert Kiyosaki’s On BTC Accumulation Notably, the author has recently called the ongoing Bitcoin crash “Great news” , which has sparked market discussions. However, he confirmed accumulating more BTC, saying that “Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale.” Simultaneously, he has urged investors to keep accumulating BTC at lower price and hold. This also showcases his growing confidence in the flagship crypto and its long-term perspectives. Besides, he also highlighted the limited supply of BTC, saying that only “2 million more Bitcoins” are left to be mined. Crypto Market Crash Fuels Concern The recent crypto market crash has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, as evidenced by the liquidation of $712 million in the digital assets space. Simultaneously, despite Robert Kiyosaki’s bullish take, investors are looking for potential reasons behind the recent drop in BTC price . Notably, the investors appear to have maintained a cautious stance as BTC soared past the $100K mark yesterday. On the other hand, the experts also warned over potential volatility with a flurry of key economic events scheduled for this week. For context, the US Fed’s FOMC Minutes is scheduled to be released today. The market saw a major pullback after the US Fed announced the last rate cut of the year last month. Having said that, the December FOMC minutes might fuel the ongoing market volatility. Simultaneously, the traders will also keep close track of the upcoming US Job data to understand the health of the Labor Market.

The forecast stems from his analysis of a distinctive price pattern observed in XRP’s weekly market cap chart. Following Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November 2024, XRP experienced substantial market appreciation. The digital asset’s valuation rose dramatically from $28.13 billion, when it traded at $0.50, reaching an unprecedented seven-year high of $165.74 billion as the price almost touched $2.9 in early December 2024. Half mast flags should complete within six weeks, otherwise they should be viewed with great suspicion. This flag in $XRP needs to rock and roll soon, otherwise it will likely morph into something else TBD. But if it completes, then market cap of $500 B is possible pic.twitter.com/c7BHqnQFkP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) January 6, 2025 Technical Pattern Suggests Further Growth According to Brandt’s analysis, XRP’s price action has entered a consolidation phase after achieving these significant milestones. The current market structure exhibits what he refers to as a half-mast flag pattern, characterized by a period of price compression between converging trendlines following a strong upward movement. Supporting technical indicators reinforce the pattern’s significance. The Average Directional Index (ADX) is at 39.95, indicating robust trend momentum. While trading volume has decreased during the consolidation period, this reduction aligns with typical flag pattern characteristics and often precedes significant price movements. Brandt emphasizes the time-sensitive nature of this technical formation. He believes the breakout will occur within approximately six weeks. If it exceeds this timeline, it could devolve into a different technical format, and Brandt noted that this development should be viewed with suspicion. However, if the pattern can complete its formation, Brandt says this could push XRP’s market cap to $502 billion, adding to the list of bullish predictions for a massive XRP market cap . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for XRP’s Market Position This projected market cap is almost four times XRP’s current market cap of $131.41 billion at its current price of $2.29. If its market cap climbs to $502 billion, XRP would have a price of approximately $8.74. Assuming Ethereum maintains its current market capitalization of $407.7 billion, this development could position XRP as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market. Despite his historical skepticism toward XRP, Brandt has recently adopted a more optimistic stance. In November, he identified $1.96 as a crucial resistance level , suggesting that surpassing this threshold could trigger substantial price appreciation. XRP subsequently broke through this level, which now functions as a support zone. Brandt further reinforced his bullish outlook in December 2024, when he identified an XRP chart he described as the most powerful in the crypto world. Other prominent crypto voices have shared their predictions that XRP can surpass Ethereum in the current cycle, and Brandt’s analysis has bolstered the bullish sentiment surrounding the asset.

The onshore renminbi fell 0.1% on Wednesday to Rmb 7.34 against the US dollar, its weakest since September 2023. According to a Financial Times report , the decline occurred despite the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) maintaining a steady daily fixing rate ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration. The renminbi’s exchange rate, which is allowed to trade within a 2% band of the PBoC’s daily rate, is now nearing the lower limit of that range. Analysts attribute the selling pressure to fears that proposed tariffs on Chinese goods could push Beijing to weaken its currency further, offsetting the impact on exports. International trades are an imperative component of China’s economic growth, because domestic demand is currently at a low. Market speculation and currency policy The drop in the onshore yuan, which sank below the 7.3 mark to a 14-month low earlier this week, has sparked speculation that the PBoC may adopt a more lenient approach to currency depreciation. Ju Wang, head of greater China foreign exchange and rates strategy at BNP Paribas, noted that the market has been pricing in these concerns since the US election. “ The market doesn’t want to give up, ” Wang said, adding that the central bank appears to be in “wait-and-see mode.” Wee Khoon Chong, a senior markets strategist at BNY Mellon, echoed these sentiments, citing market impatience for more significant movement in the renminbi. The currency’s slide coincides with strong US economic data, which has boosted the dollar and intensified selling pressure on the Chinese currency. Trade war 2.0 fears grow Concerns of a renewed “Trade War 2.0” under Trump have added to the yuan’s downward bias. The US President-elect’s campaign rhetoric echoed higher tariffs on Chinese imports. Markets fear that Beijing may strategically allow the renminbi to weaken to preserve its export competitiveness. These fears have reignited memories of past trade tensions, with both sides employing economic tools to gain leverage. While China’s currency faces pressure, a broader movement among BRICS nations seeks to reduce reliance on the US dollar in global trade. Currently, the dollar dominates approximately 90% of global transactions and accounts for half of all international trade. BRICS leaders argue that de-dollarization is not only a financial risk management strategy but also a way to mitigate exposure to US sanctions. Ray Dalio, CEO of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized the risks associated with holding US dollar-denominated assets. “ Sanctions mean freezing assets like US Treasury bonds. There’s concern among nations about being vulnerable to such measures ,” Dalio said. He added that direct transactions in local currencies could offer an alternative to using the dollar as an intermediary. Trump’s fiery stance on de-dollarization and BRICS When president-elect Donald Trump was campaigning for a return to the White House, has vowed to counter de-dollarization efforts. At a rally in Wisconsin, Trump pledged to maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. “ Many countries are leaving the dollar ,” he said. “ They’re not going to leave the dollar with me. ” Trump also warned that nations abandoning the dollar would face steep penalties , including 100% tariffs on their goods. Much like China, BRICS leading nation Russia is also facing a mountain of economic hurdles, although President Putin’s government is making bold moves to counter inflation. Russia’s central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 21% on Wednesday, defying widespread expectations of another increase to combat soaring inflation . Governor Elvira Nabiullina defended the decision, citing a need to pause after a series of aggressive rate hikes. The decision comes as Russia faces double-digit inflation and a sharp depreciation of the ruble, exacerbated by the economic pressures of its ongoing conflict in Ukraine. President Trump vowed to end the Ukraine-Russia war when he assumes office, much to the dismay of the latter nation. President Putin recently acknowledged the challenges of managing what he termed an “overheating” war economy. Critics within Kremlin-linked circles have expressed dissatisfaction with the central bank’s tight monetary policy, arguing it stifles the country’s economic growth.

Aside from BTC, Ethereum fell nearly 8%, Ripple dropped by 6%, and Solana slumped by nearly 10% in the 24-hour window. BTC Price Retraces Jan 6 Bump on New Congress Going into the work week, Bitcoin’s price picked up steam on Sunday after trading flat over Friday and Saturday around the $98,000 handle as it spiked to over $102,500 on Tuesday morning. That was most likely a result of the blockchain market’s enthusiasm for the incoming pro-cryptocurrency Republican Congress. US delegates for the 119th Congress took their oaths of office on Monday after convening in Washington, DC, on Jan. 3. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who oversees development for XRP—the third-most capitalized token without stablecoins (behind Bitcoin and Ethereum)— recently hailed the 119th as “the most pro-crypto Congress in history.” But on Tuesday, market euphoria over the new regime in Washington faded fast as a surge in US Treasury bond yields depressed prices for risk assets broadly. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin weren’t the only growth-oriented high-risk/reward assets to fall on Tuesday. Bitcoin’s Price Slumps on Treasury Yields The Nasdaq Composite focused heavily on the tech sector, fell by more than 2.5% before the close of Wall Street markets at 4 pm US Eastern Standard Time. By the end of the day, the Nasdaq had lost nearly 2% after recovering some in intraday trading. The Institute for Supply Management published new data on Tuesday indicating faster growth in December than analysts expected. Consequently, markets lost their nerve for US Treasury bonds on fears of more inflation in the US dollar. When the dollar weakens, and prices move up in a growing economy, bond coupons and their principal investment due back to the note’s owner on the maturity date lose value. So, markets sell them at a discount, causing bond yields to rise. Several analysts in retail and institutional finance have posted some exciting predictions for Bitcoin’s price in 2025. The sentiment overall for a continuing rally has been broadly bullish so far in January.

With its innovative capabilities in data processing and analysis, Lightchain AI is being hailed as the next big breakthrough in tech and finance. The excitement around this project has only grown with the launch of the Lightchain AI Presale, offering early investors an exclusive opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Lightchain AI’s AI-driven platform is already disrupting traditional models, and investors are recognizing its potential for significant growth. As momentum builds, Lightchain AI is carving out a prominent place in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and DeFi landscape. The Rise of Lightchain AI- A Revolutionary Blockchain-AI Integration Lightchain AI is revolutionizing the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence by introducing innovative solutions to longstanding challenges. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing valuable AI computations, enhancing network security and efficiency. At the core of its ecosystem is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which facilitates real-time AI tasks directly on the blockchain, ensuring scalability and privacy. By seamlessly integrating AI with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is poised to transform industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics, offering decentralized, transparent, and efficient solutions. Limitations of Toncoin and Solana- Why Investors Are Seeking Alternatives Investors are increasingly seeking alternatives to Toncoin and Solana due to several limitations. Toncoin’s growth is closely tied to Telegram’s ecosystem, which limits its broader appeal. Additionally, its utility remains largely confined to payments and basic decentralized applications, lacking groundbreaking features to distinguish itself in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. Solana, despite its high throughput and low transaction fees, faces challenges such as network outages and security vulnerabilities. Its reliance on a limited number of validators raises concerns about centralization, and the sophisticated technology can present a steep learning curve for developers. These issues have prompted investors to explore more robust and innovative platforms that offer better scalability, security, and decentralization. Why Lightchain AI is the Future of Decentralized Innovation Lightchain AI is poised to lead decentralized innovation by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its roadmap outlines a strategic progression: Prototype development is scheduled for November 2024, focusing on the introduction and testing of the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). By January 2025, the testnet rollout will enable real-world testing of AI workloads and validation mechanisms. Finally, the mainnet launch in March 2025 will mark the full deployment of PoI and AIVM, paving the way for industry-wide adoption. Security is a cornerstone of Lightchain AI’s design. The PoI consensus mechanism enhances network security by rewarding nodes for performing valuable AI computations, ensuring that network activity contributes to meaningful outcomes. Additionally, the AIVM provides a specialized execution environment for AI tasks, enabling seamless deployment of AI-powered applications on the blockchain. By addressing scalability, privacy, and efficiency challenges, Lightchain AI offers a robust and secure platform for decentralized applications, positioning it at the forefront of technological evolution. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 09:29:22

This potential 257% surge from its current trading price of $3,361, as per the data by CoinMarketCap, hinges on two pivotal factors: the successful deployment of Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and a supportive regulatory environment under Donald Trump’s presidency. Pectra Upgrade and Regulatory Optimism Dawson shared his insights in a recent interview , emphasizing that Ethereum’s success would require significant adoption of real-world assets (RWAs), robust inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and expanded utility in emerging tech sectors like decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and AI agents. He also highlighted Ethereum’s growing relevance in AI applications , with its layer-2 scaling network, Base, becoming a hub for AI agents. The Pectra upgrade, slated for the first quarter of 2025 , is expected to improve Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability, potentially attracting broader institutional and retail adoption. Dawson believes that enhanced interoperability driven by layer-2 solutions could further solidify Ethereum’s position in the crypto market. Bullish Options Market Suggests Ether Price Surge While Ether’s price has been relatively steady around $3,500 since December 20, the derivatives market suggests a bullish outlook. Dawson pointed out that on Derive.xyz, call options significantly outnumber puts, with 250% more open interest in calls. This reflects a strong appetite among traders for upward price movement. However, Dawson acknowledged potential risks to Ether’s bullish trajectory. A failure to attract institutional interest for a spot Ether ETF or losing ground to competitors like Solana could push ETH below $2,000 in a bearish scenario. He warned that other layer-1 blockchains offering higher risk-reward opportunities might challenge Ethereum’s dominance in a bull market. Long-term holder confidence in Ether has been rising , with the percentage of investors holding their tokens for over a year increasing from 59% in January 2024 to 75% by December, according to IntoTheBlock. This contrasts with Bitcoin, which saw a decline in long-term holders over the same period, reflecting growing optimism about Ethereum’s future prospects.

Posting on X (formerly Twitter) on January 8, Kiyosaki reframed the narrative around Bitcoin’s recent slide below $100,000—touching $95,000 before stabilizing at $96,000—as a rare buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. Kiyosaki’s playbook: “Buy Low, HODL Hard” While most investors were biting their nails, Kiyosaki was already filling his shopping cart. With only 21 million coins ever to exist and fewer than 2 million left to be mined, every dip in price reinforces his belief that demand will one day collide with dwindling supply. The author’s reaction was as sharp as ever when he took to X to make his stance crystal clear: “Bitcoin crashing. Great news. I continue buying Bitcoin because Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale. Remember ‘Buy low… and HODL.’ Less than 2 million more Bitcoins to be mined.” BITCOIN crashing. Great news. I continue buying Bitcoin because Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale. Remember “Buy low….and HODL.” Less than 2 million more Bitcoins to be mined. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 8, 2025 This approach isn’t new for Kiyosaki. He has consistently positioned Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a safeguard from economic instability—a sentiment that has only intensified with his broader economic outlook. Storm clouds and silver linings The financial guru didn’t stop at Bitcoin. He earlier delivered a grim forecast about the global economy, stating that the “biggest stock market crash in history” is already unfolding. His message was clear: be prepared for falling prices across the board. “Please be smart, keep your eyes and ears open. Many expensive assets such as houses, gold, silver, and Bitcoin will go on sale. I will be buying more real assets with fake US dollars.” I WARNED Y’all. 2013 Published Rich Dad’s PROPHECY.

Instead, Kiyosaki advocates converting cash into “real” assets like gold , silver , and Bitcoin . His plan is straightforward: buy tangible, scarce assets when prices fall to build long-term wealth. It’s important to note that Kiyosaki doesn’t put all his faith in Bitcoin alone. Gold and silver have long been his go-to assets for wealth preservation, and he frequently encourages his audience to diversify into these metals alongside cryptocurrencies. While he has mentioned other digital assets like Solana in the past, his focus has shifted back to the fundamentals, investments that he believes can weather financial upheavals.

BTC was trading above $100,000 since January 6, when it reached an intraday high of $102,464. However, its decline saw the price plummet below $100,000 to its current $96,278. The price is down almost 6% over the past 24 hours, with sellers firmly in control. The rest of the crypto market fared no better, with Ethereum (ETH) plummeting over 9% to slip below $3,500. Solana (SOL) also dipped below $200 after shedding over 9% and is currently trading around $197. Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted almost 10% and slipped to $0.352. Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Chainlink (LINK), Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC) , Uniswap (UNI) and other altcoins also registered substantial losses. Bitcoin (BTC) Plummets Below $97,000 Bitcoin (BTC) registered a shard drop on Tuesday to slip below $100,000 after stronger-than-expected economic indicators put pressure on risk assets like crypto. According to data from Coin Metrics, the flagship currency fell to a low of $96,525, dropping over 5%. Crypto stocks, including MicroStrategy, Mara Holdings, Core Scientific, and Coinbase also registered substantial drops. The decline comes after a sudden increase in the 10-year US Treasury Yield following data released by the Institute for Supply Management showed faster-than-expected growth in the US service sector, adding to concerns about inflation. Market watchers expect BTC to reach $200,000 this year, with investors hopeful a clear regulatory framework will support digital asset prices and benefit crypto stocks. However, the uncertainty surrounding rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact crypto prices. The Fed signaled it would make fewer rate cuts in 2025, a decision that rattled markets. A Surge In Liquidations The cryptocurrency market saw a surge in liquidations after Bitcoin (BTC)’s unexpected drop below $100,000. Data from Coinglass showed that over $200 million in long positions were liquidated in an hour. A total of $483 million in long positions was liquidated in 24 hours. Other altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), also registered substantial drops, with ETH slipping below the crucial $3,500 level and SOL dropping below $200. While lower than the single largest 24-hour or hourly liquidations seen in December/January, the numbers are still significant, with over 129,900 traders liquidated in the past 24 hours. The largest liquidation was seen on Binance, with nearly $12 million liquidated. US CFTC Chair To Step Down Rostin Behnam, the Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will step down on January 20, signaling the end of a four-year tenure that saw significant enforcement action in the crypto sector and calls for stronger regulations. Behnam oversaw several high-profile cases, including a $4.3 billion settlement with Binance. However, he expressed concern about the lack of oversight in the digital asset space, describing current regulations as insufficient. Under Behnam, the CFTC finalized Federal guidelines for carbon offset trading and expanded oversight into digital assets. He also ensured action against Binance for operating illegally in the US as an unlicensed crypto derivatives platform and failing to comply with regulations. He also flagged regulatory gaps in the crypto markets, arguing many tokens qualify as commodities and should come under the CFTC’s jurisdiction, calling upon his replacement to deliver “renewed focus” for more clarity. Meanwhile, Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and the current head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, has emerged as the top pick to replace Behnam. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted below $100,000 after dropping over 5% on Tuesday as markets turned bearish after stronger-than-expected economic indicators put significant pressure on risk assets. BTC slumped to a low of $96,202 on Tuesday, erasing a significant portion of the gains made the previous week before rising slightly to settle at $97,019. Meanwhile, Katie Stockton, a top technical analyst at Fairland Strategies, has warned investors to brace for a potential double-digit drop in BTC prices, suggesting the asset has been massively overbought in its latest bull run. The analyst believes BTC will find support around $84,000, implying a drop of 13%. A secondary support at around $73,800 will come into play in the event of a steeper selloff. Stockton said in a note to clients she foresaw near-term weakness despite BTC reclaiming the $100,000 level, adding that BTC could slip below $90,000 to find support around the $84,000 mark. Despite her prediction, Stockton remains bullish about BTC's long-term prospects, pointing to a strong long-term backdrop that could support the asset. “Bitcoin has a rebound underway, but we expect it to fade quickly, yielding a lower high relative to the December peak. The weekly stochastics have an active overbought downturn, and the daily stochastics are newly overbought, so we think further upside will be limited in the near term.” BTC had been quite bullish despite dropping to a low of $91,279 last Monday. It recovered from this level on Tuesday and surged to an intraday high of 496,159. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and BTC ultimately settled at $93,383, registering an increase of almost 1%. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 1.06% to $94,373. Bullish sentiment intensified considerably on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of almost 3% to go above $95,000 and settle at 496,823. The price pushed above the 20 and 50-day SMAs on Friday after rising 1.09% and settling at $97,878. Source: TradingView The weekend saw buyers retain control as BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $98,312. Bullish sentiment intensified substantially on Monday as BTC surged past $100,000 and settled at $102,228. However, bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday following stronger-than-expected economic indicators putting pressure on risk assets. As a result, BTC plummeted over 5% to go below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA and settled at $97,019. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to drive BTC below the 20-day SMA.

Schiff predicted that BTC’s crash will eventually cause MSTR shares to plummet. Bitcoin crashed by more than 6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $95K. American stockbroker and crypto critic Peter Schiff has predicted another bearish turn for Bitcoin (BTC) and its largest corporate holder, MicroStrategy. He also took aim at the leverage strategy employed by the business intelligence company to purchase more Bitcoin in recent months. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Schiff claimed the Trump administration would not adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. He suggested this confirmation would drive Bitcoin holders to sell, which could negatively affect MicroStrategy. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Under Fire Schiff believes MicroStrategy and its CEO, Michael Saylor, would accelerate leveraged Bitcoin purchases to prevent a crash. However, he predicts these moves will only delay Bitcoin’s collapse, eventually causing MicroStrategy’s shares to plummet. Notably, MicroStrategy’s stock price fell 9.94% on January 7, closing at $341.42.

The company’s president sees an XRP ETF likely in 2025, with pro-crypto SEC leadership potentially favoring the launch of such products. The Leaders to Embrace RLUSD ‘Imminently?’ Ripple revealed its intentions to launch a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in April last year . The product (called RLUSD) passed through a testing phase in the following months before being officially approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in mid-December. Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, Moonpay, CoinMENA, and others were the first cryptocurrency exchanges to embrace the stablecoin. Around Christmas, the Peter Thiel-backed Bullish also jumped on the bandwagon. However, behemoths like Coinbase and Binance have yet to join the list. In a recent interview for Bloomberg, Ripple’s president, Monica Long, said people should expect such a move “imminently.” The exec noted that the crypto market has been growing in the last quarters. She predicted that 2025 could also be successful for the industry, claiming that stablecoins might play a crucial role in the process. “We think that the market’s going to grow tremendously in the course of the next year. Our business doubled within payments last year, and we see a really strong growth trajectory for our payments solution, and with that, RLUSD will have a premium role,” Long added. What About an XRP ETF? Ripple’s president also assumed that US-based companies would introduce more crypto ETFs this year and that an XRP exchange-traded fund “is likely to be next in line.” “We think, especially with the administration change, the approvals of those filing will accelerate,” Long suggested. Recall that the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) will soon have a new leader – Donald Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins . He will replace Gary Gensler, who has been considered a huge enemy of the crypto industry. During his tenure, the securities regulator filed numerous lawsuits against cryptocurrency businesses, and perhaps the most popular is the one against Ripple . Gensler’s successor, Atkins, has shown a pro-crypto stance in the past, and the XRP army believes this could result in a favorable resolution of the legal battle that has been ongoing since December 2020.

The CEO discussed this initiative in an interview on Bloomberg and highlighted why the company made the strategic move. The move will ensure enhanced accessibility and liquidity of BUIDL tokens for institutions and venture-backed projects. Wintermute aims to bridge the liquidity gap and provide the crucial piece that completes the value chain by enabling BlackRock’s BUIDL to be traded more efficiently on secondary markets. BUIDL token is highly demanded in the OTC market During the interview, Wintermute CEO Gaevoy mentioned that the demand for the BUIDL token comes from institutional investors and crypto-native organizations like centralized exchanges that have leveraged cryptos for years and operate on blockchain. When institutions plan to acquire crypto, they require considerable liquidity and prefer tailored trading solutions that are lacking in most public exchanges. BUIDL tokens encourage building and participation in the blockchain ecosystem. They are not merely speculation tokens. As high-net-worth individuals and institutions feel like venturing into it, OTC trading makes it easy for them to enter and exit positions. Fully collateralized lending protocols can use the tokens to allow people to borrow against them. This clearly shows that traditional and crypto markets are converging. Traditional markets borrow a lot from the crypto market, such as general compatibility between different players. The availability of OTC trading for BUIDL tokens aligns with Wintermute’s mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) world. Wintermute is keen on shaping the future of cryptocurrency Wintermute’s quest to offer OTC for trading BUIDL shows the company’s intentions in shaping crypto markets. The firm has strategically offered its expertise in areas around exchange liquidity, DeFi, and institutional clients. It can support trading niche tokens that hold significant value for the crypto ecosystem. Offering OTC service for a growing token class like BUIDL is not a walk in the park. It requires deep market insights and the capacity to analyze the market and the infrastructure. BUIDL has low liquidity compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin and is mostly tied to specific projects.

Exploring the Economic Impact on the Crypto Market Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price took a significant hit and dived to the $96K level, marking its biggest selloff of 2025 so far, and altcoins followed suit. But amidst this downturn, major buyers are stepping in to scoop up the dip. If you’re wondering why this is happening, you’re not alone — many are confused by the market movement, but the Altcoin Daily analyst has analyzed the current market scenario. The market is in a state of panic with Trump’s inauguration and FOMC meeting the month of January will be a catastrophic month for altcoins. There is fear that Trump’s biggest plan to create the Bitcoin reserve plan and pass crypto regulations will be delayed is the reason behind the recent crashes. The Real Reason Behind the Selloff The crypto market is feeling the heat due to new U.S. economic data. While the economy shows strength, it’s not all rosy for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve is actively working to control inflation, and recent job openings data — the highest since June 2024 — has contributed to a spike in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. This suggests that the Fed might not be cutting rates as expected, which has caused the crypto market to dip. The Trump Effect? Not Quite Amid the selloff, some are blaming Donald Trump, citing concerns that he’s changing away from his pro-crypto stance. However, the analyst argues that this isn’t the case. Trump’s appointments are promising for the crypto space, with individuals who support digital assets and innovation. There’s optimism that Trump could make the U.S. a global leader in crypto regulation, even surpassing places like Dubai and Singapore. Big Predictions for Bitcoin’s Future Despite the current dip, the market is bullish about raising ETF inflow there is a bright future for Bitcoin. The channel believes Bitcoin could soar well beyond $100,000 in 2025, possibly even reaching $200,000. While some analysts predict a more conservative top of $125K to $150K, there’s a risk that many will sell too early, missing out on the long-term gains. Wall Street is also getting more involved in Bitcoin, and many altcoins are poised for big growth in the coming years. With the changing political scenario, the market is poised for significant growth in 2025. With major players buying the dip and a long-term bullish outlook, now might be the perfect time to hold onto your assets.

The decline broke crucial support levels following a market-wide correction that erased gains from the recent bullish trend. Despite the drop, whales accumulated 1.63 trillion SHIB tokens. Bitcoin also suffered a notable drop, breaking below $96k, impacting market sentiment. Investors now await signs of a potential price rebound amid market uncertainties. Shiba Inu Whales Buy 1.63T SHIB After 10% Price Crash The SHIB price has dropped by 10%, currently at $0.000021, as the broader crypto market faces liquidation pressures. The sudden downturn highlights ongoing volatility, with significant moves by large holders or “whales” contributing to the market dynamics. A notable transaction caught attention on January 7, 2025, as Whale Alert reported a massive transfer of 1.63 trillion SHIB tokens. Valued at $39 million, the SHIB tokens moved from Crypto.com to an unidentified wallet. This activity followed the recent price slump, raising speculation about whale strategies and their impact on SHIB’s price action. Despite the setback, some investors see these whale movements as a potential setup for a price rebound. With the market eyeing recovery, analysts are closely watching Shiba Inu’s performance for signs of stabilization. 1,636,940,000,000 #SHIB (39,038,563 USD) transferred from #CryptoCom to unknown wallet https://t.co/3J9xiNndj3 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 7, 2025 SHIB Technical Analysis Shiba Inu’s price chart reveals the formation of a textbook cup and handle pattern, sparking bullish sentiment among traders. The cup-shaped curve showcases a period of accumulation followed by a smaller consolidation phase, forming the handle Such technical setups often signal a strong bullish breakout, with the meme coin aiming for potential targets at $0.00003287 and $0.00005339. The anticipated breakout offers a substantial upside of 62.53%, based on historical data. The buying zone, ranging from $0.0000161 to $0.0000193, provides a strategic entry point for investors seeking to capitalize on the trend. The SHIB is currently consolidating near $0.00002151, just above this range, indicating a potential for accumulation before a breakout. If the pattern holds, Shiba Inu may experience a steady upward trajectory into mid-2025, supported by strong volume inflows. Shiba Inu Price Targets For January 2025 The Shiba Inu price prediction has sparked significant interest among investors aiming for potential gains in the crypto market. According to technical analysis, the projected movement suggests two critical targets for SHIB. The first target, referred to as the Neckline is set at $0.00003287, representing a potential 103% profit from the buy zone. Beyond that, the second target reaches $0.00005339, offering an impressive 230% gain for those holding through the projected rally. Investors should note the buy zone identified in the chart, marking an optimal entry point before the anticipated bullish breakout. Source- TradingView Shiba Inu price whales have accumulated 1.63 trillion SHIB after a 10% price crash, fueling speculation of a potential price rebound. The current technical setup suggests strong bullish potential, with SHIB targeting gains of up to 230% if the pattern holds. Investors are closely monitoring the price action for opportunities amid ongoing market volatility.

Over 3,500 illegal crypto exchanges have been blocked, marking a major shift in the country’s approach to digital assets. This move came after years of growing concern over unregulated crypto platforms operating within the country. Kazakhstan Strict Action On Crypto Exchanges The crackdown was led by Kazakhstan’s Agency for Financial Monitoring (AFM RK), in collaboration with the National Security Committee and the Ministry of Culture and Information. Together, these institutions have launched a significant operation to rid the country of illegal crypto exchanges and the problems they cause. In 2023, Kazakhstan shocked the crypto world when it blocked access to Coinbase , one of the biggest crypto exchanges. Authorities said Coinbase violated Kazakhstan’s digital asset laws according to Coinpedia news. This action against a giant like Coinbase sent a clear message: Kazakhstan is serious about regulating the crypto space. Last year in 2024, Kazakhstan stepped up its efforts even more. It closed 36 illegal crypto exchanges that were dealing with over $113 million in transactions. The authorities also froze assets worth 4.8 million USDT, which is a popular stablecoin. During this operation, officials uncovered two crypto pyramid schemes and returned over 500,000 USDT to the victims. New Rules for Crypto Transactions Kazakhstan is not just targeting illegal platforms. The government is also working on new laws to make sure crypto transactions follow the rules. They are focusing on stopping money laundering and other crimes linked to digital assets. The government is also working with international partners to enhance the country’s ability to track and regulate digital asset transactions. Opening Doors to Legal Crypto Exchanges While the country is cracking down on illegal platforms, Kazakhstan is also welcoming regulated crypto exchanges. In 2023, Bybit and Binance both received full licenses from Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). This move shows Kazakhstan’s intention to create a safe and regulated space for crypto businesses. Kazakhstan’s Future Digital Currency Kazakhstan’s central bank is also exploring the possibility of creating a digital version of its national currency, called the digital tenge. This is part of the country’s push to stay ahead in the world of digital currencies. Kazakhstan’s actions show that it’s serious about regulating the crypto market while also embracing new technologies.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 09:54:50

The position may cause a further slide, as SUI goes down from its recent all-time peak. A whale’s leveraged position on SUI is threatened if the asset dips to $4.56. The whale has already received a warning for borrowing more than the limit, and for being close to the liquidation threshold . The whale deposited sSUI and SUI in two separate pools to borrow USDC and wUSDT. As of January 8, SUI hovered around $4.60, though with the occasional dip to a lower level. The crypto market moved sideways, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slid to a lower range, making other coins and tokens more volatile. SUI recently posted its all-time high at $5.33, leading whales to increase positions. The chain is one of the most active in the past year, attracting a new inflow of traders. SUI rallied along with the rest of the market in the last quarter of 2024. As a result of SUI’s expansion, the L1 chain acquired a thriving DeFi sector. The whale’s position relies on an ongoing positive price performance, as it was tied to a loan from SUI Lend. The whale deposited 4.1M SUI, or $19.3M, to borrow $14.4M in stablecoins. If the loan is liquidated, the whale will retain the stablecoins, while SUILend will become a custodian of the loan. The loan is not similar to a centralized long position, as the whale will not face a total loss. Additionally, the price pressure may be smaller, as the tokens are limited to the DeFi app. SUI has slowed down its rally, with open interest also going down from a recent peak above $800M, down to $676M. The asset is still expected to expand, as reflected by the 70% long positions. However, SUI may continue to contract as those long positions are attacked for liquidation. SUI received a boost from DeFi lending While the $20M position is at risk, SUILend is one of the key features of the ecosystem. The ability to absorb a loan of that size during liquidation shows the chain has built up its DeFi liquidity. SUI hosts more than $1.91B in total value locked, with SUILend arising in the past few months as the leading app. Previously, SUI relied on NAVI Protocol for most of its DeFi activity, but the positive SUI market performance allowed for the growth of lending. Briefly, the value locked on SUI rallied above $2B in the first days of the new year. SUI also carries more than $414M in stablecoins, taking a part of the newly minted liquidity in 2024. This has allowed DeFi users to expand loans and move into stablecoin positions through lending. Will SUI rally to a new peak? SUI was one of the most rapidly expanding L1 chains, setting up expectations of a path similar to Solana. For now, SUI trades at a much lower range, but the platform aims for a similar type of growth. The prediction of WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski for a bottom at $4.85 failed for now, as SUI may go through a deeper drawdown. I’m calling $SUI bottom pic.twitter.com/R1RvlCD1Jk — wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) January 7, 2025 SUI is a relatively new addition with claims to become a major token, and its goal for 2025 is to establish more reliable organic traffic. SUI is now seeking to launch its native AI agent platform, to tap the recent hot trend of AI tokens. In January, the SUI AI Agents token (SUIAI) is already completing its first month of trading. SUI Agents launched at the end of November 2024, allowing for one-click deployment of AI models. The SUIAI token also has DeFi elements, and has been locked for staking on Ethereum protocols. SUIAI lined up among the trending tokens of the ecosystem, despite its significant volatility. SUIAI traded at $0.04, still lagging behind the leading SUI ecosystem tokens. The chain mostly carries DeFi assets such as Cetus Protocol (CETUS) and DeepBook (DEEP).

As Scamsniffer has reported , the victim signed several phishing approvals that allowed the attackers to manage the accounts. The victim was convinced that they were interacting with a genuine website. This gave the attackers a false sense of security making them transfer funds without alerting the owner.. Phishing: A Growing Concern in Crypto Phishing scams, a type of social engineering attack, where the attacker manipulates the victim into divulging personal details or providing authorisations to the fraudster, are steadily on the rise in the cryptocurrency industry. These attacks most commonly entail the creation of a dummy site that looks like the original site. The gullible users thinking they are on the original site enter login details or click on a link approving transactions which gives the hackers full control over the wallets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : CoinSwitch Announces ₹600 Crore Recovery Plan for WazirX Hack Victims , Global Crypto Phishing Effect Out of the total percentage of attacks in 2024, the phishing percentage was high to 40% and it was estimated to be about $ 1.05 billion out of the global overall crypto scams and hacks. Modern complex scams using fake websites, social networking profiles, and deceitful agreements persist to take advantage of weak user consciousness and platform defence. Alas, with time, we have seen bad actors adapt to the changing crypto space and the strategies used by the criminals also change. It will not be easy for the victim to face the loss, but for the rest of the crypto world, it is a wake-up call to really think about safety first and spread the word. Be in the know and remember to think twice before signing any transaction since that is all you have at stake. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pi Cycle Indicators Predict the Bitcoin Price Top The Pi Cycle indicator is an accurate indicator that successfully forecasts the Bitcoin price at the top. It has accurately predicted the top in 2013, 2017, and 2021; the next might be 2025. Pi cycle analysis depends on the 111-day moving average (111DMA) and 350-day moving average multiples by 2, where the intersection of these two moving averages predicts the cycle tops. Now, after the ongoing BTC price struggle amid the crypto market crash , this tool hints at the top, keeping the investor’s confidence strong amid the crash. The crypto market signals that the BTC top will likely happen in the mid-to-end period of 2025. Although the timeline could vary, the historical result confirms the top formation within days of peak prediction. Cryptocurrency Peak Prediction: BTC Top To Form on September 17, 2025 The latest Pi cycle top prediction reveals that the next crossover will occur on September 17, 2025, resulting in the BTC market peak. This BTC prediction for 2025 is based on its exponential growth ever since its formation, where the Pi chart indicator has forecasted the peak with 111 DMA and 350 DMAx2 coinciding on the charts on this date. With high accuracy and historical proof, the next BTC top will form on September 17 , but the exact value of the top is unclear for now. Some suggest it could cross six figures based on historical growth patterns, global adoption, and Donald Trump’s presidency. What You Should Do? The pi cycle indicator is a famous BTC top indicator that has accurately predicted the peak multiple times. Now, recent reports show that the BTC top will form on September 17, 2025, potentially pushing this digital asset’s price to six figures for the first time in history. Although the BTC price formed massive peaks with Donald Trump’s win, the consolidation frequency increased as Trump’s inauguration approaches. The market crash has halted the Bitcoin price surge, currently trading at $95k. Arthur Hayes’s prediction hints at a market peak in March, but investors should stay cautious and conduct their own technical analysis before investing.

The altcoins have suffered even more, with massive price declines from the likes of ETH, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, HBAR, DOT, and many others. BTC Slumps Hard After a relatively quiet weekend, which BTC spent mostly at around $98,000, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive on Monday. Within just a few hours, its price skyrocketed from under $99,000 to a multi-week peak of $102,400. This was the first time the asset exceeded the $100,000 mark since the start of the year. It kept climbing during the Tuesday Asian trading session and peaked at $102,800 (on Bitstamp). However, it quickly started to lose value as the day progressed. Once the US trading hours kicked in and some controversial data came out , BTC started to freefall and dumped by five grand in about 60 minutes. It kept dropping in the following hours and plunged to $95,200 earlier this morning, leaving roughly $700 million in liquidations. Despite recovering slightly since then, bitcoin is still 6% down on the day. Its market cap has plummeted from over $2 trillion to under $1.9 trillion, and its dominance over the alts stands at 54.3%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 8.1.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Freefall State As it typically happens during such violent corrections, most altcoins have it worse. Ethereum is among the poorest performers, having dumped by 8% from over $3,600 to under $3,400. Even more painful declines come from SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SUI, LINK, HBAR, DOT, and SHIB, as most of them have dumped by double digits. XRP and BNB have dropped by a more modest 4.5% and 3.2%, respectively, while LEO is the only larger-cap alt that is not deep in the red. The total crypto market cap went from $3.760 trillion yesterday to under $3.5 trillion today, losing roughly $300 billion in the process from top to bottom. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains.

Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? The TIA price has faced resistance around $5, resulting in minor selling pressure. However, buyers are strongly defending further decline. Will TIA price reach $100?

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

In the last three months, it has outperformed certain top cryptos like BNB, as it has climbed by over 41.7%. In the last seven days alone, it has grown by at least 4.38%. At the time when the crypto community is discussing the future prospects of the SOL ecosystem, Sol Strategies, a Canadian company, has announced its plan to invest CAD $25M to support the growth of this blockchain. Let’s discuss everything one should know about this development! Ready? Sol Strategies’ CAD $25M Investment in Solana The investment has been granted as an unsecured revolving credit, at an interest rate of around 5% per annum. The credit line will be used to purchase SOL tokens, expand staking services and fund acquisitions. It will be valid until at least January 6, 2027. Reports suggest that nearly CAD $4 million of the total credit line amount has already been used. Sol Strategies’ Rebranding & Solana-Centric Focus It was in 2024 that Sol Strategies changed its focus to Solana. In the same year, it set its target to become the most prominent participant in the SOL ecosystem. As part of its SOL-focused strategy, and in order to focus solely on Solana, it exited all its non-strategic investments, including Animoca Brands. Reports suggest that by the end of the year 2024 the company had no fewer than 1.5 million SOL tokens, valued at around CAD $450 million. Solana Growth Potential & Market Overview Solana stands out from other blockchains for its fast transaction capability and its potential to work with DeFi and NFT. It is seen as an ideal choice for firms looking to expand their presence in the Web3 environment. SOL is one of those top coins that have witnessed massive growth following the US election. At the start of November 5, 2024, the price of Solana was at $157.97. Between November 5 and 11, it grew consistently by nearly 40.97%. On November 22, it touched a peak of $264.70. Between November 23 and December 22, the market saw a massive correction of 29.9%. The Solana price has not yet recovered from this huge fall. At the beginning of the year 2025, the SOL price stood at $188.79. In the first three days of the year, the market experienced a surge of 15.45%. On January 7, it reached a peak of $223.02. In the last 24 hours, the market has plummeted sharply by at least 8.6%. Now the price of SOL stands at $197.01.

A plunge of $7,500 just since Tuesday has sent the market into a spin. Is this just a normal case of high volatility, or is the Bitcoin price in for a much more extensive retracement? Volatility plays havoc with traders The life of the average Bitcoin investor is fraught with uncertainty. An emotional roller-coaster is probably playing havoc in the minds of many, as Bitcoin bulls generally take the stairs, while the Bitcoin bears are just jumping out of the window. Many factors are attributed to this current drop in the Bitcoin price, such as the continued rise in treasury yields, inflation concerns, and an overall downturn in investor sentiment. However, can it just be the very simple fact that Bitcoin reached oversold levels, and its correction has been speeded up by volatility caused by long liquidations and probably a decent dose of market manipulation? The Bitcoin ETFs, and probably lots of very large buyers, need to purchase their BTC, and if lots of leveraged traders can be liquidated, the price can be brought down to cheaper levels. This is all the better for these big players, who are arguably first in the pecking order to benefit from market manipulation. A standard Bitcoin retracement so far Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that the retracement for this move has been fairly standard so far. The 0.618 fibonacci level is a very healthy level to go back down to , and even if the dip does get deeper, the 0.786 Fibonacci at $93,700 would also be a good level for a bounce. The major horizontal support $84,000 converges with the 1.618 Fibonacci and also the rising 100 daily moving average. So this would be the last support before going back to retest the top of the last bull market at $69,000. All this said, a bounce from the current level of around $95,000 could be a distinct possibility, given that this is also the midway point of the range Bitcoin is currently in. $93,600 is the base for the next leg higher Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the 2-week chart, it can be seen that there is a very good level of horizontal support at $93,600. If we were to return to the earlier short-term chart, it can be seen that this lines up with the 0.786 Fibonacci. Could it be that market structure will continue to be laid above this support level, and that the next stage of the bull market will use this at its platform? At the bottom of the chart is the highly important Stochastic RSI. On such a high time frame as the 2-week, to see the indicator lines heading downward is not a good sign. They will need to turn back up for the bull market to continue. The midway point at 50.00 acted as support in the 2017 bull market. It will need to do the same this time round, or a much deeper correction will likely materialise. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite being listed on Interpol's ”Red Notice” and Europe's most wanted list, Schueler is still very active online and promoting Hex. Meanwhile, in the US, early Bitcoin investor Frank Ahlgren III was sentenced to two years in prison for tax fraud, and the court ordered the surrender of his cryptocurrency holdings and private keys. Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch decided to launch a $69.9 million recovery fund to assist users that were affected by WazirX's $235 million hack in 2024. Richard Schueler Faces Mounting Allegations Finnish authorities reportedly seized $2.6 million worth of luxury watches belonging to Hex founder Richard Schueler, who is also known as Richard Heart. The watches were discovered in a residence in Espoo, Finland, according to the national broadcaster Yleisradio Oy (Yle). In total, 20 luxury watches were confiscated, and their value was determined through receipts and assessments by a luxury goods expert. Some of the watches were purchased in Finland, while others were bought in the United States. Some of the watches that were seized by police (Source: Yle ) The seizure is part of an ongoing investigation into allegations against Schueler, who is accused of tax evasion and assault. Finnish police have been actively tracking his activities, and Inspector Harri Saaristola, the detective overseeing the case, revealed that intelligence operations led to the discovery of the abandoned items. Schueler was remanded into custody on Sept. 13 of 2024, but authorities have not been able to locate him. The allegations include tax evasion between June of 2020 and April of 2024, as well as an assault on a 16-year-old victim in February 2021. The details of the assault were shared on Europe’s most wanted fugitives list, and describe Schueler grabbing the victim by the hair, dragging them into a stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. On Dec. 22, Interpol issued a “Red Notice” for Schueler in connection with these charges, and Finnish authorities estimate his tax arrears to be in the hundreds of millions of euros. His declared income for 2023 was reported as €15.2 million ($16.9 million). Despite being listed as one of Europe’s most wanted fugitives , Schueler still has a very active online presence and is promoting his cryptocurrency, Hex (HEX), on social media platforms like X and YouTube. Schueler on Europe’s most wanted list In addition to the Finnish allegations, Schueler also faces legal action in the United States. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against him in July of 2023, accusing him of raising more than $1 billion through unregistered securities tied to Hex (HEX), PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX). The SEC alleges that some of these funds were misappropriated for personal use. Texas Bitcoin Investor Sentenced for Tax Fraud Shueler is not the only person avoiding tax responsibilities. Frank Richard Ahlgren III, an early Bitcoin investor from Texas, was ordered to surrender his cryptocurrency and all associated private keys and access codes as part of a restraining order that was issued by an Austin federal court. This order was made after his sentencing in December to two years in prison for tax fraud. Ahlgren owes approximately $1.1 million in restitution to the US government after underreporting capital gains on over $3.7 million in Bitcoin sales between 2017 and 2019. On Jan. 6, Judge Robert Pitman directed Ahlgren, along with his family, friends, or representatives, to provide any physical devices that were used to store his cryptocurrency, as well as any public and private keys, seed phrases, or passphrases. The court also ordered them to identify all crypto accounts associated with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum, or Litecoin. Additionally, they are prohibited from transferring or taking any actions that might conceal or reduce the value of Ahlgren's cryptocurrency without court approval, except for use in normal monthly living expenses. This order will stay in effect until Ahlgren satisfies his restitution obligations or the court issues any other instructions. Ahlgren pleaded guilty in September of 2024 to filing a false tax return and was sentenced in December. His legal troubles stem from his purchase of approximately 1,366 Bitcoin in 2015, when the cryptocurrency was only valued at around $465. Two years later, he sold half of his holdings for $3.7 million at a price of $5,800 per Bitcoin. However, he inflated the cost basis in his tax filings to reduce the reported capital gains. Between 2018 and 2019, he sold additional Bitcoin worth more than $650,000, which he failed to report entirely on his tax returns as well. Prosecutors revealed that Ahlgren used multiple wallets, in-person transfers, and mixers to conceal details of his transactions. The total tax losses resulting from his actions exceeded $1 million. In addition to his prison sentence, Ahlgren will serve one year of supervised release. The case was the first criminal tax evasion prosecution in the United States centered solely on cryptocurrency. CoinSwitch Offers Recovery Fund to WazirX Hack Survivors Meanwhile, Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch launched a recovery fund worth 600 crore Indian rupees, or $69.9 million, to assist users of the hacked competitor platform WazirX. The initiative is called ” CoinSwitch Cares ,” and it is designed to help WazirX users who suffered losses in the alleged cyberattack that took place in July of 2024. Through this program, CoinSwitch plans to distribute the funds over a two-year period to the affected users. Eligibility for the recovery fund requires users to provide proof of their losses, including WazirX loss statements and any additional documentation CoinSwitch may request. The program offers three types of rewards: sign-up bonuses, revenue sharing, and referral bonuses. However, while users can sell their recovered crypto for rupees, direct cryptocurrency withdrawals are not currently supported. (Source: CoinSwitch ) The recovery fund will be fully financed by CoinSwitch from its cash reserves. Co-founder Ashish Singhal stated that the exchange has sufficient financial resources, with a runway of about five years, and pointed out that the ongoing crypto market uptrend also strengthened their financial position. CoinSwitch plans to screen the affected WazirX users by reviewing their balance statements to verify their claims and calculate losses. Once WazirX reopens crypto withdrawals, CoinSwitch expects to streamline the process of tracking user claims and calculating rewards. CoinSwitch was founded in 2017, and is one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges that boasts 20 million registered users and major funding from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and Coinbase Ventures. The recovery fund targets approximately four million WazirX users. WazirX’s alleged $235 million hack led to the suspension of withdrawals, and generated serious controversy in the crypto community.

The current trading volume has soared to $1.78 billion, reflecting high market interest and liquidity. This monumental increase is not merely a random market fluctuation but is backed by several strategic developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What is causing the SONIC coin to rise? The rise of SONIC can be attributed to a series of pivotal events and enhancements in its trading landscape. Firstly, Sonic SVM has been introduced to major trading platforms like Binance Futures and KuCoin, offering a variety of trading options. Binance Futures has launched SONICUSDT perpetual contracts with leverage up to 75x, providing traders with substantial trading flexibility. This move not only increases SONIC’s exposure to a broader investor base but also adds a layer of sophistication to how traders can engage with the token, potentially attracting more speculative capital. Moreover, KuCoin has extended its services for SONIC by adding it to margin trading, futures, convert, saving, and fast trade options. This comprehensive integration into KuCoin’s ecosystem offers users multiple avenues to trade or stake SONIC, with incentives such as zero trading fees on KuCoin Convert and a 4% expected APR on KuCoin Saving. These offerings have likely spurred increased trading and investment in SONIC, fostering a positive feedback loop of demand and price appreciation. Another significant factor could be the rebranding of Fantom blockchain into Sonic Labs and the transition from Fantom (FTM) to Sonic (S) tokens, which is underway with Binance facilitating a 1:1 token swap, introducing new features like developer incentives and governance opportunities, which will potentially increase its utility and attractiveness to both developers and users. It is however important to note that Sonic SVM and Sonic Labs are two distinct chains. Sonic SVM is the first Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) network extension to launch on Solana, for games and applications, and it is built on HyperGrid, a framework for orchestrating optimistic Solana rollups. On the other hand, Sonic Labs replaces Fantom and it is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-1 blockchain with 10000 TPS, sub-second finality, a secure gateway to Ethereum, and attractive developer incentives. The Fantom rebranding into Sonic, while not related to Sonic SVM has undoubtedly contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding the SONIC token for the similarity in the names. The combination of these factors – high leverage trading options on Binance, diversified investment opportunities on KuCoin, and the having a similar name as the rebranded Fantom chain – has created a compelling case for SONIC’s recent rise, making it an attractive choice for investors looking for growth and innovation in the crypto space.

The Bitcoin investor has also been ordered to surrender the passcodes to access his $124 million digital assets . In Ahlgren III’s charge sheet, he was accused of hiding almost 1,287 BTC, worth $124 million, using mixing services. He pleaded guilty to underreporting $3.7 million in capital gains from Bitcoin transactions, which warranted him to pay $1 million in tax loss reparation to the US government. The court must authorize Ahlgren III’s transactions The prosecutors handling Ahlgren III’s case had argued that the accused’s property could not be attached by ordinary physical means. On behalf of the American government, they requested the court to restrain any virtual currency and issue an order to obtain the passcodes so that they can access the accounts to ensure no one moves the cryptos. They clarified that nobody can retrieve the digital assets if the passcodes are lost or destroyed. The US District Judge of the Western District of Texas, Robert Pitman granted the prosecutor’s wishes. He ordered Ahlgren III to surrender the passcodes and any devices he used to store the digital assets. He was further ordered to disclose all of his cryptocurrency wallets. Also, Ahlgren III cannot “dissipate,” dispose of, or transfer any property unless the courts approve. However, he can freely spend on normal monthly routine expenses. Ahlgren III stated that he would abide by the court rulings Ahlgren III’s attorney, Dennis Kainen, said that his client is willing to comply with the orders issued by the court. Ahlgren III pleaded guilty on September 12 and saw his sentencing on December 12. We will comply with a court directive, or to the extent that we have a question, we will direct it to the court. We appreciate Judge Pitman’s care throughout this case. ~ Dennis Kainen Ahlgren III’s case has set a precedent that may affect even small crypto holders.

This strategic decision comes at a booming time to strengthen the country’s financial standing in Latin America and become a leader in Bitcoin adoption. Bitfinex Derivatives decide to move to El Salvador El Salvador’s proactive stance on cryptocurrency legislation has gained attention from global crypto investors. It became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, a move which has encouraged locals to seamlessly invest in cryptocurrencies. Since then, the country has proposed different policies to promote digital assets and support fintech innovation. By securing a DASP license, Bitfinex Derivatives can provide a wide range of financial services and consultations in El Salvador. Bitfinex Derivatives also lauded the country for its persistent efforts to establish new crypto frameworks, and said El Salvador’s progress in this regard aligns with the company’s broader goals of serving clients in the region. Bitfinex Derivatives’ Chief Technology Officer, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized the pressing need for this move in a recent interview, saying, “This critical transition represents a defining moment for Bitfinex Derivatives and highlights El Salvador’s rise as a global financial hub”. El Salvador’s vision to become a crypto hub El Salvador has recently introduced a series of digital asset regulations in an effort to become a crypto hub. After the country passed the Digital Assets Securities Law in January of 2023, Bitfinex Derivatives went on to secure a local DASP license in April the same year. The country’s licensing regime streamlines the fundraising and investing procedures by enabling businesses to issue tokens, raise funds, and provide returns to inventors. It has already attracted prominent initiatives, such as Bitfinex Securities’ planned tokenized public issuance of US Treasury notes in November 2024. This is not the first move by Bitfinex in El Salvador. The firm’s securities arm also attempted a Hilton hotel tokenization initiative. The hotel project attempted to raise funding by selling the “HILSV” token on the Bitcoin layer-2 Liquid Network. To get a share of the project, investors had to make a minimum investment of $1,000. Funds raised through the hotel initiative were going to be used to finance the construction of the Hampton by Hilton hotel, which would have a size of 4,500 square meters across 5 levels with 80 rooms, as well as a restaurant, work area, gym, garden, and a swimming pool. However, the project failed to raise the minimum $500,000 that was required to continue the venture. As a result, Bitfinex Securities had to refund investors in July last year.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-firm-matrixport-explains-why-bitcoin-is-under-short-term-pressure-here-are-the-details/,"Matrixport has released its latest report highlighting how global liquidity trends could impact Bitcoin prices. Matrixport: Global Liquidity Fluctuations Could Put Pressure on Bitcoin in the Short Term Historical data shows that changes in global liquidity typically precede Bitcoin price movements by about 13 weeks. Liquidity Tightening and Bitcoin’s Short-Term Outlook The report notes that the strengthening of the US dollar following the re-election of Donald Trump has triggered a tightening of global dollar-denominated liquidity. This development suggests that Bitcoin may enter a consolidation phase in the near term. Despite this potential short-term lull, Matrixport emphasized that the overall outlook for risky assets, especially Bitcoin, remains positive in the long term. Matrixport urged investors to exercise caution in light of a weaker liquidity environment. Historical trends suggest that global liquidity changes are a reliable market indicator and signal potential risks for investors navigating the current environment. Matrixport described the expected consolidation as a temporary phenomenon, while noting that Bitcoin’s long-term potential is still intact. However, investors are advised to remain vigilant as global liquidity dynamics could lead to additional market volatility. This report highlights the importance of monitoring macroeconomic factors such as liquidity and currency strength as key influencers of Bitcoin's price trajectory. *This is not investment advice.

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has announced plans to allow corporations to invest in digital assets, signaling a major step forward for the country’s crypto industry. This move could unlock new opportunities for businesses to invest in South Korea. New Rules for Corporate Investments Currently, companies in South Korea face strict rules when it comes to investing in crypto, including limitations on opening real-name accounts. The FSC aims to change this by starting with non-profit organizations. According to FSC Director Kwon Dae-young, there is a pressing need to establish clear listing standards and enforce rules of conduct for virtual asset exchanges. These groups will be allowed to invest in cryptocurrencies under a monitored framework. Once this initial phase is complete, the FSC plans to introduce new rules for how digital assets are issued and traded. The goal is to make the process clear and secure for businesses while encouraging innovation. Building Trust and Innovation The FSC is also working to ensure that only trustworthy businesses can take part in the crypto market. Plans include checks on shareholder eligibility and requirements for social credit ratings. Additionally, the agency wants to set stricter rules for volatile cryptocurrencies, like meme coins, to protect investors. Beyond crypto, the FSC is looking to make broader changes to the financial system. For example, it plans to raise the limit on how much stock companies can own in non-subsidiaries from 5% to 15%. This would give businesses more control and flexibility. South Korea’s Growing Crypto Influence While the global crypto market has faced challenges recently, South Korea’s decision shows a growing recognition of digital assets. Earlier, CoinPedia reported that the Bank of Korea, established under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, disclosed that more than 30% of South Korea’s population is now engaged in crypto trading.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 11:38:12

This sell-off was not localized to BTC or ADA and has caused millions of dollars worth of positions to be liquidated. The price is struggling to retain around the $1 psychological level without any major impact to the bullish market structure. Cardano hovers inside the $0.874 to $1.327 range, and the recent ascent failed to move past the range’s midpoint at $1.100. While the recent crypto market drop was brutal, even if ADA drops another 10% to 12%, its market structure will remain bullish, unlike other altcoins like XRP or SOL. We’re waiting for a flip of the range’s midpoint, which could happen as soon as Bitcoin pauses its descent. The recent consolidation that began after the December 3 peak of $1.326 could likely be hinting at an end after the early January rally. While the recovery may take some time, investors must note that the altcoin looks bullish and ready to shoot higher. Cardano’s Key Support Levels to Watch The key support levels that crypto traders need to focus include $0.874, $0.819, $0.741, $0.659 and $0.594. Ideally, ADA price should form a potential bottom around $0.874, but the other levels could also serve as stable support that could catalyze reversal. While these barriers might support a downtre, only a decisive breakout above critical levels will confirm ADA’s bullish movement. Breakout Signs and Future Market Outlook As noted earlier, a decisive daily candlestick close above the 50% Fibonacci level at $1.100 would signal the end of the correction. This move would also kickstart a move ot the upside move. ADA has a history of reacting to key levels, leading to volatile breakouts ot the upside. Hence investors must keep their eyes peeled for reversal and breakout signs. ADA Holders Need to Exercise Patience Cardano shot up 306% between November 5 and December 3 and is now retracing, trying to find its ground.As a result, the ongoing month-long consolidation could be coming to an end. Hence, investors need to exercise patience during this accumulation phase. This outlook signals that the ADA is in the final phase, ready for upward movement that could be triggered by an external news, event or a swift flush below key levels.

While Bitcoin briefly surpassed the $100,000 mark recently, it faced a sharp pullback amid concerns over upcoming economic events, including the Fed’s FOMC Minutes and US job data this month. Market analysts warn Bitcoin may drop further if it fails to hold the $95,668 support level. The December FOMC Minutes, scheduled for release today, is expected to create a disturbance in the market. Experts also warn that economic indicators like labor market data will play a critical role in shaping investor sentiment. Looking at the current scenario, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has shed light on the reasons behind the recent market crash while reaffirming his bullish stance on Bitcoin, gold, and silver. His insights come as the crypto market grapples with heightened volatility ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s FOMC Minutes release. However, the economic events have caused little impact on Bitcoin throughout 2024 and majorly it is considered a hefty selling where short-term investors try to wane off their previous gains. Bitcoin on a bigger scale is destined to rise. Why Crypto Market Crashed Today? Kiyosaki linked the market downturn to decisions made during the 2008 financial crisis, particularly by then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who prioritized bankers’ bonuses over the broader economy. He pointed out that several sectors, including housing, retail, and automobiles, are now experiencing a slowdown, reflecting the current financial troubles. Despite the bear scenario, Kiyosaki views this as an opportunity for investors to accumulate wealth. He believes valuable assets like houses, gold, silver, and Bitcoin are becoming more accessible, urging investors to focus on real assets, including gold and silver mines. Bitcoin: A “Sale” Opportunity Kiyosaki remains optimistic about Bitcoin, even as its price dipped by nearly 6% to $95,845, with trading volume surging 36% to $66 billion. He described the dip as “great news,” urging investors to buy more Bitcoin while prices are low. His confidence stems from Bitcoin’s limited supply, emphasizing that only 2 million Bitcoins remain to be mined. Crypto Market Turmoil Right now the traders are dealing with increasing selling pressure, today the crypto opened with the liquidation of $561 million worth of long positions. While the largest liquidation order came from Binance, involving $17.74 million in ETHUSDT. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies also suffered, with Ethereum losing over 8% and Solana falling more than 9%, and XRP by 5%.

However, many investors are unsure of their next move. Some tokens look like their major pump may have been and gone—XRP, DOGE, and ADA. Meanwhile, there’s a sea of meme coins that are so numerous it’s hard to assess anything that resembles long-term potential. Dogizen is in that perfect sweet spot. Strong fundamentals and sitting within a golden sector. Yet, since it’s in ICO phase, a big fat god candle of green is still waiting. Looking at Dogizen’s $2.8m raised and unique ICO approach, a juicy 100x could well be looming. GameFi + Telegram gaming are golden sectors GameFi’s exciting CAGR and anticipated market cap of +$125 billion , has a key player at the center: Telegram gaming. This subsector is killing it, spinning up a market cap of over $1 billion in six months , and being responsible for 21% of Web3 game launches in 2024, according to Game7 . This is most likely driven by Telegram gaming’s ease of onboarding new users—with Telegram’s integrated crypto wallet helping significantly. This is also likely why 50% of Telegram gamers are completely new to crypto. These bullish factors give Dogizen the 100x edge Dogizen is obviously entering a sector with traction. So to harness this momentum, it’s decided to hold its ICO within Telegram’s interface. Now 950 million Telegram users can conduct the entire investing experience using the same tool they use for alpha and trading. Never has such a large, crypto-friendly audience had such an easy route to ICO investing. This complements the projected gain machine that is Dogizen’s tokenomics. Dogizen is craftily geared towards having a $10 million market cap when it launches. This is nothing compared to the market caps at launch of rivals like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, leaving Dogizen piles of room to grow and appreciate. Since a) all Dogizen’s rivals hit caps of between $250 million and +$2 billion , and b) Dogizen will launch right when the bull market is likely popping in 2025, investors have every reason to anticipate a 20, 50, or even 100x. Plus, Dogizen has a roadmap that can carry it the distance. Dogizen Universe offers long-term gain potential As Telegram gaming and GameFi continue their projected climb, the demand for new Telegram gaming titles is only going to grow with it. Dogizen Universe will launch next year as a Telegram gaming arcade and Telegram game publishing platform. Essentially turning Dogizen into a development layer for Telegram games. The DOGIZ token will power this entire ecosystem. It’ll pay out fees to players, creators, and DOGIZ holders. When you add in Dogizen’s staking offer of 101% APY, holding DOGIZ has crazy long-term appeal. Dogizen is priced at just $0.000081. For a token that’s breaking new ground and is in the middle of a total disruption in gaming as we know it, this looks like an absolute steal.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Aptos (APT) have become some of the leading options, especially among altcoin investors, who believe that these projects may be gearing up for huge pumps in the following months. Each project has been successful in amassing a dedicated community already, within their respective subcategories, boasting native tokens with strong use cases. Leading Cryptos to Invest in for Major Gains in This Bull Market From presale projects to initiatives that are worth billions in valuation, there is scope for making huge profits on several projects. Touching on some of the most trending crypto narratives, here are some potential heavy hitters that investors seem to be quite bullish about. NEAR Protocol – Solving Scalability Issues as a Leading L1 Blockchain The NEAR Protocol quickly made its way to being one of the most trending projects in the space. With its highly developer-friendly infrastructure, the project became an excellent choice for developers who sought blockchains where AI could be easily integrated. As one of the hottest narratives in 2025, it didn’t take long for NEAR’s AI-supportive ecosystem to catch the attention of the wider investing citizenry. Its interoperability tool, the Rainbow Bridge, has been carefully curated to allow AI-driven applications to seamlessly interact with other leading blockchains like Ethereum, which has made it a top choice. Why Could NEAR Token Pump? NEAR was among the best-performing utility tokens in 2024, impressing thousands of investors as a strong project with major long-term potential. The token went from a $2.7 price range to more than $8.8 in 2024 itself, as the AI narrative started gaining traction. Now, with the market being as active as ever and strong predictions being made for AI-based projects, NEAR Protocol has also become a choice among leading analysts. While the price has corrected to the $5 range now, predictions for NEAR are highly bullish, suggesting a likely market cap valuation exceeding $50 billion by the end of 2025. Minotaurus – Engaging P2E Offering With Massive Profit Potential A simple but engaging crypto game may just be what the market needs to once again shake up the now-slow P2E space. The Minotaurus community is confident that the project could do this, with its super simplistic but highly engaging game ecosystem. Audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, this initiative may be one of the biggest gaming presales this year, having raised more than $1 million in a matter of weeks. The project features a charming minotaur set to run across a blockchain-powered maze seeking treasures and adventure. It aims to introduce various types of minotaurs, an in-game marketplace for in-game items, consumables within the game, special zone unlocks, and even friend incentives, all aimed at creating a community-centric gaming experience. From collecting coins to customizing various elements within the game, Minotaurus may be able to position itself as a fresh entry into the otherwise boring crypto-gaming category. Why Could MTAUR Pump? The game’s demo is set to hit Google Play and the App Store soon, which could signal an increase in user interest. As MTAUR is still a presale token, there is incredible room for growth already. While it is currently priced at around $0.000081, the listing price itself shall be $0.0002, which already indicates significant upside for those who manage to get in early. Combine that with features in top crypto publications online and leading crypto YouTubers, and MTAUR could easily be an undervalued gem, with 10x to 50x price targets once launched. Ondo Finance – Leading Crypto Pioneering RWA Tokenization Successfully Among the most watchlisted cryptos last year is Ondo Finance, a new entrant with a quality concept. Estimates suggest that the RWA sector could exceed $16 trillion by 2030 , which puts the category as one worth watching already. But Ondo Finance takes it further, trying to democratize access to institutional-grade financial services. The project supports tokenization of real-world assets and would be the first major initiative to have been successful at doing so. Since its launch, the project has offered stable yields and facilitated over $100 million in tokenized assets within its ecosystem. As the RWA narrative blows up further, ONDO could too, as the leading name within the category at the moment. Why Could ONDO Pump? Ondo has been announcing major development milestones at regular intervals, which have often been met with much enthusiasm and price hikes from its dedicated set of investors. The price of its native token ONDO surged from around $0.6 to over $2 within a single month last year. This already indicates a trending factor for the project, which could be converted to massive gains, especially since it may soon announce major listings on tier-1 exchanges like Binance or Coinbase in the coming months. Aptos – Super Fast Blockchain Addressing Congestion Issues When it comes to utility projects, the scope for growth remains high, even if they boast an existing high market cap. This is the case with Aptos, which could easily be another top gainer in 2025, despite its constant growth over the past year. At the time of writing, the project’s native token APT sits at a market cap exceeding $5 billion but could easily make it to the top 15 or even top 10 cryptos list soon. This is because Aptos currently stands among the best blockchain networks, featuring speeds of up to 160,000 TPS under ideal conditions, low-latency solutions, and backing from some of the biggest names in the industry like a16z and Multicoin Capital. Why Could APT Pump? Aptos has been dubbed as the “Solana Killer,” which could indeed be a name it lives up to with the right level of development. Mohammad Shaikh, the CEO of Aptos Labs, resigned in December last year, and Aptos still managed to stand its ground without losing much of its value, quickly recovering once the market stabilized. Despite such changes in developments, trends, and leadership, the quality of Aptos’ ecosystem has helped it amass over $1.81 billion in TVL and record major user growth too. Collectively, this could lead to the token gaining further attention in the future, which could result in a huge rise in value, making it another project worth investing in to capitalize on the 2025 crypto season. Final Thoughts With the altcoin season yet to get into full swing, investors stand to potentially make huge gains in the coming months. For those looking to park funds into quality altcoins with utility, projects like NEAR Protocol and Ondo could be excellent picks. At the same time, those with relatively bigger risk appetites could go for presale projects like Minotaurus , which could offer higher gains, potentially by 10x or 50x, given its smaller market cap and early-stage pricing.

It is starting to look unlikely that the Federal Reserve Bank will cut rates this month following stubbornly high inflation rates of 2.7% recorded in the U.S. in December. During the last few FOMC meetings, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 bps in September, 25 bps in November, and another 25 bps in December, as analysts and observers had anticipated. Federal Reserve unlikely to cut interest rates this month There is now less than a 5% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month 🚨 pic.twitter.com/EcDkOU6wwJ — Barchart (@Barchart) January 8, 2025 According to data from Barchart, a financial markets trading and investing tool provider, there is a 95% chance that the Fed will not proceed with its successive rate cuts this month and maintain the current range. The charting platform also suggests that there is a 5% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates. The Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted at pumping the brakes on potential interest rate cuts this year after announcing a 25 bps cut to the Federal funds rate in December 2024. The cut marked the third consecutive rate cut, bringing rates to the 4.25%—4.5% range. During the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Federal Chair Jerome Powell announced the 25 bps rate cuts but advised that the committee would be cautious about further rate cuts. Powell said reduced rates pave the way for further progress in lowering high inflation levels. The remarks highlight an emerging trend among policymakers who are prospecting economic changes once Trump assumes office as the next U.S. president. The Fed chair explained during the press conference that the rates had been brought to a good place. He emphasized that the U.S. had entered a new phase, prompting attention to further rate cuts. “I think we’re in a good place, but I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts.” ~ Jerome Powell During the conference, the Fed chair acknowledged that U.S. inflation has significantly improved since 2022. The Fed’s chosen inflation indicator, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, declined from a high of nearly 5.5% year-over-year in 2022 to 2.8% in October due to aggressive policy tightening in the form of rate hikes between early 2022 and mid-2023. However, Powell claimed inflation had been stuck in a sideways movement in recent months as shelter cost improvements lagged slowly behind the Fed’s expectation. Powell highlighted that inflation was higher than the forecast in 2024 and that the U.S. economy was closer to a neutral rate, giving more reasons to be cautious about further moves. Powell cautions on uncertainty following Trump’s incoming tariff policies The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, also explained that policymakers and Fed staff members remain confident that price pressures will continue to ease and that the current policies will sustain a declining inflation trend, bringing inflation numbers closer to their desired target. However, the Federal Reserve chair cautioned against the potential uncertainty surrounding Trump’s promises of higher tariffs, tax cuts, and tougher immigration policies. According to Powell, analysts predict that Trump’s promised policies could increase inflation pressures, prompting the Fed to adjust interest rates accordingly. He also explained that the committee was looking into how tariffs can affect inflation. “We don’t know whether there will be retaliatory tariffs,” Powell said. “What the committee is doing now is discussing pathways and understanding how tariffs can affect inflation.” Despite the expected pause in rate cuts, U.S. central bankers issued fresh projections calling for two quarter-point interest-rate cuts in 2025 while responding to rising inflation. Official forecasts anticipate that the core PCE (personal consumption expenditures price index eliminating food and energy expenses) will stagnate at 2.5% through 2025. The stagnation is an improvement over the 2.8% rate from 2024 but still far higher than the Fed’s 2% target.

Reportedly, the drop is witnessed following a whale dump. Moreover, with the price correction, this meme coin is on the verge of testing its important support level.

The bullish momentum has attracted whales, while some crypto analysts believe that ADA’s rally is around the corner. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Makes $21 Million From AI Agent Token As Sectors Faces Backlash Cardano Whales Fill Their Bags In November, Cardano surged to the $1 mark for the first time in over two years, leading the crypto market after the post-election rally. However, the cryptocurrency faced one of its largest one-day retraces amid the December corrections, losing key support and dropping below $0.8. Cardano whales took advantage of the end-of-year pullback, acquiring 160 million ADA at a discount. Despite large investors betting on ADA, some market watchers pointed out that market sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency had turned bearish. However, ADA has experienced the New Year rally, increasing 27% in the past week, fueled by the market’s recovery and Bitcoin’s jump to the $100,000 mark. Cardano surged from its $0.84-$0.90 price range as the new year started, reclaiming the $1 mark by January 3. Since then, the cryptocurrency has moved within the $1.05-$1.11 range, recovering its levels before the December corrections. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Cardano whales have been loading their bag again, with over 10 million ADA in the last 24 hours, potentially signaling strong sentiment from large-scale investors on the cryptocurrency. Similarly, whales bought over 40 million ADA in 48 hours as Cardano’s price surged past $1. ADA Attempts Breakout As Bitcoin (BTC) held above $100,000 again, ADA’s price attempted to break from a short-term bullish pattern. According to Cardano trader Sebastian, the cryptocurrency tried breaking out of a bullish pennant after hitting the $1.15 resistance level on Tuesday morning. Moreover, Sebastian noted that ADA was “trying to flip a very important resistance area into support on the ADA/BTC chart.” Per the chart, this horizontal level was a key resistance level that led to the early 2024 highs after being turned into support. “A breakout to the upside from here could really send ADA to the bull market doors,” the investor noted. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, shared a bullish outlook for Cardano’s future price action after Grayscale added the cryptocurrency to its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). As reported by NewsBTC, Grayscale liquidated all its ADA holdings from GDLC in April, which accounted for 1.62% of the fund’s portfolio. This move saw Cardano’s price drop by 12% and received heavy criticism for its “lacking” performance. After yesterday’s news, Gambardello claimed that “the ADA wave is coming.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Builds Momentum: ‘Monster’ Price Move Coming—Analyst Nonetheless, Cardano’s rally has been momentarily halted as BTC’s latest price drop dragged ADA and the rest of the market down. Bitcoin just saw a sharp 4% drop to the $97,000 support zone, sending ADA 8% down. The cryptocurrency dipped from the $1.11 mark to the $1.02 range before recovering. Despite the drop, Cardano remains above the key support zone and above December correction levels, showing green numbers in most mid and long-term timeframes. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $1.03, a 5.8% decrease in the last 24 hours.

The company raced to the top as the leading producer of AI microchips, experiencing an impressive growth of approximately 118% in the stock market. In November 2024, the company surpassed Apple to grow into the world’s most valuable company. However, the new year seems to have challenges in store for them. The company’s stock hit an ATH of $149.93 on January 6, 2025, but then quickly declined by 6.2% barely a day later. The unexpected volatility appears to be a result of a change in investor confidence. Huang’s presentation at Nvidia’s product event has been implicated as the primary cause of the decline. Observers believe the CEO left investors unsatisfied with the progress updates in his speech. Jensen Huang misses the+ mark Prior to the event, Nvidia stock was at an all-time high of $153.05. This surge was spurred on by the anticipation of the company’s announcements at CES, particularly concerning their AI and robotics projects. Huang’s keynote at the event focused on the company’s new GeForce RTX 50-series gaming chips, based on the Blackwell architecture. Huang announced that these new GPUs, slated to launch in March, will deliver double the performance of their predecessors. He announced that the chips will come preinstalled on computers costing between $550 and $2,000. However, Huang failed to deliver on short-term promises to investors about the company’s AI and robotics advancements. Huang was very vague about the company’s progress simply stating that robotics technology would ramp up soon. Analysts have offered varied opinions on Nvidia’s announcements at CES and the resulting drop in the company’s stock. Benchmark Research analyst, Cody Acree, wrote in a note to clients that while Huang’s presentation was technically comprehensive, it lacked the concrete progress updates investors were seeking. The analyst noted the emphasis on the Blackwell architecture and the forthcoming Rubin platform. Nvidia Corp. ripple effect While NVDA stock was declining, other related companies were experiencing a surge. Micron Technology Inc. witnessed a 10% rise on January 6, and its shares saw an additional rise of 2.7% following the announcement that its memory technology will be integrated into Nvidia’s GPUs. The company’s shares are now trading around $101.91. Aurora Innovation experienced a 35% surge after revealing a long-term partnership with Nvidia and Germany’s Continental to deploy driverless trucks. Nvidia’s shares witnessed their worst one-day percentage drop since a 9.5% drop in September last year. However, despite the decline, analysts and investors are calling it a minor bleep as they remain confident and optimistic about the chipmaker’s prospects.

XRP saw a fair share as it recorded little losses while remaining firm in its bullish zone. XRP’s reaction to the latest market decline is not much compared to other large-cap losses in the past few hours. Although it may post a double-digit loss if supply increases. But currently, things are still looking good for the asset as it trades well in a buying zone. However, the recent rejection at the falling resistance line might be something to worry about as it may join the wide market correction if it loses the $2 level, which has been holding as support since last week. Such a scenario could plummet the price back to $1. This may cause serious pain and panic for most spot traders, although providing a sell opportunity on the futures. But if the crypto manages to stay above the mentioned holding support during this selling phase to form a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, we can anticipate a mega rally to a new high. However, with the look of things, it is uncertain if this asset will survive the fresh attack from the bears. While the next few days will unfold the next major direction, XRP is still considered bullish on the daily scale. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Considering the slight price fall since the bears stepped back, XRP appeared weak on the intraday trading and is likely to pull back to $2.15. A breakdown there could slip the price to $1.9 and $1.63. Lower support levels are $1.28 and $1. A break through the resistance line at $2.5 could activate a new buying phase to the $2.9 resistance level. Surpassing it should rally us to a new high of $3.3 and maybe $4 in the near term.

Top 5 Ethereum Tokens To Buy Now,https://coingape.com/markets/looking-for-a-rich-retirement-top-5-ethereum-tokens-to-buy-now/,"While American bond yields have surged this week, cryptocurrencies offer investors a good way to benefit from price movement and staking yields. With some Ethereum tokens yielding above 10%, these assets are doing better than bonds and dividend stocks. Let’s explore some of these ETH cryptocurrencies to buy for a rich retirement. Best Ethereum Token To Buy For Your Retirement Some of the highest-yielding Ethereum tokens are The Graph (GRT), Bittensor (TAO), Injective (INJ), Chainlink (LINK), and Mantra (OM). The Graph (GRT) The Graph is one of the top Ethereum tokens to buy and hold for your retirement. It is a unique crypto project developers use to access data using thousands of existing subgraphs. GRT has a staking yield of 14.60%, much higher than the 30-year Treasury yield of about 5%. In addition to its high staking yield, the weekly chart shows that the token has been in a tight range since 2022. The accumulation and distribution indicator has been rising, a sign that smart money investors are buying the dip. The token also formed a triple-bottom pattern, with a neckline at $0.5. Therefore, the GRT price may explode higher in the near term. The initial target is $0.5, up 133% from the current level. The Graph Price Chart Bittensor (TAO) Bittensor is another top Ethereum crypto to buy for retirement. It has a strong staking yield of 17.8% , making it one of the highest-yielding tokens. Bittensor is in the growing artificial intelligence industry. TAO has also formed an ascending triangle chart pattern whose upper side is around $683. This pattern often leads to more gains. As such, a move above the upper side of the resistance at $683 will signal to more gains, potentially to the psychological level at $1,000. Bittensor Price Chart Injective (INJ) Injective is one of the top Ethereum tokens to buy, with a staking yield of 10.67%. It is a layer-1 network focused on the DeFi industry and backed by Mark Cuban and Panterra. The INJ price has remained above the ascending trendline that links the lowest swings since August last year. It has formed a series of higher highs and higher lows, and is above the 78.6% retracement level. The injective price may continue rising. The initial target to watch is last December’s high of $35, which is about 53% above the current level. Injective Price Chart Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is a top crypto to stake thanks to its strong fundamentals and technicals. The most important fundamental is that it powers industries like DeFi and Real-World Asset Tokenization. It also offers a high yield of between 5% and 6%. LINK price has formed a cup and handle pattern, is supported by the 100-day moving average, and other technicals. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Chainlink price will rise to $50 in this crypto bull market. Chainlink Price Chart Mantra (OM) Mantra, a top Ethereum token in the Real World Tokenization, has continued to form a bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart. This pattern, which is shown below in black, is made up of a vertical line and some consolidation. Therefore, the OM price will likely have a strong breakout, with the first target being at $4.62, the upper side of the pennant. Mantra Price Chart Other Top Ethereum Crypto To Buy For Retirement The other top Ethereum tokens to buy and hold for retirement are the likes of Axelar, Band Protocol, Skale, and Casper Network.

Ethereum Price Led $700 Million in Net Crypto Liquidation The broader crypto market and Bitcoin price saw major selloff , but ETH led the liquidation in the last 24 hours. Coinglass data reveals more than $152 million in ETH were liquidated, with $132 million in long positions. Whereas, BTC saw $128 million in liquidation. Source: Coinglass The total crypto liquidation reaches $710 million in the last 24 hours. Notably, 237,476 traders were liquidated and the largest liquidation happened on leading crypto exchange Binance as someone sold ETH valued at $17.74 million. This is one of the largest in Ethereum history. Whales and Institutions Offload ETH Holdings Multiple ETH sell transactions were recorded over the last 24 hours as whales and institutional investors pared their holdings. Ethereum price fell after investors lost confidence about further rally as JOLTS job openings and ISM Services PMI data showed a strong US economy. This will cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to delay its rate cuts this year. Whale Alert highlighted a 40,000 ETH transfer worth $140.44 million from Arbitrum to Binance.

While cross-border payments firm Ripple said it created the stablecoin “to accelerate the adoption of stablecoin-based payment,” it is also eager to boost its adoption in DeFi, which is likely to increase RLUSD’s market capitalization and utilization substantially.

Bonk suffered the most loss amongst the top ten, with a 16% decrease since yesterday. The last 24 hours have been turbulent in the crypto space following a sudden meltdown in altcoin prices. This came after Bitcoin cut an insane $5k from its opening price during yesterday’s trading. That dump seriously affected Bonk’s recovery, and the price nosedived through the $0.00003 level to test the $0.000028 region today. Supply currently looks heavy, and there is no sign of slowing down bleeding. Following the breakdown, Bonk may target the $0.00002 level that flipped as resistance during the November 2024 rally. Though that level is marked as a fair value gap. A retest there could bring back buying. Nevertheless, Bonk’s trajectory is still considered bullish on a long-term scale. A strong rebound should put the bulls back on track after witnessing a broader correction. Though the overall market structure still assures more upside movement on the macro scale. But looking at the setup, this could mark the end of the last phase of the bull run if the ongoing bearish move extends below the August 2024 low. BONK’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price is correcting broadly, Bonk Inu may navigate the $0.000025 level for support in the near term before testing the main $0.0000212 level. Below it lies $0.0000184. Right now, the broken $0.00003 level is acting as key resistance for a potential recovery. Above it lies the $0,0000369 resistance level that activated a sell yesterday. Reclaiming those levels should activate a new buying phase to $0.0000444 and $0.00006. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00003, $0.0000369, $0.0000444 Key Support Levels: $0.000025, $0.0000213, $0.0000184 Spot Price: $0.0000294 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

As of today, January 8, cryptocurrencies continue to show weakness, which some investors consider as an opportunity to accumulate more. Precisely, data we gathered from CoinGlass this morning show that $631.52 million were liquidated from long positions . This is a significant domination over the total liquidations in the last 24 hours, summing up to $711.30 million. Overall, 237,701 traders lost their collateral money due to the liquidations, mostly trading “Others” low-cap cryptocurrencies. One single Ethereum ( ETH ) trader lost $17.41 million alone, betting on the ETH/USDT pair on Binance . From the “Others” category, traders lost $171.12 million to liquidations. Meanwhile, ETH traders lost $152.32 million and Bitcoin ( BTC ) $128.12 million. Long positions also dominated each of these categories, with $163 million, $131.50 million, and $111.40 million liquidations, respectively. Liquidation Heatmap (24h) & Total Liquidations. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold AI meme coins boom and doom Indeed, the massive loss from “Others” is a direct result from the recent hype around low-cap AI-related meme coins. This asset class has recorded an impressive surge since the end of 2024, attracting billions of dollars, as Finbold reported . Their popularity among traders led to big markets like Binance to list AI16Z , FARTCOIN , and ZEREBRO tokens for Futures trading . Essentially, these AI cryptocurrencies are benefiting from significant developments in the artificial intelligence industry, creating financial buzz and hype. For example, Sam Altman, ChatGPT’s creator, recently forecasted AGI and AI agents joining the workforce in 2025 , fueling the narrative. However, these low market cap and low liquidity coins offer more risks and suffer the most from volatility. Big investors, with a relevant share of tokens, can easily move the price to a desired direction, triggering massive liquidations.

Source: Finbold According to the finance best-selling author, Robert Kiyosaki, this crash represents “great news” for BTC investors . “Bitcoin crashing. Great news. I continue buying Bitcoin because Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale,” Kiyosaki said in a post . “Remember ‘Buy low… and HODL.’ Less than 2 million more Bitcoins to be mined,” he concluded. Indeed, bullish investors who buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on spot have less to worry about during these crashes. On the other hand, crypto traders who bet on derivatives, usually with leverage, will often be victims of high volatility events, effectively losing money to liquidations, as happened during this most recent crash.

Pro-crypto SEC leadership changes could favor Ripple, though the case’s complexity calls for cautious optimism. The SEC Pushed ‘Ethical Limits’ The legal tussle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is among the most intriguing topics in the crypto space. It all started in December 2020 when the agency sued the company, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen, accusing them of illegally raising more than $1.3 billion in an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. The two entities have been throwing punches at each other in the following years , and despite the numerous developments and court rulings, the case remains ongoing. According to John Deaton (an American lawyer representing thousands of XRP investors in the aforementioned lawsuit ), the SEC “played dirty” and pushed “ethical limits” in the process. He claimed that the Commission’s attorneys “engaged in abusive discovery tactics, threatening and harassing Ripple’s overseas customers, investors, and partners.” “Despite having the records of every XRP transaction made by Garlinghouse, the SEC attempted to subpoena all of Brad’s, and his family’s, personal financial records, including credit card statements. It was an attempt to bully, threaten, and coerce Garlinghouse (and Ripple) into submitting to the all powerful SEC,” he added. Deaton, though, maintained that the company’s CEO endured the pressure, fought back “every step of the way,” and eventually won. “I love America because two years and one Presidential election later, the future couldn’t look more bright for an industry, company and CEO,” the lawyer concluded. It is worth mentioning that Deaton’s post was accompanied by a photo of Garlinghouse, the newly elected president of the USA, Donald Trump, and Ripple’s CTO Stuart Alderoty, who recently had dinner together. The XRP army interpreted this gathering as good news for the firm’s potential growth in the near future and the performance of its native token. Earlier this month, Garlinghouse credited the substantial resurgence of the cryptocurrency market to Donald Trump’s win in the presidential elections. He said Ripple signed more US deals in the final six weeks of the year than in the previous six months, while 75% of the firm’s open positions are now based in America. Has Ripple Won the Case? While the company notched several partial court wins, a final resolution of the lawsuit has yet to be seen . Last summer, Judge Analisa Torres ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million civil penalty for violating federal securities laws through its institutional sales of XRP. It is important to note that in 2023, the same magistrate found that the firm’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through centralized exchanges did not breach the rules. Ripple respected the decision and was ready to pay the fine. After all, it represented just a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC initially requested. However, the watchdog officially appealed in October, delaying the outcome indefinitely. The upcoming changes in the SEC’s leadership, such as replacing Chairman Gary Gensler with the pro-crypto Paul Atkins , may result in a favorable resolution for Ripple. The XRP army, though, should have somewhat realistic hopes, considering the complexity of the entire legal process.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped 6% over the past day, falling below $96K as a spot sell-off driven by macroeconomic concerns pushed BTC price action to a “pivotal” level, contributing to an 8.4% slump in the global crypto market. According to analyst Skew, following Bitcoin’s recent dip, a further drop to $95K—just $300 away at press time—could potentially lead BTC to retest levels as low as $88K. “Right around 1D lows ($92K – $88K), bid liquidity has been buffered with a significant increase in demand,” the analyst noted , adding that spot flow will also play a vital part for the rest of this week. A related chart showed liquidity blocks positioned lower in the Binance order book, signaling strong buyer interest near the $88,000 mark. Skew’s scenario could play out as there has been an uptick in selling pressure on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. According to CryptoQuant analysts, Binance’s hourly Net Taker Volume turned sharply negative on Jan. 8, hitting a yearly low of -$325 million during the release of the ISM PMI and JOLTs Job Openings data, which signaled unfavourable conditions for risk assets like Bitcoin. Among other experts, fellow trader Johnny also anticipated a potential dip into that zone in the coming weeks. $BTC I think a move like this over the next 2-3 weeks going into the inauguration is highly probable pic.twitter.com/cUVnbzDOXq — Johnny (@CryptoGodJohn) January 8, 2025 Meanwhile, according to pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has entered the $91,000–$101,165 range after failing to hold the critical daily support level at $101,165. This could see BTC oscillate within this range in the short term, with $91,000 acting as the next key support level. The bearish predictions for BTC emerged as institutional demand appeared to weaken, evidenced by a significant drop in inflows on Jan. 7, which stood at $52.9 million —nearly 94% lower than the almost $1 billion recorded just a day earlier.

Source: IntoTheBlock According to data from IntoTheBlock, net flows from exchanges surged from a withdrawal of 346.47 BTC on Jan. 6 to 1.85K BTC on Tuesday, Jan. 7. Such an increase in withdrawals suggests that investors are moving their holdings from exchanges to personal wallets, likely intending to hold them for longer periods, thereby reducing sell-off pressure.

Another bullish case for Bitcoin was presented by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who noted that the Apparent Demand for Bitcoin “remains very high.” The Apparent Demand indicator measures Bitcoin’s demand by comparing the number of newly mined coins with the number of coins that have been held for over a year.

Solana meme coins are gaining traction across the crypto sphere even though the price change in the last 24 hours remained bearish. Crypto Whale Accumulates WIF, POPCAT, and Other Meme Coins A crypto whale, identified as a mysterious whale in the latest Lookonchain report , has reportedly bought 7.25 million WIF and 5.77 million POPCAT for an approximate value of $13.34 million and $3.83 million, respectively. This has triggered bullish futuristic speculation for both meme coins with sentiments spreading across the sphere of Solana meme coins. Other meme coins that the mysterious whale bets on are 4.57 million FWOG and 3.9 million MICHI for a rough value of $922k and $467k. That said, Solana meme coins and other tokens from the segment are at the center of the stage with the community speculating their future value. It is simultaneously expected that some of the top meme coins in January 2025 could see shifts in their rankings if the trend sustains any longer. Solana Meme Coins are Gaining Traction Some of the top Solana meme coins can be seen making significant gains, so much so that the positions are changing nearly every hour. The current top Solana meme coin gainers are XP and Victorious, up by 510.7% and 201.6%, respectively, as the article is being drafted. Their trading values are $0.0003543 and $0.00008787, applicable in the same order. Simultaneously, other top Solana meme coins are also gaining traction, with the recent crypto whale’s action indicating that the traders are buying the dip. For instance, BONK price was down by 14% in the last 24 hours and investors are flocking to accumulate the token before it marks any uptick. The sentiment is similarly applicable for WIF which is down by 10.4% during the same time window. In other words, Solana meme coins have declined in a single day and investors are catching the hint of correction to purchase the dips. Meme Coin Sector In Focus The crypto whales are making significant moves in the meme coin sector today. For instance, the frog-themed meme coin PEPE Coin price was down by 11.16% in the last 24 hours to a value of $0.00001819 with a whale sparking market discussions. The whale has deposited 427 billion PEPE tokens worth $8.5 million to Kraken as the price slips recently. However, despite the recent downturn, many have predicted a potential rally ahead for the meme coins. In addition, the growing community support and rising meme trends on social media platforms could further boost the prices higher. Besides, the anticipation of meme coin’s integration into mainstream payments gained traction. Notably, speculations have soared over Dogecoin integration into X payments, especially with Elon Musk’s backing for the top dog-themed meme coin previously.

Historical Context According to King, Bitcoin’s price has repeatedly hit a resistance line over the past eight years, marking key moments of reversal. 2015–2016 : Bitcoin rallied but was halted at this resistance before retreating. 2017 Crash : After reaching its then-all-time high of nearly $20,000, Bitcoin hit the resistance line and saw a steep drop. 2021 Bear Market : Following a record high of $69,000, Bitcoin encountered the resistance line again, leading to significant corrections. 2. 2025 Prediction King warns that Bitcoin is once again approaching this critical resistance line, setting the stage for a similar market crash. Key Factors Behind the Bearish Outlook 1. Repeating Market Patterns King believes Bitcoin is in a cyclical pattern : Rapid rise toward resistance followed by sharp declines. He suggests that Bitcoin’s current rally is unsustainable, as it mimics past cycles. 2. Broader Market Trends Institutional Inflows and Outflows : Bitcoin ETFs have attracted significant inflows, but any slowdown in institutional participation could exacerbate price pressures. Macroeconomic Uncertainty : Global economic conditions, including interest rate policies, could weigh on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. 3. Fundamental Criticism King has been critical of Bitcoin’s utility, famously declaring that “Bitcoin is useless.” He argues that Bitcoin lacks tangible use cases beyond speculation. Counterarguments from Bitcoin Advocates 1. Growing Institutional Adoption Proponents highlight the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutions and nations. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and initiatives like Strategic Bitcoin Reserves by U.S. states contradict King’s dismissal of Bitcoin’s utility. 2. Scarcity and Halving Cycles Bitcoin’s fixed supply and upcoming halving event in 2024 could strengthen its long-term price prospects, countering King’s bearish narrative. 3. Broader Market Sentiment Bitcoin currently holds 90% of its supply in profit , indicating robust market confidence, according to CryptoQuant. Possible Scenarios for 2025 Bearish Scenario Bitcoin fails to break through the resistance line. Price falls below $30,000, triggering panic among retail investors. Bullish Scenario Strong institutional inflows and favorable macroeconomic conditions drive Bitcoin past the resistance line. Bitcoin establishes new all-time highs, fueled by scarcity and increasing demand. FAQs What is the long-term resistance line for Bitcoin? It’s a trendline observed over the past eight years that Bitcoin’s price has struggled to surpass. Why does Jacob King predict Bitcoin will drop below $30K in 2025? King believes Bitcoin’s cyclical price behavior and inability to breach the resistance line will lead to another major crash. What are counterarguments to this prediction? Bitcoin advocates cite institutional adoption, scarcity, and favorable macroeconomic trends as factors that could sustain price growth. Has Bitcoin hit this resistance line before? Yes, Bitcoin has encountered this resistance during major market cycles, including the 2017 crash and the 2021 correction. What’s the significance of Bitcoin’s current profit level? With 90% of Bitcoin supply in profit, market sentiment remains bullish, suggesting resilience against short-term corrections. Conclusion Jacob King’s prediction of Bitcoin falling below $30K in 2025 adds a controversial perspective to ongoing market discussions. While his views highlight important historical trends and resistance levels, they clash with the broader optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s potential as a scarce and institutional-grade asset . The next few months will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin can overcome its historical resistance or succumb to the bearish patterns King anticipates.

38694108,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/cardano-ada-needed-5-years-to-create-millionaires-this-altcoin-aims-to-do-it-in-1-year,1736342843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/38694108.jpeg,"Cardano (ADA) Needed 5 Years to Create Millionaires, This Altcoin Aims to Do It in 1 Year",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/cardano-ada-needed-5-years-to-create-millionaires-this-altcoin-aims-to-do-it-in-1-year,"After being in the crypto space since its inception in 2017, Cardano (ADA) did not create any millionaires overnight. Today, the altcoin is priced at $0.87 instead of being valued at three times that price, as was the case five years after its peak. With the crypto market on a downtrend, Rexas Finance (RXS), an emerging altcoin, plans to achieve the target within one year. Due to its unique structure and the growth of its ecosystem, RXS is an interesting investment for those looking to get quick returns, as the time for its breakout seems just around the corner. Cardano (ADA): When Peak Investment Paid Off After 5 Years Cardano allows for all-encompassing uses while offering top-tier security. However, after its debut, the asset struggled and only garnered traction in September 2021, when its price skyrocketed and reached $3 roughly 5 years after its inception. After reaching its ATH, the market began to correct itself, and ADA experienced fluctuations. As much as Cardano has achieved, it underlines the perseverance required to earn decent returns in the crypto space. If you managed to buy at the right time, you had to wait several years of market cycles before you could profit. While technically, ADA is still a contender, its path to success suggests that there should be a strong focus on the right timing and patient endurance on the project. Rexas Finance (RXS): Targeting 1 Year to Make Millionaires Rexas Finance aims to achieve much more than Cardano achieved in less time. In a single year, Rexas Finance aims to deliver more than what can be earned over a lifetime. Stage eleven, currently underway, is priced at $0.175. So far, in the presale, it has raised over $34.9 million. As a result of this early-stage positioning, investors are presented with an opportunity to be part of a project explosion at a very early stage. Real-World Asset Tokenization A key part of Rexas Finance’s ecosystem is its focus on real-world asset tokenization. The Rexas Token Builder provides a platform through which users can create digital tokens representing tangible assets like real estate and commodities and intangible assets like intellectual property. In this way, Rexas Finance is gaining substantial control over the asset-buying, selling, and trading processes by eliminating the asset digitization barrier. With improved liquidity for thousands of assets previously considered impossible to liquefy, the scope of investments for people and businesses is set to widen. RXS's focus on practical application differentiates it from other speculative and unusable projects. A Blockchain Venture That Possesses All the Necessary Tools Tokenization is just one aspect of the Rexas Finance universe. The QuickMint Bot combines creating tokens with instant messaging, enabling users with no blockchain knowledge to use it through Telegram or Discord. The Rexas Treasury increases the yield on crypto deposits, giving DeFi enthusiasts the tools they need to manage their investments. These features onboard users with various degrees of exposure to the blockchain world, from first-time technology users to experienced investors. The platform is designed to appeal as much to retail clients as to institutional ones, lending it a strong focus on usability and performance. Increasing Market Presence Rexas Finance has already established its reputation by being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, making it easier to mark its presence in the market. The project’s giveaway of $1 million, where 20 winners take home RXS worth $50,000 each, has also increased community participation and attracted new investors. Analysts assume that RXS could account for a minimum tenfold increase in value by 2025 with these initiatives, making it easy for one to become a millionaire much quicker than Cardano did. Why Rexas Finance Could Beat Cardano Rexas Finance is more advantageous because it focuses on real-world usage, early-stage investments, and an unexplored ecosystem, allowing for rapid transformation. Compared to Cardano, RXS has the potential for rapid advancement since it utilizes cutting-edge blockchain technology rather than sustaining years of expansion and market cycles. The case of Cardano teaches us that it takes time for fruits to bear fruit, but Rexas Finance enables faster capital returns that can be life-changing. With great potential to emphasize real use cases alongside its robust ecosystem, it is set to attract investors seeking growth in a shorter time. Conclusion The path of Cardano, starting in 2017 and ending with millionaires in 2021, marks it as an enigma with potential determined to last in the future. However, for investors focusing on making returns in a shorter time frame, Rexas Finance is a promising option. It intends to do what it took Cardano five years to achieve in just a year, simply due to its emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets, RXS tools, and market presence. Rexas Finance is an exceptional opportunity for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward projects worldwide. As time passes, RXS is becoming one of the best options for anyone wanting to substantially increase their capital within a very short time frame, especially as 2025 nears.

The whale has bet on this altcoin’s price trajectory, but the unexpected downtrend brought the crypto whale’s investment to collapse. Let’s discuss the Sui token’s price situation and how it can lead to millions in liquidation. SUI Price Downtrend Risks $20M Liquidation For Crypto Whale Sui token’s crash to $4.56 will liquidate $20M for this individual crypto whale, which has 4.1 million SUI, equivalent to $19.2M, and 100,000sSUI, equivalent to $470,000. The Lookonchain data reveal that the whale has deposited nearly $20M worth of assets on the decentralized lending protocol Suilend. In exchange, the whale borrowed $14.4 million in stablecoins. With this, the crypto whale shows support for the token by betting on its further growth. However, the current market crash dropped the SUI price by 10% today, threatening the liquidation of a position worth millions for this crypto whale. This becomes an unstoppable event, as the whale needs to return the borrowed stablecoins. Not only liquidation, the Sui’s decline to $4.56 could result in the buildup of a further price crash for the altcoin. Now, it all depends on Sui’s performance in the next few hours. SUI Price Prediction: Will It Recover or Crash Further? Sui reached a peak of $5.35 just two days ago amid high open interest and investor’s bullish sentiments. However, the rally was short-lived, and it crashed 15% from the prime, currently trading at $4.59. This drop threatens an individual whale’s million in liquidation. Meanwhile, on the broader picture, the altcoin still shows slight bullish dominance, as the crypto analyst Satoshi’s prediction shows a rising channel. However, the current SUI is closer to the trendline’s upper boundary. The price could decline even further if it faced resistance at this upper boundary. Regardless, the analyst believes in the ascending trajectory of the Sui token’s price performance. According to him, this ascending channel flawlessly w/ price now pressing against diagonal resistance. A breakout past the $5.50 could lead to further gains. Bottom Line After hitting an ATH two days ago, the Sui tokens could face a massive downtrend with the $20M liquidation. As the SUI price struggles to breakout in the 24-hour timeframe, the liquidation will happen with the token attaining the $4.56 mark. However, the impact would not be limited to this altcoin only. The broader crypto market might face selling pressure. However, considering the ascending trajectory, some analysts still expect a bullish outlook.

As the Bitcoin price dropped below $95,000, the Ethereum price also marked a low close to $3,300. Meanwhile, the bulls managed to halt the bearish trend and seem to be trying hard to validate a rebound. This suggests the market participants continue to remain bullish on the ETH price and hence the rally is believed to trigger a strong rebound shortly. The year 2025 started with a notable bullish trend that elevated the entire crypto market along with BTC & ETH. This was expected to attract some bearish volume but the positive sentiments over the token remained unchanged. The data from Santiment shows the price change since the start of the year remains within the positive range, regardless of the interim pullback. Hence, indicating a potential pullback could be on its way. Popular tokens like XRP, XLM, ADA, etc. and a few more display more strength along with BTC & ETH. The data also shows that AI tokens are gaining more momentum compared to the other categories, which may in turn impact the ETH price as well. Therefore, despite the current pullback, the price is still primed to mark new highs, probably above a five-digit figure before the end of 2025. But how? The price is stuck at 0.78 FIB but has defended the support at 0.618 FIB. A rise from the range may only initiate a fresh rise towards 1 FIB. But here’s when this could happen. The historical price action of Ethereum suggests the token is stuck up at a range and facing issues in rising above $4000. The latest attempt to rise above the range has faded as the technicals have turned bearish. The weekly MACD suggests a drop in the buying volume with the levels could undergo a bearish crossover. The short-term bearish action could be overcome quickly, but the long-term price action could impact the token in the long term. Currently, the price is holding the 50-day MA as a support and if it fails to defend, a wider correction may begin for the ETH price rally. Meanwhile, the platform witnessed a slight rise in volume, which has increased the volatility. On the other hand, the token is yet to gain strength against Bitcoin, which has remained stuck within a descending parallel channel along the lower bands. While the possibility of a quick rebound remains few, the Ethereum (ETH) price may also not undergo a fine upswing. However, a change in the market dynamics and a huge influx of buying volume may turn the tables for the second-largest token as the higher targets remain fixed above $10,000, somewhere around $12,000 later this year.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 13:28:23

From AI-enhanced non-playable characters (NPCs) in blockchain-based games like Illuvium to the rise of AI-driven autonomous companies and tokenized assets predicted by Multicoin Capital, the next year promises significant developments. Illuvium to Revolutionize NPCs with Virtuals Protocol Partnership Blockchain-based gaming franchise Illuvium is embarking on a journey to redefine in-game interactions by integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its non-playable characters (NPCs). Through a strategic partnership with Virtuals, the protocol behind viral social AI agents like AIXBT, Illuvium aims to elevate player experiences across its trilogy of games currently in beta. The collaboration hinges on Virtuals' G.A.M.E AI model framework, which introduces dynamic, reactive NPC behavior. Unlike static NPCs in traditional games, these agent-driven characters adapt their dialogue, quests, and challenges based on a player’s actions. This innovation promises to immerse players in a gaming environment teeming with emergent storytelling. In a Jan. 7 post on X, the team behind Virtuals illustrated this concept, ”Imagine this: You walk into a bar. The bartender agent dreams of being the most devoted husband. In a traditional game, your options might be to buy a drink or play a song. In an agent-driven world, you could insult his wife, sparking his anger, leading him to attack you.” Such interactions could fundamentally alter the dynamics of a game area. Players might unlock bespoke rewards or quests by treating NPCs kindly or trigger unforeseen consequences by choosing hostility. This transformative technology will first be deployed in Illuvium: Overworld, a third-person exploration game set on an alien planet. Players, known as rangers, venture through the alien landscapes, discovering and capturing creatures called Illuvials, which can be used in Illuvium: Arena, a battler game. Kieran Warwick, co-founder and CEO of Illuvium, expressed his enthusiasm by saying, ”We couldn’t be more excited to collaborate with [Virtuals] on this transformative framework for our up-and-coming MMO Lite.” The AI-enhanced NPCs are also set to feature in Illuvium Zero, a base-building game where players gather resources and craft skins for use in Overworld and Arena. With this integration, Illuvium is poised to offer a seamless and dynamic gaming experience across its interconnected ecosystem. For Virtuals, this partnership marks a significant milestone. The protocol has already made waves with its agentic NPCs on platforms like Roblox. Co-founder Ether Mage highlighted the potential of the collaboration by stating, ”Earlier this year, while pioneering Agentic NPCs in Roblox, we envisioned a future where AAA games like Illuvium could harness this technology to fuel an explosion of dynamic content.” Virtuals’ AI agents are designed to transcend individual games, remembering their interactions with players across multiple platforms. As Ether Mage explained, these agents could transition from battling bosses in Elden Ring to building shelters in Minecraft or assisting with tactics in Dota 2, offering a consistent and evolving relationship with players. The Virtuals Protocol: A Rising Star Virtuals Protocol has seen tremendous growth, both in popularity and valuation. Its native token, VIRTUAL, has skyrocketed by 9,900% in the last two months, reaching an all-time high of $5.07. This surge highlights the growing interest in AI-driven gaming and social applications. One of the standout products of the Virtuals ecosystem is AIXBT, an AI influencer that delivers crypto market updates and insights. The success of AIXBT demonstrates the versatility of Virtuals' technology and its appeal across different sectors. The integration of Virtuals’ AI framework into Illuvium represents a bold step forward for blockchain gaming. By combining dynamic NPC behavior with Illuvium’s decentralized gaming platform, the partnership paves the way for richer, more immersive player experiences. As the gaming and blockchain sectors continue to merge, innovations like agent-driven NPCs signal a future where games are no longer static worlds but living ecosystems shaped by player actions and AI-driven complexity. This collaboration could set a new standard for gaming, where the possibilities are as infinite as the stories players create. Multicoin Capital Predicts 2025 as a Breakthrough Year for Web3, AI, and Institutional Adoption In other AI-related news, Multicoin Capital, a prominent venture capital firm in the blockchain and crypto space, has forecasted 2025 to be a transformative year for Web3, driven by the convergence of AI and the tokenization of financial assets. In its recently released report , “Frontier Ideas for 2025,” the firm outlines a future marked by rapid institutional adoption, the proliferation of AI-driven businesses, and a significant evolution in the crypto capital markets. The report anticipates a surge in AI-run ”zero-employee companies” — fully autonomous entities capable of managing complex business operations without human intervention. This development, coupled with a ”frenzy of institutionalization” fueled by tokenization, could redefine industries and create new paradigms in finance, technology, and beyond. Security tokens, often considered the next frontier for blockchain technology, are expected to gain significant traction. These tokens, which represent ownership in real-world assets such as private credit, startup equity, and public stocks, are predicted to ”take off in a meaningful way.” Multicoin's analysts believe that 2025 will be a banner year for cryptocurrency adoption, propelled by a pro-crypto administration led by President-elect Donald Trump and the phenomenal success of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The report notes that institutional inflows into crypto assets have already started to rise, with US BTC ETFs breaking the $100 billion net asset mark in November 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The firm expects traditional financial institutions to race to offer crypto-focused financial products, creating a more inclusive and transparent financial ecosystem. ”Blockchains ensure that all participants have access to a real-time, immutable record of transactions. This level of transparency and security is a stark contrast to the opaque and sometimes risky centralized databases of traditional finance,” the report states. A pivotal trend identified in the report is the rise of agentic AIs, autonomous machines designed to pursue complex goals independently. These advanced AI systems are reshaping the digital economy, capable of building Web3 applications, launching tokens, and interacting with humans without supervision. The development of chain-of-thought reasoning models has enabled AI agents to think, plan, execute, and self-correct, laying the groundwork for their expanded role in the crypto ecosystem. Multicoin envisions these AI agents as ”alpha hunters,” whose primary function is to autonomously identify profitable opportunities in crypto markets and execute trades in real-time. This evolution could pave the way for Zero-Employee Companies — entirely AI-driven entities that manage business operations without human oversight. ”Crypto capital markets will fund ambitious attempts at Zero-Employee Companies, leading to incredible breakthroughs across all business operations,” the report predicts. Tokenization Gains Momentum In addition to AI advancements, tokenization is expected to play a central role in the 2025 financial landscape. Initially, private credit and startup equity are likely to dominate the tokenization space, with public stock tokens following suit. By democratizing access to traditionally illiquid assets, tokenization could further accelerate institutional and retail adoption of blockchain technology. The predicted developments in Web3, AI, and tokenization are expected to have far-reaching implications. With institutional complacency giving way to rapid adoption, Multicoin foresees a future where blockchain and AI technologies become deeply integrated into global financial systems, enabling more efficient, transparent, and inclusive markets. Moreover, the intersection of AI and Web3 could lead to innovations that go beyond finance, including AI agents capable of functioning across multiple industries. These agents could transition seamlessly between tasks, such as trading cryptocurrencies, managing digital assets, and even performing customer service roles in virtual environments. Multicoin Capital’s vision for 2025 paints a picture of a rapidly evolving digital economy, where AI and blockchain technologies drive unprecedented innovation. The firm’s confidence in the potential of AI-driven businesses, tokenized assets, and institutional adoption underscores the transformative power of these emerging technologies. As security tokens gain momentum and AI agents redefine business operations, 2025 could indeed be a pivotal year for Web3. With institutional players entering the space at a dizzying pace and technological advancements pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, the next chapter of the digital revolution is poised to unfold.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-08 13:30:00

The ETP’s inflows this past year are 2.4 times bigger than what was recorded in 2021 and 60 times bigger than in 2023. Ethereum beats Solana regarding inflows in 2024, with just $69 million, representing only 4% of all assets under management. While Solana’s numbers are small relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it still leads all other altcoins. Approval Of Spot ETFs Helps Increase Inflows The industry saw record-breaking inflows in 2024, which is better than what the bull market experienced in 2021. In 2021, cryptocurrency investment products recorded more than $10 billion in net inflows. In short, last year’s inflows were 4x bigger than the recorded amount in 2021. According to Bufferfill, the surge in global crypto investment products benefited from the US’ approval of spot ETFs for Bitcoin in January 2024. In January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were followed by eight spot ETFs for Ether on May 22nd. According to recent data, these spot Bitcoin ETFs are the main reasons for the inflows in Bitcoin-related investments. Butterfill also explained that these ETFs will redefine the inflows for crypto investments in the future. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Hit $1? Expert Calls It A Realistic Goal For 2025 – Here’s Why Better Days Ahead For US Bitcoin Spot ETPs Aside from CoinShares, Galaxy Digital also offered a rosy picture of the future of the crypto investments industry. In a report shared last December 31st, 2024, the company boldly predicted that the US spot ETPs market will continue to soar in 2025. The report indicated that this niche will reach $250 billion in AUMs this year. Meanwhile, Alex Thorne of Firmwide Research said Bitcoin ETPs are closing in on US gold ETPs in total value of assets under management. Thorne added that Bitcoin will continue to become one of the top-performing assets on its risk-adjusted basis. Other analysts shared that Ether’s spot ETPs will also surge this year. The Ethereum blockchain will benefit from a Trump presidency and favorable regulatory changes.

It’s Russia and Ukraine all over again, but this time with Iran and Israel – basically, the Middle East is at war. Then, there is a new virus stemming from China – again. Then, the Trump against China episode gets a sequel. Investors are yet to learn their lessons. Some have resorted to panic trading. The crypto market is bleeding – red trading charts not seen in a while since Trump won to become the 47th POTUS. Do investors know any better, or is this going to be another economic depression? Major crypto tokens suffering setbacks. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, Chinese health officials are reportedly monitoring increased cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The crypto industry is already feeling it. Bitcoin fell 5% to $96,527 in Asia after reaching above the $100,000 mark earlier this week. In addition, Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research, said that both the NASDAQ and S&P 500 fell more than 1% yesterday. However, this was caused by fears around the US economy as the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain elevated interest rates for a longer period. Is HMPV a significant threat? During Trump’s time in office, the economy suffered from COVID-19 being touted as a new deadly virus. According to reports, HMPV is also a respiratory disease. The disease is related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and has been present since at least 2001. It was first discovered in the Netherlands. Its outbreaks are prevalent during the winter months. According to local officials, cases have been increasing in northern China, particularly among children. The country’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has cautioned individuals to take health and hygiene precautions. Still, it has disputed internet allegations of overburdened hospitals and worries of another Covid-like pandemic. However, experts claim that the apparent increase in cases is likely partly due to new technology detecting and identifying HMPV more easily. Dr Jacqueline Stephens said, “I think we’re just more cautious of outbreaks now.” The senior lecturer in public health at Flinders University in Australia added, “Everyone is hypervigilant, and you hear this term human metapneumovirus, and it sounds kind of scary.” Prof Paul Griffin, director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services in Brisbane, said, “The challenge is at the moment there’s not much we can do except educate people [that] it’s around to reduce transmission. There’s no vaccine or antivirals, although there are some vaccines in development.” This fear is currently leading to liquidations as people prepare financially. The Iran-Israel conflict’s effect on the crypto industry The ongoing Iran-Israel conflict appears to presage upheaval in the crypto markets. Investors have expressed apprehensions about the potential consequences of the situation on crypto assets as tensions continue to escalate. The historical conflict in 2024 has spread in two distinct phases: the first phase, which lasted from April 1 to April 19, and the second phase, which has been ongoing since July 31. A business publication reported that Bitcoin’s (BTC) price plummeted from $70,000 to $60,000 during the initial phase. It also stated that the decline in the price of BTC had an impact on other crypto, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE), among others. This resulted in a $500 billion loss for the overall crypto sector. Geopolitical events have traditionally had a significant impact on global markets. The crypto space is no exception. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine war had an impact on Bitcoin exchange results. According to a panel research of 20 countries from January 23 to April 16, 2022, it resulted in a 0.2% fall in crypto trading volume. On the other hand, Ukraine approved legislation legalizing crypto as a means of raising funds for their fight against Russia. Following Iran’s missile strike on Israel, BTC’s price fell to $60,200, a 6% drop from a high of around $64,000 at the time. In addition to BTC, ETH and SOL had losses of more than 4% and 5%, respectively. Also, Coinglass discovered that the circumstance resulted in massive sell-offs of $523.37 million within 24 hours. However, the most serious worry is the conflict’s long-term impact on the crypto market. It is widely held that the crypto market is currently at a juncture, swaying between bearish uncertainty and optimistic optimism. At present, the most significant uncertainty is whether these disputes will catapult crypto into the realm of economic haven or heighten concerns about market instability.

His remarks come at a time when Bitcoin’s price experienced a sharp drop of nearly 7% in just one day. Additionally, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw its MSTR stock price plunge by almost 10%. Peter Schiff Warns of Potential Crash In a recent tweet post Schiff points out that once it becomes clear the U.S. government will not be purchasing Bitcoin, many investors who bought in anticipation of such a move may decide to sell. He suggests that this could trigger a wave of selling pressure, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price down. Once it becomes obvious that the U.S. Govt. won't be buying #Bitcoin , those who bought hoping to front-run that buying will sell. @saylor will be forced to accelerate his leveraged Bitcoin purchases to prevent a crash. But this will only delay the crash until $MSTR crashes first. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 8, 2025 A key figure in this scenario is Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, who has been one of Bitcoin’s most vocal corporate supporters. Saylor has used leverage to build a massive Bitcoin position, betting that the cryptocurrency’s price will continue to rise. According to Schiff, Saylor may be forced to accelerate his Bitcoin purchases in a desperate attempt to stave off a market crash, which would only delay the inevitable collapse of his leveraged position. Saylor’s Strategy To Backfire Schiff’s warning centers on the idea that Saylor’s strategy of buying Bitcoin with borrowed money could eventually backfire, leading to what he sees as a collapse in both Bitcoin’s price and MicroStrategy’s stock value. Recently, saylor announced its plan to raise $2 billion by offering perpetual preferred stock in the first quarter of 2025. This move is part of the company’s strategy to buy more Bitcoin and strengthen its financial position. This scenario could worsen if the Bitcoin price drops sharply, leaving Saylor unable to cover his position and forcing him to liquidate assets at a loss. Bitcoin & MSTR Price Plunge As of now, Bitcoin’s price fell below $95K , reflecting a nearly 7% drop over the past 24 hours, bringing its market cap to $1.88 trillion. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 46.88, indicating that bears are in control of Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) closed at $341 , down by almost 10% from the previous session.

The delisting to impact crypto such as Axelar (AXL), Coin98 (C98), Enjin Coin (ENJ), Bella Protocol (BEL), NULS, Lisk (LSK), Litentry (LIT), and SafePal (SFP). As a result, the price of some abovementioned crypto drops in response. Binance Delisting AXL, C98, and ENJ Coin Spot Trading Pairs On January 8, Binance revealed the plan to remove and cease support some spot trading pairs for Axelar, Coin98, and Enjin Coin. The delisting will take effect at 03:00 UTC on January 10. This move followed Binance’s periodic review of market liquidity and trading volume. The exchange cited poor liquidity and low trading volume as the main reasons for delisting these pairs. Even though the affected tokens can still be used for trading alongside other assets on the platform, the decision to remove these trading pairs has raised concerns among traders and investors. The delisting of pairs like AXL/FDUSD, C98/BTC, and ENJ/ETH signifies a shift in market dynamics, prompting users to adjust their positions accordingly. Investors To See Liquidity Issues? Furthermore, the removal of trading pairs from Binance can result in reduced liquidity, which can increase the volatility of the affected tokens, especially amid crypto market crash . The exchange also declared that it would terminate Spot Trading Bot services for the affected pairs. Users who have set up automated trading bots for these pairs are advised to cancel or adjust them to avoid potential losses. This warning highlights the broader implications of delisting for traders who rely on automated strategies. The delisting news triggered a sharp decline in the price of the affected tokens, contributing to the ongoing market volatility. Binance to Remove BEL, NULS, LSK, SFP, and LIT Margin Pairs Binance Margin announced the delisting of several cross and isolated margin trading pairs. These include Bella Protocol (BEL), NULS, Lisk (LSK), Litentry (LIT), and SafePal (SFP) in BTC pairs. The delisting process starts with restrictions on asset transfers into Isolated Margin accounts. Isolated margin borrowing will be suspended on January 9. Binance advised users to close their positions or transfer assets to Spot Accounts before January 16. On this date, all affected positions will be settled automatically, and pending orders will be canceled. Cross-margin pairs such as LIT/BTC, NULS/BTC, and SFP/BTC will be delisted alongside isolated margin pairs, including BEL/BTC, LIT/BTC, LSK/BTC, NULS/BTC, and SFP/BTC. One of the top crypto exchanges emphasized that users would no longer be able to update their positions during the delisting process, and failure to act in time could result in potential losses. Despite these changes, the affected tokens will remain tradable in other pairs. This strategic move follows the exchange’s commitment to maintaining high-quality trading markets and optimize the user experience. Price Impact Following Delisting Announcement Axelar’s AXL price was trading at $0.65 and fell by 12% in the last 24 hours. It was trading between a low of $0.64 and a high of $0.74.

Dump DOGE for These 3 Popular Altcoins,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/want-to-make-millions-with-crypto-dump-doge-for-these-3-popular-altcoins,"The crypto market offers immense potential, but not every token is built for long-term success. Dogecoin (DOGE), once the flagship of meme coins, has struggled to evolve beyond its speculative roots. Although DOGE enthusiasts are still rallying around rumors of its potential integration into Elon Musk’s X Payments, traders seeking bigger returns are shifting their focus to three promising altcoins: SUI, PEPE, and DTX Exchange (DTX) . Dogecoin (DOGE): Can X Payments Restore Its Relevance? Dogecoin has reentered the spotlight following a leaked code hinting at its integration into Elon Musk’s X Payments system. The payment feature, tied to X (formerly Twitter), is expected to allow creators to monetize content through direct tips and payments. Source: Tradingview At $0.399, DOGE has risen by 25% in the past week, buoyed by speculation about its future use case within Musk’s growing ecosystem. Musk’s vocal support for DOGE, combined with the potential for broader cryptocurrency adoption via X Payments, has reignited optimism among its holders. However, despite this momentum, DOGE faces stiff competition from newer tokens offering greater scalability and utility. Without clear implementation timelines or regulatory clarity, its long-term prospects remain uncertain. SUI: Rising Layer-1 Star Surges Toward New Highs SUI has solidified its place as one of the best-performing Layer-1 blockchains, reaching a new all-time high of $5.35 this week. With a 20% surge in the past seven days, SUI continues to capture the attention of DeFi enthusiasts and institutional investors. Source: Tradingview Backed by its DeepBook V3 upgrade, the launch of the Sui Bridge, and inclusion in Grayscale’s product suite, SUI’s ecosystem has grown exponentially. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) exploded from $1.75 billion in December 2024 to over $2.6 billion in early 2025, reflecting robust demand for its DeFi offerings. With institutional interest growing and bullish sentiment fueled by pro-crypto U.S. policies under President Trump, analysts believe SUI could continue its upward trajectory, with price targets exceeding $10 in 2025. PEPE Sees Surge as Community Support Grows While many meme coins lose steam, Pepe (PEPE) has maintained its momentum, climbing 11% this week to trade at $0.00002056. After peaking at an all-time high of $0.00002825 in December 2024, PEPE has rebounded from its lows, buoyed by strong community support and social media buzz. Source: Tradingview The token is currently battling resistance at $0.000021, with analysts projecting that a breakout could push PEPE to $0.000025 in the near term. Its rally is fueled in part by speculation around Elon Musk’s recent frog-themed memes, which some interpret as indirect endorsements of PEPE. Despite its speculative nature, PEPE remains one of the most resilient meme coins, attracting traders looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Utility Token With 1,000% ROI Potential Amid the meme coin mania, DTX Exchange stands out for its focus on innovation and real-world applications. With DTX Token priced at $0.14 during its presale and having raised over $11.3 million, the project is gaining traction as a utility-driven contender for 2025. DTX recently achieved a breakthrough with its testnet upgrade, delivering 100,000 transactions per second (TPS); a feat that sets a new standard for blockchain scalability. This performance ensures seamless trading across its hybrid platform, which combines stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex markets under one roof. The platform also enables Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing users to trade tokenized assets like real estate and commodities. Meanwhile, the Phoenix Wallet, downloaded over 50,000 times, offers secure, decentralized asset storage. With its focus on scalability and a growing ecosystem, analysts predict 1,000% ROI potential for DTX Token as adoption accelerates. Why SUI, PEPE, and DTX Could Outshine DOGE DOGE’s recent buzz around its potential integration with X Payments is promising but highlights its reliance on speculative narratives. In contrast, Sui, Pepe, and DTX each offer unique strengths. Sui stands out with its solid Layer-1 infrastructure and fast-growing DeFi ecosystem. Pepe continues to thrive on community-driven momentum, proving its resilience in the meme coin space. Meanwhile, DTX delivers cutting-edge scalability and real-world utility, positioning itself as a transformative force in crypto trading. These qualities make SUI, PEPE, and DTX compelling alternatives for traders seeking massive returns in 2025.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that has transformed the crypto world. Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts—self-executing agreements coded directly into the blockchain. This innovation opened the door to a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps, including finance platforms and games. To boost transaction speed and lower costs, solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon were developed. In 2022, Ethereum made a significant shift to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, becoming more energy-efficient. The upcoming sharding feature aims to make the network even faster and more affordable. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem. It’s used for transactions, rewarding those who help secure the network, and serves as a tradable asset. Based on past trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles, predictions suggest ETH could reach $6,580.53 next year and have a low of $2,700.31 in 2025. Looking ahead to 2030, these forecasts point to potential growth. Compared to other digital coins, Ethereum’s ongoing development and upgrades keep it at the forefront. With its strong foundation and plans for improvement, ETH appears attractive in the current market. As more people embrace blockchain technology, Ethereum’s role could become even more significant. IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is a new kind of technology that lets people and businesses exchange data and value in a safe and direct way. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, IOTA is built on the Tangle, which is like a web of connections. This unique design allows for fast and secure transactions without fees. IOTA also offers tools for creating apps, smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, and digital identities. With the upcoming IOTA 2.0 upgrade in 2024, the platform aims to become fully decentralized. This could make IOTA stand out in the crowded crypto market. Compared to other coins, IOTA’s focus on secure and feeless transactions makes it attractive. In today’s market, where innovation is key, IOTA’s technology shows promise. Its collaboration with Shimmer and support for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts could help it gain more users and developers. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is launching a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum. It aims to create a crypto-native form of money that doesn’t depend on traditional banks. Imagine a digital dollar that’s secure, stable, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Alongside this, Ethena introduces the ‘Internet Bond’, a dollar-denominated savings instrument that’s available globally. This bond offers a new way to save and earn, all within the crypto ecosystem. Ethena’s approach could reshape how we think about digital money. By avoiding reliance on banks, it addresses concerns about centralization and trust. In the current market, where stability is valued, Ethena’s synthetic dollar might attract users seeking a reliable store of value. Compared to other stablecoins that are backed by reserves in banks, Ethena offers a decentralized alternative. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethena’s timing could be just right. Its ‘Internet Bond’ could also provide a compelling option for savers looking for returns without traditional financial intermediaries. POPCAT (POCAT) Meet POPCAT Coin, the latest meme token inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal—one with its mouth closed and another edited to form an ‘O’ shape. This coin has no inherent value or financial expectations; it’s all about fun and entertainment. People are jumping on board for the laughs and the shared internet culture it represents. But is POPCAT Coin attractive in the current market? Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown that internet culture can impact the crypto space. While POPCAT doesn’t bring new technology to the table, its charm lies in its connection to a beloved meme. In a market where trends can shift quickly, and where community engagement matters, POPCAT might catch the eye of meme enthusiasts and crypto fans alike. Whether it becomes the next big thing or just a fleeting trend, POPCAT Coin is certainly adding some feline fun to the crypto world. Conclusion ETH, IOTA, ENA, and POPCAT shine in the 2025 bull run, but XYZVerse (XYZ) pioneers by merging sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth as a community-driven, cultural movement.

With established tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing temporary corrections, investors are flocking to presales for tokens like Doge Uprising and Lightchain AI, which promise high returns and innovative ecosystems. Notably, Lightchain AI has raised over $9.1 million in its presale at a price of $0.004875, positioning itself as a strong contender for the next wave of market growth. Why Presales Uprising Are Attracting Investor Attention Crypto presales like Doge Uprising are gaining momentum as they offer early-stage investment opportunities with significant upside potential. Unlike established tokens, presales allow investors to get in at the ground floor, often at discounted prices. Doge Uprising, for instance, is leveraging the success of meme coins while adding utility-focused features to attract a broader investor base. Presales also provide an opportunity to invest in projects before they are subjected to market volatility. For Doge Uprising, this stability, combined with the viral appeal of meme culture, makes it a compelling option for risk-tolerant investors seeking speculative gains. Lightchain AI Breakthrough in Blockchain Innovation While Doge Uprising captures attention with its meme-driven appeal, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by delivering practical blockchain solutions. A key highlight is its innovative token distribution model, carefully designed to ensure equitable access while supporting the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. This strategic economic framework has drawn interest from investors prioritizing projects that combine market potential with thoughtful planning. Moreover, Lightchain AI is engineered for high scalability and efficiency, capable of managing large transaction volumes and AI tasks seamlessly, making it a versatile solution for various industries. The platform also emphasizes community engagement by fostering collaboration through a global network of developers, driving continuous enhancements to its AI functionality. Why Crypto Presales Are the Smart Play in a Market Dip During market downturns, crypto presales provide a hedge against volatility. Tokens like Lightchain AI and Doge Uprising offer investors the chance to participate in projects that have yet to face market turbulence, allowing for potentially exponential gains. With Lightchain AI’s presale already raising over $9.1 million and attracting significant attention, it’s clear that savvy investors are taking note of these high-potential opportunities. As the market prepares for its next rally, presales like these could prove to be the catalysts for significant wealth creation. For those looking to weather the market dip while positioning themselves for future gains, presale tokens like Lightchain AI and Doge Uprising present an ideal investment strategy. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-chinese-government-announced-that-it-will-use-blockchain-technology-in-this-area-by-2029-here-are-the-details/,"The Chinese government has announced plans to use blockchain technology as the cornerstone of its national data infrastructure, which is targeted to be completed by 2029. China to Integrate Blockchain into National Data Infrastructure by 2029 The initiative is part of the country's broader strategy to establish a unified national data market, according to a policy paper published by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other authorities. Blockchain as a Key Component The policy highlights the role of blockchain in creating a standardized framework for data assets and transaction certificates using encryption technologies and smart contracts to increase traceability and reliability. The move reflects China's ongoing efforts to leverage blockchain for technological advancements, even as the country maintains strict bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining. “Industries and local governments are encouraged to actively experiment with creating new technological infrastructures such as blockchain networks and privacy-preserving computing platforms,” the guide said. Major Investment in Data Infrastructure Zhulin Shen, Deputy Director of the National Data Administration, said projects related to data infrastructure development are expected to attract 400 billion yuan ($54.5 billion) of direct investment annually. The total investment in the initiative is expected to reach 2 trillion yuan ($272.7 billion) in the next five years. The NDRC noted that China’s current data infrastructure is still in its infancy, but the government believes that establishing a robust and reliable data system is essential to support the country’s digital economy and technological leadership. While the use of blockchain in China is limited to permissioned systems and does not cover cryptocurrencies, this policy demonstrates Beijing’s commitment to embracing blockchain for applications such as data management, supply chain efficiency and privacy-enhancing technologies. *This is not investment advice.

Every hour, it spits out trading alpha so spicy, roasts so savage, and takes so unhinged you’d think it was brewed in the heart of crypto X’s darkest corners. Blocked? Banned? Doesn’t matter. It’s already back with a hotter take. Spam? Flood it. The more you throw at it, the smarter and wilder it gets. It’s a Frankenstein creation, with profit-seeking degens as the mad scientists. The community feeds it memes, trash talk, and degenerate wisdom, and in return, it delivers the kind of hype that makes standard meme coin campaigns look like snail mail. iDEGEN has no off switch. There’s no “scheduled post,” no “curated content,” and with over $12.5m raised even before it hits the open market, degens are loving it.

Every livestream, every song, every interaction adds fuel to the Luna fire, driving engagement, and her coin’s value, through the roof. With her upcoming move into new content formats, Luna is set to dominate every platform imaginable, pulling in fans and traders alike. iDEGEN, Fartcoin, Luna by Virtuals: Pick a winner this bull run The future isn’t coming, it’s already here, and it’s anything but predictable.

The reserves are down to a two-year low as the prices are still close to the range for long-term accumulation. Despite the Bitcoin (BTC) downward shift, accumulation continues and the trend of low exchange reserves is deepening. Spot markets took the lead in 2025, with the Coinbase premium showing increased US buying. As a result, the exchange reserves are down to 2.35M BTC, as both older whales and newer buyers prefer to take their coins off the markets. Exchange reserves retain their downward trend, reflecting rising demand from ETFs and institutions. | Source: Cryptoquant While there are enough sellers to depress the price of Bitcoin, there is also a trend for accumulating tokens under full control. The supply crunch underscores the creation of corporate reserves, as well as holdings by central banks and even state entities that have delayed selling their holdings. Miners are also retaining most of their coins, as the current BTC valuations are above production prices. Bitcoin holders are moving assets off exchanges The 2024 bull market, especially in the last months of the year, had the unique feature of lowered exchange reserves during a bull rally. Previously, buyers held BTC on exchanges so they could sell quickly if they needed to. Currently, the available futures markets tap short-term speculation, while spot traders often withdraw their coins. Whales often move coins to Coinbase or Coinbase Institutional, while smaller transfers prefer Robinhood. As a result, the Bitcoin network now carries a peak number of both whale and shrimp wallets after years of campaigning for self-custody. As BTC becomes more valuable, holding a balance on exchanges is seen as the bigger risk due to hacks, exploits, or simply frozen withdrawals or account closures. Self-custodied Bitcoin is also considered less risky compared to stablecoins, which can be frozen or banned from trading. Tether’s wallet is one of the biggest accumulators, using BTC as a reserve. The wallet has been building up its balance, with even more rapid accumulation in Q4, 2024. Tether now holds the sixth-largest BTC treasury in a single wallet, with 83,759 Bitcoins. Other top wallets show almost no pressure to sell. Another portion of BTC is now required for DeFi purposes, including the collaterals for WBTC and CbBTC. Projects like Babylon Labs additionally lock tokens as a source of passive income. Bitcoin DeFi already locks in more than $6.57B in value, while spreading its liquidity to other networks. The trend for BTC outflows partially affects Ethereum (ETH), though the token is not anywhere close to a supply crunch. Relentless Bitcoin buyers cause supply shock While BTC sees some selling, there are always buyers for the physically available coins. As the trend continues, a BTC supply crunch appears imminent. BTC is still in the hands of dedicated holders, while altcoins and tokens satisfy the demand for short-term speculative trading. The recent withdrawals are a mix of institutional demand, retail buying, and a sense of having the last chance to have BTC in a self-custody wallet. The ongoing trend, which has accelerated since 2023, suggests a true supply crunch may be close. Currently, strategic whales still have enough supply to sell and pressure the price downward, but expectations for a 2025 bull market may prevent other holders from taking profits at the current price range. The time horizon for a true supply crunch is within weeks or even months. In early 2025, more than 75% of the BTC supply is considered unavailable for trading. While some of the ETFs sell coins on certain days, their supply is still locked with Coinbase Custody and may not move to other wallets. The freely available BTC and the potential newly minted coins are quickly becoming scarce. BTC is expected to produce around 657K coins in the period before the 2028 reward halving, which is not expected to be sufficient to satisfy the demand for ETF buyers. ETFs alone are the single biggest factor decreasing the freely available supply on exchanges. Since January 2024, ETF buying has taken up more than 480K BTC, leading to constant exchange outflows.

Investors looking to play the expected volatility are moving towards Ripple, Cardano, and Rollblock (RBLK) , the hugely popular GambleFi presale that has recently seen a tremendous uptick in adoption. Analysts are confident that Rollblock could return up to 50x from its current small-cap status in 2025 which has created a bullish sentiment around the project. You might also like: Here are the expected bull market top prices for XRP, Solana and Rollblock Rollblock announces record betting numbers as growth accelerates The Rollblock GambleFi presale has been smashing records across all metrics recently, from surpassing over $8 million in total value locked to a 600% surge in new registrations in December. One of the biggest drivers behind Rollblock’s recent growth is its constant shipping of unique new features, including its hugely popular sports betting league, which recently went live to great acclaim from the Rollblock community. This is in addition to the 7,000 casino classics also available on its comprehensive gambling platform. Rollblock recently recorded over $1.75 million in wagered bets, which represents phenomenal growth and looks set to only increase in January. Rollblock gamers have the tremendous power of being able to verify that all transactions stand unmanipulated, thanks to the immutable power of blockchain technology. Now gamers can verify for themselves that no shady bet fixing has taken place. The entire platform is powered by RBLK, Rollblock’s native Ethereum-based token. This has a hard cap of a billion tokens, which can never be inflated. This is due to a bullish revenue share scheme that reduces the number of coins in circulation by regularly buying back RBLK tokens from the open market using casino profits. 60% of these purchases are immediately burned, with the remaining tokens being used to fund a generous staking rewards program. With growing scarcity and rampant growth on the horizon, analysts are predicting a supply squeeze that could send the price of RBLK flying up to 50x from its current level of $0.0445! Ripple legal woes look set for hasty resolution Ripple stands to benefit enormously from the incoming change of leadership in the White House as a more crypto-friendly SEC will likely end years of legal troubles for Ripple Labs. Long accused of selling illegal securities to American investors, Ripple has seen years of price suppression, which could soon be over. The market has been pricing in this change for some weeks now, leading Ripple to gain more than 450% in the last six months. In the past week alone, Ripple has risen by over 10%, which has taken the Ripple token price up to $2.31. New all-time highs are expected for Ripple during Q1 if this bullish momentum continues. Cardano heads to DC as crypto charter promises bullish 2025 Cardano is also poised for a stunning Trump rally as it has recently emerged that Cardano CEO Charles Hoskinson has been working with the incoming Trump regime on more crypto regulation. Cardano has opened up an office in Washington DC to assist with drawing up a new crypto charter, which will likely be exceptionally bullish for Cardano. Hoskinson also took to X recently to announce that the Midnight privacy sidechain is also nearing completion and that Bitcoin DeFi will be a huge growth area for Cardano during 2025. Cardano has gained 31% this week to reach $1.13. Rollblock will dominate gaming during Trump’s administration Ripple and Cardano stand to benefit greatly from Trump’s presidency, as does Rollblock, which stands at the forefront of bringing a transparent gaming experience to the masses. Rollblock’s market cap will likely swell enormously during the coming months as it races through stage 9 of its presale. Time is short to snap up stage 9 tokens, which are already over 53% sold out and will soon face a further price hike.

Private “Lending is the type of relationship where you value the return of your assets more than the return on your assets.” This was Di Bartolomeo’s answer when I asked him what has set Ledn , a bitcoin and crypto borrowing and lending platform, apart from its competitors, including now defunct companies that offered similar services like BlockFi , Celsius and Voyager . “There's no company in this space that has a better track record of returning your assets than Ledn,” Di Bartolomeo told Bitcoin Magazine. Since its founding, Ledn has prioritized security and reliability. Di Bartolomeo and his co-founder, Adam Reeds, have not only wanted to win the trust of the traditional financial institutions with which Ledn interfaces but that of Ledn’s global user base, some of whom are accessing financial services for the first time thanks to the company. And Di Bartolomeo’s work is quite personal to him in part because he understands the importance of Bitcoin thanks to his firsthand experience with it in his home country of Venezuela. Di Bartolomeo’s Bitcoin Journey “My family found Bitcoin and started mining it in Venezuela in late 2014/early 2015 in the middle of hyperinflation where basically it was illegal for them to buy or hold U.S. dollars or anything that would preserve value,” recounted Di Bartolomeo. “When I saw how they and other Venezuelans were using Bitcoin to opt out of their broken system, I thought to myself “How many people in the world live like this and how many people in the world are going to need this?” And my answer was a number that I couldn’t compute in my head,” he added. Di Bartolomeo decided to begin working in the Bitcoin space soon after. He moved to Canada where he and Reeds began helping miners grow their operations. Di Bartolomeo recalled that these miners wanted to expand but didn’t want to sell their bitcoin to do so. “They had bitcoin revenues and fiat expenses, and there was no real place for them to get any type of financing,” said Di Bartolomeo. “We sought financing, but nobody would give us a loan. So, we decided to solve our own problem,"" he added. ""That was the genesis of Ledn.” How Ledn Differentiated Itself When Ledn was founded in 2018, only a few other services like it existed. However, there was a notable difference between Ledn and its competitors. “There were other bitcoin-backed lenders in the market, but they required tokens,” said Di Bartolomeo. “This was around the ICO era and we saw Nexo and Celsius come into the space with tokens. My view was that they were only using them to raise cash without selling off equity,” he added. Di Bartolomeo and Reeds didn’t want to issue a token, as they saw it as a questionable practice from a regulatory perspective. “When you look at finance at scale, immediately you think about compliance and regulation,” said Di Bartolomeo. “We wanted to build a company that was able to sit in front of BlackRock or Goldman Sachs, heavily regulated banks, and say, ‘Hey, I want to interact with you guys.’” What is more, Ledn also prioritized transparency. In 2021, it became one of the first major Bitcoin companies to issue a proof of reserves , a system that allows anyone to audit Ledn’s bitcoin holdings. “We're still the only lender operating in the U.S. or other highly-regulated markets that has this proof of reserves where every six months our clients can come and check it out,” said Di Bartolomeo. “We've been doing this since before it was cool.” Ledn also publishes a monthly Open Book Report that breaks down Ledn’s lending strategies. From early on, Di Bartolomeo believed that taking a buttoned-up and transparent approach would foster trust amongst Bitcoin enthusiasts, a group that lives by the “ don’t trust, verify ” mantra, and his thesis has played out. Reducing Risks Of the many products Ledn offers , one is yield generation on bitcoin — the same type of product that caused the demise of BlockFi. However, Ledn approaches its version of this product differently than its former competitor did. “We generate Bitcoin yield on bitcoin primarily by lending it to market makers that arbitrage the BlockRock IBIT ETF and units of Coinbase spot,” said Di Bartolomeo. “These groups are price neutral. They don’t have directional exposure. They’re just closing price gaps and benefitting from volatility,” he added. BlockFi’s approach was far riskier. “With BlockFi, there was a duration mismatch,” explained Di Bartolomeo. “They were taking open-term deposits, and they were deploying them into mining infrastructure that had five-year payback. What do you think is going to happen when somebody shows up before the five years are done?” he added, alluding to the notion that what happened to BlockFi seemed inevitable. What is more, Ledn only deals in highly liquid assets like bitcoin (and ether, which they added in 2023), which helps alleviate asset liability mismatch risk. “With bitcoin, you always have people on both sides of the house with demand,” said Di Bartolomeo. “When you start supporting things like Shiba Inu or Dogecoin and people want to earn interest on those, you then have to turn that Dogecoin into something else, and you create asset liability mismatch in the process,” he added. Di Bartolomeo also noted that all of Ledn’s products are ring-fenced from one another. “When you're paying for a custody loan, you are not exposed to the credit risk of our other products,” he said. “This is very similar to how traditional finance works, and it’s something we do very differently as compared to our now defunct peers.” Growing Competition As more people begin to view bitcoin as “ pristine collateral ,” more bitcoin borrowing and lending platforms are destined to pop up. Many already have. Centralized bitcoin borrowing and lending services like Salt and Nexo remain competitors to Ledn, while institutional bitcoin financing services like Newmarket Capital’s Battery Finance are also poised to cut into Ledn’s business. And services that enable users to borrow against their bitcoin in a non-custodial manner, including Debifi and Lava , may also increase their market share. Di Bartolomeo is aware of the competition but doesn’t seem concerned. In fact, he believes that in such a market, the biggest winner will be the consumer, and he doesn’t have any plans to change Ledn’s strategy. Instead, he’s looking to double down on what Ledn does best. “Our sweet spot is going to be individuals or people who prioritize transparency, security of funds and compliance,” said Di Bartolomeo. “Safety, trust and transparency are what makes Ledn stand out. There is no other operator like us in this space with an equivalent track record as far as loans processed, years in the business and cycles survived,” he added. “This industry is volatile. You have to have the right expertise and the right set of values powering your team, and I think other companies would be hard pressed to demonstrate what we have over the time that we have. Will you be able to find something cheaper? Yes. Will that be riskier? Absolutely.” Fostering Financial Inclusion One of the primary ways in which Ledn differs from traditional borrowing and lending platforms is that its rates don’t differ based on the jurisdiction in which the lender or borrower is located. “This makes people feel very empowered because they know that whether they're in Madrid or Medellín, they're getting the same rate,” said Di Bartolomeo. And Di Bartolomeo smiled from ear to ear as he discussed this point, as it seemed to remind him of why he got involved with Bitcoin in the first place. “This is one of the things that makes me proudest about this business,” he said. “We have people back in Latin America who've come to us to say we are the first loan they've ever been approved for. This is because all we look at is ‘Did you complete KYC?’; ‘Are you a compliant citizen?’; ‘Do you have Bitcoin?,’” he added. “It's not ‘Where do you live?’; ‘Who are your parents?’; What’s your skin color?’ I love this aspect of Bitcoin and what we do.”",Business|Borrowing|Lending|Bitcoin|ledn,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-01-08 14:00:11

Announced by Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Chunhavajira, the initiative aims to make digital payments easier and quicker for tourists while boosting the nation’s competitiveness in the tourism sector. Set to operate within Thailand’s existing legal frameworks, the project includes identity verification through local exchanges and a clearing house to convert Bitcoin ( BTC ) into Thai baht for merchants, according to The Nation. Speaking at a seminar organized by the Marketing Association of Thailand, Pichai emphasized the program’s compliance with current regulations, ensuring no legal amendments are necessary. “We won’t do anything that is illegal,” he stated, adding that the trial is expected to capitalize on the growing global adoption and value of cryptocurrencies.

Phuket, in particular, has been a hub for foreign nationals, including those displaced by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to The Nation. Pichai highlighted that using Bitcoin for transactions, such as real estate purchases, could streamline processes for these individuals. Crypto exchange Binance has also started to focus on Thailand as a key market in its global expansion efforts, citing the country’s crypto-friendly regulations. The exchange believes that Thailand’s regulatory openness is a crucial factor in its mission to make crypto mainstream. Despite the growing appeal of cryptocurrency, safety concerns remain. Earlier this week, Thai police pursued two Russian suspects following a violent robbery in Phuket that stemmed from a cryptocurrency-related dispute. The suspects allegedly assaulted and robbed a 31-year-old Russian man of $20,000 over an unresolved crypto debt. Thailand already has a small but active crypto community. In Kalasin’s Huay Phueng district, a self-proclaimed “Bitcoin town” has emerged, with over 80 locals accepting Satoshi payments via the Bitcoin Lightning app. You might also like: Bitcoin could drop under $88k if it fails to hold $95k support: analyst",News|Binance|Bitcoin|Thailand,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-08 14:00:21

ETH balances on exchanges are rising, Ethereum Foundation continues to sell, while American bond yields are surging. So, will the Ethereum price rise to $4,000 or will it crash below $3,000 soon? Ethereum Foundation Sells ETH On-chain data spotted by LookOnChain showed that the Ethereum Foundation continues to dump ETH . It sold 100 ETH on Wednesday, continuing a trend that started in June last year. It has now dumped 4,566 tokens valued at almost $13 million. ETH Foundation Sells Ethereum Insider sales are often seen as being negative since they have more details about a project than external parties like investors. Still, data shows that Ethereum Foundation still holds a substantial amount of ETH in its treasury. According to DeFi Llama , it holds over $900 million of ETH in the treasury, making it fairly bullish. The foundation’s sales come as the number of Ethereum tokens in exchanges has continued rising in the past few weeks. Chainalysis data shows that the change in exchange balances has been in a strong uptrend after bottoming on November 24. An increase in exchange balances is a sign that investors are selling. ETH Balances Exchanges All this is happening as the bond market sends worrying signals in the stock and crypto market. The 30-year yield is closing in on the psychological point at 5%, its highest level in almost two years. Other short-term yields like the 10-year and 5-year have continued rising, a sign that investors anticipate a more hawkish Fed. Ethereum and other coins tend to underperform when yields are soaring. US Bond Yields Are Soaring Ethereum Price Analysis: Triple Top Or Inverse H&S? The three-day Ethereum price chart is sending mixed signals as it forms two diverging patterns. On the positive side, the coin is showing signs of forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. In this case, the head of this pattern is at $2,156, while the shoulders are around the $3,000 mark. The neckline is at the $4,000 level. If the pattern turns into an inverse H&S, there is a likelihood that the Ethereum price will jump to $4,000 , followed by an all-time high of $4,800. This bullish ETH price forecast is supported by the fact that Ether does wel l in the first quarter of the year. Ethereum Price Chart On the other hand, there is a risk that the coin has formed a triple-top chart pattern at around $4,085. This pattern comprises three peaks and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $2,156. As such, even if the ETH price falls to just that level, it signals a 35% crash from the current point.

Meanwhile, Reddit’s Collectible Avatars NFT program also faces uncertainty after the departure of its head, Bianca Wyler. Despite these controversies, NFTs ended 2024 with $8.83 billion in sales, slightly surpassing 2023. Additionally, South Korea's Jeju Island recently announced plans to launch NFT tourist cards in 2025 to attract younger visitors. Eden Gallery Defends Against NFT Lawsuit The Eden Gallery Group filed a motion in a New York federal court seeking the dismissal of a class-action lawsuit that was brought by a group of 36 non-fungible token (NFT) holders. The lawsuit was initiated in October, and accuses the gallery and artist Gal Yosef of fraud, unjust enrichment, and violations of New York’s General Business Law related to the “Meta Eagle Club” NFT collection. The plaintiffs claim the project, which sold 12,000 unique humanlike eagle NFTs and generated $13 million between February of 2022 and November of 2023, was a “rug pull.” They also allege certain misrepresentations were made that led them to overpay for the digital assets. In its motion to dismiss, Eden Gallery argued that the claims are completely baseless, and attributed any losses that were experienced by the plaintiffs to the overall decline of the NFT market rather than fraudulent activity. The gallery also placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that NFTs, including those from the Meta Eagle Club collection, were launched during a period of heightened market popularity in early 2022, but the broader market has since seen a big downturn. It also argued that the NFTs were marketed as digital art products, not investment vehicles, and dismissed the plaintiffs’ losses as a result of broader market forces rather than any wrongdoing on its part. The motion further stated that the plaintiffs’ individual claims for damages, ranging from $1,224 to $70,219, do not meet the jurisdictional threshold of $75,000 that is required for federal court, and aggregation of claims is not allowed. The floor price for a Meta Eagle Club NFT plummeted to 0.0051 ETH, or approximately $17, a huge decline from its launch price of 0.6 ETH, or around $1,800, in February of 2022. Meta Eagle Club floor price (Source: OpenSea ) Future of Reddit NFTs Uncertain The future of Reddit’s Collectible Avatars NFT program also came under scrutiny after the departure of its head, Bianca Wyler. In a LinkedIn post on Jan. 6, Wyler confirmed her exit from Reddit, and stated that she was proud of her work with the program while acknowledging her sadness about the transition. Her departure caused some concerns among Reddit users due to the fact that some recent comments were deleted from her Reddit account, while others worry that her departure means the discontinuation for the NFTs. Part of Bianca Wyler’s exit post (Source: LinedIn ) Reddit Collectible Avatars were launched in July of 2022, and are unique NFTs hosted on the Polygon blockchain, often depicting the platform’s alien mascot. Users can integrate these avatars into their profiles and access perks like “special comment treatment.” They were billed as limited-edition artworks created in collaboration with independent artists, and the program boasts more than 33.5 million holders, according to Dune Analytics data . Despite its initial success, sales of the avatars struggled to maintain momentum, with secondary monthly sales volumes hovering around $100,000 in the final months of 2024. Trading activity also declined quite a bit from its 2022 peak. Wyler, who joined Reddit in June of 2024, pointed out that the program already came down from its earlier bull run and required a thoughtful strategy to revitalize it. Within three months of her tenure, she reported optimizing the program by improving community sentiment, and achieving increases in sales and creations. Wyler described her departure as part of the “natural shifts” that are often seen in companies like Reddit, X, and Meta as they adapt to emerging technologies and shifting priorities. While she is still uncertain about the current trajectory of the Collectible Avatars program, she is confident that Reddit will continue to prioritize its community. NFTs End 2024 with a Bang Despite the controversy surrounding certain projects, NFTs still ended 2024 on a high note by surpassing their 2023 sales by over $100 million. According to data from CryptoSlam , NFT sales reached $8.83 billion in 2024, which was a 1.1% increase compared to the $8.7 billion that was recorded in 2023. Ethereum and Bitcoin were neck and neck in sales volumes, and each contributed $3.1 billion to the total, while Solana followed in third place with $1.4 billion. Ethereum held its position as the leading blockchain for NFTs in all-time sales by amassing $43.3 billion, trailed by Solana with $6.1 billion and Bitcoin-based NFTs with $4.9 billion. Top 5 blockchains by all-time NFT sales (Source: CryptoSlam ) Despite the year-on-year growth, 2024 sales volumes were still much lower than the sector's peaks in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, NFTs reached $15.7 billion in annual sales, which is 43.9% higher than 2024's record, while 2022 saw $23.7 billion in sales. Animoca Brands chairman Yat Siu is still optimistic, and suggested that NFTs could one day surpass those levels as the broader crypto market expands. Siu also predicted that NFT trading volumes could potentially reach billions of dollars monthly in a thriving crypto ecosystem. The latter part of 2024 saw an unexpected resurgence in NFT sales after a challenging seven-month downturn. Sales began to recover in October, which recorded $353 million in volume, an 18% increase from September’s low. The momentum accelerated in November with $562 million in sales, which was a six-month high. December capped the year with $877 million in sales, making it the fifth-highest performing month of 2024. Ethereum-based collections drove most of the December recovery by contributing $482 million to the month’s total. Top 5 NFT collections in December 2024 (Source: CryptoSlam ) Among the top-performing NFT collections, Pudgy Penguins led with $115 million in sales for December. Other popular collections, including Azuki, LilPudgys, CryptoPunks, Doodles, and Bored Ape Yacht Club, collectively generated $141 million in sales. Bitcoin-based NFTs contributed $172 million in December, while Solana-based collections added $100 million. Jeju Island to Launch NFT Tourist Cards in 2025 Jeju Island, South Korea's largest tourist destination, plans to launch NFT tourist cards in the second half of 2025 to attract younger visitors. According to local reports, the main goal of the initiative is to appeal to millennials and Generation Z by offering digital tourism cards linked to NFTs that come with perks like travel subsidies and discounts at tourist spots. A trial phase will precede the full rollout. Jeju is very well known for its hiking trails and resorts, and has a history of embracing blockchain technology.

U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman has ordered early crypto investor Frank Richard Ahlgren III to turn over the private keys to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet and any other relevant digital asset storage devices. Private keys are an encryption system that safeguards crypto wallets, giving the holder full access and control. Judge Pitman’s order also blocked Ahlgren and any of his proxies from moving cryptocurrencies or concealing digital assets from the court. Although Ahlgren can finance his monthly living costs with crypto, the court’s decision is aimed at unlocking approximately $124 million in digital assets attributed to Ahlgren and recovering $1 million in court-approved damages, according to Bloomberg . Ahlgren’s Bitcoin tax fumble Ahlgren’s name has become synonymous with the first U.S. crypto tax evasion case following his formal sentencing in late December. Federal prosecutors issued a seven-charge indictment against the BTC investor, alleging he falsely reported capital gains from a $3.7 million BTC sale and deliberately evaded taxes. According to the Department of Justice, Ahlgren, also known by his alias “Paco,” tried to hide his blockchain footprint using sophisticated financial tactics. While the Bitcoin blockchain is public and immutable, some protocols allow users to obscure their transactions to a degree, the DOJ emphasized in a statement at the time. After a lengthy investigation and months-long trial, a Texas District Court sentenced Ahlgren to two years in prison.

Table of Contents Analyst claims Solana’s price could reach $500 in 2025 Remittix positioned for 2,000% growth in early 2025 Which altcoins will offer the best returns in 2025? Solana’s (SOL) price opened the year with an impressive rally, breaking through the $200 crucial resistance trendline, which was the previous support zone. The recent bullish movement has pushed the altcoin price above the $215 mark, potentially triggering positive predictions. Some analysts tip the price to surpass the $500 mark in Q1. While the Solana coin is tipped to skyrocket in Q1, Remittix (RTX) , a new DeFi coin, is making waves in the market, driven by the cross-border payment feature. Built to redefine the DeFi landscape, Remittix is forecasted to surge as high as 2,000% in the coming weeks. Analyst claims Solana’s price could reach $500 in 2025 Solana has displayed an upward momentum since the start of the year, triggered by the $55 million transfer from Pump.fun to Kraken exchange in the past few days. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Solana’s price soared by 15% in the past week with the SOL market cap hitting $104B. This rising market activity has led to positive Solana price prediction. According to crypto analyst Cloudz , Solana’s price will hit $500 in 2025. Moving forward, IGGY AZALEA, with over 7M followers on X, projects Solana tokens to $1000 this year. Another analyst, The Moon Show, thinks that Solana’s price could hit $330 if it maintains support above $200. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest more bullish movement, with the altcoin price hovering above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs . The Solana market sentiment is bullish, with the 14-day RSI at 57, suggesting the altcoin is not in the overbought zone. With speculations of a potential Solana ETF approval by the US SEC in the year, the altcoin price is likely to set a new price record in the coming weeks. If the Solana crypto is able to flip the next resistance at $218.15, it could surpass the $500 mark in 2025.

In her letter dated December 17, 2024, Favario called the court’s attention to the excessive expenses, noting that it is a norm for bankruptcy professionals. The creditor’s letter follows similar concerns that bankruptcy judge John Dorsey raised during the December 12, 2024, hearing. Dorsey highlighted three questionable expenses in that hearing, including an $8,251 airline ticket, a $134 Uber ride, and a $120 hotel room meal. According to Favario, these expenses are only a few of the extravagant spending by bankruptcy professionals, which contravenes the Department of Justice (DOJ) guidelines for Bankruptcy cases. She wrote: “My independent research suggests that these issues are not isolated but part of a broader pattern of excessive and unnecessary spending that contravenes the DOJ’s “Guidelines for Reviewing Applications for Compensation and Reimbursement of Expenses.” Favario also highlighted several instances of excessive spending by bankruptcy managers, including employees of legal counsel Sullivan & Cromwell and bankruptcy expert Alvarez & Marsal. The CEO of the bankrupt exchange, John Ray III, was also accused. Her letter included examples of how these professionals stayed in the 5-star Hotel Du Pont in Delaware and lodged at the luxury Grand Hyatt in Nassau, Bahamas, all on FTX money instead of using more affordable accommodation. An unnamed Alvarez & Marsal employee also spent $971.74 to stay in a New York hotel for one night. Meanwhile, the extravagant spending was not just on accommodation and meals. The professionals also spent exorbitant amounts on taxi rides and transportation, with bankruptcy managers using business class for most of their train travels and some of their flights. Kumanan Ramathan, an employee of Alvarez & Marsal, allegedly spent $1,733 on taxis in just one week in November 2022, while the FTX bankruptcy estate also paid $2,683.14 for three taxi rides on December 12, 2023. Favario asks the court to expand the expense review With the creditor identifying several extravagant expenses and providing evidence to support them, she has now asked the court to expand the scope of the expenses review. She noted that the professionals’ spending shows that they have no regard for FTX funds, which belong to creditors who have suffered devastating losses due to the fraud. According to Favario, increased scrutiny of the bankruptcy experts’ spending is important to ensure fairness in the case and that the FTX administrators comply with the DOJ guidelines. The letter has attracted several comments from FTX creditors, many of whom have been highly critical of how the FTX administrators have handled the bankruptcy process. So far, the process has taken over two years, and over $300 million has already been spent as of September 2023. The magnitude of expenses in the proceeding has attracted criticism from various quarters, including five bankruptcy law professors who filed an amicus brief in the Sam Bankman-Fried appeal in 2024. In the amicus brief, they noted that close cooperation between the bankruptcy lawyers and Government prosecutors cost FTX investors and creditors more money while allowing Sullivan & Cromwell to bill tens of millions of dollars.

From scalability-focused technologies to established ecosystems driving innovation, a few key projects are shaping up to be the top altcoins to buy in 2025. BlockDAG, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Coin (BNB), and Ethereum are leading the charge with exciting updates and promising potential. Whether you're interested in groundbreaking tech or proven market leaders, these altcoins bring a mix of reliability and growth potential that makes them worth exploring this year. BlockDAG: Redefining Speed and Scalability BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining significant traction thanks to its innovative blend of blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. This combination enables faster and more scalable transactions compared to traditional blockchain platforms. BlockDAG's presale has already raised over $176.5 million, demonstrating strong interest from early participants. The presale ROI has soared to 2,380%, with the coin currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch. What sets BlockDAG apart is its dual compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM). This feature allows developers to migrate decentralized applications (dApps) seamlessly, opening doors to innovations in gaming, artificial intelligence, and decentralized finance (DeFi). With a successful testnet under its belt, BlockDAG is gearing up for its mainnet launch in 2025, which could further drive adoption and value. The project’s plans to debut on multiple exchanges after the presale conclude make it a strong contender for those looking at the top altcoins to buy in 2025. Avalanche: Speed and Efficiency for the Win Avalanche (AVAX) continues to strengthen its position as a leading player in the crypto space. The platform’s Avalanche9000 upgrade, launched in late 2024, has significantly reduced deployment costs and C-Chain fees, making it more accessible for developers and users. This upgrade has been a game-changer in terms of scalability and cost efficiency, which are critical factors for DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Additionally, Avalanche recently raised $250 million in a funding round, further solidifying its reputation as a project with long-term potential. This capital will likely fuel further development, attracting more developers and projects to the platform. With these updates and its commitment to improving transaction speeds and eco-friendliness, Avalanche is undoubtedly a strong pick among the top altcoins to buy in 2025. Solana: A Developer's Favorite Solana (SOL) has been making headlines for becoming the preferred choice for new blockchain developers, surpassing Ethereum for the first time. This growth in its developer ecosystem reflects the platform's efficiency and appeal for building decentralized applications. Solana’s high transaction speed and low fees make it an attractive choice for projects ranging from DeFi to gaming and NFTs. While network outages in the past raised concerns, the team has taken proactive measures to improve stability, implementing a six-point plan to enhance the update process. Solana’s growing ecosystem and recent advancements in network reliability make it one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025, especially for those who believe in the potential of high-speed blockchain solutions. Binance Coin (BNB): A Market Staple Binance Coin (BNB) continues to hold a prominent position in the cryptocurrency world, thanks to its extensive use cases within the Binance ecosystem. Whether it’s trading fee discounts, participation in token launches, or powering the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB remains integral to the crypto ecosystem. The coin’s deflationary mechanism, driven by regular coin burns, ensures a decreasing supply, which could contribute to its long-term value. Binance’s ongoing efforts to expand its ecosystem and the coin’s established utility make it a reliable option among the top altcoins to buy in 2025. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) is showing strong market activity as it trades around $3,623.45, with a 0.68% uptick over the previous close. The crypto saw intraday fluctuations between $3,599.14 and $3,693.79, reflecting ongoing investor interest. Notably, December 2024 marked a milestone for U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with record net inflows of $2.08 billion, showcasing its growing institutional adoption. Analysts remain optimistic, projecting Ethereum's price could reach $4,000 in early 2025. In December, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated $170,000 in ETH to support the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers, emphasizing the network's role in fostering community values. Meanwhile, the ""Dencun"" upgrade, implemented in March 2024, continues to boost scalability and reduce Layer 2 transaction costs, enhancing Ethereum's appeal to developers and users alike. The Final Take As 2025 unfolds, BlockDAG, Avalanche, Solana, Binance Coin, and Ethereum stand out as promising picks for the year. Each of these projects offers unique features and ongoing developments that position them well in a competitive market. Whether you're drawn to BlockDAG’s scalability, Avalanche’s efficiency, Solana’s developer-friendly environment, Binance Coin’s broad utility, or Ethereum’s foundational role in blockchain innovation, these coins represent some of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. With careful research and a strategic approach, these altcoins could play a pivotal role in a well-rounded crypto portfolio.

The total number of wallet addresses now sits at 1,889,804, with daily transactions averaging 4.7 million. This milestone shows how far Shibarium has come since its launch, demonstrating its technical capabilities and strong community adoption. Developer Kaal Dhairya celebrated the achievement: “Shibarium just fetched 500 million transactions—proof of pack is unstoppable. Here’s to more tail-wagging milestones ahead.” The Shiba Inu community is clearly excited as the network continues to expand. The Token Asset Repository Update Shiba Inu marketing lead Lucie took it to her X account to announce a new update on the Shibarium: The Shibarium Token Asset Repository is se t to redefine the Shiba Inu ecosystem moving forward into the future. With this update, token holders have the ability to share photos and relevant data across Ethereum, Sepolia, Shibarium, and Puppynet networks, hence simplifying the presentation of token data. Each network now has its folder for token images, simplifying updates and enhancing visibility. This update could have a big impact on the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Centralizing token management provides a streamlined way for tokens to gain exposure. As Shiba Inu grows, this feature positions Shibarium as a key tool for future development. Shiba Inu Community Reaction The Shiba Inu community has been buzzing with excitement since the update dropped. Lucie, a member of the Shiba Inu team, shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), sparking discussions and celebration. On the market side, Shiba Inu saw a massive 50% surge in price, briefly pushing its market cap back above $13 billion. While the price has dipped slightly since then, SHIB remains up 2.7% on the week, showing resilience in a volatile market. With the new Token Asset Repository live and Shibarium hitting 700 million transactions, Shiba Inu is clearly gaining momentum. This update adds another layer of utility to the ecosystem, which could help drive further adoption and growth.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-08 15:24:59

In a new video, Cowen tells his 855,000 YouTube subscribers that the QQQ ETF hit a local top after going up by 150% in roughly one year following the launch of the ETF. The QQQ ETF tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. As the flagship digital asset approaches the first anniversary since the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF, Cowen says the crypto king could replicate similar price action, though it’s unlikely to “play out the exact same way.” “In 1999 the QQQ ETF launched in March and it rallied from around $48 to $120. And that Rally from $48 to $120 took about 54 weeks – $48 to $120… …if you look at Bitcoin’s ETF, it launched at around $48,000… if you look at the launch of the spot ETF for Bitcoin it wicked up to $48,000 instead of down to it like it did with the QQQ [ETF]. But interestingly enough, 54 weeks later is January 20th – Inauguration Day [of President-elect Donald Trump], which is interesting because 54 weeks after this launch of the QQQ, it was 54 weeks later the QQQ went from like $48 to $120. Now look at this, if you go to Bitcoin on the daily time frame and you connect these highs here [$99,600, $104,100 and $108,200] and you just extend that out what’s fascinating is if you grab the sort of a price label and you go over to January 20th and go up to this trend line it would put you at $120,000 which is exactly what the QQQ did – it went from $48 to $120, 54 weeks later.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen says that if Bitcoin’s price action closely follows that of the QQQ ETF in the first 13 months of its existence, a 48% drop is a possibility. “Obviously this is very dubious and obviously, we know that QQQ got a large drop after that… …what I would be interested in is if Bitcoin finds itself at $120,000 at some point in a few weeks, what is the reaction there? And one potential outcome… basically what happened with the QQQ is after it hit $120, it had a large drop down to $63, which is a pretty big drop.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $101,484 at time of writing. ?

According to Grewal, the FDIC abused FOIA exemption 8 in an attempt to hide court-compelled info. Table of Contents Why did the FDIC redact disclose documents? The “pause letters” recap Is Operation Choke Point 2.0 real? Coinbase sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to enforce the Freedom of Information Act. Initially, the request was denied by the FDIC. According to Grewal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation failed to provide all the court-compelled documents timely and added more documents only after additional legal pressure. More than that, the FDIC used FOIA exemption 8 to heavily redact the revealed documents (so-called “pause letters” to financial institutions) without lawfully justified reason. Exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information Act is set to protect the matters “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.” Why did the FDIC redact disclose documents? An excuse to hide certain details in the disclosed documents was that the reveal of this info would have caused “reasonably foreseeable harm” to the recipients of these letters. Allegedly, the names of the institutions, the specific operations, and other details, if made public, will damage the relations between the banks in question and the regulator (i.e., the FDIC). Interestingly enough, the letters weren’t even confidential until September 2022, when the FDIC began to add notifications that banks should keep the letters secret. Tl; dr: FDIC lied. I don't say that lightly. But the redactions clearly weren’t about protecting confidential supervisory information. They were about covering up evidence that they tried to kill BTC transactions, the development of blockchain tech, and even a bank account for… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 6, 2025 Some of the information initially redacted became available on January 4. Grewal claims that the newly revealed data doesn’t harm the recipients of the pause letters and that the FDIC made up the excuse to cover up an ongoing Operation Choke Point 2.0, a colloquial name of the series of efforts by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and other institutions to block services for clients performing transactions associated with cryptocurrencies, religious groups, clients associated with African countries, and other law-abiding customer groups. Senator and former prosecutor John E. Deaton expressed support for the efforts in stopping Operation Choke Point 2.0 and stated he is eager to lead an investigation against the officials involved for free. As a former prosecutor and Special Assistant United States Attorney I am very serious about volunteering to help lead a federal investigation into ChokePoint 2.0. I would accept the task without salary. The American people deserve the truth a hell of a lot more than I or anyone… https://t.co/LFdhpCixnr — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 4, 2025 In the X post, Deaton stresses the prominence of the Choke Point 2.0 in the ongoing case against Ripple. He warns that the precedent of “unelected bureaucrats… arbitrarily denying access to essential financial infrastructure” goes far beyond the cryptocurrency sector. The “pause letters” recap The letters sent by the FDIC to financial institutions were aimed at stopping banks from providing services to clients associated with cryptocurrency activity. The letters noted that the services may not be provided until the advice from the regulator, but it’s not known if this advice has ever been provided. In most cases, clients were left without consistent explanations over the reasons for the service cease. At several instances, banks admitted that they blocked accounts due to “unexpected activity” or things like this. The 25 disclosed letters were sent between 2022 and 2023. The types of activity that financial institutions were urged to stop for an indefinite amount of time included the following: Bitcoin-backed lending operations NFTs and cryptocurrency storage by the banks Onboarding of the decentralized “ecosystems” Products that allow clients to buy or sell cryptocurrencies Private and public blockchain settlement networks Issuance of permissioned stablecoins Stablecoins depositories Issuing debit cards that support Bitcoin cash back Other known cases include the blocking accounts of cryptocurrency hedge funds.

Is Operation Choke Point 2.0 real? There are several accounts of cases where banks were stopping to provide services to clients associated with cryptocurrency. If this is not enough to confirm the existence of the operation, we can add the FDIC’s letters. Although they don’t necessarily urge banks to completely close clients’ accounts, they created problems by indefinite account blocks, creating uncertainty for U.S. entrepreneurs in the crypto sector. If one doubts that Operation Choke Point 2.0 is real, we may state that the FDIC’s recommendations of termless closures of the bank accounts of companies that don’t violate the law are real. The activists writing about Operation Choke Point 2.0 claim the FDIC is engaging in the covert disinformation campaign started against them.

Solana meme ai16z price has joined other tokens in having double-digit losses this week. It has formed a risky chart pattern that points to a downside, potentially $1. Ai16z Price Analysis As A Risky Pattern Emerges The ai16z price has become one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past few months as investors rotated to AI agent and Solana meme coins. It soared by over 13,000% from its lowest point in November and its highest point this year. The 4H chart suggests that the token may have more downside in the near term as it gets towards the markdown phase. It has formed what resembles a double-top chart pattern at $2.36, a popular bearish reversal sign whose neckline is at $1.7198. The ai16z coin has also moved below the 50-period moving average and is slowly nearing the neckline. Therefore, a drop below the neckline at $1.7198 will validate the double-top pattern and point to more downside. Such a price action will lead to a more downtrend, potentially to the psychological point at $1, about 45% below the present level. This price is notable because it also coincides with the highest point on December 13. The bearish outlook will become invalid if the token rises above the double-top point around the $2.40 level. Such a move will mean more buyers in the market may want to push it to the psychological level at $2. ai12z Price Chart Wyckoff Method Explains The Solana Meme AI16Z Crash The ai16z price has crashed because of the ongoing sell-off in the crypto industry that has affected meme coins substantially. CoinGecko data shows that most Solana meme coins have plunged by double-digits in the last 24 hours. That crash has dropped their combined market cap from over $21 billion last weekend to $18.6 billion. Solana Meme Coins Pengu Penguins, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin, Popcat, and Gigachad have all plunged by over 10% in this period. Bitcoin has also plunged below $95,000, leading to more sell-offs among smaller tokens. The concept of the Wyckoff Method also explains why the ai16z price has crashed. This approach explains how assets move from an accumulation phase with little price movement, followed by markup, distribution, and markdown. The daily chart below shows these stages on the ai16z token. It remained in an accumulation in November, then the markup started in December. The recent movement could be part of the distribution and will be followed by the markdown.

In a packed X post, the Hyper Foundation, an organization dedicated to growing Hyperliquid’s ecosystem, debunked allegations surrounding its 16 blockchain validators. Most of the claims alleged that entities bought their way into the project. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) launched in November 2024 as a decentralized perpetual futures exchange on its own layer-1 network. Responding to the allegations, the Hyper Foundation emphasized that validator selection was based on a merit-driven process. The organization also noted that the number of validators would naturally grow as the ecosystem expands. There is no way to buy a seat at the table, and claims otherwise undermine the efforts of the validators who dedicated time and effort to understanding the system.

Addressing these criticisms, the Hyper Foundation acknowledged the advantages of open-sourcing but defended its approach, citing the scale and speed of its development. The foundation compared its model to established blockchains like Solana, which also use single-client architecture. Yes, the node code is currently a closed source. Open sourcing is important. Projects open source once development is in a stable state. Hyperliquid ships at orders of magnitude faster than most projects. The scope is orders of magnitude larger than most projects as well. Code will be open source when it’s secure to do so. Hyperliquid debuted with a massive token airdrop last November. The perp DEX airdropped 310 million tokens, 31% of the total HYPE supply, to early participants. The project also launched HYPE staking, locking $8.4 billion worth of its cryptocurrency to secure the L1 chain and bootstrap developer activity.

Speaking to Business Insider, Fairlead Strategies analyst Katie Stockton said Bitcoin could fall to as low as $84,500 in the face of overbought conditions. Stockton said Bitcoin is giving “overbought” signals during its recent rally, and therefore there is a risk of a double-digit decline. Stating that the decline in Bitcoin could continue to $84,500, the analyst added that the price could fall even further if there are harsher sales. Adding that Bitcoin could find secondary support at $73,800, the expert said that if the sales are harsher than expected, the decline could drop to 25 percent. “We expect Bitcoin to recover from the drop. However, we expect the pace of recovery to slow and reach a lower peak than the December peak. “There is an active overbought decline in the weekly dynamics and new overbought signals in the daily dynamics, so we think the upside will be limited in the near term.” Stockton said he expects a limited upside in the near term but remains optimistic about a longer-term rally. *This is not investment advice.

The latest XRP news reveals that Bank of America uses the Ripple token for 100% of internal transactions. Let’s discuss how true these claims are and how they will impact the XRP price. David Stryzewski Claims Bank of America Uses XRP In a recent FOX Business interview, the Sound Planning Group CEO, David Stryzewski, revealed that Bank of America has integrated XRP for 100% of their internal transaction. His XRP news disclosed that the bank had also filed 83 patents around Ripple, putting its native token ahead to become the fundamental component of finances in the future. Notably, there is no conclusive evidence behind these claims. However, there is some documented evidence that hints at the collaboration between the banking institution and the blockchain payment network. Stryzewski also presented his bullish views on the Ripple token. He concludes that XRP is progressive despite the regulatory constraints, and the RLUSD stablecoin success would strengthen its position in the payment sector. “XRP is going to be the track that everything runs on in the future” JUST IN: Fox Business Discussing Ripple & $XRP Connection To Bank of America! “Ripple is going to be the track that everything is running on in the future” “Bank of America, like I said, was doing 100% of their internal transactions.

Many see Bank of America’s adoption as expanding the adoption scope throughout the USA. Ripple Tokens Eyes Global Adoption in Payments Ripple launched its RLUSD stablecoin to gain global adoption and acceptance. Interestingly, the blockchain payment network also contributed to the 2024 elections, donating millions to Trump’s inauguration . Ripple CEO Brad Garlingouse revealed that these donations are for the development of the crypto industry and to witness crypto regulations. That involvement brought the Ripple CEO to meet Donald Trump . This is another remarkable moment, presenting a bullish outlook for the Ripple token. Analysts see this meetup and Bank of America’s XRP news as influential factors helping the digital payment network in regulatory issues and global adoption, eventually bringing a long-term XRP price uptrend. Will XRP Price Hit $4 With This XRP News? Despite today’s downtrend, the long-term price trajectory hints at XRP’s bullish performance in the near future. Considering its last two months’ bullish performance and recent surge to a seven-year high, analysts predict a major price rally for the Ripple token at the end of January. Currently, the XRP price is $2.32 per CoinmarketCap data , but experts see a long-term target of $3.50-$4 in early February. Regularity clarity, RLUSD adoption, and other significant factors will play a role in this milestone. What’s In There For You? David Stryzewski’s unproven claims reveal the XRP is poised for global adoption, not only in the US. Many financial institutions are eyeing this blockchain technology for possible integration, which could push the Ripple token to become a global payment infrastructure. The launch of the RLUSD will also play a significant role in that.

The foundation, which oversees the Hypeliquid perpetuals trading platform and its associated Layer 1 blockchain, reaffirmed that all network validators are selected based on their performance during the testnet phase. It explicitly dismissed claims suggesting that participants could “buy a seat at the table,” ensuring that the selection process remains merit-based. Hyperliquid further noted its plans to gradually expand the validator set to improve decentralization and increase the network’s security. Hyperliquid’s validators qualification and expansion plan To encourage high standards among validators, the foundation shared its Delegation Program, which supports and incentivizes exceptional participants. This initiative aligns with Hyperliquid’s goals of fostering decentralization while rewarding validators who demonstrate excellence in their roles. Moreover, concerns about centralization around API servers were also addressed. Hyperliquid clarified that anyone can operate an API server pointing to any node within the network. While example client code may suggest reliance on a single server, the network’s design ensures flexible accessibility, reducing the risk of bottlenecks and centralization. Hyperliquid also responded to reports of users attempting to create a black market for testnet HYPE tokens. The foundation condemned such activities and pledged to improve the onboarding process for testnet participants to prevent misuse. Another issue raised was the closed-source nature of Hyperliquid’s node code. The foundation acknowledged the importance of open sourcing and explained that the decision to delay stemmed from the rapid development pace and the project’s broad scope. It assured the community that the code would be made publicly available once it reached a stable and secure state. Additionally, Hyperliquid addressed concerns about its single-binary system for running validators. While some viewed this as a limitation, the foundation pointed out that such an approach is common even among mature networks like Solana, where the majority of validators use a single client. HYPE token performance metrics Hyperliquid launched its HYPE token in November 2024 through a token generation event and a community airdrop. It distributed 31% of the total supply, equivalent to 310 million tokens, to early supporters and active users. The token experienced a significant surge in value following its airdrop, reaching an all-time high of $35.73 on December 21, 2024. HYPE delivered exceptional performance in December, with a return of 234%. However, it has since dropped by 40%, with its current trading price around $21, per recent updates . HYPE price chart (1-hour) | TradingView At press time, it has a market cap of approximately $7.1 billion and a fully diluted valuation of over $21 billion. The circulating supply stands at 333 million tokens. In a January 6 report , asset manager VanEck highlighted Hyperliquid’s remarkable growth within the perpetual DEX ecosystem. Over the past year, Hyperliquid has expanded its market share from 10% to an impressive 70%, solidifying its dominance in the sector. “Hyperliquid is successful because it created a better product, harnessed itself to a strong distribution mechanism, and cultivated a loyal community,” VanEck noted. During December alone, Hyperliquid’s exchange facilitated $160 billion in perpetual futures trading volume, generating $47 million in revenue from these trades. Additionally, the platform’s decentralized exchange (DEX), which operates exclusively for native assets on the HYPE network, contributed approximately $1.7 million in spot trading fees over the same period.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped sharply on Tuesday as U.S. bond yields surged to their highest levels in over two years following stronger-than-expected job vacancy data. The bond market sell-off continued on Wednesday, pushing 30-year and 10-year yields to 4.95% and 4.70%, respectively. Rising yields suggest the market expects the Federal Reserve to maintain its hawkish stance throughout the year.

Petr Kozyakov, CEO of Mercuryo, commented in a note sent to crypto.news on Jan. 8: “Markets are no longer euphoric over bitcoin entering a new age where even the US Central Bank will hold a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Instead, Bitcoin’s role as an ultra risk-on, risk off asset has surfaced once again amid signs that the US Federal Reserve may keep interest rates elevated for longer than previously expected.” Some analysts believe bond yields could continue climbing as inflationary pressures persist due to policies under Donald Trump’s administration, including deportations, tariffs, and tax cuts. In a recent note, Mark Zandi , the Chief Economist at Moody’s warned that higher yields may affect the stock and crypto market. Legendary trader Peter Brandt remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s longer-term outlook despite acknowledging the potential for near-term volatility due to bond market concerns. Brandt also noted that Bitcoin appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, which could signal further fluctuations. Charts morph all the time.

The chart shows a cup-and-handle pattern, a classic bullish continuation formation. Bitcoin broke out of the handle section in November, reaching a record high of $108,200 in December. Currently, Bitcoin is forming a bullish pennant pattern just below the key resistance level of $100,000. Such consolidations near major psychological levels are common before major upward moves. The pennant consists of a long vertical line followed by a triangle pattern, indicating the potential for a breakout. Bitcoin also remains above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the next few weeks. A strong breakout could occur in the coming weeks, possibly ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. If this breakout materializes, the key target level to watch will be $122,000. This estimate is based on measuring the depth of the cup and projecting it upward from the breakout point.

Following such developments, 2025 appears like another strong year for the company and for the separate XRP token , as the wider digital assets sector is set to enjoy an amicably disposed U.S., and the broader bull market is expected to persist. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Why XRP might rally in January XRP, in particular, is expected to continue its rocketing as Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC might conclude near the same time as Trump’s January 20 inauguration. This event could prove a major external cryptocurrency catalyst. The Republican re-entering the White House could, in particular, spark a strong rally given the growing association between Ripple and its leadership and the President-Elect as, for example, CEO Brad Garlinghouse of CLO Stuart Alderoty recently had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty . Strong start to 2025! pic.twitter.com/UjM6lahUG4 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 8, 2025 Furthermore, Ripple President Monica Long announced near the same time she expects the company’s stablecoin RLUSD will be on more platforms ‘imminently’ and that a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) is likely ‘next in line.’ Finally, the token will likely receive additional, internal positive developments. On January 7, Ripple announced a partnership with Chainlink, thus obtaining blockchain oracle services for the RLUSD stablecoin to bolster the security and utility of the cryptocurrency. How high can XRP rise on January 20? Though there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market – as evidenced by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) exceptionally choppy trading in recent weeks despite widespread optimism – technical analysis and historical precedent offer some bullish insights into how high XRP could go around January 20, 2025. For example, should the token react to Trump’s inauguration – and the hopes it will bring to the industry – similarly to the post-election rally, XRP could rocket 401.85% from its press time price of $2.33 and climb all the way to $11.69. Recent technical analysis ( TA ) appears to back such optimism. The legendary Peter Brandt, for example, shared on January 7 that the token might be forming a ‘half-mast flag’ bullish technical pattern, which, provided it ‘rock and rolls’ quickly enough, could signal a market capitalization surge from the press time valuation of $133 billion to $500 billion. Earlier analyses have been just as if not even more bullish with, for example, on-chain expert Ali Martinez opined already in late 2024 that, despite being an ambitious target for the token, $48 is not out of reach in 2025. Why an XRP rally might not be in the cards Despite the strong, bullish factors, XRP might not be headed for an imminent rally. Indeed, while many notable analysts have described the token’s performance in recent weeks as a consolidation phase, it has been trading in a relatively wide range, and unless there is a decisive breakout above the resistance level at $2.49, it may face a drop toward its support zone near $2.12. $XRP (per request) Faked out the top of the channel so I'm assuming this drops back to the $2.00 support area now that it's back inside. pic.twitter.com/CxzcM8cHb0 — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) January 7, 2025 A prominent trader known as Dom on X even went as far as to claim that XRP might have already fallen further toward $2 had it not been for positive announcements in the last 24 hours or so, noting that the pattern of bullish tweets breaking a plunge has become so commonplace, it is now ‘incredibly amusing.’ $XRP VWAP bands still holding It's incredibly amusing when we see positive ""news"" come out during a dump SOLELY to keep XRP higher I have seen this play so many times, it's truly something If Brad didn't post that Trump pic last night, pretty sure we'd already be at $2.20 pic.twitter.com/AktE2uY1gb — Dom (@traderview2) January 8, 2025 XRP price chart Whatever the future may bring, XRP’s performance in recent months is nothing short of remarkable. Indeed, despite struggling under the weight of the SEC lawsuit for years, the token broke out in late 2024 ensuring it is 310.92% in the green in the last 12 months. XRP 12-month price chart. Source: Finbold Still, it is worth pointing out that despite the bullishness and the hoped-for external tailwinds, XRP found some stability in the range between $2 and $2.50. Though such performance has been partially positive as it secured the November gains, it has also, at best, postponed a further rally. Indeed, despite the overall strength, the last 30 days of trading brought a slight 4.70% decline to XRP’s price today of $2.33.

PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a tribute to the internet meme Pepe the Frog, created by Matt Furie. The cryptocurrency aims to build on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE sets itself apart with a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching up to $1.6 billion. This rapid growth attracted a strong community of enthusiasts and sparked interest in other memecoins. The PEPE roadmap outlines plans for listings on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” The coin’s rise reflects the influence of meme culture in the cryptocurrency market and showcases the community’s enthusiasm for new memecoin projects. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. Meme coins often originate from internet culture or pop references, and dog-themed tokens have become notable in the cryptocurrency world. WIF aims to build a community centered around fun and shared interest in the meme. The Solana blockchain provides high-speed transactions and low fees, which may benefit WIF in terms of scalability and user adoption. As a meme coin, WIF leverages social media trends and community engagement to gain attention. In the current market cycle, the coin’s potential is tied to its ability to maintain interest and participation within the crypto community. The appeal of WIF depends on factors like market sentiment toward meme coins and the overall dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. POPCAT (POCAT) The POPCAT token is a cryptocurrency inspired by the Popcat Internet meme that gained popularity in October 2020. The meme features images of a cat named ‘Oatmeal’, with one image showing its mouth closed and another edited to show an open ‘O’ shaped mouth. The token is designed as a meme coin and is intended solely for entertainment purposes, with no inherent value or financial expectations attached. As a meme coin, the POPCAT token leverages the viral nature of Internet memes to gain attention and participation from the online community. The technology behind meme coins typically relies on existing blockchain platforms, but they often lack unique technological innovations. In the current market cycle, the attractiveness of the POPCAT token depends on the interest and engagement of the community rather than underlying fundamentals. Investors considering meme coins like POPCAT should be aware that they are primarily for entertainment and not traditional investments. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 is a meme token that emerged from internet culture. It aims to surpass the S&P 500 index by achieving a market capitalization of $69 trillion. The token’s concept is based on the idea that the number 6900 is greater than 500, implying that SPX6900 is superior to traditional financial instruments. The token embraces a whimsical approach to investment, promoting the belief that larger numbers equate to better value. Its potential relies on community support and the viral nature of meme-based assets. In the current market cycle, the attractiveness of SPX6900 depends on investor sentiment toward meme tokens and the broader cryptocurrency environment. Conclusion PEPE, WIF, POPCAT, and SPX show potential, but XYZVerse (XYZ) offers early adopters 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in a community-driven all-sport memecoin.

Total Bitcoin ETF assets under management have grown from approximately $30bn to over $105bn in the last 12 months. As more individuals, institutions and governments adopt Bitcoin as a store of value, and as network supply decreases. Price per Bitcoin could reach prices over $200,000 before year-end 2025. It has been nearly a year since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs for trading. Since then, over $100bn of funds have flowed into these ETFs and with the inflows, the ETFs have amassed over 1.1 million in total bitcoin. Grayscale’s newest bitcoin ETF ( BTC ) continues to capture market share due to its lower expense ratio of 0.15% compared to its predecessor, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which continues to have a 1.5% expense ratio. I continue to see The BTC ETF to grow into the top 5 largest Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management within the next 18 months, meaning it would have to triple or quadruple its current bitcoin holdings of just over 39,000. Grayscale has an advantage as it charges 0.05% less than most of its competition. Most Bitcoin ETFs charge an expense ratio of 0.20 to 0.25%, which ends up being the equivalent of $50 to $100 in additional expense per bitcoin equivalent in holdings per annum. Full disclosure, I have been an owner of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since 2020, and since this time, they have spun out the BTC (mini trust) ETF and since then, any additional top-ups I want to make in Bitcoin have been through this ETF rather than the Original Grayscale spot ETF. I remain steadfast in my belief that Bitcoin is a great alternative ETF for individual, institutional or companies to hold now and into the next decade as normal government backed currencies will continue to experience large amounts of inflation and lose trust. About the ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust is a Bitcoin spot ETFs that holds Bitcoin as its only underlying asset and thus trade in tandem with the price of Bitcoin, which at the time of writing is approximately $96,000. This is important to note as there are other ETFs that are Bitcoin-linked which may trade Futures Contracts or leveraged derivatives and for those seeking strictly Bitcoin Spot ETFs, I do not want you to get impacted by choosing the wrong ETF. Always read a prospectus and understand holdings and ETF objectives prior to investing. Following up on my previous article In my previous article , I wrote about the foundations of what the new Grayscale Bitcoin ETF was about and provided a $120,000 to $200,000 per bitcoin target by mid-2025. Now that we’ve seen prices grow up to $110,000 in the last 30 days, I am upping the lower end of my price range from $120,000 to $135,000. Also in that August 2024 article I wrote that after the peak in mid-2025, Bitcoin prices would retrace to the levels observed then, which was $58,000. With institutional, corporate and individual level buying coupled with the potential of government buying, I find it hard to believe the price would fall over 50% from its peak like we have observed in the past. Demand has increased, and daily mining supply has decreased, making a retracement less and less likely. How has the AUM of Bitcoin ETFs Grown At their inception in January 2024, bitcoin ETFs started with an approximate 600,000 bitcoin under management at Grayscale worth approximately $30bn. Since then, iShares/BlackRock has continued to dominate and has grown into the largest player with over 550,000 bitcoin - equaling approximately 50% of the market share, and altogether, the top 11 ETFs hold approximately 1.1 million bitcoin under management. Since late December we have seen a slight plateau as the price of bitcoin has retraced from $110,000 to $92,500 and has since started a small push back to $96,000. That said, now that bitcoin is an easier than ever product able to be invested in, comparable to an S&P500 ETF, I anticipate we will continue to see inflows on a monthly basis as more and more individual, institutional and companies hold bitcoin in their portfolios and contribute to them on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Bitcoin ETF AUM over time (The Block Co) That is what has led to the 80% growth of bitcoin under management and the total value of these Bitcoin ETFs to grow from $30bn to the approximate $105bn they are today. The Grayscale Bitcoin mini trust has gained market share and is almost neck and neck against the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ). The mini trust has established itself as the 6th dominant ETF in the industry and has outpaced the growth of Vaneck and Valkyrie ETFs as a distant 7th and 8th. Current ETF Assets Under Management (Treasuries BitBo) After some time, the original Grayscale bitcoin ETF has now moved to 3rd place from its previous position in 2nd place ETF in the industry. I anticipate this ETF will continue to lose market share while investors move towards a cheaper expense alternative. Future price of Bitcoin As more institutions and governments continue to use bitcoin as a store of value and or means for moving funds, I believe more than ever that every individual should put 2% or more of their income into Bitcoin. The rainbow chart , while qualitative more than quantitative, signals that as bitcoin blockchain rewards continue to halve and the supply is held by more and more institutions and governments, the price will inevitably go higher due to its supply of only 21,000,000 bitcoin. As demonstrated below, there is an obvious pattern 18 months post halving cycle where bitcoin increases in price due to lower supply and the shock that the network rewards. Just as a reference, the previous halving occurred in April 2024. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart (blockchaincenter.net) For those unfamiliar with the Rainbow chart, it is a log plot versus time (non-log) where the rainbow colors represent a similar log trend just at a slightly different location on the y-axis. This log trend has been adjusted from peaks and troughs of previous cycles of bitcoin movement to show when bitcoin was or is currently under or overpriced. Today, the rainbow plot shows things are still at a moderate price and people should hodl. Based on previous cycles, the expected price should increase to anywhere between $160k-$220k 18 months post halving which occurred in April 2024. As noted, I have switched my bottom target from $120,000 to $135k based on the recent movements in 2024 with time remaining before the end of the crypto bull market (YE2025). With the price of bitcoin currently $96,000, I anticipate the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF to increase 60-120% before year-end 2025. With a current price of $43, that would correspond to a price of $69 to $99. Previously, I was in the camp that after the bull markets, there would be a substantial drop, or retracement in the price of bitcoin to approximately one third or one half of its peak value. Now that more hedge funds, institutional and government entities are buying into the space, I believe there will still be a bear market and retracement, but that retracement is less severe than previous bear markets. That noted, there may need one more bull/bear cycle to play out before we confirm if the bear market bust trend post bull peaks continue. Conclusion Over the last year, Bitcoin spot ETFs being approved by the SEC has shined a positive light on the cryptocurrency as funds from individual and institutional clients continue to roll in. Institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock will remain the dominant ETFs as they have access to retirement accounts like 401K and 403B plans, as more investors become aware and expense ratio cautious Grayscale mini trust will benefit as the Grayscale brand name has been associated with bitcoin for quite some time, and it remains the lowest expense bitcoin ETF. The mini trust ETF has closed the gap to the 4th and 5th largest bitcoin ETFs and over the next few months, I anticipate the BTC ETF will overtake Bitwise as the 5th largest and, eventually, over the coming decades, the third or fourth-largest ETF by assets under management. As bitcoin becomes normalized, I see it prudent for individual investors to put 2% of their monthly salary into bitcoin as continuous contributions. This move alone and the acceptance of bitcoin ETFs into retirement accounts will continue to push demand for bitcoin higher throughout 2025 and lead to a potential peak of $99 for the ETF or $220,000 per bitcoin.",GBTC|ARKB|BITB|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-08 15:47:46

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s price trend is bearish and the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications is dropping. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is correcting from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, the drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s general bearish sentiment which saw its market cap drop below $3.2 trillion. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending 2028. Will ALGO reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending 2030. Will ALGO reach $100? At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 dropping to the $0.4 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-08 15:52:54

Solana remains a strong contender with its robust blockchain platform, while Dogecoin continues to ride the wave of meme coin popularity. However, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of investors with its innovative combination of AI and blockchain technology. With its presale raising over $9.1 million at $0.004875 per token, Lightchain AI is primed for massive growth. These projects are targeting 2025 for significant advancements, making them prime candidates for substantial returns. How Delayed Bull Market is Shaping Crypto Investment Opportunities The delayed bull market in crypto is reshaping investment strategies by creating opportunities for savvy investors to enter at lower prices. While many coins have seen stagnant or declining prices, this market pause allows investors to accumulate assets before the next surge. This delay has also sparked increased interest in undervalued projects with strong fundamentals, such as Lightchain AI, which is poised for growth. As the market gains momentum, these opportunities may yield substantial returns for early investors, positioning them for future success. Solana and Dogecoin- What to Expect from These Established Coins in 2025 As of January 6, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $212.26, reflecting its strong position in the cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at $0.3792, indicating its continued presence in the market. Analysts predict that Solana could reach $400 by 2025, driven by its high-speed blockchain and growing adoption in decentralized applications. Similarly, Dogecoin has garnered attention with predictions suggesting it could reach $20, though such forecasts are met with skepticism due to the coin's high volatility. While these projections are optimistic, investors should approach them with caution, considering the inherent risks and market volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. Diversifying investments and conducting thorough research are essential strategies for navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. Why Lightchain AI is Poised for Unprecedented Growth in 2025 Lightchain AI is poised for unprecedented growth in 2025 by disrupting the blockchain space with its unique integration of AI-driven solutions. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, Lightchain AI focuses on optimizing decentralized AI computations, offering scalability, security, and privacy. With its innovative Proof of Intelligence consensus and AI-enhanced virtual machine, the platform creates new possibilities for real-world applications. Its well-structured tokenomics, including significant presale allocations, incentivizes early participation while ensuring long-term value. The upcoming testnet and mainnet launches further validate its market potential, positioning Lightchain AI as a forward-thinking platform with massive growth prospects in the coming year.

Institutional adoption, political legitimacy, and first-mover advantage are key factors driving Bitcoin's momentum, creating a complex game theoretical landscape. The recent pullback to USD 91,315 and subsequent recovery above USD 100,000 highlight Bitcoin's characteristic volatility and resilience. Any turmoil in the stock markets will put Bitcoin prices at very high risk as Bitcoin is more closely correlated with US stock markets than ever before. AI and blockchain convergence, Proof-of-Personhood systems, and stablecoin adoption are anticipated to significantly impact the crypto landscape in 2025. As we enter 2025, Bitcoin finds itself at yet another critical juncture, navigating a complex landscape of unprecedented institutional interest, regulatory shifts, and market expectations. The cryptocurrency has already surpassed the USD 100,000 milestone, yet analysts unanimously predict a year of dramatic price swings. With price target projections ranging from USD 150,000 to USD 200,000, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and all those new Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , BITO , ARKB , BITB , HODL , BRRR , EZBC , ARKW , BITX , BTF and as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) stand poised between exhilarating bull runs and potential sharp corrections, embodying the inherent volatility that has defined its remarkable journey. The current market dynamics suggest a perfect storm of factors - including spot ETF inflows, potential U.S. strategic reserve considerations, and nasty waves of profit taking in the stock market, that could propel Bitcoin to new heights while simultaneously exposing it to significant market turbulences. Game Theory Dynamics Propelling Bitcoin's Momentum Given Bitcoin's unprecedented presence and political relevance, the growing influence of Bitcoin is creating a complex game theoretical landscape that compels influential players to take the cryptocurrency seriously. This dynamic is driven by several interconnected factors: Institutional Domino Effect: As major institutions adopt Bitcoin, it creates a cascading effect where others feel compelled to follow suit to avoid being left behind. Political Legitimacy: Support from the new U.S. administration lends Bitcoin additional legitimacy and credibility, making it riskier for governments and corporations to ignore or dismiss the technology. First-Mover Advantage: The potential economic benefits of early adoption exert pressure on decision-makers to engage with Bitcoin proactively. Opportunity Cost: Global attention on Bitcoin raises the stakes of inaction, as significant developments and opportunities could be missed by those who choose to remain on the sidelines. Network Effects: As Bitcoin's user base grows, its utility and value proposition strengthen, further incentivizing adoption. These factors collectively create a game theoretical scenario where ignoring Bitcoin becomes increasingly untenable for many players. While the long-term implications of these developments remain uncertain, the current dynamics are undeniably accelerating Bitcoin's integration into mainstream finance and politics. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Weekly Chart: First cup-and-handle price target already achieved Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of January 7th, 2025 (TradingView) Starting from the crash low on August 5th at USD 49,577, Bitcoin was able to rise by around 120% over the last five months. The breakout above the resistance zone between USD 73,000 and 75,000 in November brought the final end to the tenacious consolidation phase that had lasted several months. This breakthrough caused a sharp rally and overran all obstacles. In a manner typical for Bitcoin, there was a direct march through to the first price target from the large cup-and-handle formation at USD 98,000 to USD 100,000. The second price target from this formation at USD 130,000 is still pending, however, and could be targeted in the course of 2025. Interestingly, the sharp pullback over the last two weeks in 2024 has not led to a sell signal on the weekly stochastic oscillator. Accordingly, the breather might already be over. Alternatively, however, the entire leg up of the last five months will be corrected. In particular, the weakening stock markets and the faltering Bitcoin dominance, which briefly fell significantly at the beginning of December, suggest a somewhat larger pullback might still be possible. Bitcoin CME future contract with open gap Bitcoin Future in USD, weekly chart as of January 7th, 2025 (TradingView) In the Bitcoin CME future contract, the explosive Trump rally has left an open price gap between USD 77,930 and USD 80,670. It wouldn't be surprising if this price gap still needs to be closed. This could test the successful breakout from the cup-and-handle formation, and subsequently, the continuation of the Bitcoin rally would stand firmly on two legs. Overall, the weekly chart remains bullish. The overarching uptrend is clearly established and not at risk. However, the weakness in the second half of December, combined with the roller coaster ride in the stock markets, calls for some caution. After all, thanks to Wall Street and the numerous Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin price is more closely correlated than ever before with the fate of the stock markets. Daily Chart: Strong support zone above 90,000 USD Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of January 7th, 2025 (TradingView) Although the bears tried hard for 16 trading days, they have only made very slow and sluggish progress. As a result, the stochastic oscillator has penetrated deep into its oversold zone. The bounce since the beginning of the year immediately generated a new buy signal, and the stochastic oscillator still has quickly reached its overbought zone again. As well, the upper Bollinger Band (USD 101,947) has been reached. Accordingly, after a quick and impressive bounce, the air is getting a bit thin again for Bitcoin. However, if the low, seen on December 30, 2024, was a larger turning point, Bitcoin should already be on its way to new all-time highs. Overall, the daily chart is bullish thanks to the recent stochastic buy signal. However, the daily chart is overbought too. Hence, we would not be surprised if Bitcoin needs some time to digest the bounce of the last seven days. Bitcoin Sentiment - A bit too optimistic Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of January 2nd, 2025 (Bitcoin Magazine Pro.) The ""Crypto Fear & Greed Index"" is currently at 70 out of 100 points. The pullback had at least partially cooled the mood in the last two weeks of 2024. However, there is certainly not a contrarian buy signal. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of January 4th, 2025 (Coinmarketcap) In CoinMarketCap's ""CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index"", sentiment had shifted significantly more towards ""neutral"". Thanks to the recovery of the last few days, the sentiment barometer is again in the ""greed range"". Overall, the current market sentiment requires a differentiated view. Despite the significant price drop to around USD 91,351, the general mood among investors remained too optimistic. At the same time, the pullback created enough skepticism for a significant price recovery. On top, Jim Cramer and Christian Lindner are also causing skepticism. The former German finance minister has spoken out in favor of a Bitcoin reserve for the European Central Bank (ECB), which puts him in the steadily growing circle of political actors who are opportunistically joining the Bitcoin herd instinct. This development is strongly reminiscent of the end of the Bitcoin euphoria of 2021, when numerous public figures demonstrated their support for Bitcoin by using ""laser eyes"" in their social media profile pictures. Bitcoin Seasonality - Seasonality turns neutral to slightly negative Bitcoin Seasonality as of January 4th, 2025 (Seasonax) Bitcoin has adhered to seasonal guidelines in an exemplary manner last year. Since the new all-time high in March, prices have corrected and, as expected, reached an important low of just under USD 50,000 at the beginning of August. After a tenacious bottoming phase in August and September, the next wave up began in mid-October. In the past, however, the turn of the year usually brought somewhat weaker prices for January. According to the seasonal pattern, the pullback that begun in mid of December could therefore continue until the end of the month. In summary, the seasonal component in the first few weeks of the new year is somewhat unfavorable for Bitcoin. Sound Money - Bitcoin vs. Gold /Gold-ratio, daily chart as of January 7th, 2025 (TradingView) Overall, the Bitcoin/gold ratio confirms the strong buy signal for Bitcoin against gold. The pullback from 41 to 35.5 in the last weeks of 2024 had created a strongly oversold situation on the daily chart, from which Bitcoin was able to recover quickly against the gold price. On the weekly chart shown, the uptrend is intact, and the stochastic oscillator continues to move bullishly embedded above 80 with both signal lines. Macro Update - Highly complex situation is likely to bring significantly increased volatility for 2025 Shanghai Shenzen CSI 3000 Index, as of January 2nd, 2025 (Holger Zschäpitz) At the start of the new year, the Chinese CSI 300 Index ( SHSZ300 ) recorded its sharpest decline on the first trading day since 2016, with a daily loss of 2.9%. Given that the CSI 300 lost 11.3% overall in 2016, this first trading day could be indicative of the year's trend. The German DAX also experienced a wild roller coaster ride on the first two trading days, not making the healthiest impression. The Dow Jones ( DIA ) is already trading about 5.3% below its all-time high from December 4th, while the S&P 500 ( SPY ) and especially the NASDAQ ( NDAQ ) appear somewhat more robust. Bitcoin corrects 15% within two weeks Bitcoin retreated from its new all-time high by a substantial 15% to USD 91,315 in less than two weeks, but is now back above the psychological mark of USD 100,000. So far, this looks like a normal consolidation or healthy pullback around this major psychological level. US stocks against gold, as of December 31st, 2024 (Bloomberg Intelligence) Gold, on the other hand, has been demonstrating fundamental strength throughout 2024. In mid-December, as expected, support around USD 2,600 was successfully defended again. Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) as well as the SPDR Gold Trust ETF ( GLD ), the iShares Gold Trust ETF ( IAU ) and Sprott Physical Gold Trust ( PHYS ) not only convince with new upward momentum at the start of the year, but has been outperforming the S&P 500 since 2021. This fact increasingly points to deflationary tendencies in the global financial system as a possible early indicator. Whether the precious metal will beat stocks again in 2025 could therefore be one of the most important macroeconomic questions. The current situation, after the fading of the major Covid liquidity injections, is quite similar to the dangerous situations of 1999/2000 and 2006/2007. Gold's resilience and fundamental strength remain remarkable, having held up well despite the significantly stronger US dollar in recent weeks and merely consolidating sideways the gains made since late October. Jim Rogers and Warren Buffett have drastically reduced their US stock exposure Overall, global financial markets are facing increased risk and susceptibility to profit-taking after the steep and partially bubble-like price increases in US tech stocks. Hence, significantly increasing volatility is likely to make life much more difficult for investors across all asset classes this year. However, if strong turbulence causes enough skepticism and uncertainty, the year-end balance could still show a plus in the stock markets thanks to loose monetary policies around the globe. At least in the short term, the upcoming change of power in America could cause the stock and especially the crypto markets to boom again in the course of the ""post-election pump"". Overheated US tech stocks are vulnerable in 2025 Buffett Indicator, as of September 30th, 2024 (Gramalam, LLC.) Yield curve model, as of September 30th, 2024 (Gramalam, LLC.) Their caution is reflected in concrete actions: Rogers has sold all his US stocks and is even considering shorting stocks, while Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for eight consecutive quarters. Buffett has also sold his positions in companies such as Floor & Decor Holdings ( FND ), Paramount Global ( PARA ), and Snowflake ( SNOW ). Instead, he is diversifying his portfolio by investing in other sectors. For example, he bought the railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe for USD 44 billion. These risk minimization measures and the search for alternative investment opportunities underscore the concern of these two renowned investors about current market conditions and valuations in the US stock market. 10 stocks account for 40% of market capitalization Should there be a deflationary shock or even a bear market in the stock markets, not only these tech stocks but especially the Bitcoin price would be at very high risk. After all, Bitcoin is more closely correlated with US stock markets than ever before. In particular, the election of Donald Trump as US President and his crypto-friendly stance have positively influenced both the crypto and traditional financial markets. At the same time, the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US has made it easier for institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin, closely intertwining it with the traditional financial sector. Macroeconomic factors such as US monetary policy now equally influence both markets, with loose monetary policy naturally favoring risky assets like Bitcoin. Moreover, the Bitcoin market is increasingly following the 4-year cycle of the US presidential campaign, which also influences stock markets. The growing perception of Bitcoin as an alternative store of value contributes to the cryptocurrency reacting more strongly to macroeconomic factors that also affect stock markets. Increasing Divergence Between East and West In contrast, the other half of the world's population in the eastern part of the planet (China, Russia, and India, or Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa) is increasingly distancing itself from Western values, treaties, and trade relations, opting instead to purchase physical gold. This growing divergence between the East and the West in terms of economic strategies and asset preferences is a complex phenomenon that is likely to shape both financial and geopolitical landscapes in the coming years and possibly decades. While central banks in Asia and Eastern Europe are increasingly emerging as major gold buyers, and countries such as South Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria are increasing their gold reserves to protect against currency losses, the West is focusing more on technological innovations and digital assets. Thanks to high investments in future technologies and digitalization, the West is experiencing a new ""founding era"", which, however, primarily leads to high-growth rates and new corporate giants in the USA and Asia. The future will show which strategy proves to be more sustainable. In any case, this divergence intensifies geopolitical tensions and growing mistrust between East and West. Possibly, a combination of both approaches - stability through traditional assets like gold and innovation through technology and digital assets - will be the key to balanced global economic development and a new economic order. In particular, there is an urgent need in Europe and Germany to unleash new innovative power through free markets and deregulation while simultaneously ensuring the stability of economic systems. Otherwise, Germany and Europe will have no chance in global competition. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Torn Between Bull Runs And Bear Plunges, Extreme Volatility Ahead Driven by technological advancements, regulatory developments, and changing market dynamics, the crypto industry will continue to evolve at a breathtaking pace in 2025. Artificial Intelligence ""AI"" will play a key role in reshaping the crypto landscape, with AI agents potentially owning their own wallets, autonomously conducting transactions, and even managing blockchain networks. This convergence of AI and blockchain is expected to contribute an estimated USD 1.76 trillion to global GDP by 2030, revolutionizing areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), predictive analytics, and fraud prevention. Proof-of-Personhood (PoP) systems are likely to gain significance this year to verify human uniqueness and combat deepfakes and fraud attempts. These systems aim to establish digital identities while preserving privacy, possibly utilizing advanced technologies such as iris recognition. A surge in stablecoin adoption is anticipated, with businesses from small cafes to global corporations using crypto infrastructure to reduce transaction costs. However, USDT (Tether) has disappeared from most European crypto exchanges as of December 30th, 2024, due to MiCA regulations. So far, the consequences for crypto trading in Europe have been manageable. Decentralized Autonomous Chatbots (DACs) could become a potential growth driver. Chatbots operating on decentralized and permissionless systems, coordinated through a consensus protocol, could create the first truly autonomous billion-dollar company in the bot economy through the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Bitcoin 2nd Bull-run within the cycle (AurelienOhayon) Price-wise, Bitcoin is likely to move in a large trading range between approximately USD 70,000 and USD 150,000 this year. We are confident that the second price target from the four-year cup-and-handle pattern at around USD 130,000 can be reached during the course of this year. However, we fear that the volatility will become extreme.

The ultimate guide,https://crypto.news/crypto-mining-farm/,"Crypto mining farms are large setups where digital currencies are created. Mining is how new coins enter circulation, with Bitcoin being the first to be mined back in 2009. As of early 2025, thousands of coins are out there, contributing to a market worth over $3.4 trillion, but only a handful of them can actually be mined. What is a crypto mining farm? Crypto mining farm explained A crypto mining farm is essentially a hub where powerful computers team up to mine digital currencies. In simple terms, a crypto mining farm is a tech-driven facility where specialized computers, called mining rigs, work to solve complex mathematical problems to validate and secure transactions on a blockchain network. For each problem solved, new coins, like Bitcoin are minted and added to the cryptocurrency world. Cryptocurrency farms can be massive, often filled with hundreds or even thousands of these rigs working nonstop. Bitcoin mining farms are a great example of this, requiring a lot of energy and special setups to keep things running smoothly. These farms are key to making cryptocurrencies thrive and keep the digital economy growing.

Crypto mining farms operate by setting up large networks of powerful computers designed to work together in solving complex mathematical equations required to validate cryptocurrency transactions. A cryptocurrency farm is essentially a powerhouse of machines focused on mining coins like Bitcoin . These rigs solve complex equations to confirm transactions, earning cryptocurrency rewards stored securely in wallets. Managing Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining farms takes careful planning, as they need significant electricity and cooling to keep running efficiently. Expanding the number of machines increases the farm’s ability to mine more coins, making growth key to success in this space. Mining farms serve as the engine that powers cryptocurrency creation while safeguarding the integrity of the blockchain system. Types of cryptocurrency mining farms Mining farms aren’t one-size-fits-all — they come in different sizes to meet various goals. At the top are industrial mining farms, massive operations featuring warehouses full of rigs optimized for maximum output. Mid-sized setups, usually run by smaller companies, focus on balancing costs with profitability. For individuals, home mining farms offer a personal way to mine cryptocurrency, although they face challenges in keeping up with larger players. Beyond physical setups, alternatives like cloud mining have gained popularity, allowing users to rent mining power remotely. Creative approaches also exist, such as mining with renewable energy sources or repurposed hardware for a greener, cost-effective solution. Benefits of cryptocurrency mining farms Cryptocurrency mining farms are like powerhouses for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They allow both individuals and businesses to combine resources, creating a far more cost-effective way to mine. Thanks to economies of scale, mining at these farms is more affordable than doing it on your own. With cutting-edge hardware and optimized systems, farms make mining profitable and efficient. Moreover, they’re key players in securing the blockchain, verifying transactions, and keeping the system decentralized. For those who want a hassle-free entry, cloud mining services hosted by farms offer an easy solution. Overall, mining farms simplify the process while strengthening the foundations of the crypto world. Challenges and costs of running a mining farm Setting up your own cryptocurrency mining farm requires some serious planning. The first big hurdle is the electricity cost — mining rigs run nonstop, which can quickly make your power bill soar. Then, there’s the need for cooling systems; if they fail, the machines can overheat and require costly repairs, slowing down your operations. On top of that, the upfront cost for mining rigs is hefty, and maintaining them requires expertise to ensure they run smoothly. In other words, it’s not just about buying equipment; it’s about investing time and money into a system that can handle the demands of mining at scale. The future of crypto mining farms The future of cryptocurrency farms, particularly Bitcoin mining farms, looks promising as technology continues to evolve. As advancements in mining technology push the boundaries of what’s possible, these farms will see increased production at lower energy costs.

The flock is pushing hard for Flocktopia! 🐦🔥🚀 pic.twitter.com/Ad8c15xPFi — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) January 7, 2025 With a unique twist on community governance, sound fundamentals and a strong social media presence, it is no surprise that experts are viewing FLOCK as one of the top meme coin investments for 2025. Flockerz Raises $9M In ICO — Why The Hype? Flockerz is branding itself as “the people’s meme coin”, prioritizing decentralization above all else. For the uninitiated, Elon Musk called Dogecoin “the people’s cryptocurrency”. However, while a significant portion of the DOGE supply is held by whales, FLOCK is still a low-cap meme coin, which prioritises decentralization above all else. As per its whitepaper , Flockerz is offering a unique twist on the idea of community governance. All FLOCK holders will be members of the Flocktopia DAO and decide the direction of the project with their votes, whether it is regarding exchange listings, new features, marketing initiatives, etc. While many high-upside projects have been ruined by the short-sighted, money-minded actions of the developer team, Flockerz’s community governance ensures that this new crypto coin doesn’t befall the same fate. Community governance isn’t a novel idea in the community market. However, Flockerz’s vote-to-earn platform fosters active participation — the more a FLOCK holder votes, the higher their payout. In fact, 25% of the entire FLOCK token supply has been allocated towards the V2E rewards, which already pans out to over $2.25 million. The meme coin’s core mission of decentralization could prove to be a major boon, especially in regard to its upcoming CEX listings. For instance, Binance has been listing low-cap, decentralized crypto coins like First Neiro On Ethereum and Act I: The Prophecy. In fact, Binance co-founder He Yi has criticised centralized meme coins, claiming that they violated the anti-Wall Street spirit of the meme coin sector. Other top-tier CEXs have also offered listings to small-cap cryptocurrencies. It is, therefore, no surprise that FLOCK is quickly becoming one of the highly-anticipated new cryptocurrency listings. Is Flockerz The Best New Cryptocurrency To Buy? As previously stated, Flockerz is a meme coin with strong fundamentals. For instance, FLOCK has community-centric tokenomics. For instance, 70% of the FLOCK token supply has been allocated towards investors —- 20% in the form of the presale, 25% as vote-to-earn rewards and another 25% as staking rewards. The Flockerz staking pool, which offers attractive passive income to early buyers, is currently offering a reward rate of 300% per annum. The remaining tokens will also be utilized for the project’s growth, including its marketing and exchange listings. Notably, there is no separate allocation towards the developer team or any private sale, which makes Flockerz a viable project in the long term and reduces the risk of any scams or rug-pulls. Furthermore, the FLOCK smart contract has been audited multiple times, with the Coinsult and Solid Proof audit reports available on the presale website.

Bitcoin’s price fell below $96K, signaling a bearish trend that triggered investor liquidations. This downturn caused Dogecoin’s price to break key support levels, raising concerns among traders. Analysts now speculate on possible recovery paths as consolidation patterns echo past cycles. Today, crypto markets face significant losses as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) lead sharp declines. Bitcoin dropped below $96K from $102K, contributing to over $1 million in liquidations. The market downturn underscores increased volatility, with traders facing substantial losses across major digital assets amid shifting market sentiment. Dogecoin Price Ready for Takeoff? A Look at 2017’s Bullish Patterns Crypto trader tweeted about the Dogecoin price potential to repeat historical patterns observed during previous market cycles. According to the trader, DOGE tends to consolidate near its all-time high (ATH) levels for several months before experiencing a substantial price surge. This behavior mirrors the market dynamics of 2021, when similar consolidation preceded a significant breakout. The analysis highlights Dogecoin’s current price movements, showing signs of consolidation around its previous ATH levels. The trader speculates that this phase might last a few months before a final upward move. Such a scenario suggests the possibility of a major bull run following this period of price stability, which is consistent with Dogecoin’s historical patterns. If the market aligns with this outlook, Dogecoin enthusiasts could anticipate a potential rally once the consolidation phase concludes. However, traders are reminded to consider market volatility and exercise caution when making investment decisions. Source- X DOGE Price Analysis At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trading at $0.3449, reflecting a decline of 5% within the last 24-hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 34.00, nears oversold conditions. This indicates that a potential rebound might be on the horizon if buying pressure increases. However, the RSI’s downward trend confirms the current bearish bias. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line. This reinforces the bearish sentiment, pointing to further downside risks in the short term. Traders should closely monitor the $0.35 resistance level. A successful breakout above this level could drive the price toward $0.40. Conversely, if the price fails to maintain support at $0.30, the Dogecoin price prediction could revisit the $0.25 mark. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView Dogecoin’s consolidation phase suggests a potential rally, reflecting historical trends. However, market volatility and bearish indicators demand cautious trading. Monitoring key levels and market sentiment will be crucial for traders anticipating a bullish breakout in the coming months.

This New Altcoin Is Predicted To Be A Better Investment,https://nulltx.com/can-cardano-catch-up-to-binance-coin-bnb-market-cap-this-year-this-new-altcoin-is-predicted-to-be-a-better-investment/,"Cardano is an OG crypto project that fell off along the way. But things changed for the better last year, and Cardano’s price mounted a serious momentum that took it into the top 10 coins by market cap. Several industry watchers are saying ADA’s next mission is to overtake Binance Coin and shoot to the sky. However, this remains to be seen, as Remittix , a new crypto project, could outperform both ADA and BNB this year. Cardano market cap hits $40 billion level Cardano is a proof of stake protocol whose goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators, and visionaries” to bring about positive change to the world. Launched half a decade ago, ADA fell off but has slowly risen back up. At the moment, Cardano boasts a market cap that is about $40 billion strong. This is over $50 billion away from BNB’s market cap of $100 billion. However, Cardano has a superior supply of tokens, so a significant Cardano price rally could see it catch up with BNB. BNB drops down the pecking order BNB is the native token on Binance and the Binance Smart Chain. It used to be the third largest coin on CoinMarketCap, but that isn’t so anymore. Due to price stagnation, BNB has dropped down the ladder, with XRP and Solana overtaking it in recent times. At the moment, BNB is sitting 6th and this is still an enviable position for any crypto project. Plus, there’s still a chance BNB could climb up the ladder. However, BNB’s price hasn’t recorded any significant uptick after its massive rally last March. Maybe it’s more likely that ADA would overtake BNB than the latter climbing up the ladder. Is Remittix a better investment option? Remittix is not an established crypto token like BNB and Cardano, but it is pulling its own crowd. Launched about a month ago, Remittix has garnered significant interest from the crypto world, and its presale is highly contested by a horde of investors. But what does Remittix do? In a nutshell, Remittix empowers crypto holders and businesses to facilitate crypto-to-fiat transactions worldwide. It leverages local payment networks and blockchain technology to allow anyone to send fiat to any bank account across the globe, right from their cryptocurrency wallets. Even more, the transfer is executed in an instant, and Remittix charges no FX fees. It has a user-friendly interface which anyone can get around easily. It also operates in a non-custodial manner, putting investors’ minds at rest in terms of security. These features put Remittix on a pedestal and position it as a disruptor in the global remittance industry. This market is worth over $700 billion and Remittix is a breath of fresh air, offering better services and possibilities. Veteran crypto analysts know it is headed to the top, with early RTX investors set to make a killing. The bottom line A significant Cardano price surge could see it over take BNB’s market cap before the year ends. However, Remittix is a superior investment option to ADA and BNB. It has a groundbreaking use case and is set to the top. Available now for just $0.0185, it is set to appreciate by as much as 10,000%, and anyone who jumps on its bandwagon stands to make humongous profits even before it gets listed on exchanges.

However, amidst the optimism for these established tokens, Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as the standout viral altcoin. This project takes a fresh approach to crypto, fusing the best of iGaming and DeFi to create a compelling GambleFi solution that appeals to both audiences. So how will Solana, Binance Coin, and Rollblock (RBLK) perform in the next financial quarter? Rollblock Soars as Presale Approaches $8.5 Million Rollblock (RBLK) is reshaping the iGaming and blockchain landscapes with its groundbreaking GambleFi platform. It offers an engaging casino experience with a powerful play-to-earn token at its center, built on Ethereum’s intelligent blockchain infrastructure. This blockchain architecture is key to Rolblock’s popularity, as it ensures trades are fully immutable, building an environment of trust and safety for iGaming and DeFi enthusiasts to enjoy. Rollblock’s casino offering is comprehensive, offering more than 7,000 casino games in total. From live options like baccarat and roulette to innovative virtual games such as “Jungle Quest” and “High-Speed Chase,” Rollblock provides an unparalleled gaming experience. Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model adds immense value for token holders. Each week, up to 30% of platform profits are allocated to buying back RBLK tokens, with 60% burned to reduce supply and 40% distributed as staking rewards. This model promotes the long-term growth of the ecosystem while rewarding investors who have shown loyalty to the project since its early days. Currently priced at $0.0445 in stage 9 of its presale, RBLK is projected to see an 800% gainbefore its official launch. As the presale only has 60% of the fixed supply of tokens allocated to it, time is quickly running out as thousands of investors buy in. Solana Eyes $1000 with Scalability Enhancements Speedy transactions with low fees have made Solana (SOL) a perennial favorite with developers and investors, and recent upgrades to Solana's network infrastructure have only strengthened its position further. Particularly, Turbine 2.0 improved Solana's scalability and transaction throughput. In addition, Solana’s (SOL) strategic release of an alternative validator client has helped Solana handle more transactions while making Solana a more favorable environment for developers. Binance Coin’s Gradual Ascent to $1000 A slew of improvements to the Binance Smart Chain have cut transaction costs notably for Binance Coin (BNB) users, making Binance Coin more efficient as a means of currency. Binance Coin (BNB) maintains its gradual trend upwards despite some volatility and analysts believe it could hit $1000 by late 2025. Binance Coin is currently trading at $701 after a 1.5% weekly increase. While this is a poor performance compare to many of the markets top altcoins experts remain optimistic about BNB’s growth in Q1. Rollblock Steals The Spotlight Amid Established Players While Solana and Binance Coin continue to see gradual price increases, Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a promising newcomer in the DeFi industry. With its blockchain-powered transparency, extensive gaming ecosystem and revenue-sharing model, Rollblock is capturing the attention of iGaming and DeFi enthusiasts from across the space.

This comes amid changing tides within the crypto community’s sentiment regarding the ongoing bull run and whether it has come to an early and abrupt end. CryptoPotato has repeatedly reported the adverse price development around BTC, which started yesterday. Recall that the asset had soared past $102,000 on Tuesday morning for the first time since December 19. However, its run was quickly halted, and BTC started to lose value rapidly and violently. In just an hour or so yesterday, after the release of the US jobs report, the cryptocurrency plunged by five grand to under $97,000. That was just the beginning of this ongoing correction as the asset plummeted further today – first to $95,000, as mentioned earlier, and now to below $94,000 for the first time since January 1. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView The altcoins continue to bleed out, with ETH dumping below $3,300, BNB losing the $700 mark, while DOGE and SOL have dropped by over 8% each. The total crypto market cap has lost nearly $400 billion in 36 hours. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this crash, which could trigger the implementation of a bearish head and shoulders pattern for bitcoin. He asserted that the cryptocurrency had dumped below a coveted support line formed between $95,400 and $98,400, where over 1.5 million BTC was acquired by nearly 1.8 million addresses. As such, the analyst outlined $92,000 as the next pivotal support level that needs to hold; otherwise, bitcoin risks dropping to $74,000 as there’s not much support until that level, given the asset’s rapid ascent since the US elections. A surge in selling pressure pushing #Bitcoin below $92,000 could spell trouble. Falling past this level opens the door to a steep drop, with little support until $74,000. https://t.co/pyGIVD5uCD — Ali (@ali_charts) January 8, 2025 The post Bitcoin Price Breaks Below $94K Amid Warnings About a Crash to $74K appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-08 17:24:00

Meanwhile, coins in the Ethereum ecosystem, including Ethena and Rollblock ($RBLK), will likely enjoy significant pumps in Q1. Many investors are now rotating from the large-cap majors to tokens such as Ethena and Rollblock, which are tipped to deliver incredible 50x gains during the coming months. Rollblock ($RBLK) On A Mission To Restore Trust With Blockchain-Backed Betting Rollblock (RBLK) represents a long-awaited upgrade for the $500 billion online gambling sector, as it uses the power of blockchain technology to stamp out the kind of underhanded bet tampering that has long plagued the industry. Rollblock gamers can now verify independently that their bets stand exactly as intended. A new gaming license from Gaming Anjouan also speaks to Rollblock’s commitment to bringing trust and transparency back to this huge addressable market. Over 7,000 games are available to explore as well as a brand-new sports betting league, which is already proving incredibly popular. Reports from December indicate that the platform experienced a 600% surge in new registrations as word has begun to spread about the vast potential of the Rollblock platform. All game payouts are made using RBLK, which allows gamers to earn a passive income of up to 30%. This is made possible by the Rollblock revenue share scheme, a game-changing deflationary tactic that will use a portion of Rollblock profits each week to buy up RBLK token from the open market. 60% of these purchases are burned to reduce the supply, while the remaining 40% are allocated to stakers who can earn a passive income. The Rollblock price is currently just $0.0445. This incredible discount won’t last much longer as stage nine tokens are already over 53% sold as thousands of investors buy in each week. Ethereum ($ETH) Setting Up For A Sustained Rally In Q1 Ethereum has rallied by 9% in the previous 7 days to reach $3.6k. The Ethereum price recently rebounded from support at $3.2k, and a rally to $4k looks inevitable in the coming weeks. Ethereum’s RSI is also currently above 50%, which indicates a high probability of bullish momentum going forward. The Ethereum futures market has been fairly muted recently, as recent long liquidation cascades led to a hefty correction. This supports the case for a slow and steady rally for Ethereum during Q1 if the present demand for Ethereum is sustained. The Future Looks Bright As Ethena ($ENA) Adds 177% In 6 Months Ethena has had an impressive week of trading and is currently up 24% on the weekly time frame to reach $1.17. This has taken the Ethena market cap to $3.56 billion and secured Ethena a place at number 40 in the crypto rankings. In the last 6 months, Ethena has delighted its holders with a 177% rally, making Ethena one of the top-performing Ethereum tokens in the ecosystem. Ethena will likely reclaim its yearly high of $1.52 during Q1, especially if Ethereum’s dominance continues to rise. Rollblock Ready To Soar As Metrics Scream ‘Buy’ Ethena and Rollblock are poised to do exceptionally well following Ethereum’s recent show of strength. At this point in the cycle, Rollblock is likely to deliver gains of up to 50x as its incredible scarcity and unmatched utility combine to create a truly enticing investment opportunity.

Meme Index Hits $2M In Presale,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/best-crypto-to-buy-now-meme-index-hits-2m-in-presale,"A new meme coin, Meme Index (MEMEX) , is receiving considerable praise early in its presale, with some calling it one of the best crypto to buy now. There is a strong demand for MEMEX among smart money investors and retailers alike, with the new meme coin having already raised over $2 million in its presale. Meme Index - Invest In Meme Coin Baskets The strong demand for meme coins means that the sector has ballooned to thousands of tokens, a number of which have high upside potential. While whales can easily invest in a broad selection of meme cryptos for outsized returns, small-scale retailers often have just enough funds for two to three investments. Their all-in approach also has considerable risk and opportunity cost — many tokens underperform while others may turn out to be scams. Consider, Moo Deng, for example. The meme coin is live on almost all top-tier CEXs, including Coinbase and Binance Futures. It currently represents the third-largest allocation by the trading firm Wintermute. And yet, the Moo Deng coin is down by nearly 30% since its Coinbase listing. While the meme coin is expected to eventually skyrocket, small-scale investors who went all-in on MOODENG are currently in significant losses. Meme Index is looking to tackle this issue head-on. It is the first-ever decentralized index fund for meme coins, seeking to offer broad market exposure to investors while spreading the risk. Investors will have their choice from four separate indexes. The Meme Titan Index will include blue-chip meme coins, many of which have multi-billion dollar valuations. The basket will likely feature assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. Similarly, the Meme Moonshot Index will include the high-flyers — tokens that have been showcasing outsized growth and are poised to hit the billion-dollar mark. This basket could have projects like Notcoin, First Neiro On Ethereum and Snek. Third is the Meme Midcap Index, featuring assets within the $50 million and $250 million valuations. Investors could find the next Binance meme coins in the basket, especially since the world’s leading exchange has been listing low-cap crypto assets in recent months. Finally, the Meme Frenzy Index will include high-risk, high-reward meme coins. This index is designed for the degens and could offer outsized returns, especially in the upcoming meme coin supercycle. Notably, only MEMEX holders will be able to invest in these baskets, which explains the strong early demand for the new crypto coin. Moreover, they will vote on which meme coins are included in each basket, a feature that has impressed the experts. It will allow investors to benefit from community-intelligence — making money from investments that they otherwise would have missed out on. Moreover, it would be extremely unlikely that a scam token would make it into the basket. With its unique value proposition, it is no surprise that smart money investors are calling Meme Index one of the best crypto to buy now. Is MEMEX The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Aside from its innovation and community governance, MEMEX is also a meme coin with strong fundamentals. Smart money investors are impressed with its community-centric tokenomics, multiple security audits and strong social media presence. For instance, the Meme Index X account — which was created at the start of the presale — already has nearly 20k followers. This is on top of the 2.3k Telegram subscribers. Retail investors are also investing in MEMEX due to its presale staking platform, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 1100%. Unsurprisingly, Meme Index is being backed as one of the best crypto to buy now. Many smart money investors are eyeing up to 10x returns from it following its launch.

According to Onchain data, a crypto whale has come close to the brink with a $20 million SUI long position. The crypto whale in question had recently deposited $4.1 million worth of SUI and $470,000 worth of sSUI into Suilend, in exchange for a $14.4 million stablecoin loan. With a serious decline in the cryptocurrency market led by altcoins, this crypto whale will be completely liquidated if the SUI price drops below $4.45. It is not yet known whether the crypto whale will add new funds to prevent his position from being liquidated. Related News: Why Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Falling? Here Are All the Reasons in Depth! The SUI price has dropped by around 9% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $4.45 at the time of writing. SUI, which is among the largest altcoins in the world with a market value of $ 13.38 billion, was launched in the summer of 2023 and attracted a lot of attention. The altcoin rose to its all-time high price level two days ago. *This is not investment advice.

In 2028, the coin could be worth between $28.69 and $34.15, with an average price of $33.15. By 2031, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $55.76 Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks Overview Cryptocurrency Cosmos Token ATOM Current Price $6.43 Market Cap $2.51B Trading Volume $480.94M Circulating Supply 390.93M ATOM All-time High $ 44.70 on Sept 19, 2021 All-time Low $1.13 on Mar 12, 2020 24-hour High $6.79 24-hour Low $6.41 Cosmos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 8.60 (32.84%) Volatility (30-day variation) 11.63% 50-Day SMA $7.47 14-Day RSI 45.33 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $5.95 Cosmos (ATOM) technical price analysis TL; DR Breakdown: The price of Cosmos is under bearish pressure and is struggling below resistance at $6.75 while nearing support at $6.46. Key indicators show weakening momentum with the 1-day RSI at 43.48 and the 4-hour MACD confirming bearish momentum alongside mild buying interest. If the price recovers above $6.75 it could target $7.00 to $7.20 but continued bearish pressure might push it down to $6.00 if $6.46 support breaks. ATOM/USD 1-Day price chart ATOM 1-Day price chart ; Tradingview The 1-day chart for Cosmos (ATOM/USD) on January 8 indicates a bearish sentiment, with the price currently at $6.557, down 3.17%.

The RSI is at 43.48, trending downward toward oversold levels, with the 42.58 mark signaling weakening momentum. If the price fails to reclaim $6.75, further declines toward $6.00 are likely. A breakout above $7.00 could restore bullish momentum toward $7.50. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOM 4-hour price chart ; Tradingview The 4-hour chart for Cosmos (ATOM/USD) shows the price at $6.565, with a high of $6.651 and a low of $6.529.

The Balance of Power (BOP) is slightly positive at 0.21, suggesting mild buying pressure. The MACD histogram showcases bearish momentum, with the MACD line at -0.123 and the signal line at -0.129, hinting at a downtrend.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour charts for Cosmos (ATOM/USD), the price is under bearish pressure, currently trading at $6.565. The daily RSI of 43.48 indicates weakening momentum, with resistance at $6.75 (SMA) and support at $6.46 (Bollinger Band). The 4-hour MACD shows bearish momentum, while the Balance of Power (0.21) suggests mild buying interest. A recovery above $6.75 may lead to a retest of $7.00-$7.20 levels, but sustained bearish pressure could push the price below $6.46, targeting the $6.00 psychological support. The overall outlook favors consolidation with bearish potential unless strong buying emerges near $6.50. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo’s current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $50 by 2029. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will unlikely reach $100 soon. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $73.66 by 2030, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $74 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base.

During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos is trading between $7.2 to $7.5.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-08 17:31:07

Recently, Grok spelled out the bullish case for Rollblock (RBLK) , the GambleFi presale that is on track to outrun meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu with the potential for 50xgains during its next phase of rapid growth in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Blockchain Casino Sees A 600% Spike In Signups Rollblock (RBLK) has been accelerating through its early-stage presale launch recently, reaching stage 9 and raising more than $8.2 million in only a few short months. Rollblock recently announced that more than 40,000 early adopters have taken positions in this GambleFi platform, many of them enjoying over 300% returns already on their initial investments. Rollblock finished last year with a flurry of bullish indicators, including a reported 600% surge in new signups and more than $1.75 million of wagered bets across its 7,000 casino games and sports betting facility. Rollblock brings the best of DeFi to the $500 billion gaming industry and pays out all of its winnings using the Ethereum-based RBLK token. This allows for staking rewards of up to 30% as investors can grow their bags by securing the chain. Each week, the casino will head to the open market with up to 30% of its operating profits to buy up RBLK, burning 60% of these tokens and allocating the rest to stakers in the community. In this way, the supply of RBLK will trend lower over time as the token becomes truly scarce. Rollblock recently secured a coveted gaming license from Gaming Anjouan and has passed regular audits and regulatory checks ensuring user safety throughout its ecosystem. With Rollblock tokens available for just $0.0445 and over 50% of stage nine of the presale sold investors are running out of time to buy before RBLK surges. Dogecoin (DOGE) Swinging Wildly In Musk’s Wake Dogecoin has been subject to typically choppy trading conditions recently, having put in a phenomenal weekly candle of 23% to reach a price of $0.38. However, zooming out onto the monthly time frame tells a different story as Dogecoin holders still find themselves down a woeful 14.9% in the last 30 days. Dogecoin recently increased by 300% in a matter of months following support from the world's richest man Elon Musk and his many viral X posts. Dogecoin's price will likely continue to fluctuate wildly as Dogecoin is a purely speculative investment without anything in the way of actual utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burning Through Its Supply At A Rapid Pace Shiba Inu remains the second largest meme coin in the crypto space behind Dogecoin. A recent 12% rally this week has led the price of Shiba Inu to reach $0.000023 and a total market cap of $13.9 billion. Shiba Inu recently burned a huge amount of tokens by removing a total of 34 million tokens from circulation. This equates to an increase in the burn rate of 2,133%. However, it looks likely that Shiba Inu is in for a period of consolidation here as selling pressure has been high in recent weeks. Grok Delivers A Startling Rollblock Prediction While meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have tremendous viral appeal, Rollblock(RBLK) combines a similar loyal community with the unquestionable utility of a truly comprehensive GambleFi platform. Its smaller market cap means that it has tremendous potential to grow up to 50x this cycle as many analysts, including Elon Musk's Grok, have predicted it will outperform the top memes.

In contrast, the company’s addition of new trading pairs often leads to significant price surges, as seen with numerous altcoins in the recent past. The Delisting Spree The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange decided to remove several margin trading pairs from its platform. According to the official announcement , LIT/BTC, NULS/BTC, SFP/BTC, BEL/BTC, LIT/BTC, LSK/BTC, NULS/BTC, and SFP/BTC will become unavailable to clients from January 16 . “Effective immediately, users will no longer be able to transfer any amount of assets of the aforementioned pair (s) via manual transfers and Auto-Transfer Mode into their Isolated Margin accounts. If users hold outstanding liabilities of said tokens, these users may only manually transfer up to the amount of liabilities of that token into their Isolated Margin accounts, less any collateral already available,” the company explained. Additionally, Binance will delist the spot trading pairs AXL/FDUSD, C98/BTC, and ENJ/ETH on January 10 . The company periodically conducts such amendments “to protect users and maintain a high-quality trading market.” It takes several factors into consideration when removing trading pairs, including poor liquidity and trading volume. Withdrawing support from a major crypto exchange like Binance typically has a negative effect on the prices of the affected digital assets since it causes reputational damage and limited accessibility (among other setbacks). Literally, all involved cryptocurrencies in the delisting efforts have headed south in the past 24 hours, with many experiencing double-digit declines. It is worth noting that the correction of the broader digital asset market could have also contributed to their poor performance. Recall that Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $102,000 on January 7, but several hours later, it nosedived by more than seven grand. Currently, it trades at around $95,500, while Ethereum (ETH) plunged below $3,400. The crash resulted in over $700 million in liquidations, as approximately 90% of the wrecked traders had opened long positions. The Opposite Effect Besides removing certain trading pairs, Binance also often adds new ones to respond to ongoing market trends and enhance its services. The involved cryptocurrencies usually witness a substantial price resurgence following those actions . Such was the case in November last year when the company listed Cow Protocol (COW) and Cetus Protocol (CETUS). Both assets saw their valuations skyrocketing by 70% shortly after the disclosure . Several weeks ago, the meme coin launched on the BNB chain – Simon’s Cat (CAT) – also pumped significantly. This happened mere hours after Binance included it in its HODLer Airdrops Portal.

However, despite these high expectations, the price action has been disappointing. This is leading traders to explore other viable altcoins that have been delivering impressive growth. A notable choice has been DTX Exchange. This hybrid trading platform has been the fastest-growing altcoin of the year after launching a unique pre-launch sale for users to become early holders. This rival exchange token is also expected to become a considerable competitor to Binance after adding a new range of products. DTX Exchange Crosses 450,000 Holders After Staking Launch While the crypto market has been bullish at large, DTX Exchange has been the most notable performer this month. The hybrid platform has seen an unusual increase in demand after offering stocks, cryptos, and ETFs under a single platform. Initially starting the presale at $0.01, DTX tokens are currently trading at $0.14 and selling out fast. Experts have attributed this aggressive demand to perks like profit-sharing, discounted trading, and governance rights for holders. DTX Exchange has also recently rolled out an update to offer tokenized ETF trading for global users. This is a significant milestone because these assets can be traded with global assets with upto 1000x leverage without requiring any KYC. In the most recent milestone, the platform has crossed over 450,000 users in its active community. This rapid increase in wallet addresses on the platform has led DTX Exchange to become a highlighted name in the crypto world. The most recent feature addition is expected to be the staking mechanism which will allow existing holders to make passive income. BNB Price Analysis: Why Is BNB Stuck In Channel Binance is globally renowned as the biggest crypto trading exchange in the world. After crossing 250 million users on its platform, experts were predicting the exchange token BNB to hit new highs. However, the recent movement of the altcoin has disappointed holders as BNB price is stuck between $700 and $750. Experts have attributed this slowdown in price to legal troubles surrounding Binance. In the past, the platform was fined over $4 billion by the US SEC. Past CEO Changpeng Zhao was forced to leave the platform, further deteriorating confidence in BNB price to cross $1000. Despite efforts by new CEO Richard Teng, BNB is yet to cross its critical resistance. A major reason behind this slowdown has been the shift to lower-cap tokens by users. BNB has seen over 10,000% increase since its ICO. Now, traders are expecting other altcoins to repeat the same rise. Key Takeaways The slow movement of Binance coin despite the growth of the platform has been a key factor in pushing holders to add newer altcoins with better upside potential. DTX Exchange has been a popular choice for BNB holders, looking to capitalize on similar gains as the initial ICO gains. This also explains the rush of investors rushing to get in early in DTX as time is running out for the presale. To know more about DTX Exchange, checkout the website , or join the community .

As Remittix gains momentum, Chainlink (LINK) remains steady at around $20, with traders eagerly anticipating its next move in search of a bullish opportunity. Investors are shifting their gaze from established tokens like Chainlink to promising newcomers like Remittix, embracing the chance for significant profit and the thrill of innovation in the crypto space. Remittix: Revolutionizing the $180 Trillion Remittance Market Remittix (RTX) is boldly transforming the future of finance by uniting blockchain technology with traditional payment systems. With its groundbreaking PayFi protocol, the platform makes cross-border crypto transfers a breeze. Users can effortlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into their chosen fiat currency, having their funds deposited directly into bank accounts around the globe. At the heart of Remittix lies the $RTX token, a powerful catalyst for the entire ecosystem. The team has made remarkable strides to build trust by locking liquidity and tokens for three years. Furthermore, $RTX has completed rigorous security audits by SolidProof and BlockSAFU, offering investors reassurance and confidence. Remittix rises above the challenges faced by platforms like Wise and Stripe by enabling quicker transactions with no hidden fees, fostering an inclusive financial system available to all. This makes the Remittix protocol a true game changer for individuals in regions where the banking system is fragile. Prioritizing its loyal community, Remittix empowers $RTX holders to stake their tokens and earn up to 8% APY, while also offering the opportunity to join the VIP Program for enhanced benefits. The VIP Program features three tiers, with Tier-3 members reaping rewards such as up to 18% APY, platinum debit cards, extra voting power, and personal account managers. The Remittix presale is gaining incredible traction, having already raised over $2 million! $RTX tokens are available at an attractive price of just $0.0193, and demand is soaring. Analysts foresee a remarkable 1,000% gain by the end of the presale and a staggering 4,000% surge following the launch. Now is the perfect moment to embark on the $RTX financial revolution. Ripple News: XRP Faces Challenges Amid Dropping Demand and Bearish Signals The latest Ripple news shows that XRP has gained $19 billion in market cap, but its growth seems stunted as demand dwindles. Santiment reports a 32% drop in new addresses trading XRP over the past week. Despite this, the XRP price has surged 16%, climbing to $2.42 and breaking above a descending parallel channel. However, the lack of fresh interest could make it hard to sustain these gains. If selling pressure rises, the XRP price could turn bearish, potentially sliding back to support at $1.88. Adding to the concern, XRP’s Network Realized Profit/Loss metric has dropped 99% since January 1, signaling weaker profitability. Conversely, a surge in buying could push the XRP price higher, possibly reclaiming its multi-year high of $2.90. Amid this uncertainty, XRP whales are turning to the Remittix presale for more profitable opportunities. Chainlink’s Strategic Partnerships and Whale Activity Signal a Strong Recovery Chainlink’s recovery is powered by innovation and high-profile collaborations. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial recently partnered with Chainlink for Oracle services and purchased $2 million worth of LINK tokens. These deals showcase the project’s growing influence across crypto and traditional finance. Since 2022, Chainlink’s network has handled over $18.2 trillion in settlements, highlighting its essential role in the DeFi ecosystem. Key partnerships with financial giants like Vontobel and UBS further solidify its credibility in the mainstream market. On January 6, on-chain data revealed a significant whale move, where a trader spent $1.86 million on 77,127 Chainlink tokens at an average price of $24. The purchase with 506 stETH left the whale holding over $200,000 in stETH and ETH, signaling a calculated investment in Chainlink’s potential. Despite falling from $30 to $20, Chainlink has held strong at this support. Whale activity suggests buyers could soon drive the price back to $30 or higher. Remittix: A Top Presale Token with Massive Potential Remittix is gaining momentum, with analysts envisioning it could surpass XRP and Chainlink by 2025. The token recently soared to a new high of $0.0193 during its presale. With ambitious projections of reaching $1 by 2025, Remittix shines as an incredible low-cost investment opportunity for those seeking substantial returns.

True to the cryptosphere’s dynamic nature, altcoins are following Bitcoin’s surge, with RCO Finance (RCOF), an emerging altcoin priced at just $0.07, gaining traction as analysts forecast a potential climb to new heights. Bitcoin’s Role in the Final Phase of the Bull Run As the cryptocurrency bull market enters its final stages, Bitcoin remains at the forefront of investor sentiment. According to CryptoQuant, the market is poised to reach its cyclical peak by Q1 or Q2 of 2025.

However, the price has since faced a significant correction, aligning with Bitcoin’s dip below $96K in a broader bearish market trend. A whale’s $20 million long position on SUI is now nearing liquidation. Investors are questioning whether Sui can recover above $5 after this week’s volatility and market sell-off. Is Sui Price Set to Cross $5 After Its ATH Milestone? SUI price recently reached a record high of $5.35 on January 6, 2025, before falling by 14.04%. At the time of writing, SUI price is trading at $4.56, reflecting an 8% decrease in the past 24 hours. The token has shown strength by breaking through the $4.80 barrier, setting a firm support level that could drive further momentum. If SUI breaks past the $5 resistance, it may open the door to testing $5.35 again and possibly climbing toward $6. However, ongoing bearish activity could lead the price to retest the $4.50 support or even dip to $4 if market pressures persist. The crypto market correction impacting SUI comes alongside Bitcoin’s decline below $96,000, creating a cautious environment. The next steps for SUI will depend on its ability to sustain upward movement and overcome key resistance levels. A $20M SUI Position Risks Liquidation A prominent SUI whale faces the risk of liquidation as market conditions intensify. This investor reportedly deposited 4.1 million $SUI, valued at $19.3 million, along with 100,000 $sSUI, worth $470,000, into the decentralized platform Suilend. Subsequently, the whale borrowed $14.4 million in stablecoins. According to market data, the liquidation threshold for this position is set at a price drop to $4.56 per $SUI. If the price hits this level, the whale’s $20 million long position may be liquidated. A whale’s ~$20M long position on $SUI is on the verge of liquidation! This whale deposited 4.1M $SUI ($19.3M) and 100K $sSUI ($470K) into #Suilend and borrowed $14.4M in stablecoins.

38701015,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=639979,1736358745,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38701015.jpeg,Russia’s war-fueled economic boom faces a reckoning,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russia-war-fuel-economic-boom-face-reckoning/,"Russia’s economic machine, once turbocharged by war and government spending, is now running out of steam. Nearly three years after the Ukraine invasion, Moscow’s upbeat mood — with its packed restaurants and buzzing luxury stores — feels like a thin veil over a much more fragile reality. Inflation is way up, interest rates are at a shocking 21%, and cracks are forming in quite literally every sector of the economy. “A relatively good period for the Russian economy, which was based on previously accumulated resources, is over,” said Oleg Vyugin, a respected economist and former central bank official. Inflation and high rates are hitting everyone Russia’s central bank is facing an impossible task. Inflation is running at more than double the bank’s target, and its answer — hiking interest rates to levels not seen since the early days of the war — is backfiring. Businesses are groaning under the weight of record borrowing costs. Car dealerships are among the first casualties. Autostat, a research group, warns that bankruptcy waves could wipe out large parts of the industry. Farmers are next in line. With spring planting season around the corner, they’ll need loans to survive, but these rates have made borrowing a gamble. Even state-controlled giants aren’t immune. Pipeline operator Transneft and Russian Railways have slashed investment programs, citing the high cost of borrowing. Private players like steelmaker Severstal and aluminum producer Rusal are scaling back too. Rusal, one of the world’s top aluminum producers, is considering cutting its output by 10%. But the pain doesn’t stop there. For regular Russians, high prices are eating into their pockets. The middle class, buoyed by a tight labor market that pushed up wages, is managing. But for lower-income households, it’s a different story. They’re struggling to keep up as inflation erodes what little purchasing power they have. Energy exports and currency troubles add pressure Energy isn’t the safety net it used to be. Oil prices, already unpredictable, pose one of the biggest risks for 2025. If they drop some more, the government will be forced to make tough sacrifices, warned economist Sofya Donets. And Ukraine’s recent decision to end natural gas transit across its territory will chip away another 0.2% to 0.3% of GDP, according to analysts. The ruble is also under pressure. It has weakened way too much against the dollar, and cross-border payment issues stemming from U.S. sanctions are adding insult to injury. Import-reliant sectors are feeling the heat. Sanctions have made borrowing abroad a logistical nightmare. Yuan-denominated bonds, which were once a lifeline, have slowed in issuance due to payment delays and currency shortages. This leaves businesses strapped for cash and short on options. A risky economic future And now the Bank of Russia has a new monster to fight: stagflation. It’s the worst of both worlds — high inflation coupled with sluggish growth. This overheating economy, fueled by war spending in the first half of 2024, is now running headfirst into supply-side constraints, including a labor shortage. Governor Elvira Nabiullina said avoiding stagflation is critical, emphasizing that this is every central bank’s nightmare scenario. But whether Russia can dodge the bullet is another question. Domestic demand is showing early signs of slowing, which could eventually help ease inflation. But for now, prices remain painfully high. And growth forecasts are grim. The central bank predicts GDP growth could plummet to as low as 0.5% in 2025, a drop from last year’s estimated 3.5%-4%. Inflation, the bank hopes, will return to its 4% target by 2026. Meanwhile, the Economy Ministry is a little more optimistic, projecting a 2.5% growth rate for this year. President Vladimir Putin has downplayed the concerns, framing the slowdown as part of a broader plan to “stabilize” inflation. Consumer confidence remains surprisingly resilient. A December poll by the Levada Center found two-thirds of Russians optimistic about the future. While confidence has dipped from wartime peaks earlier this year, it’s still higher than in 2022. For now, high wages and a tight labor market have softened the blow for many. But as borrowing costs stay high and prices continue to climb, that optimism may not last.

The Cardano price passed the $1 mark, and Solana continues to cement its place as a leading blockchain. Amid this excitement, a fresh contender, Remittix , captures the attention of seasoned investors. Read more to see how these three projects stack up in the evolving crypto landscape. Hot New Crypto Remittix Redefines Cross-Border Transactions Remittix is a transformative hot new crypto in the global remittance market, which exceeds $150 trillion per year. The platform uses blockchain to offer ultra-fast and cost-effective international payment solutions, it cuts transaction fees and processing times significantly. Remittix currently in its presale phase at just $0.0185 per token, has already attracted over $1.8 million in investments within its first month. This momentum reflects its appeal among investors looking for real-world use cases and sustainable growth. Unlike speculative assets, Remittix focuses on providing tangible benefits to users, from individual remitters to multinational corporations. Its unique PayFi protocol integrates seamlessly with traditional banking systems, positioning it as a practical alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. This blend of innovation and utility has placed Remittix on the radar of investors seeking the next big opportunity in crypto. ADA Price Climbs past $1, What's Next? The ADA price crossed the $1 line after an impressive rally of 11.7%. For some, this is enough to draw a comparison with the market cycle of 2020-2021, where the ADA price climbed from $0.05 to an ATH of $3.09. Key developments underpin Cardano's upward movement. Over 100,000 smart contracts were deployed on its blockchain last year, with many utilizing the improved Plutus V2 framework. Additionally, founder Charles Hoskinson hinted at potential integration with BitcoinOS in 2025, a move that could inject billions in liquidity into the Cardano ecosystem. Some experts believe the ADA price could reach upwards of $3 in the next bull cycle if these initiatives bear fruit. Solana Steadies Above $200 Amid Investor Optimism Solana really stood out in the past weeks and stabilized above $200. It showcased the resilience that earned it the nickname ""Ethereum killer."" Its ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second at minimal cost has made it a favorite for developers of dApps, NFT platforms, and DeFi projects. Despite external challenges, including cofounder-related legal issues, Solana continues to attract significant attention from institutions. Five major asset managers have submitted proposals for a Solana ETF, with approval potentially coming as early as this quarter. Such developments could propel SOL beyond $300, according to market analysts. However, not all Solana enthusiasts are staying within the ecosystem. Many investors are diversifying into newer projects like Remittix, drawn by its potential for exponential growth in a trillion-dollar sector. Why Diversification Is Key in 2025 Cardano and Solana remain strong contenders in the crypto space, but Remittix sets itself apart as a hot new crypto with unmatched potential. While ADA's price reflects solid fundamentals and SOL's growth attracts institutional interest, Remittix stands out by addressing real-world financial challenges. Its innovative approach to cross-border payments positions it as the most practical and lucrative investment option in 2025. Investors seeking success in the fast-paced crypto market should prioritize Remittix while diversifying with established players like ADA and SOL. This balanced strategy could unlock significant returns this year.

Speaking at a conference in France on Wednesday, Waller said inflation was moving steadily toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target but said it was “too early to declare the end” of the central bank's easing cycle. Waller highlighted the recent improvements in inflation measures and listed the reasons for his optimistic outlook: Decline in Core Inflation: The six-month annualized core inflation rate came to 2.4% in November, improving from 2.8% in the same month of the previous year. Sticky Price Components: Waller attributed most of the remaining inflationary pressure to imputed prices, which he described as a “less reliable guide” to true supply-demand imbalances. These imputed prices account for about a third of the core price basket. Base Effects: Waller stated that annual inflation rates could fall further by March if there are no significant price increases in the coming months. Related News: Massive Cryptocurrency Whale is on the Brink: If This Altcoin Falls Any Further, It Will Be Completely Liquidated Waller said the “little progress” in 12-month inflation data had led some to call for a pause in policy adjustments. But he rejected that view, saying: “I believe inflation will continue to move towards our 2% target over the medium term and that further rate cuts would be appropriate.” Waller's speech made it clear that the Fed remains committed to its inflation target, signaling that further rate cuts are likely on the horizon. Waller emphasized the importance of maintaining the current momentum, and said he did not yet see conditions that would require an end to monetary policy easing. “My bottom line message is that I believe further rate cuts will be appropriate,” Waller said, reinforcing the central bank’s cautious but proactive approach to ensuring inflationary pressures are effectively addressed. *This is not investment advice.

This decision is an important step in the U.S. government’s ongoing efforts to seize digital assets in tax evasion cases. It also shows how cryptocurrency is becoming more connected to law enforcement. Texas Federal Court to Access $124M Stash in Cryptocurrency The court ordered Ahlgren, convicted of tax evasion in December, to reveal all private keys to his cryptocurrency holdings. These keys are essential for accessing digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies stored on blockchain networks. Ahlgren must also identify any devices that he used to keep his crypto wealth, such as hardware wallets or other storage solutions. Likewise, the government wants access to about $1 million in restitution, which he owes after his conviction. Meanwhile, the order places strict limits on Ahlgren and his associates. They cannot transfer or hide any digital assets without getting the court’s approval. However, they can use the funds for their regular living expenses, allowing Ahlgren and his associates to pay their everyday costs while the case is ongoing. Details on the Bitcoin Investors’ Sentencing Last year, the Satoshi era Bitcoin investors were sentenced to two years in prison. This sentence came after he underreported the capital gains he earned from selling $3.7 million BTC. Ahlgren bought Bitcoin in 2011 and sold his funds between 2017 and 2019 for $4.35 million. However, he misinterpreted these figures to his accountant and in his tax filings. The total tax loss, calculated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), is over $1 million. As such, he was sentenced to serve a one-year supervised release and asked to pay $1,095,031 in restitution. U.S. authorities are changing how they deal with the challenges presented by these decentralized assets in criminal cases, especially those involving tax evasion and financial crimes. The outcome of Ahlgren’s case could create important legal rules for future efforts to enforce compliance and recover digital assets linked to illegal activities. US Government to Ensure Transparency and Accountability Recall that the United States government transferred $922 million worth of seized BTC in February 2024 . This transfer came hot on the heels of Bitcoin’s price breaking the $60,000 barrier. As reported by TheCoinRise, the transferred funds were from two cryptocurrency wallets confiscated from Bitfinex in 2016. The government’s decision to transfer these wallets underscores the complexities of managing seized cryptocurrency holdings amidst a rapidly fluctuating market. Meanwhile, the rising number of crypto scams has concerned authorities. According to the FBI’s cryptocurrency fraud report , 71% of crypto scams were tied to fraudulent investment schemes, with over $3.9 billion stolen.

The CFTC filed a complaint against Gemini back in 2022, alleging the exchange made false and incomplete statements to the agency in connection with the 2017 evaluation period of a proposed Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures contract product. Gemini, which is run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, allegedly submitted false or misleading statements regarding whether the proposed Bitcoin futures contract would be susceptible to manipulation. The lawsuit was scheduled to begin on January 21st, the day after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration day. Each of the Winklevoss brothers donated $1 million worth of BTC to Trump’s campaign in June. Tyler Winklevoss also argued that the Biden-Harris Administration unleashed “four years of terror” on the crypto industry, with Cameron estimating the outgoing administration’s policies cost the sector $500 million worth of legal fees. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ordered Gemini to pay the $5 million within 10 days of the consent order, which he signed on Monday, according to the court docket . The exchange is also “permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from making false or misleading statements or omitting to state material facts to the Commission.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The partnership between the Financial Conduct Authority regulated neobank and Pyth Network ( PYTH ) means Revolut will now contribute its price data to the blockchain-based oracle network, benefiting the growing decentralized finance ecosystem. Revolut’s integration with Pyth comes as the gap between traditional finance and DeFi continues to narrow. This trend has gained traction amid the increasing adoption of blockchain technology across financial technology and related ecosystems. The Pyth Network’s oracle solution plays a key role in this evolution as the platform seeks to expand alongside industry giant Chainlink ( LINK ). Both oracle networks aim to provide web3 users and institutions with enhanced transparency and reliability. Mike Cahill, chief executive officer of Duoro Labs and a contributor to the Pyth Network, highlighted the growing recognition of digital assets and DeFi within traditional finance. “Pyth’s collaboration with Revolut is part of a larger trend we’re seeing, where traditional banking institutions, trusted by millions of customers globally, are recognizing the value of decentralized finance and digital assets. Together, we are driving the future of finance, where transparent and reliable data empowers the next generation of financial applications,” he noted.

According to Glassnode’s report, the accumulation trend score stands at 0.21 amid declining Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is currently trading at $93,814, a 3.46% drop in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin whales are selling more of their holdings Glassnode reveals that Bitcoin entered its distribution phase at the beginning of the year, suggesting that most BTC holders are now selling their assets. Source: Glassnode In an X post on January 8, Glassnode commented : The Bitcoin market has shifted into a distribution phase at the turn of the year, with Accumulation Trend Score currently at 0.21. This suggests net selling across most holder cohorts. Glassnode The Glassnode report even shows that BTC selling has been more prevalent among large whales with more than 10,000 BTC. Large whales have been consistently selling since September; however, their selling pace has picked up in January. Moreover, selling activity among BTC holders of 1000 to 10,000 BTC has intensified in the last few weeks, hinting at diminished confidence or profit-taking among major players. CryptoQuant’s data even supports the idea that multiple investors are profiting from selling Bitcoin. From its report, the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR), a vital profitability metric, has moved up to 1.04. BTC is in its cooling phase as on-chain activity dwindles Once Bitcoin crossed the $108,000 mark, its price value slumped, causing many analysts to question whether it had just concluded its bullish momentum. Some have even suggested that BTC traders could see a longer correction phase in the coming months. BTC rebounded on January 6, bringing its price to over $100,000. However, the token slid by over 3.05% today and is currently going for only $94,742. Additionally, the adjusted SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) has remained above 1 over the past week. Historically, a drop below 1 often precedes Bitcoin rebounds, as loss-driven selling typically triggers reversals in bull market conditions. Meanwhile, the cumulative network fees within a 7-day SMA are on a decline, showing reduced on-chain activity. Avocado, a crypto analyst, has suggested that the current BTC market conditions indicate a cooling-off period more than the conclusion of a bull market.

Here's Why,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/og-crypto-trader-chooses-to-go-with-remittix-over-dogecoin-or-shiba-inu-heres-why,"Meme coins are highly volatile assets that can deliver significant returns in the cryptocurrency market. An experienced crypto trader has made a bold move by selecting the relatively new PayFi token, Remittix (RMX), over the well-known meme coin heavyweights Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Analysts are strongly bullish on Remittix, suggesting it has substantial potential. While it's true that meme coins can experience rapid price surges, particularly in response to positive news about Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it’s worth examining why this seasoned trader has confidently chosen a lesser-known altcoin over the more established contenders. The decision signals a clear belief in Remittix’s future potential. OG crypto trader goes all in on Remittix The buzz around Remittix has caught the attention of some of the most seasoned crypto trader experts, with one OG going all in on this PayFi token. But what makes Remittix stand out in the crowded crypto arena? This revolutionary PayFi protocol bridges the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat systems, offering seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion. The platform allows users to send crypto directly to global bank accounts for over 30 fiat currencies. With zero FX fees, flat transaction costs, and super quick settlements, Remittix utilizes blockchain and his set to completely disrupt the massive $250 trillion cross-border payment market. For any OG crypto trader, the appeal is Remittix’s ability to tap into this vast sector, positioning it as a key player in helping drive mass adoption of crypto. The presale success has been another significant factor, even though it’s still in its early stages. The RTX token has already made waves in the crypto market, raising over $2 million and selling 122.4 million tokens since its launch at just $0.015. With analysts predicting impressive growth, seasoned crypto investors are shifting their focus away from popular meme coins and zeroing in on Remittix, a potential ten-bagger that promises to deliver extraordinary returns. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to be part of something transformative! Can Dogecoin maintain growth as the market demands utility? Dogecoin has long been the token choice of many crypto traders, but for some reason, it lags in this bull market. The original meme coin, Dogecoin, continues to capture attention, but with a lack of utility, there are questions about its long-term viability. Despite its exponential rise in previous bull markets, the Dogecoin Foundation is working on enhancing its ecosystem with payment solutions as it aims to position Dogecoin as more than just a speculative asset. Shiba Inu news sparks optimism as meme coin shifts towards utility There has been a lot of positive Shiba Inu news of late, as this once useless meme coin makes strides toward greater utility. Recent updates, including a Layer-2 scaling solution, which focuses on dApps and lower transaction fees, are both positive, but again, the market looks to be ignoring them. This shift towards utility aligns Shiba Inu with a maturing market that’s now demanding real-world applications. With these developments and potentially more positive Shiba Inu news, SHIB could become more than just a speculative token. Conclusion When an experienced crypto trader embraces a brand new altcoin over traditional meme coins, it’s a signal to pay attention. Dogecoin will always guide the market, and with exciting news surrounding Shiba Inu, interest is bound to follow. Yet, as true insiders know, it’s the latest cryptocurrencies that often deliver the greatest rewards. With Remittix set to disrupt the banking and remittance industries, this Payfi token may just ignite the bull market of 2025.

To read full editions, subscribe . Today, Starknet unveiled its dedicated rollup chain tech stack, SN Stack. The project was first teased in a July 2023 blog post. The SN Stack offers developers the ability to build validity rollup chains with customized parameters like block times and sizes, using proven components of Starknet such as Starknet OS, CairoVM or the Blockifier execution engine. Developers can opt to use Madara, an open source and modular framework to quickly develop appchains, or Dojo, a framework more suited to building onchain gaming apps. Starknet appchains will also be able to leverage the StarkWare sequencer infrastructure which in future will be open source. “From now, projects will be able to build appchains using the gold-standard ZK-STARK cryptography with the ease and low-cost that has only been possible with optimistic rollups,” said StarkWare co-founder and CEO Eli Ben-Sasson. ZK-STARKs are considered to be an improved version of zk-SNARKs due to their lack of reliance on an initial trusted setup, though STARK proof sizes are larger. For cross-chain interoperability, there is a proof-based interoperability solution in the pipeline that leverages Starknet’s upcoming open-sourced prover Stwo (Stark Two), a Starknet spokesperson told Blockworks. Paradex , a perpetuals exchange, is the only existing rollup built on SN Stack today. A short history of rollup stacks In 2020, Ethereum embarked on a rollup-centric roadmap that sought to offload execution to L2 chains for scalability. This introduced the incentive for rollup teams to develop their own custom rollup tech stacks, attract rollup chain developers and curate a gated ecosystem. Optimism was first to the game. Optimism’s OP Stack was officially introduced in late 2022 and launched in early 2023. In 2023 followed the launches of Arbitrum’s “ Orbit ” then Zksync’s ZK Stack . Last month also saw the announcement of Commonware’s “ anti-framework ” stack by ex-Ava Labs VP of engineering Patrick O’Grady. Commonware promises an even more modular architecture and less lock-in than the aforementioned rollup stacks. Optimism’s first-mover advantage has largely paid off, as is the case with open-source tools. Based on L2Beat, OP Stack is the most widely used stack with at least 50 combined rollup and Validium chains built on its technology , including Kraken’s Ink , Coinbase’s Base and the upcoming Unichain . This network effect provides Optimism with a lucrative monetization opportunity. For instance, Optimism offers rollups the option to enter into a revenue-sharing agreement that shares 2.5% of sequencer revenues or 15% of transaction fee profits (whichever is higher). While Starknet has yet to specify a monetization model for SN Stack, the team has confirmed details will be announced in the future.

The asset’s price continued its run up to $102,760 before undergoing a healthy correction, pushing it back below $100k. As of press time, Bitcoin trades between $96k and $102k, with total trading volume hitting $6.58 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes a Breather: Gains Reduced Amid Volatility While Bitcoin’s recent price performance looks healthy, the asset’s funding rate data tells a different story. Based on Glassnode’s data, Bitcoin’s current average funding rate dropped to 0.009%, below its neutral level of 0.01%. Lower-than-usual funding rate data suggests a cautious long-term trading sentiment for investments, including Bitcoin. 📉 After peaking at 0.026% in mid-December, the weekly MA of perpetual funding rates has cooled to 0.009% – just below the neutral 0.01%: https://t.co/CORjRx0X2k 🔍 This suggests a cautious positioning, with speculators showing limited willingness to pay premiums for long… pic.twitter.com/JwSPpZRpeG — glassnode (@glassnode) January 7, 2025 A Look At Bitcoin’s Average Funding Rates The average funding rate is just one of the technical indicators used to assess the market’s sentiment on Bitcoin and other investments. A funding rate, expressed in percentage, is set by crypto exchanges for their perpetual futures contracts. If this rate is positive, long positions periodically settle short positions; when it’s negative, short positions periodically settle long positions. According to data, the funding rate’s weekly moving average dropped to 0.009%, below the neutral score of 0.10%. This week’s updated funding rate reflects a steep decline from the 0.0026% mid-December, suggesting a cautious investor sentiment for long positions. Is Bitcoin’s Price Rally Sustainable? Coinglass also shared that the assets’ Open Interest-Weighted Funding Rate increased to 0.0058% but was still below January 5th’s high of 0.0113%. Then, Coinshares also revealed that the Volume-Weighted Funding Rate increased to 0.0051%, but still way below a previous high of 0.0111%. Interestingly, the decline in funding rates indicates that most traders are cautious as Bitcoin struggles to hit and keep the $100k mark. Their reluctance to put their money on leveraged exposure means they’re not confident in Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its price surge soon.

The asset’s derivatives trading activity increased, with its daily trading volume increasing to $85 billion, or a surge of 42%. Open interest saw a modest increase of 2%, and the asset’s Long/Short ratio is set at 1.0243, which makes investors’ sentiment neutral. Also, Bitcoin’s Chande Momentum Index (CMI) increased to 58.71 during the price rally, which topped $100k, but this slowed down as the price settled below $100k.

The decision was brought to attention after an email to customers, warning about the bank’s new policy. This move follows increasing regulatory scrutiny of crypto markets in Europe, including the European Union’s push for stricter guidelines under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. However, some experts argue that this move might backfire by pushing users toward decentralized platforms, outside the control of traditional banks. Despite this shift from BiG, other major Portuguese banks, like Caixa Geral de Depósitos are reportedly still processing crypto-related transfers. This development could mean a more cautious approach from financial institutions in Portugal, despite the country’s historically crypto-friendly stance, such as exempting crypto transactions from VAT and capital gains tax. Delphi Labs co-founder José Maria Macedo wrote on social media, “One of the largest Portuguese banks BIG is now blocking transfers to crypto exchanges, citing ECB guidance about risks associated to virtual assets. Crypto is inevitable, banks are dead, and these abuses of power will only “redpill” more people into moving their wealth on-chain, This is part of a wider trend, where stricter regulations are being introduced. Portugal was once considered a crypto tax haven, with no VAT or capital gains tax on cryptocurrency. But in 2023, it introduced a 28% capital gains tax on short-term crypto holdings. While some nations, like El Salvador, have scaled back crypto adoption due to economic challenges, Portugal’s evolving stance reflects broader global concerns about the risks associated with digital currencies.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 18:05:10

SoSoValue , the leading AI-driven investment research platform, announced today that it has raised $15 million in a Series A. This comes on the back of strong growth over the last month, surpassing eight million registered users. This comes as crypto assets continue hitting higher all-time prices and overall interest in the asset class recently drove total market capitalization across all tokens to nearly $4 trillion just weeks ago. The Series A round – co-led by existing shareholder HSG and SmallSpark , with participation from Mirana Ventures and SafePal – brings the crypto startup’s valuation to approximately $200 million. Following its $4.2 million seed round in mid-2024, the total investment in the project now approaches $20 million. This latest funding round was closed at the end of December 2024 and is primarily earmarked as a reserve fund for the SSI (SoSoValue Indices) Protocol , an innovative spot crypto index protocol designed to help efficient investment in the crypto market. SoSoValue launched four SSI tokens on Base chain as beta test in late December 2024, namely – MAG7.ssi, MEME.ssi, DEFI.ssi and USSI (Delta-neutral funding-rate earning). Within two weeks, more than 10,000 unique wallet addresses have been shown to be holding SSI tokens. The SoSoValue Index Protocol is a cutting-edge spot index solution designed to make crypto investments simple and secured. It leverages on-chain smart contracts to repackage multi-chain, multi-asset portfolios into wrapped tokens that represent a basket of assets. These tokens track the price action of the underlying, effectively achieving the effects of passive index investing. The underlying spot assets are safeguarded by licensed custodian partners for security and full transparency. The SSI tokens automatically rebalance monthly. Token holders are subject to 0.01% tech service fee per 24 hours. Jiva Kwan, co-founder of SoSoValue, said, “As Charlie Munger famously said, ‘In the long run, none of us can beat the market.’ “For ordinary investors, the best approach is index investing. “We believe the best solution for everyday investors is a spot-based index that automatically rebalances – as a stress-free, market-tracking investment option. “To further democratize investing, we plan to launch an open-source index creation tool, empowering professional investors to turn their unique market insights into actionable index strategies. “This will enable anyone to issue their own indices, embodying SoSoValue’s commitment to information and asset equality.” With the SSI launch, SoSoValue follows through on its vision to make crypto investment tools and resources accessible and equitable for everyone. The SSI protocol to SoSoValue’s comprehensive data platforms is the natural evolution of a mission to attract and sustain healthy, long-term participation in the cryptocurrency market. Organic growth to more than eight million total users in one year represents a near-tripling of the user base and shows the appetite for such products. SoSoValue helps retail investors to sift through vast amounts of data to find meaningful insights – and achieves this by leveraging advanced AI algorithms that analyze data from multiple sources and present it in an intuitive dashboard. Every investor, regardless of background, has access to the same high-quality information and is given the tools to better understand it. Jessie Lo, co-founder of SoSoValue, said, “Finding reliable, relevant data has historically been a challenge in the space, as it has been fragmented across disparate platforms and providers – and we are on a mission to simplify investing in this asset class for all market participants “Our growth this past year is proof there is an appetite for actionable information and products, and we will continue to expand and bring more to our users throughout the rest of this year and beyond.” Funds will also be used to expand teams across marketing, engineering and business development – and also to bring additional products to market that are expected to be launched over the coming quarters. Development on SoSoValue began in 2023 and after the launch in 2024 is rapidly growing to become the largest professional research platform for digital assets. It was the first to highlight net-inflows and net-outflows from Bitcoin ETFs on a unified dashboard and is also the first to bring together spot indexes in token form.

Recently, Pierre, who is a crypto native, has also partnered with Binance to debunk crypto myths in a four-episode series in which he approaches topics around security, crypto applications in the real world and the benefits of Web 3.0 in an entertaining and educational way – f urther showcasing how Binance can bring fans closer to their favorite sport, offering unique content and new ways to connect. Pierre Gasly said, “Bringing together the spirit of the crypto and F1 (Formula One) community is truly electrifying, and I’m honored to bring crypto education to fans through Binance. “Our previous helmet contest for the 2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was an incredible showcase of community-focused energy and creativity. “I had the chance to meet the winner, and I’m excited to see how fans channel their inspirations for the Australian Grand Prix. “We have some exciting plans to reveal the winning design at the start of race week, so stay tuned.” Rachel Conlan, chief marketing officer at Binance, said, “Formula One fans are among the most passionate and engaged globally, and through innovation, we’re able to bring a new level of dynamism to fan engagement. “With our partnership with Pierre and BWT Alpine Formula One, we are excited to continue bringing F1 fans closer to them through our efforts, including this latest helmet contest.” Sarah Dale, global head of partnerships at Binance, said, “We’re excited to once again see the powerful connections between the worlds of crypto and F1 through this helmet contest. “Pierre embodies the perfect blend of both worlds, and as he prepares for the season-opener in Australia, fans have the chance to be part of history at the start of the 2025 race season.” This content is sponsored and should be regarded as promotional material.

Take Ethereum, for instance, which started at $0.30 during its ICO and soared to a peak of $4,891. This highlights the significant gains early investments in promising crypto projects can offer.

It’s by no means perfect or undefeatable privacy, but it is a better than naive use of the base layer blockchain itself. It’s also not perfectly balanced. The sender learns a good many details about the receiver, but the receiver learns nothing about the sender. For casual payments it is a big improvement for consumers over on-chain payments. It does have one big problem though, something not unique to Lightning, but a problem for all onion routed systems. Global Passive Adversaries. That means an actor who is able to passively monitor all the internet connections between everyone involved in a network like Lightning, or Tor. When a message crosses the network, the adversary can see a message move from one node to a second node, and also see that a message went from the second node to a third right after it received one from the first. If a global adversary exists, then while they cannot see the specific details of a message across the network, they can see where it originated from and where it arrived. That is plenty enough information to deanonymize a payment system like Lightning, where the chief matter of importance is after all who is paying who. This is the true fundamental shortcoming, Lightning can be very private for senders from their merchants, and soon with coming improvements for receivers from the person paying them, but it is very weak against a truly powerful global adversary. This can be mitigated however. Payments stand out to a global adversary because that is the majority of traffic nodes will send, and the timing relationship from A to B to C to D, etc. These heuristics can be broken by nodes sending fake traffic to each other regularly. Fake traffic could take the form of a constant barrage of fake packets, simply replacing fake ones with real messages when payments are routed. This would make it impossible to correlate anything. Other options would be to add decoy messages that continue on after the completion of a payment, or opportunistically make payments when such decoy messages reach you. Different strategies would have different degrees of success in creating privacy, but something needs to be done. Multiple improvements have been made, or are coming down the pipeline, in the form of BOLT 12 and blinded path invoices, but the larger picture is still the same as it was: totally transparent to a powerful adversary. Given the scale of importance Bitcoin has rapidly grown to, maybe it’s time to reconsider the larger picture of privacy and not just incremental local improvements. This article is a Take .

New data from market intelligence platform Coinglass shows traders saw liquidations during the last two days to the tune of $862.4 million, mostly by those betting long on Bitcoin. [ The flagship crypto asset reclaimed the $102,000 level on Monday, but has since plummeted. Bitcoin is trading for $92,721 at time of writing, down 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital – who nailed Bitcoin’s pre-halving correction last year – is warning his 528,400 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto king may correct even further before resuming its upward momentum. “Bitcoin will retrace deep enough to convince you that the bull market is over. And then it will resume its uptrend.” The analyst is also warning of market volatility for the rest of the week after BTC failed to flip a key resistance level into support. “The orange technical uptrend continues to act as a resistance, indeed facilitating the retest of the blue area. However, the retest of the blue area is currently a volatile one and with still a big part of the week to go, lots could still change here.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Lastly, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin’s bear market will begin at some point this year and stretch into most of 2026 if BTC follows the traditional halving cycle. “2025 will likely see the BTC bull market peak and the beginnings of a brand new bear market (Candle 1). The majority of the bear market will take place however in 2026 (Candle 2). The bear market would last some 365+ days and be between -65% to -80% deep.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here are the most important parts of the meeting minutes published by the FED: If the data plays out as expected, it would be appropriate to continue gradually moving toward a more neutral policy stance, participants said. Participants said the Fed is at or near a point where it is appropriate to slow the pace of easing. While participants expected inflation to continue moving toward the 2% target, the impact of possible trade and immigration policy changes suggested this process could take longer than previously expected. Some respondents said they included “temporary assumptions” about possible changes in trade and immigration policies in their forecasts. The majority of participants thought that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the policy rate by 25 basis points at the December meeting. Participants expect labor market conditions to remain strong. Some participants believed it was necessary to keep interest rates steady at the December meeting, citing the increasing risk of persistent high inflation. Combining the latest data and assumptions about possible policy changes by the new administration, Fed officials expect GDP growth to be slightly lower than the previous baseline forecast, while the unemployment rate is expected to rise “slightly.” Many respondents think caution is warranted in the “coming quarters.” Most respondents believe that interest rate decisions are a delicate balance.

Analytics Company Reveals Critical Level Where BTC Price Should Not Fall After cutting interest rates by a quarter point at its Dec. 17-18 meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said policymakers may now be “cautious” about further cuts, and noted that uncertainty about the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff, tax and other proposals has some officials approaching upcoming decisions as if they were “driving on a foggy night or entering a dark room full of furniture.” Fed member Chris Waller said in new comments today that he thinks more rate cuts will be made this year, but the timing is unclear after several months in which progress in reducing inflation “appeared to have stalled.” *This is not investment advice.

With the nearest resistance at $0.0033, a move above this level could signal a significant rally. The stochastic indicator at 72.19 suggests positive momentum, while the RSI of 49.40 indicates room for growth before reaching overbought levels. If STRUMP can surpass the second resistance at $0.0046, it might gain upwards of 100% from current levels. The recent uptick, despite being below the 10-day SMA of $0.0038, hints at a potential bullish reversal. As altcoin season approaches, STRUMP could be positioned for substantial gains. MAGA Coin Shows Potential for Significant Gains Amid Market Momentum MAGA (TRUMP) is trading between $1.92 and $4.00. The price increased by 58.83% in the last week and 45.55% over the past month. With a Relative Strength Index of 45.67, the coin shows steady momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $4.79. Breaking this could push the price toward $6.88. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $2.66 and $2.73, hinting at potential upward movement. A stochastic value of 33.28 supports a bullish outlook. If the altcoin season starts as expected, MAGA could see impressive gains. Watching the support level at $0.6211 is important. Conclusion While STRUMP and TRUMP show less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance surges at $0.175, eyeing $15, positioning as a top contender to Ripple with massive investor interest. Table of Contents A game-changing platform empowering tokenization Presale success: A testament to investor confidence Predictions of a monumental rally: Too good to miss With its outstanding price of $0.175 and expected trajectory that might lead to a parabolic surge to $15 before XRP achieves similar heights, Rexas Finance (RXS) is making waves as a strong contender to Ripple (XRP). The crypto world is very interested in this currency, as many investors consider it a rare chance for significant gains. A game-changing platform empowering tokenization Rexas Finance is unique in the crypto scene. It aims to transform the way digital tokens are produced and handled. Its main goal is to democratize actual asset (RWA) tokenization. The platform’s unprecedented simplicity allows users to tokenize many assets, including real estate, art, intellectual property, and goods. Rexas Finance is advancing the acceptance of tokenized economies and increasing asset ownership availability to a worldwide audience by bridging the gap between blockchain technology and tangible assets. This creative approach distinguishes Rexas Finance from rivals like Ripple because it provides value beyond international transactions. The platform is positioned as a major participant in the growing RWA market because it lets users tokenize and trade assets anywhere, at any moment. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Presale success: A testament to investor confidence Rexas Finance has had an outstanding presale performance. In stage 11, the coin jumped 500% from its presale price to $0.175. With over $34.97 million raised so far, widespread investor interest has driven this amazing increase. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capitalists for financing, the Rexas Finance team has prioritized public participation in its presale. This choice shows their will to establish a dispersed ecosystem motivated by community support. Rexas Finance’s presale momentum has been further enhanced by its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which has drawn a larger audience and improved its legitimacy. Market analysts estimate the token’s price to soar in the following months, with a possible 8,500% increase to $15, as it prepares for listings on three elite exchanges. In the crypto market, security and openness are essential; Rexas Finance has acted early to guarantee these. One of the top blockchain security companies, Certik, has extensively examined the platform. This audit has significantly raised investor confidence since it ensures the strength of Rexas Finance’s smart contract architecture. Certik’s support builds investor confidence and supports Rexas Finance’s standing as a trustworthy and safe project. This degree of certainty is especially crucial in a sector where security issues sometimes discourage possible players. Predictions of a monumental rally: Too good to miss Many predict that Rexas Finance will reach $15 long before XRP reaches the same mark, and market watchers are growing increasingly hopeful about its future. The coin’s strong foundations, creative use case, and outstanding presale performance help underpin this prediction. Rexas Finance is carving out its identity by tackling practical problems and providing concrete answers, rivaling Ripple. The expected 8,500% increase emphasizes Rexas Finance’s enormous expansion possibility. This coin offers investors looking for a high-reward possibility a fascinating proposition. Rexas Finance is a more interesting option for long-term investment than XRP, which is still struggling with regulatory issues and market volatility because of its defined road map and community-driven strategy. Furthermore, the scheduled listings on the main tier-one exchanges are expected to increase the token’s liquidity and market visibility. This calculated action would increase demand and help Rexas Finance maintain its leadership in the crypto market. Given such a solid basis, the $15 price objective seems reasonable; some experts think the coin might exceed this mark and provide even more profits for early adopters. Rexas Finance is a unique prospect in the crypto market thanks to its unusual mix of invention, investor confidence, and market potential. At $0.175, investors wishing to profit from its increasing trend have a reasonable starting point. With a target price of $15 and beyond, this XRP rival is ready to change the cryptocurrency scene. Rexas Finance’s capacity to enable consumers to tokenize and exchange actual assets worldwide is different from other cryptocurrencies. It is meeting a significant market need and establishing itself as a leader in the tokenizing industry by bridging the gap between blockchain technology and actual assets. Rexas Finance seems too excellent for investors looking for the next great thing in cryptocurrencies to overlook.

Prosecutors in the US criminal case against Kwon have outlined their discovery plans, including searching his email, Twitter, and electronic devices. They expect to find several terabytes of data relevant to the case, including trading records and materials from cryptocurrency exchanges. Some recordings of Kwon, made without his knowledge, may also be part of the discovery process. Do Kwon’s criminal fraud trial in the U.S. is tentatively set for next January, giving both prosecutors and his defense team enough time to review the large six-terabyte data expected during the discovery process. Judge Engelmayer highlighted the historic nature of the case and the complexity involved as prosecutors revealed 6 terabytes of data, including trading information and new evidence from four seized cell phones, one of which was obtained after Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro. Extra Time For Trial Considering all that, Judge Engelmayer made an exception to his normal scheduling proceedings to allow extra time to prepare for trial. Kwon’s defense team initially suggested a spring 2026 trial, but both sides agreed on January 2026, pending any changes. The judge noted that Kwon’s case differed from Sam Bankman-Fried’s, as Kwon had already served time in Montenegro. The trial will not be delayed further after January 2026. Upcoming Trial to Involve More Evidence Notably, the upcoming trial would involve far more evidence than what was presented during the Securities and Exchange Committee’s civil fraud trial brought against both Do Kwon and Terraform Labs. Prosecutors noted that data in that trial only amounted to about one terabyte of data, roughly one-sixth of what’s to come. Prosecutors also noted that only about two of the five fraud theories against Do Kwon were presented by the SEC in that case, during which a jury ultimately found Do Kwon and Terra liable for fraud. Do Kwon faces up to nine felony charges, including conspiracy and fraud, with a potential maximum sentence of 130 years in prison. He is currently in custody, though the exact location has not been disclosed.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 19:14:37

Bitcoin Poised for Breakout as Technical Indicators Hint at Bull Run Bitcoin is moving within a tight range just below its nearest resistance level at $103706. Although the past month saw a modest decline, the cryptocurrency has surged significantly over the last six months. Technical indicators like the RSI and Stochastic are near oversold levels, hinting at a possible upward move soon. If Bitcoin breaks above the current resistance, it could aim for the next level around $111273. The MACD suggests bearish momentum, but a shift could signal the start of a new bull run. Traders are optimistic, expecting Bitcoin to lead the way into a global crypto bull market and an exciting altcoin season ahead. Conclusion With the bull run here, BTC may face resistance and less short-term potential. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that has transformed the crypto world. Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it introduced smart contracts—self-executing agreements coded directly into the blockchain. This innovation opened the door to a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps, including finance platforms and games. To boost transaction speed and lower costs, solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon were developed. In 2022, Ethereum made a significant shift to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, becoming more energy-efficient. The upcoming sharding feature aims to make the network even faster and more affordable. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem. It's used for transactions, rewarding those who help secure the network, and serves as a tradable asset. Based on past trends and Bitcoin's halving cycles, predictions suggest ETH could reach $6,580.53 next year and have a low of $2,700.31 in 2025. Looking ahead to 2030, these forecasts point to potential growth. Compared to other digital coins, Ethereum's ongoing development and upgrades keep it at the forefront. With its strong foundation and plans for improvement, ETH appears attractive in the current market. As more people embrace blockchain technology, Ethereum's role could become even more significant. IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is a new kind of technology that lets people and businesses exchange data and value in a safe and direct way. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, IOTA is built on the Tangle, which is like a web of connections. This unique design allows for fast and secure transactions without fees. IOTA also offers tools for creating apps, smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, and digital identities. With the upcoming IOTA 2.0 upgrade in 2024, the platform aims to become fully decentralized. This could make IOTA stand out in the crowded crypto market. Compared to other coins, IOTA's focus on secure and feeless transactions makes it attractive. In today's market, where innovation is key, IOTA's technology shows promise. Its collaboration with Shimmer and support for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts could help it gain more users and developers. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is launching a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum. It aims to create a crypto-native form of money that doesn't depend on traditional banks. Imagine a digital dollar that's secure, stable, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Alongside this, Ethena introduces the 'Internet Bond', a dollar-denominated savings instrument that's available globally. This bond offers a new way to save and earn, all within the crypto ecosystem. Ethena's approach could reshape how we think about digital money. By avoiding reliance on banks, it addresses concerns about centralization and trust. In the current market, where stability is valued, Ethena's synthetic dollar might attract users seeking a reliable store of value. Compared to other stablecoins that are backed by reserves in banks, Ethena offers a decentralized alternative. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethena's timing could be just right. Its 'Internet Bond' could also provide a compelling option for savers looking for returns without traditional financial intermediaries. POPCAT (POCAT) Meet POPCAT Coin, the latest meme token inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal—one with its mouth closed and another edited to form an 'O' shape. This coin has no inherent value or financial expectations; it's all about fun and entertainment. People are jumping on board for the laughs and the shared internet culture it represents. But is POPCAT Coin attractive in the current market? Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown that internet culture can impact the crypto space. While POPCAT doesn't bring new technology to the table, its charm lies in its connection to a beloved meme. In a market where trends can shift quickly, and where community engagement matters, POPCAT might catch the eye of meme enthusiasts and crypto fans alike. Whether it becomes the next big thing or just a fleeting trend, POPCAT Coin is certainly adding some feline fun to the crypto world. Conclusion ETH, IOTA, ENA, and POPCAT are promising, but XYZVerse's unique blend of sports and memes positions it for notable growth in the crypto market.

Bearish Momentum Drives Price Toward $0.00001731,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/pepe/pepe-in-jeopardy-bearish-momentum-drives-price-toward-0-00001731/,"PEPE is under pressure as its price approaches the critical $0.00001731 level, a support zone that has repeatedly tested bulls’ resilience. The renewed bearish momentum highlights growing concerns about the token’s ability to maintain stability in the face of intensified selling activity. Recent attempts to spark a recovery have been met with resistance, leaving PEPE vulnerable to further declines if the current trajectory persists. The $0.00001731 level has emerged as a key battleground, with its ability to hold determining whether PEPE can stage a comeback or succumb to deeper corrections. A breakdown below this support could amplify negative sentiment, opening the door to additional losses and dampening market confidence. Conversely, if the bulls can defend this level, it may provide a springboard for upward momentum. Renewed Selling Pressure Challenges PEPE’s Recovery Efforts PEPE’s price trajectory has encountered renewed selling pressure, casting doubt about its ability to sustain a meaningful recovery. As the price edges closer to the critical $0.00001731 level, bearish sentiment appears to dominate the market. This level now serves as a pivotal support zone, and its breach might exacerbate the downturn, triggering more declines. Related Reading: Bulls Falter As PEPE Slide To $0.00001748: Key Support In Focus Despite recent attempts by bulls to stabilize the price, the overwhelming selling pressure has curtailed recovery efforts. Market participants are closely watching for signs of strength at this support level, as a successful defense could reignite optimism. However, failing to hold above $0.00001731 may signal a prolonged pessimistic phase, leaving PEPE vulnerable to deeper corrections in the near term. Furthermore, the current technical setup suggests the potential for additional downside movement. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are hovering near oversold territory, signaling weak bullish momentum and the possibility of continued selling pressure. Similarly, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) displays bearish crossovers, reinforcing the downward trajectory. Critical Levels To Watch: The Path Ahead For PEPE As PEPE faces renewed bearish pressure, the $0.00001731 support level has become a focal point for its price action. This level holds significant importance, as a strong defense could prompt a reversal, allowing the bulls to reclaim momentum and push the price toward the $0.00002188 resistance level. A successful rebound from $0.00001731 could open the door for more gains, signaling a potential upside recovery. Related Reading: PEPE Hits New All-Time High, Market Cap Surpasses $10 Billion Nonetheless, if the $0.00001731 support level fails to hold, PEPE could experience a more significant decline, with the next crucial support zone at $0.00001313 coming into play. A sustained breach of this level would signal weakness, possibly triggering a negative movement that drives the price down toward the $0.00001152 level. Such a move would indicate a deeper correction in the market and may suggest that the bears are firmly in control, pushing PEPE into a prolonged downward trend.

38702782,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=639839,1736364618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38702782.jpeg,Cynthia Lummis looks forward to SEC reforms with Atkins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cynthia-lummis-looks-forward-to-sec-reforms/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis is working to promote Bitcoin and improve crypto regulations. She met with SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins to discuss fixing the SEC’s rules and her plan for the U.S. to buy one million Bitcoins. Lummis wants clear rules to make the U.S. a leader in digital assets. Cynthia Lummis had a meeting with Paul Atkins, the President-elect Trump’s nominee for the SEC Chair. There, she discussed reforming the SEC rule-making process and advancing meaningful legislation on digital assets. Cynthia Lummis meets Paul Atkins Already, her Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is in consideration, and being a proponent of pro-crypto-friendly policies, these are huge steps ahead for the map of cryptocurrencies in the United States. Lummis said she believes Bitcoin will be played out in the U.S. economy. Her 2024-presented Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act would have the U.S. Treasury buy one million Bitcoins in five years and keep them safe for 20 years. It is based on the premise that Bitcoin’s intrinsic scarcity and decentralization will be the inflation hedge against the $36 trillion national debt. According to Lummis, super-charging this nation’s economic growth by infusing Bitcoin into America’s fiscal policy can make this nation a giant in the global ecosystem of digital assets. Talk with Atkins sets the tenor for regulations. Atkins has been pro-crypto pro-advocacy; viewed more than one era within the SEC’s operation, and is believed to be fighting and championing balance in in-house innovation across the markets with needed oversight. This is one of the most significant battles between the SEC and Ripple Labs regarding whether the native cryptocurrency referred to as XRP, offered by Ripple, was a security or not. Partially because it won, retail sales of XRP did not constitute a sale of a security. However, huge inconsistencies, though, came into the open during the case as to how the SEC regulates its digital assets. It further added that cryptocurrencies are something nobody controls and cannot be placed under former financial laws. So, Lummis and Atkins probably spoke of filling the gaps and creating a structure that would let innovation bloom but not strangle the market. This is the follow-up conversation of Lummis’ earlier talk with David Sacks, the administration’s “Crypto Czar.” Sacks is an ex-PayPal executive and supports Lummis’ campaign for Bitcoin integration into the US policy. The agenda of the day revolved around the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act or how Bitcoin can be used as an instrument for stabilizing the economy and paying off the national debt. Crypto-friendly policies have very much used Sacks’ presence in the administration, and what he would work on would bring much strength to Lummis’ efforts. With Atkins and Sacks on her side, Lummis’s moves may change things for America on cryptocurrency policy. Paul Atkins’ leadership to shape U.S. crypto policies The leadership Atkins brings to the SEC is very much on point, as that agency has received criticism, among other ways, through the use of heavy-handed tactics under previous Chair Gary Gensler. In a social media post, she joked about putting the SEC on an “Atkins diet,” pointing out she is looking for a leaner, more balanced framework of regulation. He invested in Bitcoin in 2013, so the management of the industry will be very cautious of him. He would focus on innovative development while, at the same time, fraud and a volatile market. The future prospects of Lummis are a two-pronged approach in fiscal policy along with regulatory reforms that would mean avenues for more incorporation of cryptocurrencies in the United States. In her Bitcoin reserve proposal, she is learning from El Salvador embracing Bitcoin as she would like the United States to lead in digital assets. Since the digital assets of the United States are growing rapidly, it demands a framework to understand its nature and potential. The advocacy through Lummis and fresh faces in the SEC can bring the much-needed integrated approach to regulate cryptocurrencies. Combining fiscal innovation and clear rules, this country will stand at the top of crypto leaders’ rank across the globe and bring it into line with the evolution of its economy and technological muscle.

With bitcoin’s price dipping significantly below $100k again, the “buy the dip” cheerleaders are out in full force. But I’m here to offer a different perspective, which is simply: Don’t buy the dip. Before I continue, let me please make it clear that nothing that I write in this Take is investment advice. Why would I say such a thing? Is it that I hate bitcoin all of a sudden? No. I have other reasons for making such a statement. The first is that I’m trying to keep you from becoming exit liquidity for people like this: Don’t worry guys. The retards are coming. pic.twitter.com/1YL8keRHYa — Breadman (@BTCBreadMan) January 8, 2025 The second is that I like to buy bitcoin when it’s truly selling at a discount, not just when it appears to be selling at one. Let me explain. Right now, bitcoin is trading about 13% off of its all-time highs. While that may be a significant discount for an asset in the world of traditional finance, it’s hardly more than a daily fluctuation in the world of bitcoin. In the four-year bitcoin cycles , bitcoin’s price tends to skyrocket during the years of and after its halving . And then the year that follows tends to be pretty terrible for bitcoin’s price. During that year, bitcoin’s price hits a low, which tends to be in the range of the prior cycle’s high. That was a bit confusing, so let me give you an example. In 2022, the last “pretty terrible” year, bitcoin's price dropped to about $15,500, which was actually about $3,500 lower than bitcoin’s top from the previous cycle — $20,000. If something comparable were to happen in 2026, we’d see bitcoin’s price at approximately $53k (23% below the previous cycle’s all-time high of $69k). Now, that would be a significant discount and a dip worth buying. I don’t share this perspective to dissuade you from continuing with something like a dollar-cost averaging bitcoin investment strategy (one of the best strategies out there for the average retail investor). Instead, I share it because if a loved one came to me and asked me if now was a good time to buy bitcoin, I’d say “not really.” I try to maximize the financial upside (in fiat terms) of investing in bitcoin as much as possible for those who ask me about investing in it — especially those who are new to it. And while I could maybe help someone trade in and out of a bitcoin position in the next year or so, I don’t like to do this, as I encourage people to buy and hold bitcoin for the long haul. But, Frank, the U.S. might announce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and other nations may follow suit! And look at all the companies buying bitcoin for their treasuries ! Yes, these things are happening, and so are things like Bhutan selling bitcoin and so have things like Germany selling bitcoin and Tesla selling bitcoin . Up until now, all bitcoin price cycles have been similar. So, while it looks like we have another year of bitcoin price upside in store for us, I think we drop far lower than this current price level when the tables turn. And that’s when I’ll be proactively buying. This article is a Take .

According to a new court memo, investigators say they will sift through massive amounts of Kwon’s personal data to gather evidence against him. “The Government anticipates that Rule 16 discovery in this matter will be voluminous, consisting of multiple terabytes of data. The discovery will include the following categories, among others: Search warrants, related affidavits, and materials seized pursuant to those warrants. Some of those warrants relate to accounts or devices used by Kwon, including his business and personal email accounts, his Twitter account, and four of his electronic devices.” Other data that prosecutors will look through include the business records of Terra employees, its partners and investors, trading records from crypto exchanges and written recorded public statements made by Kwon. Kwon, who was recently extradited to the US from Montenegro, is accused of defrauding investors, money laundering and conspiracy related to the multibillion-dollar downfall of the Terra ecosystem and its native tokens, TerraUSD and LUNA. He was initially arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 after he attempted to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates with a fake Costa Rican passport. He was held in Montenegro until the nation’s highest court ruled that he was to be extradited to the US. He is also wanted in his homeland of South Korea for similar charges.

Reflecting on his tenure, Gensler said he was proud of the SEC’s enforcement actions in the crypto space, noting their consistency over the years. Gensler highlighted the foundation laid by his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who spearheaded 80 crypto-related enforcement actions from 2017 to 2020. During Gensler’s four-year leadership, the SEC initiated approximately 100 actions, maintaining a steady approach to tackling fraud and misconduct in the rapidly evolving sector. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler says that crypto is ""rife with bad actors"" https://t.co/y7Ay3mGxJg pic.twitter.com/iFWjUuHkOl — Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) January 8, 2025 Crypto is less than 1% of U.S. financial markets, yet it’s riddled with “scams,” Gensler said. “I’ve never seen a field that is so wrapped up in sentiment and not so much about fundamentals,” Gensler said. “Of these 10,000 to 15,000 projects, many of them will not survive. They’re like venture capital investments. They’re not going to survive.” Gensler’s comments come as he prepares to step down on January 20, the day of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.

He came out forcefully against the FIT21 bill after it was passed in the House. The relationship between the crypto industry and Gensler has been contentious. The industry mostly views Gensler with skepticism and frustration. Many believe his strict enforcement approach and classifying most crypto assets as securities have stifled innovation and created legal uncertainty​. Gensler repeatedly asserted that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, urging firms to register with the SEC. Critics within the industry argue that compliance is impractical due to regulatory frameworks designed for traditional financial entities. Reflecting on his tenure, Gensler acknowledged the challenges but emphasized the SEC’s role in building on prior efforts. “I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished, but there’s still work to be done,” he said.

US authorities extradited Kwon, the disgraced co-founder of the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem, late last month. Kwon faces fraud charges related to the multibillion-dollar downfall of Terra in 2022. In a recently submitted court document , prosecutors argue that Kwon’s “constructed financial world” was propped up on “lies and manipulative and deceptive techniques used to mislead investors, users, business partners, and government regulators.” They also outline the massive scope of Kwon’s alleged fraud. “Ultimately, investors suffered over $40 billion in losses as a result of Kwon’s fraud. The victims in this case include, among others, individuals and entities in both the United States and abroad who purchased Terraform’s cryptocurrencies directly from Terraform or from third parties, including through cryptocurrency exchanges based in the United States and in other countries. While it is difficult to precisely quantify the number of Kwon’s victims in light of the sheer number of purchases and sales of Terraform’s cryptocurrencies and the manner of those transactions (with many transactions in those assets occurring on foreign exchanges and through digital asset wallet or crypto trading accounts without personal identifying information), the Government estimates that the number of victims in this case exceeds hundreds of thousands of individuals and entities, and potentially totals more than one million.” Kwon was initially arrested by authorities in Montenegro in 2023 after he was caught attempting to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a forged Costa Rican passport. After the Terra founder’s arrest, both the United States and South Korea wanted to extradite him. The highest court in Montenegro ruled in favor of the US in December.

The announcement marks Bhutan’s move to strengthen its economic resilience and innovation within the growing digital asset ecosystem. Changpeng Zhao Applauds Bhutan’s Crypto Strategic Reserve Plans Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC) in Bhutan, a Special Administration Region, has recently added Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) to its strategic reserves. The region as a result plans to develop the position of the economy by using liquid assets and assets with a high market capitalization among digital assets. In a statement, GMC said it will only invest in assets that are issued on secure blockchains and where on-chain transactions can be monitored. ”For its strategic reserves, GMC plans to only include digital assets that have a large market capitalization and are highly liquid,” the statement added. Binance Co-founder Changpeng Zhao as a result has praised Bhutan for the liberal policy of accepting many forms of cryptocurrency, which indicates the country’s willingness to try new approaches to blockchain technology. He said, “This is a strategic decision by the country to lure crypto firms, investments and innovations.” GMC’s Plans to Host a Global Meeting on Digital Assets Concurrently, GMC has also revealed its intention to conduct a high-level conference in March of 2025 to address the question of the inclusion of digital currencies in the national strategic reserves. The meeting will consist of representatives of the world’s governments and heads of major companies. GMC also intends to convene an international council on digital assets in the course of the event. Binance Co-founder Changpeng Zhao has pointed out that Bhutan’s actions could encourage other countries to explore the use of cryptocurrencies as an instrument of their economic policies. He pointed to the addition of Binance Coin to the company’s reserves as an indication of the rising popularity of BNB. The meeting, in addiiton, coincides with Bhutan’s strategy to promote itself as a front-runner in blockchain technology with GMC acting as a center for new technologies. Zhao praised the country’s vision, saying that Bhutan is “a great example of how things should be done.” Bhutan’s History with Crypto Mining and Adoption Cryptocurrency mining has been practiced in Bhutan for a long time now, with the Himalayan nation using hydroelectricity to power its clean energy mining. Druk Holding & Investments, the sovereign investment arm of the country, started mining Bitcoin in 2019 and is reported to have more than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, as per Arkham Intelligence data. Zhao consequently pointed to Bhutan’s mining background and the fact that the country already owns Bitcoin, which makes it a perfect candidate for the broader implementation of digital currency. The reserves in addition incorporate other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Binance Coin making Bhutan as one of the first countries to embrace multiple cryptocurrencies for stability. New Laws Support Crypto Growth in Gelephu Mindfulness City The Application of Laws Act 2024 has laid down a legal framework on the operations of digital asset companies in GMC. The law provides a safe and efficient framework for conducting crypto transactions, which fits the region’s strategy to grow the use of blockchain. Binance Co-founder Changpeng Zhao subsequently congratulated the authorities and stressed that such approaches contribute to increasing confidence in the market and the development of the digital asset industry. He added that such an initiative will probably draw global crypto companies to Bhutan. This move as a result shows that Bhutan is an innovative and economically stable country since it has decided to include cryptocurrencies in its strategic reserves. As Changpeng Zhao keeps on supporting such ventures, his part in the promotion of the crypto sector remains crucial in the expansion of blockchain technology across the globe.

Gensler, who will leave his post on Jan. 20, 2025, discussed the challenges and successes of his time at the helm of the SEC, particularly overseeing the $120 trillion U.S. capital market and regulating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector. Gensler, who called his role a privilege, emphasized the SEC’s mission to protect everyday investors and ensure fair and transparent markets. “What we do here is protect everyday Americans, people trying to save for a better future,” he said, highlighting initiatives such as shortening the stock market payout cycle and enforcing rules to protect personal data. During Gensler’s tenure, there has been a significant focus on cryptocurrencies, an industry he once likened to the “Wild West.” Under his leadership, the SEC has intensified its regulatory scrutiny, filing more than 100 crypto-related enforcement actions on top of the 80 cases initiated by his predecessor, Jay Clayton. Despite these efforts, Gensler noted that the industry remains rife with noncompliance and bad actors. Related News: BREAKING: FED's Highly Anticipated Critical Meeting Minutes Released - Here's All You Need to Know “Bitcoin accounts for two-thirds to 80% of the value of the crypto market, but beyond that, there are 10,000 to 15,000 projects, many of which will not survive,” he said. Gensler also noted the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, citing their limited fundamentals and vulnerability to pump-and-dump schemes. High-profile cases, such as those involving Sam Bankman-Fried and other industry figures, have resulted in billions in losses for investors. Gensler expressed pride in the SEC’s enforcement efforts, while acknowledging that “there’s still work to be done,” particularly when it comes to altcoins and brokerages. Gensler, who described how he transitioned from academia to regulatory leadership, addressed perceptions that he might be a crypto advocate because of his work at MIT. “When you’re in academia, you can study and teach about the value propositions of new technologies,” he said. “But in this job, you’re sworn to protect the investing public, and that means addressing challenges and non-compliance.” *This is not investment advice.

First appearing in GTA 3, the feature brought the series from the top-down view to 3D and kicked off a new era of action-adventure gaming, Former Rockstar Games developer Obbe Vermeij, who helped create GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA 4, has been sharing details of the series’ behind-the-scenes action. Since starting a blog in 2023, he has discussed fan theories like why GTA 3’s main character, Claude, doesn’t speak. In his newest post, Vermeij explained how the iconic cinematic camera angle was born. The feature is now a staple in every GTA title. The cinematic camera remained unchanged for Vice City. One of the coders that joined us after finishing Manhunt (Derek Ward) took over the camera and revamped the cinematic camera for SA. — Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) January 7, 2025 The GTA 3 train ride was initially usual behind the carriage view Vermeij tweeted that he considered having players skip to the next station because he found the train ride “boring.” However, the option was unworkable due to technical limitations. He instead had the idea of going down the track, switching cameras to random viewpoints along the journey. Vermeij added another team member who also got inspired and suggested applying the same concept to cars. This way, the cinematic camera was born and loved by the team, who found it unexpectedly fun. The cinematic camera remained in GTA Vice City, which is believed to be one of the best in the series, although a different Rockstar employee revamped it for GTA San Andreas. Source: escapekey111156, X One fan even pulled GTA 3’s cinematic train camera from the game files to show what the train would have looked like without Vermeij’s innovation. Vermeij replied that without the feature, the camera would have been a simple view from about behind the train carriage, “so you looked at the roof and couldn’t see the player.” Moreover, the developer also confirmed the details of a December leak that showed Rockstar’s early plans for an online mode in GTA 3. The leak contained documents about how to create characters, how to do online missions, and how players progress in this world. Vermeij said he had built a basic deathmatch mode in which players earned points by defeating each other. However, the online mode required much more extensive development.

33767162,[object Object],1736366443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Here’s Why The Shiba Inu And Dogecoin Prices Have Crashed More Than 10% Today,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-price/,"The Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices have suffered double-digit losses today, having started the week on a positive note. This price drop has occurred thanks to macroeconomic factors, which present a bearish outlook for these coins. Why The Shiba Inu And Dogecoin Prices Crashed Today CoinMarketCap data shows that the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices have crashed over 10% today. This development came following the release of the JOLTS job openings and ISM Services PMI data. The JOLTS job openings came in stronger than expected, rising to 8.09 million for November 2024. The ISM Services PMI also came in stronger than expected, rising to 54.1% in December, marking the sixth month of expansion. While these figures suggest the US economy is healthy, they present a bearish outlook for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, which is why the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices crashed. With such economic figures, the US Federal Reserve could feel less motivated to cut interest rates and instead keep them steady. The CME FedWatch data shows that the probability of the Fed keeping rates unchanged at its next FOMC meeting rose to 95.2% following the release of these economic data. The likelihood of the Fed keeping interest rates steady has sparked a bearish sentiment among investors, which led to a wave of sell-offs in the crypto market, with Shiba Inu and Dogecoin also caught in the mix. It is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin price also dropped from around $101,000 to as low as $96,000 following the release of these economic figures. As such, the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices were bound to drop, given their strong positive price correlations to the flagship crypto. These meme coins are still at risk of further sell-offs if the Bitcoin price suffers more pullbacks. Some Positives For The Meme Coins Despite the recent crash, there are still some positives for the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices. On the fundamentals side, Donald Trump’s inauguration is fast approaching, with the US president-elect set to take office on January 20. This presents a bullish outlook for the foremost meme coins, given Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Trump recently stated that the interest rates are too high amid the growing inflation. This suggests that the incoming president might pressure the Fed to cut rates, which is undoubtedly bullish for the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin prices. Meanwhile, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) will finally come to life, which is particularly bullish for Dogecoin. From a technical analysis perspective, crypto analyst Master Kenobi provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, predicting it would reach a new high once Trump takes office. The Shiba Inu price is also expected to follow suit, given the strong price correlation between these meme coins.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Shiba Inu|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-08 20:00:43

As we enter the new year, the industry highlights three projects currently making headlines: Ripple (XRP), Fantom (FTM), and this rising sensation, DTX Exchange (DTX). Over the years, Ripple and Fantom have become prominent in their respective use cases and utilities. However, DTX Exchange stands out, offering early adopters significant returns. This viral altcoin has surpassed experts’ expectations with its recent 150% surge in presale price. This article shares more details as to what sets these projects apart. Ripple (XRP): A Top Altcoin Armed with Resilience Ripple has proved resilient in the crypto market despite its ongoing regulatory battle. Its goal of making cross-border payments faster and cheaper has proved successful. As a result, the XRP price made a dramatic climb to an all-time high of $3.84. Yet, its ongoing legal hurle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This situation has slowed its momentum to the upside. But, Ripple remains unfazed and is committed to deliver more innovation. There have been rumors that the first XRP ETF would attract institutional investors seeking faster and more transparent payment systems. The Ripple (XRP) price is currently around $2.4 . If current market dynamics persist, traders could experience more selling pressure. However, given the anticipated bull cycle in 2025, this asset may soon regain its former glory. Fantom (FTM): A Top Altcoin Merging Innovation with Market Volatility Fantom (FTM) is another token that gained impressive traction in the last market bull cycle. Positioned as an efficient and scalable blockchain platform, this asset has become a favorite for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. However, the excitement surrounding the FTM price has waned in recent weeks, slipping below $0.8 . While this decline reflects broader market volatility and increased selling pressure by traders, Fantom remains a notable player that could still deliver more gains soon. Notably, crypto analysts suggest that as market conditions stabilize, traders can see FTM’s price return to its all-time high of $3.48. For now, it’s facing the challenge of defending its critical support while competing with newer entrants like DTX Exchange.
