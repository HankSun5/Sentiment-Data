Hayes began his essay by setting a vivid scene from Japan’s Hokkaido ski resorts, likening dangerous backcountry conditions caused by insufficient snow cover over sharp bamboo grass (sasa) to potential market obstacles that could cut short crypto rallies. He observes that 2025 has kicked off amid robust snowfall in Hokkaido—an apt metaphor for what he sees as a liquidity “dumping” that could propel digital asset prices upward. Nonetheless, he warns that the political and fiscal environment in the United States may introduce unexpected hazards. Why March Could Mark The Next Peak For Crypto “As we begin 2025, the question on crypto investors’ minds is whether the Trump pump can continue,” Hayes writes, referencing the initial optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s second term. While Hayes believes “the high expectations for policy action out of the Trump camp set up the market for disappointment,” he maintains that any short-term negativity could be offset by a powerful “dollar liquidity impulse.” Related Reading: Crypto Trader Nets $17 Million From AI Coins: Here’s What He’s Buying Now Hayes underscores that the Fed’s RRP has been critical for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Since the third quarter of 2022, the facility’s unwinding has correlated positively with crypto and equities prices. “Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 when the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) reached its zenith,” he explains, noting that US Treasury Secretary Janet “Bad Gurl” Yellen facilitated a shift from issuing longer-dated coupon bonds to issuing shorter-dated T-bills. This approach, he argues, effectively drained more than $2 trillion from the RRP, injecting liquidity into global markets. Now, with the RRP falling to almost zero, the Fed has “belatedly changed the policy rate of the RRP” to make it less attractive. Hayes points out that it still represents a potential $237 billion injection into markets once the remaining RRP funds move into higher-yielding Treasury bills. Meanwhile, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) removes $60 billion per month, totaling $180 billion between January and March. Netting both factors yields a $57 billion injection over the quarter. Another major focus in Hayes’s thesis is the Treasury General Account. As debt ceiling negotiations loom, the Treasury’s inability to issue new debt means it can only cover expenses by spending down the TGA—an action that releases liquidity. “Because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling, the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account, the TGA,” Hayes writes, noting that the balance stands at around $722 billion. Related Reading: This Week’s Top Crypto Catalysts: What Investors Need To Watch He estimates that without a debt ceiling resolution, the TGA could be exhausted by May or June. For crypto markets, the crux of the matter is the timescale for a deal in Congress. The essay highlights Trump’s narrow majority and the likelihood that Republicans who position themselves as fiscally conservative will not grant quick or easy consent. Democrats, Hayes adds, are unlikely to facilitate enabling more spending for a president they oppose—further fueling legislative brinkmanship. According to Hayes’s calculations, TGA drawdowns could release an additional $555 billion from January through March. If combined with the $57 billion net liquidity from the Fed’s RRP and QT adjustments, total dollar liquidity could rise by as much as $612 billion in the first quarter. Hayes zeroes in on March as the critical juncture—when this liquidity surge might begin to wane and expectations for new federal spending or pro-crypto legislation from the Trump administration may not materialize on schedule. “I believe I answered the question I posed at the outset. That is, the sasa of a letdown by team Trump on his proposed pro-crypto and pro-business legislation can be covered by an extremely positive dollar liquidity environment,” he states, before concluding that peak liquidity could subside quickly once the market anticipates the debt ceiling’s resolution and the subsequent refilling of the TGA. From a historical lens, Hayes cites Bitcoin’s price action in 2024, which peaked in mid-March around $73,000, then drifted sideways and tumbled just before the April 15 tax deadline. The reasoning, he suggests, is straightforward: as soon as TGA spending has run its course, the net positive liquidity picture reverts to neutral or negative, leaving risk assets vulnerable. While Hayes acknowledges that Chinese credit expansion, Bank of Japan interest rate policies, and the Trump administration’s potential dollar devaluation strategy against other major currencies or gold could upend his timeline, he trusts that RRP and TGA mechanics are reliable near-term gauges. Crucially, these twin sources of liquidity appear powerful enough to overshadow any disappointment about Trump’s policies until at least the end of March. “None of these major macroeconomic issues can be known a priori, but I have confidence in the math behind how the RRP and TGA balances will change over time,” he says, underscoring that the surging crypto and stock markets since late 2022 align with the massive drain in the RRP. Hayes concludes by suggesting that, historically, markets often provide significant selling opportunities in the first quarter. By springtime, investors might want to take profits and “chill on the beach” while waiting for improved liquidity conditions to re-emerge in the second half of the year. “Right on schedule, just like almost every other year, it will be time to sell in the late stages of the first quarter,” Hayes concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $101,344.

Join One of The Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today,https://thecoinrise.com/couldnt-jump-on-the-popcat-bandwagon-join-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-buy-today/,"If you’ve been anywhere near the crypto world recently, you’ve probably noticed one thing: meme coins are more than just a joke. They’re a cultural phenomenon, a chance to invest in something fun with explosive potential. Over the years, meme coins have turned everyday investors into millionaires, from Dogecoin’s viral rise to Shiba Inu’s domination of the market. And now, the buzz is all about BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new meme coin making waves with its jaw-dropping features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a referral program, and staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY. But hang on, what about POPCAT, the meme coin that went viral overnight? Let’s dive in and compare these two to see why BTFD Coin deserves the spotlight as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s Breaking All the Rules BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a full-blown ecosystem designed to reward investors from the moment they get in. The presale has been a masterclass in building FOMO, raising over $5 million so far and selling more than 63 billion coins to over 7,800 holders. With a starting price of just $0.000004, BTFD raced through its first 10 presale stages in just two weeks. Now in Stage 13, you can snag it for $0.000142, but don’t sleep on this—the final listing price is $0.0006, meaning there’s still a massive opportunity for early birds. Picture this: a Play-to-Earn game where you’re not just gaming but stacking up real-world rewards. BTFD’s Bulls Squad game brings NFTs to life with interactive gameplay that’s more than just pretty pictures. You collect, trade, and use these NFTs to earn $BTFD, making it a solid win-win for gamers and investors. Who needs regular games when you can make bank while having fun? Alright, let’s talk staking. At a staggering 90% APY, this isn’t just another staking pool. It’s a money machine. Every $1,000 staked could earn you $900 in a year, and that’s without touching the principal. Plus, the BTFD staking program is super easy to use, meaning you don’t need to be some blockchain wizard to start earning. Want to bring your friends along for the ride? With BTFD’s referral program, you can earn extra tokens for every person you convince to join. It’s like getting paid to help your buddies level up—how cool is that? Here’s where it gets juicy. Imagine you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin. That’d get you about 52,816,901 $BTFD. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash would be worth a staggering $31,690. That’s a 322% return. Tell me, where else can you get returns like that? POPCAT (POPCAT): The Viral Challenger POPCAT is another meme coin that’s been turning heads lately, but it’s playing a slightly different game. Launched with a bang thanks to its viral marketing campaigns, POPCAT has quickly captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, especially those who love its playful homage to internet culture. The coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity. POPCAT’s creators leaned into its meme-worthy origins, using the famous Popcat meme to spark curiosity. Think of it as Dogecoin’s cheeky cousin—cute, relatable, and undeniably viral. And while it’s undoubtedly fun, the question remains: Does it have the depth to go the distance? Unlike BTFD, POPCAT doesn’t offer a robust ecosystem. Sure, it’s fun to hold and watch your portfolio grow when the market gets hyped, but the lack of tangible use cases—like staking or a P2E game—makes it more of a speculative play. That said, its community is passionate, and in crypto, that can sometimes be enough. Crypto analysts are mixed on POPCAT. While some see potential for short-term gains due to its viral nature, others warn of its lack of utility and staying power. Current forecasts suggest modest growth if the hype continues, but it’s not offering the kind of returns BTFD is projected to deliver. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to jump in?

From its 90% APY staking to the Bulls Squad, P2E game, it’s building a meme coin ecosystem that delivers real value, not just laughs. Add to that its referral program and stellar presale performance, and it’s clear why BTFD is topping the charts as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. The window to get in at a discounted price is closing fast. With the presale already in Stage 13 and a listing price of $0.0006 around the corner, the time to act is now.

Ethereum price analysis suggests a potentially significant shift, as the symmetrical triangle formation on the chart may either surge to $3,980 or fall to $2,920, drawing keen interest from market watchers. In the meantime, the Dogecoin price remains near the critical $0.300 mark, leading to discussions on whether it can rebound if this level remains intact. BlockDAG (BDAG) is on an upward path with its Refer & Earn program, which rewards users with 6% to 10% USDT cashback on each transaction, with no limit to how much they can earn. BlockDAG’s impressive presale, which gathered over $176.5 million, along with its scalable rewards and potential for high returns, firmly establishes it among the best crypto to buy right now! Dogecoin Price Stable Amid Potential for Upward Movement The Dogecoin price has recently fallen by 23% over ten days but now teeters at the pivotal $0.300 support. Observers are watching to see if this marks a temporary decline or a move to lower levels. Current trading suggests an effort to maintain the $0.300 level, which could indicate an impending bullish shift if it holds. Trader Tradigrade’s insights on X point to a potential recovery for Dogecoin price, with signs of an upward trend on the horizon. If the price remains above its 20-day EMA, it could draw renewed buying interest, possibly leading to a price increase. However, a drop below $0.300 might trigger increased selling pressure, marking a critical moment for DOGE. Ethereum Price Analysis Indicates a Possible Major Shift Significant attention is on Ethereum price analysis as it currently navigates a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. Technical analyst Carl Runefelt’s recent X post suggests a likely substantial movement. Ethereum price analysis forecasts either a push to $3,980 or a decline to $2,920. The price stabilization around $3,419 shows resilience despite market fluctuations, with critical levels at $3,300 support and $3,550 resistance. The outcome of this pattern could define Ethereum’s immediate market direction, with anticipation building around these pivotal points. BlockDAG’s Cashback Rewards Through Its Refer & Earn Program BlockDAG has revamped the way users benefit with its Refer & Earn USDT system, offering immediate cashback that ranks as one of the most beneficial in the cryptocurrency sphere. Referrers get a 6% cashback on their first referral transaction, which increases to 10% for any additional purchases within the next 24 hours. Buyers also enjoy a steady 6% cashback, ensuring rewards for everyone involved. Since its launch, BlockDAG has collected over $176.5 million from its presale and has distributed over 17.7 billion coins. Currently, each BDAG is valued at $0.0248, providing an impressive 2,380% ROI to early participants. The Refer & Earn system allows unlimited referral rewards with immediate USDT payouts, making it a seamless opportunity for earning. The structure of the referral program is clear-cut, resetting daily at 00:00 UTC to ensure fairness and transparency. The time-sensitive nature of these increased cashback rates has led to strong engagement as users take advantage of the growing rewards for repeated transactions. As the 27th presale batch of BlockDAG nears a sellout, its mix of affordability, community-focused incentives, and scalable rewards mark it as a leading choice among cryptocurrency ventures. The strong metrics from BlockDAG’s performance, combined with the lucrative referral program, highlight it as one of the best cryptos to buy right now for those looking for significant rewards and cashback opportunities. The Bottom Line The crypto market wraps up the fourth quarter with cautious optimism and promising opportunities. Ethereum price analysis points to a crucial moment, with its current symmetrical triangle pattern suggesting a possible major price shift. This could lead to a significant rise to $3,980 or a fall to $2,920, shaping its short-term direction. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price stays in the spotlight, maintaining around the $0.300 support level, with ongoing debates about its potential rise or further drop. BlockDAG continues to draw interest with its interesting Refer & Earn program, known for its unmatched cashback rewards and enhancing its status as the best crypto to buy right now . As 2025 nears, BlockDAG offers numerous opportunities for traders to explore as they strategize on maximizing their returns.

If the U.S. digital assets exchange can get the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to take its appeal and agree that the SEC was wrong about its accusations that Coinbase improperly handled the trading of unregistered securities, such a decision would echo throughout the wider crypto industry. Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York decided on Tuesday to approve a request from Coinbase to ask the higher court to consider one core question in the dispute, in a process known as an interlocutory appeal. And while Coinbase is chasing that matter, the rest of the case will sit idle. Failla noted she doesn't appreciate the company's ""efforts to cast aspersions on the SEC’s approach to crypto-assets,"" but she pointed out the clash in rulings from different federal courts on similar questions and decided that ""conflicting decisions on an important legal issue necessitate the Second Circuit’s guidance."" At the heart of the legal clash between the U.S. securities regulator and the leading U.S. crypto exchange is whether certain tokens traded on the platform should be considered securities, and thus be seen as breaching the law. Coinbase has argued, among other points, that the issuers of crypto tokens traded on its secondary market don't owe anything to the buyers, so the tokens don't tick the boxes of the legal standard for what makes a security, the so-called Howey test. The judge said she's granting the April 2024 request ""because it presents a controlling question of law regarding the reach and application of Howey to crypto-assets, about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and the resolution of which would advance the ultimate termination of the SEC’s enforcement action."" ""We appreciate the court's careful consideration,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal posted on social-media site X . ""On to the Second Circuit we go.""

In the end, this and other court disputes over what constitutes a crypto security could head toward the Supreme Court but finally run into irrelevance if Congress passes a new law to define how the assets and their trading should be regulated in the U.S. That's what the industry is aiming for with its political operations and lobbying efforts, focusing on steering this year's new Congress toward more industry-friendly legislation. The SEC's leadership is also about to change hands to Republican control, which is likely to mean more openness to the crypto industry.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 22:42:00

The AI firm also reportedly closed a deal with Panasonic to integrate its artificial intelligence models into the legacy electronics maker’s products. Artificial Intelligence firms had a strong year in 2024, and they look to have picked up the pace already in 2025. AI has become an umbrella that can include so many specialties and disciplines. AI Agents now operate X (formerly Twitter) accounts, can solve complex issues, and some, like Anthropic’s Claude, can browse Chrome as a human would. Anthropic is the latest beneficiary of the FOMO as it steals some of the shine from global leaders like OpenAI and Gemini. Panasonic teams up with Anthropic to release AI-enhanced family wellness coaching app Panasonic announced its partnership with Anthropic during the CES 2025 event. The app will be called Umi, and it is designed to help family members “care, coordinate, and connect” with one another. It is also supposed to help the family as a whole set goals like spending mealtime together or being more physically active, creating routines, and managing communal tasks. The user can preset goals via the app’s natural language voice interface. Panasonic reportedly aims for the app’s target audience to be families with members of all ages. The company stated during its CES demo that Umi can easily support caregivers by keeping them informed of the habits of elderly family members. Claude will not have autonomy over recommending advice because Panasonic plans to incorporate a wide range of wellness experts to help users establish and maintain healthy habits and routines. Umi will reportedly hit US markets later this year. Panasonic will make the app available to other members of its Panasonic Well’s Partner Collective, including Aaptiv, Precision Nutrition, SleepScore Labs, Addition Wealth, BlueApron, and Calm, so it is likely users will see its AI capabilities integrated into related products as well. The electronics company also plans to integrate Claude into other customer-facing systems like customer service, sales, and marketing. Panasonic also introduced its new “Panasonic Go” initiative, which is supposed to fast-track “AI-driven innovation” within the company. The firm has what some users on X have called ambitious plans, as it expects 30% of its revenue to come from “AI-driven hardware, software, and solution businesses” by 2030. Anthropic in advanced talks to raise $2 billion According to a Tuesday WSJ report , the AI startup is in advanced talks to raise $2 billion in a deal that would raise its valuation to $60 billion. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, revealed in 2023 it had secured a $500 million investment from Alphabet, which promised to invest another $1.5 billion over time. Amazon has also now invested a total of about $8 billion into Anthropic, with the latest investment being an immediate pledge of $1.25 billion, with the remaining $2.75 billion in funding expected to arrive this year. Amazon has serious stakes in the AI firm. Anthropic named Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. It is also using AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its models. This new investment means Amazon retains its minority stake in the startup. In November 2024, Anthropic revealed its model context protocol. It is a flagship product that allows Claude to integrate with tools like Google Maps and Google Calendar, meaning it can create an app or chatbot to take care of tasks like locating lunch spots, scheduling meetings, or even making restaurant reservations, according to Mike Barret, founder and chief strategy officer at ad agency Supernatural AI. “Anthropic is finding ways to make their AI more useful,” Barret said. This development pushes the company closer to making large language models more than just information providers but also doers that can take actionable steps across platforms.

A widely followed business survey data release, meanwhile, came in stronger-than-expected, suggestive that the dominant US service sector remains in rude health. As traders upped their bets on continued US economic strength, higher inflation ahead and fewer rate cuts from the Fed, long-term US bond yields jumped, with the US 10-year hitting its highest levels since April 2024 near 4.7%. That weighed on risk assets across the board – high yields in the market’s benchmark “risk free” asset tends to weigh on assets, and the riskier these assets are viewed, the more they are likely to decline. That explains why major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , which many traders view as a risk/liquidity play, are so sensitive to macro repricing events like this. With the Ethereum price now down roughly 10% from Monday’s highs in the mid-$3,700s, traders are asking is a new price collapse is here. Will Ethereum soon dump below $3,000, threatening an end to the post-Trump election victory bull run? Will Macro Headwinds Drive Ethereum Price Under $3,000? Macro has certainly been a major headwind to the crypto market, and broader risk assets, since the Fed’s hawkish policy meeting in mid-December. The central bank is clearly now more sensitive now to data that implies stickiness in inflation and economic strength, as Tuesday’s data did. The argument for more rate cuts in 2025 is increasingly weak, and could yet weaken further if Friday’s official US jobs report for December also comes in stronger than expected. That could add to the current market headwinds, and keep major cryptocurrencies, like the Ethereum price, on the defensive. In the medium-term, its tough to argue that easing liquidity conditions will be a major tailwind for crypto in 2025. The Fed continues to shrink its balance sheet following its 2020/2021 QE splurge. And indices of US liquidity show conditions have been broadly unchanged since around mid-2022. Arthur Hayes USD Liquidity Index , which is calculated by taking the Fed’s balance sheet minus the US Treasury General Account balance at the NY Fed plus the amount of accepted reverse repo bids at the NY Fed, shows US liquidity of currently around $6 trillion, still well below its late 2021 peaks in the $7 trillion region. US economic conditions, at least how they seem right now, likely mean the Fed won’t embark on substantial easing, and liquidity will likely remain around current levels in 2025. Analysts expecting 2025 to be a repeat of the kinds of moves seen during 2020/2021’s zero interest rate/QE fueled bull run may be left disappointed. All said, should financial conditions continue to tighten (seen by a further rise in US yields), then yes, Ethereum could certainly crash back below $3,000 in the short-term. But does a lack of incoming liquidity in 2025 mean the bull market is dead? Probably not. Here’s why. Ethereum Under $3,000, Buy The Dip? If the Ethereum price was to dump below $3,000 in the short-term, this could be a great opportunity for investors to accumulate more aggressively. Yes, liquidity conditions right now aren’t likely to be a big tailwind for crypto in 2025, but that could change in the coming years. More important, however, is the upcoming pro-crypto shift in the regulatory and adoption landscape in the US this year. Simply put, the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration is set to usher in a new golden age for the US crypto industry and markets more broadly. The US might be on the cusp of the establishment of an official Bitcoin reserve , which could kickstart a global race to accumulate the asset. This would be a huge headwind to the whole market. And even if that doesn’t happen, the Trump administration is packed with pro-crypto advocates that are set to create a better environment in the US for innovation and growth. 13 days until Gary Gensler steps down. 13 days until the most pro-crypto administration in history takes office. Trump’s cabinet is set to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital of the world.' Here’s everything you need to know about it pic.twitter.com/xVJLnzOoLN — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) January 7, 2025 Most importantly, anti-crypto zealot SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to leave the agency in under two weeks, and Trump’s proposed replacement is expected to end the agency’s crusade to destroy the industry. INTEL: Gary Gensler will step down as SEC Chair in 13 days — Solid Intel (@solidintel_x) January 7, 2025 This is particularly good news for the altcoin sector, which was hit hardest by the SEC’s regulation by enforcement drive in recent years. Trump and his family are also known supporters of Ethereum, owning the crypto in substantial amounts, and even launching a token on its blockchain. So yes, liquidity might not be a major factor this year, but 2025 could be crypto’s best-ever year in terms of gaining broader adoption and acceptance. Ethereum’s position as the only major altcoin with a spot ETF in the US, BlackRock’s anointed altcoin of choice, and the still undisputed kind of DeFi sets it up for a strong year.

Tokyo-based SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Japan’s SBI Group, has announced an agreement with a community of Solana supporters on the archipelago to give away an exclusive Solana-based NFT. SBI to give away Solana NFT to wallet holders The financial giant has agreed to give an NFT “present” to users of its SBI Web3 Wallet, with the aim of promoting the growth of Solana in Japan in 2025, in a joint campaign with Solana Superteam Japan , which is supported by the Solana foundation. The campaign is currently active and lasts until January 20th. “New Year NFT Present Campaign” Source: SBI Holdings. According to SBI’s press release (translated by Google): “This NFT represents the construction of the Web3 world centered on the Solana economy with a fortress-like structure, and the first sunrise viewed from the structure represents the dawn of a new Web3.” The NFT was designed by Solana Superteam Japan. Interestingly, the design is somewhat dystopian in appearance, with what appears to be “TOKYO STUPID GAMES” written in orange on the underside of the fortress balcony. SBI’s Web3 Wallet allows users in Japan to trade NFTs using Japanese yen, opening the market even to those who are not crypto-savvy. While the news is indeed bullish for fans of SBI and Solana, there are some caveats. Anons, true NFT degens, and fans of permissionless peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in the nation can count themselves out, as SBI’s Web3 Wallet requires an SBI VC Trade account, identification documents, and a stringent KYC (know-your-customer) process. For Solana fans looking for fun, volatile speculation, or just a middle finger to everyone (including themselves?), Fartcoin might be a better option for the new year.

WEMIX token prices since 2021. (Source: CoinGecko) The employees, some of whom still work at WeMade, are seeking damages of around $11 million. The group comprises members of the Wemade Tree subsidiary, WeMade’s former blockchain arm. The firm successfully developed WEMIX, which was first listed on crypto exchanges in 2020. WeMade then merged with WeMade Tree in February 2022.

They also claimed that the company had sent an email to the staffers “clearly promising them token compensation.” But WeMade’s attorney said that the plaintiffs’ claims centered on “a verbal contract” regarding token bonuses. However, the WeMade legal team denied that any such “verbal contract was concluded.” It also claimed the firm “only provided guidance” on “basic compensation plans.” The WeMade legal team lawyers said that “at the time, there were no established industry standards” for “firms to handle accounting conducted in crypto.” The same team said that “after discussing various matters at the company,” executives “realized that [crypto bonuses] would be burdensome” because “accounting standards were so unclear.” The WeMade legal team suggested the firm still intends to launch a WEMIX token bonus program “through consultation with company employees.” However, the plaintiffs said there had been a “criminal breach of trust” on the part of the company.

It’s vital to track the current positions of Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Hedera has recently reached a peak of about $0.40 but is now adjusting. Meanwhile, Toncoin price has slid below its average after hitting $7.20, but it’s expected to recover to around $6.20. In the spotlight, BlockDAG (BDAG) has captured the community’s attention with its proactive steps, highlighted in a recent AMA. The event showcased the launch of an incubator, a substantial grants program, and a new launchpad, among other initiatives. Dive into these developments to get a full grasp of the competitive edge BlockDAG is bringing to the table. Toncoin Price Outlook: A Dip Before a Potential Rise Toncoin price has been on a rollercoaster lately, dipping below its average after a peak at $7.20, hinting at a challenging road ahead. After a decline to $4.78, Toncoin fought back, climbing over $5.00 though still under the average thresholds. A surge above these levels could signal a bullish comeback. On the flip side, a drop beneath the 50-day SMA could ramp up sell-off actions, possibly driving its value down to $3.65. Currently, Toncoin trades around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past the average lines, possibly aiming for $6.20. If it sustains above these lines on the daily chart and overcomes the $6.50 barrier, the upward trend might kick back into gear. Hedera’s Price Movement: A Leap Over $0.40 Hedera’s price has recently surged past a crucial resistance after reaching near $0.40, suggesting the start of a potential upward trajectory. However, it still seeks further confirmation. Just days ago, Hedera bounced from its foundational level, making a significant breakout. The daily chart indicates the beginning of the fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci levels marking essential supports and resistances. After rallying from the 0.382 mark at $0.24, Hedera’s price soared 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI indicating rising momentum from previously high levels, keeping an eye on the Fibonacci resistances becomes essential for anticipating its next moves. BlockDAG Ignites the Blockchain Scene with New Growth Tools BlockDAG, an emerging leader in the layer-1 blockchain arena, has captured the spotlight with its latest AMA, positioning itself as a top trending crypto. This event showcased ambitious plans to enhance its ecosystem and spur development, echoing the early expansion seen in networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is forging ahead with a new launchpad designed to foster the creation of decentralized applications and other projects on the BlockDAG network. This platform is set to catalyze a wide array of initiatives, enhancing engagement and participation across the community. In a bold move, BlockDAG, in collaboration with Hacker Earth, will organize four significant hackathons in 2025, anticipated to attract over 15,000 developers and spark hundreds of projects. Additionally, a robust $10 million grants program is slated to begin in February, offering financial support from $5,000 to $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that meet the criteria. Moreover, an ambassador program is being launched to incorporate global representatives, and a strategic partnership with an incubator will provide mentorship, resources, and guidance, all aimed at propelling promising projects to success on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG’s recent milestones underscore its trajectory of progress. Its ongoing crypto presale has amassed over $176.5 million and distributed over 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in presale batch 27, early participants have seen a staggering 2380% ROI. These initiatives underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to building a robust ecosystem and shaping its path as a prime choice heading into 2025. Wrapping Up: BlockDAG Steals the Spotlight Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to be prominent in the domain of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently surpassing $0.40 and Toncoin price stabilizing around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s strategic endeavors, like the $10 million grants program, a global incubator, and a launchpad for new projects, that are enhancing its allure. The success of the project’s crypto presale , which raised $176.5 million and delivered an impressive 2380% ROI since its inception, positions BlockDAG as an attractive proposition as we move towards 2025. For those keen on engaging with a project that combines solid growth with extensive community involvement, staying updated on these top trending cryptos and grasping the market shifts are crucial.

More than that - the same software that can win the math olympics and write novels can also control physical robots, allowing one digital persona to operate across the digital and physical worlds. So yes, robots walking around your neighborhood, or working alongside you, will have consistent opinions and actions on X/Twitter, on prediction markets, and in the real world. But there’s a major gap. How do we integrate thinking machines into human society, from schools, hospitals, factories to our homes and daily life? Most of the systems we’ve built are for other humans and make strong assumptions of having a fingerprint, parents, and a birthdate, none of which are true for thinking machines. There is also broad uncertainty about how to regulate thinking machines - do we outlaw them, pause their development, or try to limit their ability to synthesize human-intelligible emotions (as in the European Union)? Which regional laws apply to a 200B parameter LLM running on a computer in low earth orbit, that’s controlling the actions of a trading bot, or a physical robot in the New York SEC office on Pearl Street? What is needed is a global system that supports financial transactions, allows humans and computers to come together to vote and set rules, is immutable and public, and is resilient. Fortuitously, thousands of innovators and developers have spent the last 16 years building exactly that - a parallel framework for decentralized governance and finance. From the very beginning, the point was to support “non-geographic communities experimenting with new economic paradigms” by building a system that “doesn't much care who it talks to” ( Satoshi 2/13/09 ). It’s now more clear what that meant - unlike the rest of the human-focused tech, financial, and regulatory stack, blockchains and smart contracts don’t much care if they are being used by humans or thinking machines, and gracefully accommodate all of us. For this reason, decentralized crypto networks offer the vital infrastructure that's needed to allow this burgeoning sector to flourish. The benefits will be tangible across healthcare, education and defense. Several hurdles will need to be overcome. Seamless human machine and machine machine collaboration is essential — especially in high-stakes environments such as transportation, manufacturing, and logistics. Smart contracts enable autonomous machines to discover one another, communicate securely, and form teams to complete complex tasks. Presumably, low latency data exchange (e.g. among robot taxis) will happen off chain, for example in virtual private networks, but the steps leading up to that, such as discovering humans and robots able to drive you to the airport, are well suited for decentralized markets and actions. Scaling solutions such as Optimism will be critical to accommodate these transactions and traffic. The fragmented regulations around the world is another factor slowing innovation. While some jurisdictions such as Ontario are ahead of the curve when it comes to autonomous robotics, most are not. Decentralized governance tackles this by establishing programmable, blockchain-based rule sets that deliver much-needed uniformity. Creating global standards for safety, ethics and operations is critical for ensuring that autonomous robots can be rolled out across borders at scale, without compromising safety or compliance. Decentralized autonomous organizations, otherwise known as DAOs, help accelerate research and development in robotics and AI. Traditional sources of funding are both slow and siloed, holding the industry back. Token-based models such as DeSci DAO platform remove these bottlenecks, while giving everyday investors potential incentives to get involved. Likewise, some of the developing business models for AI involve micropayments and sharing of revenue with data- or model- providers, which can be accommodated with smart contracts. Combined, these advantages will help fast-track the development of autonomous robots, with a plethora of compelling use cases. A new paradigm for robotics and thinking machines It’s easy to fear that cognition is a zero sum game, and that the broad availability of smart machines will directly compete with humans. But the reality is that there are severe shortages of well educated humans in education, healthcare, and many other sectors. Research by UNESCO recently revealed a worldwide teacher shortage that there's an ""urgent need for 44 million primary and secondary teachers worldwide by 2030"" — and that's before you consider the assistants who offer one-on-one support in classrooms and help struggling students to keep up with their peers. Autonomous robots can deliver huge advantages here, tackling significant shortages across the education sector. Imagine a child being able to learn about a complicated concept with a robot sitting next to them, to walk them through a new concept of skill — reinforcing their understanding about a subject while enhancing their social skills. We are used to humans teaching robots, and this being a one way street, but that is changing. Meanwhile, the WHO has warned of a ""health workforce crisis."" There's a total shortfall of 7.2 million professionals across 100 countries — and given the world faces an aging population, this gap is expected to accelerate to 12.9 million by 2035. The industry is facing shortages in critical areas like nursing, primary care, and allied health. This crisis is affecting the quality of care patients receive and threatening the ability of healthcare professionals to do their jobs. From monitoring patients with chronic diseases, assisting surgical procedures, to offering companionship for the elderly, autonomous robots can play a crucial role in alleviating the workloads of nurses and doctors. Without being prompted, they can monitor supplies of medicines and equipment — ordering in additional stock when required. When you factor in other use cases such as transporting medical waste, cleaning treatment rooms and assisting in surgeries, it's clear to see that robotics can drive greater productivity — and consistency — at a time when the healthcare sector needs it. Autonomous systems are already reshaping the defense sector, primarily involving swarms of drones and naval surface assets, and we're barely scratching the surface when it comes to the advantages robotics can bring — executing tasks that may be unsafe or impossible for humans. From prototypes to practical use All of this may seem abstract and straight out of the 22nd century, but Ethereum is being used today to store decision and action guardrails for AIs and robots, and as reported by Coinbase , AI agents are using crypto to transact amongst themselves. The open and auditable structure of decentralized crypto networks allows robotics developers to securely share data, models, and breakthroughs. This accelerates the transition of autonomous robots from prototypes to real-world applications, enabling their deployment in critical areas like hospitals and schools faster than ever. When you walk down the street with a humanoid robot, and people stop and ask - “Hey aren’t you scared” you can tell them - no I’m not, because the laws governing this machine’s actions are public and immutable, and then you can give them the a link to the Ethereum contract address where those rules are stored. Decentralized ledgers can also act as coordination hubs, allowing robots in heterogeneous systems to find one another and coordinate without centralized intermediaries. This is conceptually similar to the standard defence C3 technology (command, communication, and control), except that the infra is decentralized and public. Immutable records ensure that every exchange and action is traceable, creating a trusted foundation for collaboration. For robot-to-robot interactions, smart contracts streamline task allocation and resource sharing, enabling efficient coordination. In robot-to-human interactions, privacy-centric decentralized systems can secure sensitive data, such as biometric or medical information, fostering trust and accountability. This new world may invoke fear - what does this all mean for us? - but everyone reading this article has been working on making it come true for almost 2 decades now, by building the infrastructure that will handle governance, teaming, communication, and coordination of humans with thinking machines.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 23:58:02

However, while Dogecoin gains attention, RCO Finance (RCOF) , a cutting-edge DeFi project is projected to skyrocket from $0.07 to $2, an impressive 28x growth, long before Dogecoin reaches its target. Let’s explore why Dogecoin remains a strong contender, how RCO Finance’s features and market potential make it a standout, and why investors are flocking to this emerging DeFi powerhouse. Dogecoin’s Gradual Ascent to $0.7 Dogecoin has evolved into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, backed by a loyal community and prominent figures like Elon Musk. With its increasing adoption for payments and growing ecosystem, Dogecoin is slowly but steadily working its way toward a price of $0.7. Key Drivers of Dogecoin’s Price Increase Community Support The Dogecoin community remains its strongest asset, driving demand and keeping the project relevant even in bear markets. Elon Musk’s Influence Musk’s frequent mentions of Dogecoin and Tesla’s acceptance of it for certain products have boosted its credibility. Wider Adoption Businesses integrating Dogecoin as a payment option, combined with its low transaction fees, are further solidifying its position in the market. While the Dogecoin price’s journey to $0.7 is promising, its gradual growth rate leaves room for faster-moving projects like RCO Finance to take the spotlight. RCO Finance: From $0.07 to $2, The DeFi Giant in the Making Unlike the Dogecoin price, which relies heavily on hype and community momentum, RCO Finance (RCOF) is an advanced financial platform built on substance, offering revolutionary features that appeal to both novice and expert investors. AI-Powered Investment Strategies RCO Finance uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create personalized investment strategies tailored to individual user goals. This ensures optimal portfolio performance without requiring extensive market knowledge.

KYC-Free Privacy Operating within a KYC-free ecosystem, RCO Finance prioritizes user privacy while offering seamless access to decentralized financial products. Comprehensive Asset Options The platform supports over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, allowing for unparalleled portfolio diversification. High ROI Potential With its token price currently at $0.07 in presale, RCO Finance is expected to reach $2 soon after its launch on major exchanges, a growth trajectory that far outpaces Dogecoin’s projected gains. The RCOF Presale: A Golden Opportunity RCO Finance’s ongoing presale is one of the most talked about in the crypto space. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to hit $2; a remarkable 28x return, shortly after its launch. Why Invest in the Presale? Early Entry Advantage : You get to secure tokens at the lowest possible price. High Growth Potential : A projected jump to $2 ensures exponential returns. Access to Exclusive Features : Early investors gain priority access to RCO Finance’s suite of tools. As the presale progresses, the price will increase, with the next stage set at $0.2142. The time to act is now for investors seeking to maximize their returns. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price is expected to rise above $0.7, its growth trajectory remains gradual, driven by community support and mainstream adoption. On the other hand, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unparalleled ROI potential, with a clear path to $2 from its current presale price of $0.07. For investors, the choice doesn’t have to be binary. A balanced portfolio that includes both Dogecoin for steady gains and RCO Finance for exponential growth ensures exposure to the best of both worlds.

33767162,[object Object],1736294407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Flips Positive As Market Euphoria Increases, A Rally Imminent?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-index-flips-positive/,"With a significant move at the start of the week, Bitcoin has revisited the pivotal $100,000 milestone once again. This move has triggered a wave of fresh optimism among crypto enthusiasts as several key metrics have also seen positive movements alongside the recent upswing. BTC’s Market Dynamics Undergoes A Shift Bitcoin’s market dynamics are showing signs of a bullish shift as the Coinbase Premium Index metric moves in a positive direction . The recent upsurge in Bitcoin’s price appears to have triggered a notable change in the critical metric. This index, which reflects the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other crypto exchanges, often serves as an indicator of increased demand from US-based institutional investors. As the metric turns positive, this shift suggests renewed market confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects, which could catalyze its next price rally. It is important to note that the development comes after the Coinbase Premium Index witnessed a persistent decline, falling to a 12-month low. Just before the US Presidential elections, the metric fell as low as -0.200 in October last year due to increased uncertainty within the sector. Meanwhile, on the last day of 2024, the index dropped even more to about -0.237, the lowest level in the past 12 months. Furthermore, the sharp drop was fueled by heightened selling pressure in the US markets after BTC declined to the $91,500 price level. Typically, a huge decrease in the Coinbase Premium Index can lead to an unfavorable environment for Bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory. With the key metric turning positive for the first time in 2025 in tandem with a surge above $102,000, BTC’s near-term prospects look promising once again. Data from leading on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that the index has risen to nearly 0.001. Addressing the impact of US investors on the market, the platform highlighted that their actions have served as a leading indicator for the crypto market ever since the Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Taded Funds (ETFs) were approved. At 18:04 local time, Coinbase reported a single block outflow of 4,012 BTC, in addition to the Coinbase Premium Index turning positive. These data imply that buying pressure is once again becoming the dominant factor in US investors’ behavior. Upside Momentum Signals More Gains For Bitcoin BTC climbed to about $102,000 on Monday following a renewed upward momentum. This move has triggered a wave of fresh optimism among investors about its short-term and long-term potential. Examining the surge, Titan of Crypto, a market expert, noted that Bitcoin is attempting a key breakout that might fuel its uptrend.

According to the analyst, the Power Law Corridor’s blue line is being tested by BTC, which is currently acting as resistance.

In December 2024, the volume of BTC acquired through Spot Bitcoin ETFs more than tripled the amount mined during that same month, underscoring the severe imbalance between supply and demand. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Trigger Supply Shock Risks In December 2024, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased an astonishing 51,500 BTC. On the other hand, BTC miners produced only 13,850 coins during the same period, according to data from Blockchain.com. This indicates that Bitcoin ETFs alone purchased nearly four times the amount BTC miners generated and supplied to the market that month. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent According to reports, the demand for ETFs in December was nothing short of extraordinary, exceeding the available supply by approximately 272%. This massive increase in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has raised concerns about a potential BTC supply shock, with analysts suggesting that it could happen soon. Specifically, Lark Davis, a crypto analyst, announced earlier in December that “a massive supply shock is imminent.” The analyst based this alarming forecast on the significant accumulation of BTC from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Davis disclosed that at some point in December, BTC ETFs had bought 21,423 BTC; meanwhile, miners had produced only 3,150 BTC around the same time. The analyst also noted that BTC ETFs globally held approximately 1,311,579 BTC as of December 17, 2024. This amount, valued at $139 billion, accounts for 6.24% of BTC’s total supply of 19.8 million. Given this staggering figure, Davis projects that during peak bull market phases, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could hold 10-20% of BTC’s total supply, raising more concerns about a major supply shock. Concentration Of Spot BTC Inflows In December Data from Glassnode has revealed that Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $4.63 billion in December, almost doubling their 2024 monthly average of $2.77 billion. Notably, Glassnode disclosed that the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows was more concentrated during the first half of the month, while the second half saw outflows, with December 26 being the exception. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Not surprisingly, the timing for this surge and subsequent decline in Bitcoin ETF inflows aligns with BTC’s price movements in December. At the beginning of the month, BTC experienced upward momentum, skyrocketing to a new ATH above $108,000 on December 17, fueled by the bull market hype and soaring demand. However, following this peak, BTC’s price saw a sharp decline, a drop that coincided with the timing of significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, as reported by Glassnode. Despite the surge in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs in December, new data shows that investors have extended their accumulation trend into January 2025. On January 3, investors purchased over $900 million worth of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs acquired an additional 9,500 BTC, worth over $966 million at the current market price.

Although, experts caution that a drop below $400 could indicate a negative trend. Meanwhile, Atua.ai and Bitgert are joining forces to bring AI innovations to Bitgert’s decentralized system, aiming to broaden their role in the web3 ecosystem. In addition, Web3Bay is innovating in Web3 e-commerce with its platform that lets users control the sale and purchase of digital assets, cut down on transaction costs, and participate in governance through its 3BAY token, which is in its presale phase. The token’s anticipated starting price is $0.195, presenting a significant 6430% potential gain for early participants. Bittensor Continues to Trend as Prices Rise \Bittensor’s market performance shows a robust 30% increase over the past three days, driven by strong market interest. The price has crossed the 200-day EMA, with bullish signs from both candlestick formations and RSI divergence suggesting further potential increases. If Bittensor maintains its upward trajectory, the price might exceed $1000. However, given the unpredictable nature of the market, a fall below $400 could lead to a downturn. Despite the positive signs, analysts urge investors to proceed with caution. Atua.ai and Bitgert Collaborate to Boost the Web3 Ecosystem Atua.ai has partnered with Bitgert to integrate AI into Bitgert’s decentralized cryptocurrency platform, enhancing the web3 ecosystem. This partnership is expected to improve trading tools and user experiences by offering AI-driven solutions. Atua.ai users will have easier access to a diverse range of digital assets, which helps increase adoption. Furthermore, Bitgert’s extensive reach will open new opportunities for Atua.ai across various industries such as education, advertising, and entertainment, setting the stage for both entities to expand their brand influence within the web3 space. From Shopping to Governance: How Web3Bay is Shaping the Next Era of E-commerce Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by providing users with authentic ownership and governance. It operates on layer-1 blockchain technology, enabling users to manage their data and transact digital assets, actively shaping the platform’s evolution. In contrast to centralized platforms, Web3Bay empowers its users to make crucial decisions through voting with the 3BAY token, promoting a community-led development that enhances transparency and trust. A major advantage of Web3Bay is its reduced transaction fees. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform significantly lowers the costs usually associated with centralized e-commerce services. This reduction in fees facilitates a more conducive environment for small businesses, fostering a truly global marketplace where users can engage in buying and selling digital assets more affordably. Web3Bay further incentivizes its community by rewarding active users with the 3BAY token. Participation in transactions, staking, and active engagement on the platform are all ways users can earn rewards, contributing to a dedicated and vibrant community. Moreover, Web3Bay accommodates both seasoned crypto users and beginners by supporting widely-used payment methods like PayPal, merging traditional Web2 commerce dynamics with the innovative, decentralized Web3 ecosystem, thus widening its user base. Currently, the 3BAY token is in its presale phase, having already gathered over $460,000. Priced at $0.0039675 during its 3rd stage, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering an astounding potential for a 6430% return on investment for early participants. With Web3Bay poised to revolutionize practical applications, the value of the 3BAY token is expected to see significant growth, promising substantial returns for early investors. Final Thoughts The recent trends in Bittensor suggest growth potential, yet caution is advised due to the market’s instability. Meanwhile, the partnership between Atua.ai and Bitgert is set to enhance the web3 ecosystem with innovative AI applications. However, Web3Bay is making notable progress in the Web3 sector by offering a platform that is community-driven, has lower fees, and connects Web2 with Web3 commerce. With the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.0039675, it is an opportune moment to engage with the Web3Bay ecosystem and potentially benefit from substantial future gains.

The meme coin world has always been full of surprises. From Dogecoin’s rise to fame to Shiba Inu’s record-breaking journey, the crypto space has seen coins go from mere jokes to massive investment opportunities. Shiba Inu made history as one of the most recognised meme coins, backed by its strong community and ecosystem. But as the crypto world evolves, new players like BTFD Coin ($BTFD) are emerging with innovative features that could make them the best new meme coins to join this week. BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s shaping the future of the space with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking programme, and a strong community known as the Bulls Squad. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin might be your next big opportunity and how it stands out in a market once dominated by Shiba Inu. BTFD Coin: Combining Innovation and Community Power BTFD Coin is creating buzz not only because of its $5 million presale milestone but also for its groundbreaking Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that launched on January 1, 2025. This P2E game is a central piece of its ecosystem, offering players the chance to earn $BTFD tokens by completing challenges, competing on leaderboards, and unlocking rewards. It’s more than a game—it’s a platform where investment and entertainment merge seamlessly. The 90% APY staking programme is another major highlight, giving investors an unmatched opportunity for passive income. For instance, if you invest $12,000 during Stage 13 at $0.000142 per token, you’ll secure approximately 84,507,042 $BTFD tokens. By staking these tokens for a year, you could earn an additional 76,056,337 tokens. If BTFD reaches its projected listing price of $0.0006, the total value of your investment could soar to $96,339. Beyond these features, the Bulls Squad—a growing community of over 7,800 holders—is the backbone of BTFD’s success. With a vibrant network of supporters driving the project’s visibility, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Buying $BTFD is quick and easy. Start by setting up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Visit the official BTFD Coin presale page , connect your wallet, and select your investment amount. Confirm your purchase, and once the presale ends, your tokens will be available to claim. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That Made History Shiba Inu entered the crypto space in 2020 as a community-driven token with big ambitions. Over time, it has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem with features like ShibaSwap, its decentralised exchange, and strategic initiatives like token burns to manage supply. These efforts have cemented its place as a pioneer in the meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s growth is a testament to the power of community and innovation. Its ability to transform from a simple meme coin to a recognised digital currency shows the potential that lies within this space. But while Shiba Inu continues to thrive, newer coins like BTFD are stepping in with fresh ideas, signalling that the meme coin landscape is far from static. The Final Thoughts Based on market trends and the growing excitement around BTFD Coin, it’s clear that this project has all the ingredients for success. Shiba Inu might have set the stage for meme coin dominance, but BTFD Coin is ready to take things to the next level. With its P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a dedicated community, it’s shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Don’t miss out on this chance to secure your spot in one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the revolution.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 00:22:00

El Salvador’s Role in the Global Crypto Economy El Salvador has solidified its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. The country pioneered Bitcoin adoption as legal tender in 2021 and continues to grant licenses to crypto platforms. Bitfinex was the first crypto exchange to secure DASP registration in El Salvador in 2021, followed by Bitfinex Securities obtaining a Digital Assets License. Nayib Bukele’s government has been providing encouraging policies and making sound investments in the crypto industry. By the end of December 2024, the Bukele’s government had bought more than 6,000 BTC, which proves it’s focus on the cryptocurrency. Moreover, El Salvador plans to accelerate Bitcoin accumulation, adding to its current reserves valued at approximately $596 million. Despite retiring the Chivo wallet and IMF restrictions limiting Bitcoin use in public transactions, the government remains committed to advancing Bitcoin education and capital market development as part of its strategy.

38674325,https://coingape.com/?p=232447,1736296911,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Canadian Firm Sol Strategies Announces Strategic Investment In Solana,https://coingape.com/canadian-firm-sol-strategies-announces-strategic-investment-in-solana/,"Toronto-based Sol Strategies Inc. has announced a CAD $25 million investment in the Solana ecosystem to bolster its position as a leading player in blockchain staking operations and acquisitions. Sol Strategies Strategic Investment In Solana Sol Strategies, a Canadian publicly traded company, has promised CAD $25 million to the Solana ecosystem through an unsecured revolving credit facility. This financing agreement which has been made at the interest rate of 5% per annum will assist the company in the purchase of Solana tokens (SOL), an expansion of the staking services and the search for strategic acquisitions. The company said that it has in fact utilized $4m from the facility and intends to spend the balance over the next two years. In a press release made by the chief executive officer Leah Wald, the firm aims to boost the returns it offers to its shareholders and at the same advance Solana digital asset. Wald said “This new position in Solana will enable the further development of the ecosystem, and enhance our staking operations.” The credit line is being extended by company chairman and director Antanas Guoga and will be valid until January 6, 2027. Guoga was also optimistic about the capabilities of both Sol Strategies and Solana, focusing on the future of the blockchain. Pivot to Solana Following Rebranding Sol Strategies, formerly called Cypherpunk Holdings, repositioned its business in 2024 and shifted its focus to only build products within the Solana ecosystem. The rebranding was a part of the process when the company aimed to become one of the biggest Solana validators and participants of the ecosystem. During Wald’s tenure at the firm, it sold off non-strategic investments, including its equity interest in Animoca Brands that was once a major investment. Sol Strategies has been able to divert its capital and put it towards buying Solana tokens and its validator business. At the end of the year 2024, the firm had invested in more than 1.5 million SOL tokens, which was worth approximately CAD $450 million. HODL’s symbol has changed to match the company’s focus on Solana, allowing investors to indirectly invest in the blockchain. The analysts have compared this approach to that employed by the firms such as MARA and Riot Platforms where clients get exposure to Bitcoin through mining. SOL’s Growing Role in Web3 Innovation The main advantage of Solana is the high speed of transactions, the prospect of scaling and the possibility to work with DeFi and NFT. As more firms shift their focus to particular blockchain platforms, Solana has become one of the most popular destinations for businesses that want to expand within the Web3 ecosystem. Sol Strategies has already invested more than 140000 SOL tokens that are owned by the company directly, to strengthen Solana network. In this case, the company engages in validator operations to reinforce the blockchain and, at the same time, gain rewards and increase the amount of holdings. The company also detailed its intention to increase its activity in the decentralized finance and liquidity provision space. This strategic expansion is in synergy with the general market dynamics as companies with a focus on blockchain technology direct their investments to high growth platforms. Solana Price Analysis Points To Breakout Solana (SOL) is among the assets that have shown significant rebound over the past few months with the price of the asset forming a V-shaped pattern. At the time of writing, Solana price is trading at $254 with the first barrier at $254.35. According to market analysts, SOL prices could rise to $302 and further to $345.76 if the buying pressure continues. The investment from Sol Strategies comes as Solana is experiencing a surge in investor interest in the blockchain due to its use in DeFi and NFTs. Solana’s ecosystem could be further supported by the company’s CAD $25 million, which may also improve the liquidity and staking of the ecosystem. In its recent announcement, Sol Strategies is also set to gain from the price rise of Solana. The company has high expectations that the blockchain can create sustainable shareholder value owing to its potential for growth.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,200 followers on the social media platform X that FLOKI appears to have completed an ABC correction on the daily chart. Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to ignite a five-wave upside move after completing an ABC retracement. “FLOKI is another major meme looking turbo bullish in my opinion and heading to ATHs. Price action from the November highs looking like another high timeframe ABC with a fresh impulse looking underway, ATH before the end of the cycle is inevitable in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will surge close to $0.0004 by March. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.0002. The analyst is also watching the US dollar index (DXY), which traders use as a barometer for investors’ risk appetite. According to Bluntz, the DXY looks bearish after respecting a key Fibonacci resistance level and concluding an ABC upside correction. He now expects the index to drop below 100. “DXY looks topped now, hit 108 as I expected, wicked a major 0.618 level, and looks like a long slow ABC up after an impulsive move to the downside. Risk assets held up extremely well while DXY pumped which was counterintuitive. I think we start heading back below 99 in 2025.” Source: Bluntz/X A bearish DXY chart typically suggests that investors are unloading their US dollars to accumulate risk assets such as crypto and stocks. At time of writing, the DXY is hovering at 108.

Table of Contents When the crypto cop packs up From hater to believer When memes meet government Crypto and AI walk into the white house Michael Saylor’s mega Bitcoin stack SEC gets a slice of humble pie CZ vs. the meme coin craze Inverse cramer still working Peter Schiff’s bubble talk When the crypto cop packs up The first and foremost — and arguably the best crypto tweet of 2024 came from none other than Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Nov. 21, he announced his resignation via a concise thread on Twitter, stating, “On January 20, 2025, I will be stepping down as SECGov Chair.” On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as @SECGov Chair. A thread 🧵⬇️ — Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) November 21, 2024 Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair, which began in 2021, has been nothing short of polarizing for the crypto industry. Known for his no-nonsense approach, he led an aggressive regulatory crackdown, describing the sector as “rife with fraud and hucksters.” Under his leadership, the SEC launched a record-breaking 46 enforcement actions against crypto-related entities in 2023 alone, marking a sharp 53% increase compared to 2022. In his post, Gensler credited the SEC’s staff as “true public servants” and emphasized the Commission’s focus on “protecting investors” and “enforcing the law without fear or favor.” However, the crypto community viewed this announcement through a very different lens. Many perceived it as the end of what they considered an overly harsh era of regulation. Social media, particularly the sphere of crypto Twitter influencers, reacted with outright relief. Adding to the intrigue, Gensler’s resignation sets the stage for Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance, to take the helm. Atkins’ nomination by President-elect Donald Trump has fueled speculation about a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto, presenting a stark contrast to Gensler’s approach. From hater to believer The next major entry in the best crypto tweets of 2024 came from Donald J. Trump on Oct. 31, just days before the U.S. presidential elections. I would like to wish our great Bitcoiners a Happy 16th Anniversary of Satoshi’s White Paper. We will end Kamala’s war on crypto, & Bitcoin will be MADE IN THE USA! VOTE TRUMP! #Bitcoin #FreeRossDayOne — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2024 In this tweet, Trump celebrated the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) white paper, extended his best wishes to the Bitcoin community, and vowed to “end Kamala’s war on crypto” while ensuring that Bitcoin would be “Made in the USA.” Trump’s message marked a striking departure from his earlier views on crypto. During his first presidential term, he frequently dismissed crypto as speculative and unreliable, raising concerns about its use in illegal activities. By mid-2024, however, his stance had shifted dramatically. Trump’s promises go beyond rhetoric. During a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, he met with Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. The discussions reportedly included ambitious proposals, such as establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to be managed by the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund—an idea Trump had previously floated during his Nashville speech in July. Trump has also outlined plans to ensure Bitcoin mining is “Made in the USA,” with the goal of positioning the U.S. as a global hub for crypto infrastructure. He has even expressed support for controversial measures, such as pardoning figures like Ross Ulbricht. When memes meet government The next best crypto tweet came from none other than Elon Musk. On Nov. 13, Musk shared a striking graphical image of a dog with the acronym “DOGE” prominently displayed. The image header read “Department of Government Efficiency.” pic.twitter.com/4K0ruu7UMS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 13, 2024 The tweet wasn’t just a playful nod to Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the meme coin Musk has famously supported for years — it also carried a deeper connection to real-world events. President-elect Trump had recently announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative aimed at reducing bureaucratic waste and streamlining federal operations. Musk, along with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, was named as one of the leaders of this new department. The choice of acronym, DOGE, seemed to be a deliberate, Musk-like move to merge his well-documented love for Dogecoin with his new governmental role. For those who have followed Musk’s crypto journey, his association with Dogecoin comes as no surprise. He’s long been referred to as the “Dogefather,” a title earned through his relentless promotion of the DOGE. Elon Musk’s tweets about cryptocurrency have repeatedly influenced Dogecoin’s price, transforming it from a joke coin into a legitimate player in the crypto market. His history with DOGE includes everything from calling it “the people’s crypto” to suggesting it could become the currency of Mars. Crypto and AI walk into the white house The fourth entry in our top crypto tweets of 2024 features Donald J. Trump’s repost from his Truth Social account, announcing the appointment of David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David… — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 6, 2024 Trump’s announcement stated, “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas… and will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for.” This announcement makes clear how far crypto and AI have come from their early days as fringe industries met with skepticism. Today, these sectors are acknowledged as critical pillars of the future economy. With this new position, Trump continues his push to bring crypto-friendly voices into the policy-making process, signaling a clear intent to promote growth and leadership in both fields. As the founding-era COO of PayPal, Sacks was part of the legendary “PayPal Mafia,” a group of tech leaders who went on to create some of the most iconic companies of their time. Additionally, Sacks has been a prominent figure in Silicon Valley for over two decades. His crypto journey began as early as 2017, when he described Bitcoin as the cornerstone of a “decentralized web” and the “internet of money.” Michael Saylor’s mega Bitcoin stack The next entry comes from Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, a company renowned for its relentless acquisition of Bitcoin. In a Dec. 15 tweet, Saylor announced the latest milestone, stating, “MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin… As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin.” MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in 2020, MicroStrategy has steadily increased its holdings through a combination of cash flow and debt financing. With 439,000 BTC in its reserves, the firm now stands as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the fourth-largest holder overall. For perspective, the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains the largest entity, controlling over a million BTC. Following Satoshi is BlackRock’s IBIT BTC ETF, which holds 553,460 BTC. Saylor’s tweet also points to impressive returns. With a quarter-to-date yield of 46.4% and a year-to-date yield of 72.4%, MSTR has cemented itself as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. SEC gets a slice of humble pie The next crypto tweet of 2024 comes from Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple ( XRP ), following a key development in the company’s legal battle with the SEC. On Nov. 29, Garlinghouse tweeted: “The SEC asked for $2B, and the Court reduced their demand by ~94%, recognizing that they had overplayed their hand. This is a victory for Ripple, the industry, and the rule of law. The SEC’s headwinds against the whole of the XRP community are gone.” The SEC asked for $2B, and the Court reduced their demand by ~94% recognizing that they had overplayed their hand. We respect the Court’s decision and have clarity to continue growing our company. This is a victory for Ripple, the industry and the rule of law. The SEC’s… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 7, 2024 Ripple’s legal saga with the SEC began in December 2020, when the agency accused the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. The case quickly became a flashpoint for the broader crypto industry, reflecting the growing tensions between regulators and the sector. Ripple consistently argued that XRP should not be classified as a security, citing its utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. The SEC, under Gary Gensler’s leadership, pursued the case aggressively as part of a broader crackdown on the industry. In July 2023, Ripple secured an initial partial victory when a court ruled that certain XRP sales — particularly those on secondary markets — did not constitute securities transactions. However, the case was far from over. The SEC continued its push, demanding an unprecedented $2 billion in penalties from Ripple. The turning point came in August 2024, when a court drastically reduced the SEC’s demand, ordering Ripple to pay a $125 million civil penalty — just under 6% of the original amount sought. Despite this significant win for Ripple, the SEC’s subsequent appeal indicates that the legal battle may not yet be entirely resolved. CZ vs. the meme coin craze The next standout in the top crypto tweets of 2024 comes from Changpeng Zhao, or simply CZ, the founder and ex-CEO of Binance. On Nov. 26, CZ expressed his unease with the booming meme coin trend, tweeting, “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ‘a little’ weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain.” I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ""a little"" weird now. Let's build real applications using blockchain. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 26, 2024 Meme coins have taken 2024 by storm, dominating crypto conversations and becoming the hottest sector in the space. While classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) set the stage, today’s frenzy is fueled by platforms like Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL ) based ecosystem designed to make launching and trading meme coins as simple as posting a tweet. The stats back up the hype. According to Dune Analytics, meme coin trading on Pump.fun made up a jaw-dropping 62.3% of all decentralized exchange ( DEX ) activity on the Solana blockchain in November — a figure that’s been climbing steadily for months. Among the most buzzworthy tokens are Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ), Just a Chill Guy ( CHILLGUY ), and Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ). Each of these coins has tapped into quirky narratives and speculative excitement, drawing in traders from all corners of the crypto world. Inverse cramer still working The eighth noteworthy entry in the top cryptocurrency tweets of 2024 comes from Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money and a polarizing figure in the financial world. On Aug. 5, Cramer waded into the age-old debate between traditional assets and crypto, tweeting, “Remember this: gold held up a lot better than crypto…” Remember this: gold held up a lot better than crypto… — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) August 5, 2024 The post immediately sparked reactions, particularly from fans of the infamous “Inverse Cramer” phenomenon. The idea is simple: do the opposite of what Cramer advises, and you’re more likely to profit. Cramer’s August tweet proved to be another classic example. At the time, gold was trading at $2,411 per ounce, while Bitcoin sat around $54,000. Fast forward to Dec. 20, and gold has inched up to $2,606 — a respectable but modest 8% gain. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has skyrocketed to $98,000, delivering a jaw-dropping 81% return in just a few months. If you followed the Inverse Cramer playbook this year, it’s safe to say you’ve had a very profitable year. Peter Schiff’s bubble talk The final entry in our top crypto tweets of 2024 fittingly comes from Peter Schiff, Bitcoin’s most persistent critic and a vocal advocate for gold. On Dec. 16, Schiff took yet another jab at Bitcoin, tweeting, “Congratulations Bitcoiners on blowing the biggest bubble ever!” About 400 publicly traded dot-com companies went bankrupt when the bubble popped. At their peak, those 400 companies had a market cap of $1.7 trillion. The current market cap of #Bitcoin alone now exceeds $2 trillion. Congratulations Bitcoiners on blowing the biggest bubble ever! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 16, 2024 His post drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap and the $1.7 trillion valuation of dot-com companies at their peak before the infamous bubble burst. The crypto community, predictably, wasn’t about to let this slide. Jeff Park of Bitwise Investments fired back with a sarcastic reply: “Thank you for your insights, Peter. Keep up the good work!” Thank you for your insights Peter. Keep up the good work! — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) December 16, 2024 Schiff’s disdain for Bitcoin is nothing new. He’s been calling it everything from a “Ponzi scheme” to “fool’s gold” since its early days. Despite his dire warnings, Bitcoin has defied expectations, climbing to new all-time highs and achieving widespread institutional adoption. Ironically, Schiff’s relentless pessimism has made him something of an unofficial mascot for Bitcoin rallies. His critiques are often met with memes and tweets celebrating his uncanny ability to be wrong at the worst possible times. While it’s unlikely Schiff will ever change his tune, his comments have become a source of amusement for Bitcoin enthusiasts.",Feature|Changpeng Zhao|Donald Trump|Gary Gensler|Twitter|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-08 01:23:00

The recent breakout above $100K signals renewed market optimism, yet the question remains: can Bitcoin maintain its momentum? Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting a critical pattern forming in Bitcoin’s 1-hour time frame. According to Runefelt, Bitcoin is currently shaping a symmetrical triangle, a classic chart pattern that typically precedes a significant price movement. The pattern suggests that Bitcoin is coiling for a decisive breakout or breakdown, with the next few days—or even hours—potentially shaping its short-term trajectory. This pivotal moment for Bitcoin comes as the broader crypto market experiences renewed energy following a sluggish end to the previous year. Investors are optimistic yet cautious, as the technical setup could signal either a continued rally or a temporary setback. With BTC back in six-figure territory, the stage is set for a critical period that could define the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Breaks Above $100K But Faces Risks Bitcoin has surged to $102,700 with impressive strength, fueling optimism for a highly bullish year ahead. Investors are closely watching the market leader, which continues to show resilience after reclaiming the $100K mark. However, BTC is not without risks; any loss of current levels could result in a significant pullback, potentially shaking confidence in the ongoing rally. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s formation of a symmetrical triangle on the hourly timeframe. This classic chart pattern often precedes a sharp breakout or breakdown, signaling heightened market activity. Runefelt emphasized that the next move could occur as the price consolidates tightly within the triangle. Runefelt outlined key price targets for traders to watch. A close below the $100K mark would act as a bearish signal, potentially invalidating the bullish structure built over recent weeks. Conversely, a breakout above $103K would confirm bullish momentum and set the stage for a continuation of the rally.

While optimism surrounds the possibility of a sustained bull cycle, the potential for increased volatility underscores the need for caution in this pivotal period. Testing Fresh Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $101,400 after a decisive 4-hour breakout above the critical $100K mark, sparking renewed optimism among investors. This clean breakout has pushed BTC into fresh liquidity above the psychological level of $100K, a sign of strength as the market leader attempts to maintain bullish momentum. However, the battle is far from over. While Bitcoin’s price action remains promising, bulls need to push the price higher to assert full control. The next major hurdle lies at $103,600, a key resistance level that, if broken, could pave the way for a massive rally. A strong move above this mark would confirm Bitcoin’s bullish structure and likely attract more buyers, driving the price into new all-time highs.

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has rocketed, fueled by a 265% increase in large-scale trading activity and growing market interest. At the same time, the SUI price prediction for 2025 indicates a substantial growth opportunity, with projections suggesting as much as 359% gains. Leading the charge in mining innovation, BlockDAG (BDAG) has garnered widespread attention with its environmentally friendly mining solutions. Recognized as some of the most profitable crypto miners, these units have surpassed 15,200 sales. As the 2025 launch approaches, these miners are set to deliver unmatched scalability and benefits for early adopters. SHIB Price Climbs as Major Transactions Increase On Tuesday, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price saw a significant rise, spurred by a 265% boost in whale transactions and improved sentiment across the crypto market. Market experts like Ali Martinez have identified buying opportunities on SHIB’s daily chart, suggesting potential price increases to $0.000026 or $0.000029. Crypto analyst The Moon Show noted a bullish ascending triangle formation, setting a conservative target of $0.000056 in the current cycle. Accompanying this, large transactions exceeding $100,000 jumped from 118 to 180, coupled with a steady flow of 4.7 million daily transactions on Shibarium, emphasizing growing interest in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price from major players. SUI Price Forecast for 2025: Potential for Up to 359% Growth The SUI price prediction for 2025 reveals strong upward potential, with price targets ranging from $6.13 to $21.36. Analysts are forecasting an average price of $12.25 for the year, with January expected to show the most significant increase, possibly reaching a 359% rise from current levels. In the near term, SUI is expected to grow by 27.7%, aiming for a price of $5.94 by January 2025. This positive forecast is supported by a Greed Index of 73 and a 14-day RSI indicating a stable market condition, adding to the positive SUI price prediction for those looking towards long-term growth prospects. BlockDAG Miners: 15.2K Units Sold, Gearing Up for 2025 Launch BlockDAG miners are transforming the domain of cryptocurrency mining through a blend of high performance and sustainable practices. These miners are engineered to use less energy while increasing earnings, achieving a new level of efficiency with exceptional hashing power per watt. Their advanced hybrid consensus protocol enhances both scalability and security, providing a competitive advantage in the fast-changing cryptocurrency market. As the 2025 launch of BlockDAG approaches, the emphasis on environmentally friendly technology positions these miners as essential tools in modern crypto mining. The upcoming 2025 launch has propelled BlockDAG to new heights, with sales topping 15,200 miners. The X30 model stands out for its efficiency, with the capability to mine up to 600 BDAG coins daily. Situated between the smaller X10 and the more robust X100, the X30 strikes an ideal balance of performance and scalability, suiting a broad spectrum of mining operations. Its effective return on energy makes BlockDAG’s offerings some of the most profitable crypto miners on the market. The strong presale results underscore the rapid appreciation of the coin’s value, offering a unique chance for those who get involved early. With more than $176.5 million accumulated in the presale and a dramatic 2,380% increase in BDAG’s value, the excitement for BlockDAG miners is unwavering. As we move closer to the 2025 launch, miner availability is dwindling, and demand is surging. For those aiming to establish a position in the crypto market, the opportunity to act is now—before the increase in mining difficulty and the addition of BDAG to major exchanges potentially heightens the competition. Closing Insights As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price continues to rise, bolstered by increased activity from large-scale traders, it highlights the persistent popularity of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Likewise, the SUI price prediction for 2025 suggests a promising future, with the potential for substantial growth driven by market dynamics and analytical indicators. Yet, it is BlockDAG that captures the most attention with its advanced mining technology, setting new standards for profitability. Having sold over 15,200 units, BlockDAG’s miners are acclaimed as among the most profitable crypto miners currently available. With the 2025 launch on the horizon and demand increasing, securing a BlockDAG miner now might be the most prudent strategy for those looking to benefit from future developments.

DeFi developers will also be able to integrate RLUSD support into their applications for several use cases, such as lending and trading. Ripple’s press release disclosed that RLUSD stablecoin users would also extensively use Chainlink’s decentralized data feeds to monitor smart contracts. RLUSD users can connect their smart contract applications to any API through Chainlink’s ‘request and response’ model, facilitating interoperability between on-chain and off-chain systems. Chainlink will provide RLUSD with the essential infrastructure and ecosystem to power the movement of secure data and tokenized real-world assets. With Chainlink, RLUSD will tap into the $867 trillion tokenized real-world asset industry through exchanges like Uphold, Bullish, Keyrock, Bitso, and Coinmena. Chainlink’s infrastructure has reportedly enabled over $18 trillion in transaction value so far. Ripple’s RLUSD uses Chainlink to provide fair market asset prices . @Ripple x @Chainlink : $RLUSD has adopted the Chainlink standard for verifiable data to fuel DeFi adoption with real-time, secure pricing data. The future of stablecoins is here: https://t.co/mq3cThLGQJ pic.twitter.com/993Ac0o282 — Ripple (@Ripple) January 7, 2025 Ripple chose Chainlink Price Feeds after reviewing several Oracle solutions because it provided opportunities for RLUSD-supporting DeFi applications to access fresh asset prices. The data will be supplied directly on-chain via a reliable tamper-proof system. According to Ripple, the fair market asset prices will reflect a volume-weighted average from off-chain and on-chain trading environments. The decentralized Oracle network infrastructure will fetch, aggregate, and deliver financial market data onto the Ethereum blockchain. Ripple claimed that Chainlink Price Feeds sourced high-quality data from premium data aggregators. The data aggregated from hundreds of exchanges is weighted by volume and cleaned of ‘wash trading.’ According to Ripple, Chainlink’s data was, therefore, inherently resistant to inaccuracies and manipulation of any single or set of exchanges. “As RLUSD scales across DeFi ecosystems, reliable and transparent pricing is essential to maintaining stability and building trust in its utility within decentralized markets.” -Jack McDonald, SVP, Stablecoin at Ripple McDonald said Ripple was bringing trusted data on-chain to further strengthen Ripple’s stablecoin utility across institutional and DApps by leveraging the Chainlink standard. Eid echoed McDonald’s sentiments, saying that having access to critical on-chain data would accelerate the adoption process for the RLUSD stablecoin. Chainlink provides secure node operators in a decentralized network Chainlink Price Feeds node operators were secured by independent, security-reviewed, and ‘Sybil-resistant’ oracle nodes run by blockchain DevOps teams, traditional enterprises, and data providers. Ripple said the Chainlink nodes remained reliable even during infrastructure outages or high gas prices. The Chainlink Price Feeds were also decentralized at the data source, Oracle node, and Oracle network levels. They generated robust protections against downtime and manipulation by the Oracle network or data provider. Chainlink provided a strong reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allowed users to independently verify node operators’ historical and real-time performance. Ripple reduced RLUSD’s on-chain, counterparty, credit, and liquidity risks by using Chainlink’s ‘Proof of Reserve’ to verify the protection of cross-chain tokenized assets against over-minting. Enabling automated risk management unlocked the programmatic utility for the RLUSD stablecoin, which was launched only last month. The token, issued on the Ethereum blockchain and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has a market cap of $72.3 million, according to Coingecko’s data . Ripple believes Chainlink will play a crucial role in ensuring that RLUD’s off-chain data is credibly neutral for all users. Ripple believes combining multiple layers of decentralization and cryptoeconomic incentives will ensure high accountability. Chainlink’s decentralized infrastructure could help prevent ‘black swan events’ like the recent NYSE glitch. Listed prices of several securities dropped by up to 99% due to the failure of NYSE’s centralized infrastructure. Chainlink’s viable and future-proof approach will use the CCIP to solve the interoperability problem. Ripple highlighted that Chainlink can also retrieve data from off-chain sources and deliver it on-chain promptly and securely. The decentralized blockchain oracle network is expanding its presence in the MENA region, creating opportunities for more RLUSD adoption.

In a surprising development, JPMorgan analysts have turned their attention to PropiChain , an emerging competitor to Dogecoin. According to their analysis, PropiChain could deliver staggering returns of 67,089%, provided its ambitious roadmap and market adoption goals come to fruition. This unexpected endorsement from a traditional banking titan signals a seismic shift in the way mainstream financial institutions perceive blockchain innovations, particularly those with real-world applications like PropiChain. Dogecoin’s Journey: A Tough Act to Follow Before diving into why JPMorgan is bullish on PropiChain, let’s reflect on the enduring appeal of Dogecoin . What began as a lighthearted meme token evolved into a cryptocurrency juggernaut, fueled by a passionate community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s widespread adoption as a payment method and its playful branding have given it a strong foothold in the crypto market. However, critics often point to its limited utility or robust infrastructure as limitations for long-term growth. This is where PropiChain excels. With a laser focus on disrupting the trillion-dollar real estate industry, PropiChain combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and fractional ownership to offer a utility that Dogecoin lacks. What is PropiChain, and Why is JPMorgan Bullish? PropiChain is a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to revolutionize real estate investments. By tokenizing physical properties, it enables investors to buy and sell fractional shares of real estate assets. This innovation solves major challenges in the traditional real estate market, such as high entry costs, lack of liquidity, and limited accessibility. Key Features Driving JPMorgan’s Optimism Fractional Ownership : PropiChain makes it possible for anyone to invest in premium real estate properties with as little as $100. AI-Powered Insights : The platform uses artificial intelligence for property valuation and market analysis, ensuring investors make informed decisions. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain integrates with the metaverse, offering virtual property tours and enabling global investors to collaborate seamlessly. Rental Income : Token holders earn proportional rental income, providing a steady stream of passive earnings. These features make PropiChain a unique player in the crypto space, blending blockchain innovation with tangible financial opportunities. JPMorgan’s Forecast: Why 67,089% Growth Is Possible According to JPMorgan analysts, PropiChain’s potential lies in its ability to tap into the $300 trillion real estate market. If the platform achieves even a fraction of this market, the returns for early investors could be astronomical. What Needs to Happen for the Prediction to Materialize Widespread Adoption : PropiChain must secure partnerships with real estate agencies, developers, and property management firms. Regulatory Clarity : Like all blockchain projects, PropiChain’s success hinges on favorable regulations, particularly in major markets like the US and EU. Presale Success : The ongoing presale is critical. With tokens currently priced at $0.011, the price will rise to $0.023 in the next stage. Early participation could yield exponential returns. Presale: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. As the presale transitions to Stage 3, the price will jump to $0.023, offering early investors a significant advantage. This price hike mirrors the early days of Dogecoin, which saw meteoric rises after initial adoption. However, PropiChain’s real-world utility positions it for sustained growth rather than short-term hype. For those considering entry, the presale represents a rare opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before the project gains mainstream traction. The endorsement from JPMorgan isn’t the only vote of confidence for PropiChain. The project has undergone a BlockAudit review , ensuring the security of its smart contracts, and is listed on CoinMarketCap , adding credibility to its offering. Conclusion While Dogecoin will always hold a special place in the crypto community, PropiChain’s real estate investments approach sets it apart as a high-growth opportunity. JPMorgan’s bullish forecast underscores its potential to deliver life-changing returns for early adopters. With the presale in full swing and the price poised to increase, there’s no better time to invest. A small investment today could yield huge gains, making PropiChain a no-brainer for smart investors.

They intend to do this by introducing a “lattice-based” hashing system that reduces the effort needed to keep track of the state of every user account. Hashing is the cryptographic process of turning data into a standardized 64-character code that can’t be reverse-engineered, while the state is a snapshot of the data stored in a blockchain. So instead of taking a snapshot of every user on the entire blockchain, and “recalculating everything, it will only update accounts that have changed,” explained research firm Republik Labs in an X post. “This is faster, simpler, and uses fewer resources, letting Solana handle millions (or billions) of accounts more easily.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|SOL|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-08 02:02:02

The meeting that happened at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort is an important beginning to the year 2025 for Ripple especially with the current changes happening in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple CEO and CLO Meeting with Donald Trump On Monday evening, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed his meeting with Donald Trump and Stuart Alderoty on the platform X (previously Twitter). “Had a great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty. ”Great start to 2025!” he posted indicating that things are looking good for Ripple. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s legal head, also commented on the event, joking about the dinner’s menu: “The beef bourguignon was really good.” The dinner at Mar-a-Lago takes place at a time when Ripple has been building up its steam with wins against the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court.In line with the optimism, crypto analysts have provided bullish signals for XRP, some of whom have forecasted a price surge to $3. John Deaton Breaks Silence on Ripple CEO Meet Up Ripple has recently come into the limelight for its legal victory against the SEC where the latter had alleged that the company and Garlinghouse sold unregistered securities via XRP. The lawsuit that lasted for more than two years concluded with the victory of Ripple, which opened up new possibilities for the future of the cryptocurrency market. John E. Deaton, a pro XRP lawyer and following the case commented on X that Ripple’s win means that the company has remained unshaken. He also pointed to the SEC’s aggressive approach in the litigation process, which involved serving Garlinghouse with personal subpoenas to produce financial information. ”Ripple and Brad disclosed every XRP transaction that has ever taken place, but the SEC acted misconduct when it came to discovery,” Deaton said. However, Ripple has come out even stronger, suggesting that more positive outcomes are in the offing for the company and the sector as a whole. Cynthia Lummis Chats With US SEC Potential Chairman Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse has also noted recent expansion of Ripple’s activities within the United States which shows that the focus has shifted back to the domestic market.He disclosed that three quarters of the new positions at Ripple are based in the United States, something that was not the case in the past given the company’s focus on the international market. Furthermore, the company signed up more US business contracts in the last six weeks of the year 2024 than it had in the six months prior to that period. The dinner comes after several meetings between politicians and crypto enthusiasts. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for blockchain technology, has also been engaging with Paul Atkins, the man expected to be named SEC chairman by President-elect Trump. These discussions focus on the need to reform the SEC’s rule making process and to advance the use of digital assets. Ripple’s Growing Market Influence Ripple is also coming up strongly in the blockchain space with new products being introduced. Ripple President Monica Long stated that the stablecoin, RLUSD, which was recently launched, is expected to be listed on multiple platforms. At the same time, the company has joined Chainlink to work on the integration of secure and accurate pricing of RLUSD into the DeFi ecosystem. In these developments, Ripple has witnessed a rise in its valuation due to the increased prices of XRP and the increasing adoption of its solutions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has earlier stated that the $11 billion valuation of the company is quite dated given the current situation.

Despite this bearish outlook, long-term holders appear to be accumulating the tokens and seem to be taking advantage of the recent price decline, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. XRP Fails to Hold Bullish Outlook Before this crash, the overall market sentiment appeared bullish , with XRP seeming poised for a mega rally. However, the recent price decline has shifted the overall market sentiment, including for XRP. On January 2, 2024, XRP broke out from a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and subsequently moved into a consolidation zone, which the altcoin maintained for four trading days. However, the recent price crash has breached XRP’s consolidation zone and suggests a major price decline in the near future. $60.7M in XRP Outflow from Exchanges Amid this price decline, whales and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the asset, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $60.7 million worth of XRP in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinglass In cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which is often seen as a sign of accumulation. Additionally, outflows may indicate a potential buying opportunity and the possibility of an upside rally.

It’s crucial to stay updated on the latest from top trending cryptos—Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Recently, Hedera hit a high near $0.40 but is now adjusting, while Toncoin has slipped below its usual range after peaking at $7.20, with projections pointing towards $6.20. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has been making waves with its bold initiatives, revealed during a captivating AMA session. This session introduced a slew of exciting new developments including an incubator, a grants program, and a launchpad, marking it a key player in the blockchain field. Delve into these updates to get a handle on what’s heating up in this competitive space. Toncoin Price Insights: Potential Dips Could Set the Stage for Gains Toncoin has been on a wild ride, dipping below its average after hitting $7.20, suggesting some bearish trends ahead. The price fell to $4.78 but rebounded slightly above $5.00, still under the moving averages. Should Toncoin surge past these averages, we might see a resurgence. Conversely, if it dips below the 50-day SMA, the price could plummet to as low as $3.65. Currently, Toncoin is priced around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past average levels, aiming for $6.20. On the daily chart, maintaining positions above these averages and breaking through the $6.50 resistance could signal a bullish revival. Hedera Price Momentum: Soaring Past $0.40 Hedera’s price dynamics are heating up, recently breaking out from a descending triangle pattern after touching near $0.40, suggesting the start of an upward trend, awaiting further validation. Just a few days back, Hedera rallied from its base, breaking through significant resistance. The daily chart now hints at an upcoming fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci tools spotlighting critical support and resistance areas. After a robust rebound from the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.24, the price surged 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI climbing from high levels, the growing momentum could lead to critical movements in the near future, keeping all eyes on Fibonacci barriers. BlockDAG’s Latest AMA Reveal BlockDAG, a rising layer-1 blockchain project, is now among the top trending cryptos, following its recent AMA that unveiled new initiatives to boost its ecosystem and expand growth opportunities. These developments echo the formative stages of well-known networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is eagerly developing a new launchpad to support the roll-out of decentralized applications and projects on the BlockDAG network, poised to enhance participation and energize the ecosystem. BlockDAG is gearing up to host four significant hackathons in 2025, expecting to attract over 15,000 developers and catalyze hundreds of new projects. To bolster these efforts, they are introducing a $10 million grants program in February, awarding amounts between $5,000 and $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that qualify. Moreover, an ambassador program is being set up to integrate global representatives, and a collaboration with an incubator will provide essential mentorship, resources, and guidance to promising projects, ensuring they thrive on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG continues to impress with its significant milestones. Its ongoing crypto presale has successfully raised over $176 million and distributed more than 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in the 27th presale batch, early participants have seen an astonishing 2380% ROI. These achievements underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem and its readiness to be a leading choice for participants as we approach 2025. Final Say Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to hold strong in the list of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently exceeding $0.40 and Toncoin maintaining around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s targeted initiatives, including a robust $10 million grants program, a worldwide incubator, and a dedicated launchpad for new projects, that are raising its profile. The initiative’s crypto presale has not only raised $176 million but also achieved a phenomenal 2380% ROI from the first batch, showcasing BlockDAG’s dynamic approach to growth. This strategy sets BlockDAG apart as a standout opportunity for those aiming to engage with a project that combines consistent expansion with significant community involvement.

Investors are closely watching both of these well-established tokens, anticipating further gains. However, while DOGE and XRP continue to capture attention, there’s a new altcoin gem emerging with the potential to deliver even bigger gains – Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.004875 during its presale, Lightchain AI presents a fresh opportunity for investors to secure significant returns in 2025 and beyond. Dogecoin and XRP Strong Price Movements, But Can They Sustain Growth? Dogecoin and XRP has shown big price jumps, with Dogecoin going up more than 30% to about $0.30 and XRP getting up to near $2.43. These actions are mostly linked to hopes of a better crypto-supportive rule setup under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he wants to cut back on digital-asset rules. Also, the choice of crypto backer Elon Musk to run the Department of Government Efficiency has made market hope grow. Bu͏t, the durability of this rise stays unclear; as it really relies on the true use of good rules and the fixing of current legal fights like Ripple’s battle with the SEC. Investors should exercise caution, as the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market can lead to rapid changes in asset values. Lightchain AI New Altcoin with Explosive Potential While Dogecoin and XRP have their moments in the sun, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a major contender for the next big altcoin surge. Lightchain AI is a blockchain-based platform that integrates artificial intelligence and decentralized solutions to address real-world challenges across industries such as data processing, AI model training, and data privacy. Unlike DOGE, which is largely driven by community speculation, and XRP, which is limited to the cross-border payments space, Lightchain AI offers real-world applications with massive potential for adoption across various sectors. The presale of Lightchain AI , priced at $0.004875, has already raised significant investor interest. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI is poised for exponential growth, with predictions for 1000% returns by 2025. The project’s real-world use cases in decentralized AI solutions for industries that require secure, scalable infrastructure make it one of the most promising altcoins to invest in this year. Road Ahead for Lightchain AI Looking ahead to 2025, Lightchain AI is set to disrupt the blockchain and AI markets. As demand for decentralized AI solutions and blockchain scalability continues to rise, Lightchain AI’s platform will be well-positioned to meet these needs. The project’s combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world applications, and strong investor backing makes it one of the most exciting altcoins for investors looking for significant returns. As the crypto market matures, projects like Lightchain AI , which focus on delivering real value and addressing real-world problems, will gain prominence. For those looking for an investment that goes beyond the hype, Lightchain AI offers a rare opportunity to get in early and benefit from its explosive growth.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Crossed Above Its 14-Day SMA In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed a pattern that has recently formed in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The “Coinbase Premium Index” is an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This indicator is useful for determining how the buying or selling behaviors differ between the userbases of the two cryptocurrency exchange titans. Positive values imply the users on Coinbase are buying at a higher rate or selling at a lower rate than the ones on Binance. Similarly, negative values imply that Binance users have pushed the BTC price higher than on Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Breaks Equilibrium: Whales Scoop Up 240,000 BTC Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index, as well as its 14-day simple moving average (SMA), over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index plunged under its 14-day SMA and into the red territory last month. The cryptocurrency’s price plummeted alongside this venture into the negative zone for the indicator, suggesting the shift in the metric occurred not because of Binance users buying more, but rather due to Coinbase investors taking to selling. The activity of Coinbase users, who are predominantly from the US, has actually played a key role in BTC price action this year, with the asset’s value often finding itself closely mimicking the trend in the Coinbase Premium Index. Thus, it’s not surprising to see that these investors were the drivers for the recent crash as well. From the chart, it’s visible that users on the exchange continued to sell into the new year, but during the last few days, the metric has finally shown a reversal. With this surge, its value has crossed back above the 14-day SMA, potentially implying a return of momentum in the market.

CryptoQuant has pointed out that the last time the cryptocurrency showed a similar trend was back in November. Following this previous crossover, the indicator saw a break into the positive region, alongside which Bitcoin enjoyed a rally from the $69,000 level to the new all-time high of $108,000. It now remains to be seen whether this is the start of a fresh wave of buying from American traders and if it would be similarly bullish for BTC this time as well. Signs have been looking positive so far, as the asset has witnessed recovery above the $100,000 mark since the crossover appeared. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $100,900, up over 7% in the last week.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 03:07:00

Fusing AR, AI, and GPS technology into a stylized low-poly world, this upcoming MMORPG invites players to explore real-world locations, conquer lands, and meet heroes spanning from ancient legends to futuristic warriors. The finish line is in sight, with the final stretch of development planned over the coming months, and excitement is already building for what promises to be a genre-defining launch. At its heart, Chaos on the Chains is all about strategic depth wrapped in an ever-evolving narrative. From forging alliances to launching full-scale invasions, every decision made leaves a lasting mark in multiple realms. Thanks to GPS and AR, the borders of the in-game world intersect with the player’s own neighborhood—meaning they can literally expand their empire by stepping outside their front door. This real-world immersion is further enhanced by AI-driven NPCs and surprise appearances from the development team itself. One moment, they could be battling a historically inspired knight; the next, they might find themselves in a showdown with a developer—or even the CEO. Each season unveils new story arcs, quests, and in-game events, so there’s always a fresh challenge on the horizon. Whether players specialize in stealthy raids or prefer taking territories head-on, the open-world approach ensures they can progress on their own terms. And because Chaos on the Chains runs on mobile devices, their next great conquest is never more than a swipe away. Being Part of the Chaos: TGE In anticipation of our Token Generation Event (TGE), we’re excited to welcome new community members. Early adopters of the Chaos on the Chains token will enjoy exclusive perks, from limited-edition gear to priority access in future expansions.

Not much, especially when projects like Book of Meme (BOME) are pushing boundaries with decentralised storage for meme culture, and Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) keeps it lowkey with its relaxed vibe and growing community. With meme coins on everyone’s radar, these new contenders are grabbing attention, but can they deliver the same excitement as BTFD Coin, which is rewriting the rules with its high-yield staking and play-to-earn game? Meme coins have come a long way from their humble beginnings, evolving into a cultural phenomenon that blends entertainment, community, and financial opportunities. Among the newest contenders, BTFD Coin stands out as a potential game-changer with its impressive 90% APY staking rewards, the launch of its play-to-earn game on January 1, and a rapidly growing community of over 7,800 holders. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin, BOME, and CHILLGUY are the best new meme coins to buy this week . BTFD Coin: 90% APY Staking Creates a Bullish Buzz Have you ever wished for a meme coin that doesn’t just ride the hype but offers actual rewards for holding? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin ($BTFD) brings to the table. Currently, in its 13th presale stage at $0.000142, the project has already raised over $5 million, selling more than 63 billion tokens. Investors are drawn to its jaw-dropping staking programme, promising an annual percentage yield of 90%. Why does this matter? Let’s crunch the numbers. Imagine you invest $7,000 in BTFD Coin today. At the presale price, that fetches you approximately 49,295,774 coins. By the end of the presale, when $BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $29,577.46—a whopping 322% return! And that’s without factoring in staking rewards. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is among the best new meme coins to buy this week. Beyond staking, the coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has captured the community’s imagination. Released on January 1, it’s already being hailed as a fun and engaging way to earn tokens. With these robust features and an ethos of “buying the dip” with strategic investments, BTFD Coin is more than just another meme project—it’s a movement. Buying $BTFD is easy: Set up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Head to the BTFD presale page , connect your wallet, and buy. Claim your tokens after the presale ends. The 16-stage presale is moving fast, and if you’re looking to run with the bulls, now’s the time to join the BTFD revolution. Book of Meme (BOME): Weekly Gains Spark Renewed Interest If memes are the language of the internet, Book of Meme (BOME) aims to create its ultimate library. Trading at $0.006871, BOME has seen a modest 11.22% weekly gain despite a 35.8% dip over the last month. Its trading volume is up by 7.89%, indicating renewed investor interest. What sets BOME apart is its ambitious plan to immortalise memes on decentralised platforms like Solana, Arweave, and IPFS. The project’s experimental nature seeks to redefine how we think about web3 culture, merging the worlds of memes, degenerate trading, and decentralised social media. Imagine a future where your favourite memes are forever etched into the blockchain—this is BOME’s vision. However, BOME has faced challenges. Its all-time high of $0.5106 from March 2024 feels like a distant memory, but with its unique use case, there’s potential for recovery. Analysts suggest that as blockchain adoption grows, so will interest in BOME, especially with its planned expansions into Bitcoin inscriptions. If you’re a meme lover who believes in the power of decentralisation, BOME might just be your ticket to combining culture with investment. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Analysts Predict $0.70 and Beyond For those who love a bit of fun without the fuss, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is all about keeping things, well, chill. The coin, currently trading at $0.1952, has experienced a 25.27% rise over the past week, though it’s still down 54% for the month. Despite this, CHILLGUY is building a loyal fan base, particularly among Gen Z and TikTok users who resonate with its laid-back “lowkey” attitude. The meme character behind CHILLGUY—decked out in a grey sweater, jeans, and red shoes—embodies a vibe that’s casual and unbothered. It’s a vibe that’s caught on, with predictions that the coin could hit $0.45, $0.70, or even $1 if the community continues to grow. CHILLGUY is a great example of how meme coins can capitalise on cultural trends to build their value. Its community-driven approach and relatable branding make it a fun addition to any meme coin portfolio. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that meme coins continue to dominate the crypto space, each with its unique flair. Book of Meme (BOME) offers a creative, decentralised spin on preserving internet culture, while Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) captures the zeitgeist of laid-back, lowkey vibes. With 90% APY staking rewards, live P2E game, and a presale price primed for massive returns, BTFD Coin shines as one of the best new meme coins to buy this week.

They’re not just about digital money anymore; they’re transforming industries like finance, gaming, and even real estate. With blockchain technology evolving at a breakneck pace, the question isn’t whether you should invest in crypto but which ones deserve your attention. This year, one name stands out: Qubetics ($TICS). While Bitcoin and Ethereum paved the way, Qubetics is addressing real-world problems in ways its predecessors couldn’t. From tokenizing assets to enhancing liquidity, Qubetics offers solutions that could redefine how we invest. Let’s dive into the top 7 leading cryptos to invest in this year. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Unlocking Real-World Asset Tokenization Imagine owning a piece of prime real estate or rare art without shelling out millions. Qubetics makes this possible through its tokenized asset marketplace, where physical and digital assets are converted into tradable tokens. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about accessibility. Fractional ownership means investors can access opportunities that were once reserved for the elite. Want a slice of a luxury hotel? Or perhaps a share in a promising startup? Qubetics turns these dreams into reality. By addressing the issues of limited liquidity and lack of transparency, Qubetics is a game-changer for investors and businesses alike. Its secondary market ensures seamless trading, making it easier to manage and grow your portfolio. The presale numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics has sold over 405 million tokens to 13,600 holders, raising $9 million. At $0.0455 per token, it’s one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. But don’t wait too long—prices jump 10% in the next stage this weekend. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Gold Standard You can’t talk about crypto without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the gold standard of digital assets. Its reputation as a store of value makes it a go-to for both seasoned and new investors. Bitcoin’s scarcity is its superpower. With only 21 million BTC ever to exist, it’s digital gold for a digital age. Whether you’re hedging against inflation or diversifying your portfolio, Bitcoin is as reliable as it gets. Sure, it’s not the fastest or most efficient blockchain out there, but its widespread adoption and network security are unmatched. If stability is your jam, Bitcoin is still one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. 3. Ethereum (ETH): The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that powers decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Think DeFi, NFTs, and even metaverse projects—all roads lead back to Ethereum. The move to Ethereum 2.0 has been a game-changer, reducing energy consumption and introducing staking rewards. This makes ETH not just a utility coin but also a lucrative investment. While gas fees can still be a pain, Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is hard to beat. If you’re looking for a versatile crypto with endless potential, ETH should be on your radar. 4. Polygon (POL): Scaling Ethereum Ethereum’s biggest problem? Scalability. Enter Polygon, the Layer 2 solution that makes Ethereum faster and cheaper. Whether you’re trading NFTs or using DeFi platforms, Polygon ensures smooth sailing without breaking the bank on gas fees. Its ecosystem is massive, hosting everything from decentralized exchanges to gaming platforms. And with partnerships from major global brands, Polygon isn’t just a crypto—it’s becoming a mainstream tech solution. If you believe in Ethereum but want something more cost-effective, Polygon is one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): The Fast and Scalable Blockchain Avalanche is all about speed. With transaction finality in less than a second, it’s perfect for applications that need high performance. From DeFi to enterprise solutions, Avalanche’s subnets make it easy to create custom blockchain networks. What sets Avalanche apart is its scalability without sacrificing decentralization. As demand for blockchain grows, AVAX is well-positioned to handle the load. Analysts are bullish, predicting significant price growth this year. If you’re looking for a crypto with both speed and scalability, AVAX should be on your list. 6. Ripple (XRP): Revolutionizing Payments Ripple’s XRP is a crypto with a mission: making cross-border payments faster and cheaper. Traditional banking systems are slow and expensive, but RippleNet is changing the game for financial institutions worldwide. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges, XRP’s utility keeps it in the spotlight. With partnerships in the banking sector and a focus on global adoption, Ripple is one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year if you’re looking for real-world use cases. 7. Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Blockchain Cardano is like the academic of the crypto world. Its research-first approach ensures that every upgrade is robust and sustainable. From energy efficiency to security, ADA checks all the boxes. Hydra, its Layer 2 scaling solution, promises to handle millions of transactions per second, making Cardano ready for mass adoption. Its ecosystem is growing, with projects in DeFi, NFTs, and social impact. If you value innovation and sustainability, Cardano is a no-brainer for your portfolio. Wrapping It Up Crypto investments can be overwhelming, but these seven projects stand out for their innovation and potential. Qubetics is leading the charge with its tokenized asset marketplace, solving real-world problems and democratizing investment. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational picks, while Polygon and Avalanche push the boundaries of scalability. Ripple and Cardano round out the list with their focus on payments and research-driven growth. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Ripple, and Cardano as the leading cryptos to invest in this year. Don’t wait—opportunities like these don’t last forever. Make your move today!

ETH is back to $3,350 and might struggle to start a fresh increase. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,750 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,675 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,450 resistance level. Ethereum Price Dips Over 8% Ethereum price remained stable above the $3,650 level and extended its upward move like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,680 and $3,700 resistance levels. However, the bulls failed to push the price above the $3,750 resistance. A high was formed at $3,742 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear move below $3,650 and $3,550. There was also a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,675 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $3,356 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,356 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,500 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,356 low. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,750 resistance zone or even $3,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,450 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The price is now battling to stay above the $2.30 mark and if the price breaks below key support levels, particularly $2.24, it may hint at a change in market structure. The current range has shown key phases like the automatic rally, secondary tests, and now a spring phase, where XRP is aiming for a breakout. This pattern has been observed before in other charts, like Binance Coin’s price action in 2023. We’re essentially waiting for the final breakout from the current range, which could happen soon. The accumulation phase that began in early December seems to be nearing its conclusion. While the breakout may take some time to fully unfold, the range is close to completing, and the next move appears to be to the upside. Support Levels to Watch The key support levels to observe are $2.23, $2.21, $2.17, $2.29, and $2.24. These areas should be monitored for signs of reversal, but a clear breakout above certain levels will confirm further bullish movement. Breakout Signals and Market Outlook A breakout above the 50% Fibonacci level at $2.35 would signal the end of the immediate downside and potentially mark the start of an upside move. XRP is known to react quickly to such breakouts, so traders should stay alert. The Patience Game After over a month of range-bound movement, the end seems near.

The question you should ask yourself this January is simple: which project offers the best crypto investment opportunity? Toncoin (TON), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) all present unique advantages, but only one is set to truly shine. Presale Token Remittix Stands Out For its Practical Focus Remittix takes a different approach by addressing real-world issues in the $150 trillion global remittance market. It uses blockchain technology to simplify cross-border payments and offers speed and cost-efficiency that traditional systems like SWIFT can’t match. The presale price is still only $0.0193 and already raised over $2.1 million highlighting the massive demand for Remittix in today’s financial landscape. Remittix’s unique PayFi protocol bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance and allows for seamless global transactions without hidden fees or delays. What sets Remittix apart is its ability to combine innovation with inclusivity. It targets underbanked populations and so brings financial services to regions that are often overlooked by traditional banking systems. Toncoin Shows Promise But Raises Questions Toncoin is attracting attention thanks to significant whale activity, with over 1.55 billion TON coins, valued at $8.86 billion, exchanged in a single day. This surge has pushed TON’s price to $5.744, with trading volumes climbing 4.94% over the past week. Analysts predict a potential test of the $6 resistance level if the current bullish sentiment continues. However, Toncoin’s reliance on large-scale transactions raises concerns. Whale activity often leads to volatility, making TON a less predictable option for those seeking stability. Despite being just 32% below its all-time high of $8.24, the token’s sideways trading pattern suggests it lacks the consistent momentum needed to sustain growth. Memes Meet Payment Potential in Dogecoin Dogecoin is in the spotlight once again. This time, it’s fueled by speculation surrounding its integration into Elon Musk’s X Payments platform. If realized, its inclusion in X Payments could revolutionize the coin’s use case and drive adoption among creators and users. Despite this optimism, DOGE remains heavily influenced by media hype and the endorsement of figures like Musk. While it has the potential to reach $1—requiring a 261% increase—technical indicators hint at short-term corrections. A declining RSI and negative MACD suggest a cooling period before further gains. Although speculative assets like DOGE can yield high returns, they come with increased risk, making them less attractive for those seeking a balanced portfolio. Why Smart Investors Favor Remittix While Toncoin offers short-term gains and Dogecoin rides on speculative hype, Remittix presents a balanced, utility-driven investment. Its focus on addressing inefficiencies in cross-border payments aligns with the growing demand for practical blockchain solutions. Furthermore, the ongoing presale allows investors to secure RTX tokens at an attractive entry point, maximizing potential returns. Institutional investors often prioritize projects with clear value propositions and scalable market potential. Remittix meets these criteria, leveraging blockchain’s strengths to deliver real-world impact. In comparison, Toncoin’s reliance on whale activity and Dogecoin’s dependence on media-driven rallies make them less predictable choices for long-term portfolios. The Smarter Crypto Investment For those seeking sustainable growth and a tangible market impact, Remittix offers a compelling alternative to speculative assets. With its presale providing early entry, January is the time to explore RTX as a cornerstone of your crypto investment portfolio with its price projected to climb a massive 600% before the presale completion!

Starting January 8, 2025, DEEP is available for trading in the Korean Won (KRW) market. The trading will commence at 3:00 PM with a base price of 230 KRW, giving users the opportunity to trade the token directly against the national currency. Bithumb Launches DEEP Token Trading on Sui Network According to the Bithumb notice , DEEP token will work only on the Sui network, and the token deposits from other networks will not be accepted. The deposits and withdrawals were opened right after the announcement of the official timing limit which was two hours. According to Bithumb, it takes 20 network confirmations for deposits to be credited to users’ accounts. To foster a fair and secure trading process during its launch, some certain measures have been put in place. New buy orders are not accepted in the primary market during the first five minutes of trading session. The sell orders are also limited to within ±10% and ±100% of the base price during this time period. Additionally, the automated trading will be allowed only after the first trade has occurred. An official said in an interview, “These measures are put in place to protect the market and prevent price manipulation during the initial trading period.” The listing of DEEP comes after Bithumb added other tokens like PEAQ and Vana to its KRW market in recent days. Deposit and Withdrawal Guidelines In compliance with the Travel Rule, Bithumb has observed that deposits and withdrawals shall only be made through supported exchanges. Tokens received from other unsupported platforms will not be credited to users’ accounts and the refund process may extend to several months. Before transferring their DEEP tokens, users are recommended to double-check the deposit address as well as the network. The exchange also informed its users that dealings through restricted exchanges may result in account limitations in accordance with the exchange’s terms of service. “More specifically, when making deposits or withdrawals, please confirm that the token is on the same network and has the same address as your Bithumb account,” the exchange said. DEEP Token Performance and Technical Analysis The DeepBook Protocol (DEEP) has been quite bullish, with the price sitting at $0.1741 and a 24-hour trading volume of $56.1 million as of the time of writing. On the DEEPUSD 3-hour chart, the market has formed a rising wedge pattern, which is a bearish pattern. During the rally, the price is trading close to the resistance level of $0.1750 with the support levels being at $0.1536(50 MA) and $0.1174 (200 MA). DEEP/USD (source: TradingView) On the DEEP price chart the short-term 50 moving average is currently positioned above the long-term 200 moving average. This crossover is usually seen as a buy signal, meaning that the token has continued to rise in the short-term. Nevertheless, it seems that this momentum is slowing down as the price nears the upper border of the wedge. If the price falls downward from the pattern, analysts believe that it may continue to decline to $0.10 levels. On the contrary, if the $0.1750 level is breached on the upside, then there could be an upward trend.
