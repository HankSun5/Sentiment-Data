Hayes began his essay by setting a vivid scene from Japan’s Hokkaido ski resorts, likening dangerous backcountry conditions caused by insufficient snow cover over sharp bamboo grass (sasa) to potential market obstacles that could cut short crypto rallies. He observes that 2025 has kicked off amid robust snowfall in Hokkaido—an apt metaphor for what he sees as a liquidity “dumping” that could propel digital asset prices upward. Nonetheless, he warns that the political and fiscal environment in the United States may introduce unexpected hazards. Why March Could Mark The Next Peak For Crypto “As we begin 2025, the question on crypto investors’ minds is whether the Trump pump can continue,” Hayes writes, referencing the initial optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s second term. While Hayes believes “the high expectations for policy action out of the Trump camp set up the market for disappointment,” he maintains that any short-term negativity could be offset by a powerful “dollar liquidity impulse.” Related Reading: Crypto Trader Nets $17 Million From AI Coins: Here’s What He’s Buying Now Hayes underscores that the Fed’s RRP has been critical for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Since the third quarter of 2022, the facility’s unwinding has correlated positively with crypto and equities prices. “Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 when the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) reached its zenith,” he explains, noting that US Treasury Secretary Janet “Bad Gurl” Yellen facilitated a shift from issuing longer-dated coupon bonds to issuing shorter-dated T-bills. This approach, he argues, effectively drained more than $2 trillion from the RRP, injecting liquidity into global markets. Now, with the RRP falling to almost zero, the Fed has “belatedly changed the policy rate of the RRP” to make it less attractive. Hayes points out that it still represents a potential $237 billion injection into markets once the remaining RRP funds move into higher-yielding Treasury bills. Meanwhile, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) removes $60 billion per month, totaling $180 billion between January and March. Netting both factors yields a $57 billion injection over the quarter. Another major focus in Hayes’s thesis is the Treasury General Account. As debt ceiling negotiations loom, the Treasury’s inability to issue new debt means it can only cover expenses by spending down the TGA—an action that releases liquidity. “Because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling, the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account, the TGA,” Hayes writes, noting that the balance stands at around $722 billion. Related Reading: This Week’s Top Crypto Catalysts: What Investors Need To Watch He estimates that without a debt ceiling resolution, the TGA could be exhausted by May or June. For crypto markets, the crux of the matter is the timescale for a deal in Congress. The essay highlights Trump’s narrow majority and the likelihood that Republicans who position themselves as fiscally conservative will not grant quick or easy consent. Democrats, Hayes adds, are unlikely to facilitate enabling more spending for a president they oppose—further fueling legislative brinkmanship. According to Hayes’s calculations, TGA drawdowns could release an additional $555 billion from January through March. If combined with the $57 billion net liquidity from the Fed’s RRP and QT adjustments, total dollar liquidity could rise by as much as $612 billion in the first quarter. Hayes zeroes in on March as the critical juncture—when this liquidity surge might begin to wane and expectations for new federal spending or pro-crypto legislation from the Trump administration may not materialize on schedule. “I believe I answered the question I posed at the outset. That is, the sasa of a letdown by team Trump on his proposed pro-crypto and pro-business legislation can be covered by an extremely positive dollar liquidity environment,” he states, before concluding that peak liquidity could subside quickly once the market anticipates the debt ceiling’s resolution and the subsequent refilling of the TGA. From a historical lens, Hayes cites Bitcoin’s price action in 2024, which peaked in mid-March around $73,000, then drifted sideways and tumbled just before the April 15 tax deadline. The reasoning, he suggests, is straightforward: as soon as TGA spending has run its course, the net positive liquidity picture reverts to neutral or negative, leaving risk assets vulnerable. While Hayes acknowledges that Chinese credit expansion, Bank of Japan interest rate policies, and the Trump administration’s potential dollar devaluation strategy against other major currencies or gold could upend his timeline, he trusts that RRP and TGA mechanics are reliable near-term gauges. Crucially, these twin sources of liquidity appear powerful enough to overshadow any disappointment about Trump’s policies until at least the end of March. “None of these major macroeconomic issues can be known a priori, but I have confidence in the math behind how the RRP and TGA balances will change over time,” he says, underscoring that the surging crypto and stock markets since late 2022 align with the massive drain in the RRP. Hayes concludes by suggesting that, historically, markets often provide significant selling opportunities in the first quarter. By springtime, investors might want to take profits and “chill on the beach” while waiting for improved liquidity conditions to re-emerge in the second half of the year. “Right on schedule, just like almost every other year, it will be time to sell in the late stages of the first quarter,” Hayes concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $101,344.

Join One of The Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today,https://thecoinrise.com/couldnt-jump-on-the-popcat-bandwagon-join-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-buy-today/,"If you’ve been anywhere near the crypto world recently, you’ve probably noticed one thing: meme coins are more than just a joke. They’re a cultural phenomenon, a chance to invest in something fun with explosive potential. Over the years, meme coins have turned everyday investors into millionaires, from Dogecoin’s viral rise to Shiba Inu’s domination of the market. And now, the buzz is all about BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new meme coin making waves with its jaw-dropping features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a referral program, and staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY. But hang on, what about POPCAT, the meme coin that went viral overnight? Let’s dive in and compare these two to see why BTFD Coin deserves the spotlight as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s Breaking All the Rules BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a full-blown ecosystem designed to reward investors from the moment they get in. The presale has been a masterclass in building FOMO, raising over $5 million so far and selling more than 63 billion coins to over 7,800 holders. With a starting price of just $0.000004, BTFD raced through its first 10 presale stages in just two weeks. Now in Stage 13, you can snag it for $0.000142, but don’t sleep on this—the final listing price is $0.0006, meaning there’s still a massive opportunity for early birds. Picture this: a Play-to-Earn game where you’re not just gaming but stacking up real-world rewards. BTFD’s Bulls Squad game brings NFTs to life with interactive gameplay that’s more than just pretty pictures. You collect, trade, and use these NFTs to earn $BTFD, making it a solid win-win for gamers and investors. Who needs regular games when you can make bank while having fun? Alright, let’s talk staking. At a staggering 90% APY, this isn’t just another staking pool. It’s a money machine. Every $1,000 staked could earn you $900 in a year, and that’s without touching the principal. Plus, the BTFD staking program is super easy to use, meaning you don’t need to be some blockchain wizard to start earning. Want to bring your friends along for the ride? With BTFD’s referral program, you can earn extra tokens for every person you convince to join. It’s like getting paid to help your buddies level up—how cool is that? Here’s where it gets juicy. Imagine you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin. That’d get you about 52,816,901 $BTFD. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash would be worth a staggering $31,690. That’s a 322% return. Tell me, where else can you get returns like that? POPCAT (POPCAT): The Viral Challenger POPCAT is another meme coin that’s been turning heads lately, but it’s playing a slightly different game. Launched with a bang thanks to its viral marketing campaigns, POPCAT has quickly captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, especially those who love its playful homage to internet culture. The coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity. POPCAT’s creators leaned into its meme-worthy origins, using the famous Popcat meme to spark curiosity. Think of it as Dogecoin’s cheeky cousin—cute, relatable, and undeniably viral. And while it’s undoubtedly fun, the question remains: Does it have the depth to go the distance? Unlike BTFD, POPCAT doesn’t offer a robust ecosystem. Sure, it’s fun to hold and watch your portfolio grow when the market gets hyped, but the lack of tangible use cases—like staking or a P2E game—makes it more of a speculative play. That said, its community is passionate, and in crypto, that can sometimes be enough. Crypto analysts are mixed on POPCAT. While some see potential for short-term gains due to its viral nature, others warn of its lack of utility and staying power. Current forecasts suggest modest growth if the hype continues, but it’s not offering the kind of returns BTFD is projected to deliver. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to jump in?

From its 90% APY staking to the Bulls Squad, P2E game, it’s building a meme coin ecosystem that delivers real value, not just laughs. Add to that its referral program and stellar presale performance, and it’s clear why BTFD is topping the charts as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. The window to get in at a discounted price is closing fast. With the presale already in Stage 13 and a listing price of $0.0006 around the corner, the time to act is now.

Ethereum price analysis suggests a potentially significant shift, as the symmetrical triangle formation on the chart may either surge to $3,980 or fall to $2,920, drawing keen interest from market watchers. In the meantime, the Dogecoin price remains near the critical $0.300 mark, leading to discussions on whether it can rebound if this level remains intact. BlockDAG (BDAG) is on an upward path with its Refer & Earn program, which rewards users with 6% to 10% USDT cashback on each transaction, with no limit to how much they can earn. BlockDAG’s impressive presale, which gathered over $176.5 million, along with its scalable rewards and potential for high returns, firmly establishes it among the best crypto to buy right now! Dogecoin Price Stable Amid Potential for Upward Movement The Dogecoin price has recently fallen by 23% over ten days but now teeters at the pivotal $0.300 support. Observers are watching to see if this marks a temporary decline or a move to lower levels. Current trading suggests an effort to maintain the $0.300 level, which could indicate an impending bullish shift if it holds. Trader Tradigrade’s insights on X point to a potential recovery for Dogecoin price, with signs of an upward trend on the horizon. If the price remains above its 20-day EMA, it could draw renewed buying interest, possibly leading to a price increase. However, a drop below $0.300 might trigger increased selling pressure, marking a critical moment for DOGE. Ethereum Price Analysis Indicates a Possible Major Shift Significant attention is on Ethereum price analysis as it currently navigates a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. Technical analyst Carl Runefelt’s recent X post suggests a likely substantial movement. Ethereum price analysis forecasts either a push to $3,980 or a decline to $2,920. The price stabilization around $3,419 shows resilience despite market fluctuations, with critical levels at $3,300 support and $3,550 resistance. The outcome of this pattern could define Ethereum’s immediate market direction, with anticipation building around these pivotal points. BlockDAG’s Cashback Rewards Through Its Refer & Earn Program BlockDAG has revamped the way users benefit with its Refer & Earn USDT system, offering immediate cashback that ranks as one of the most beneficial in the cryptocurrency sphere. Referrers get a 6% cashback on their first referral transaction, which increases to 10% for any additional purchases within the next 24 hours. Buyers also enjoy a steady 6% cashback, ensuring rewards for everyone involved. Since its launch, BlockDAG has collected over $176.5 million from its presale and has distributed over 17.7 billion coins. Currently, each BDAG is valued at $0.0248, providing an impressive 2,380% ROI to early participants. The Refer & Earn system allows unlimited referral rewards with immediate USDT payouts, making it a seamless opportunity for earning. The structure of the referral program is clear-cut, resetting daily at 00:00 UTC to ensure fairness and transparency. The time-sensitive nature of these increased cashback rates has led to strong engagement as users take advantage of the growing rewards for repeated transactions. As the 27th presale batch of BlockDAG nears a sellout, its mix of affordability, community-focused incentives, and scalable rewards mark it as a leading choice among cryptocurrency ventures. The strong metrics from BlockDAG’s performance, combined with the lucrative referral program, highlight it as one of the best cryptos to buy right now for those looking for significant rewards and cashback opportunities. The Bottom Line The crypto market wraps up the fourth quarter with cautious optimism and promising opportunities. Ethereum price analysis points to a crucial moment, with its current symmetrical triangle pattern suggesting a possible major price shift. This could lead to a significant rise to $3,980 or a fall to $2,920, shaping its short-term direction. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price stays in the spotlight, maintaining around the $0.300 support level, with ongoing debates about its potential rise or further drop. BlockDAG continues to draw interest with its interesting Refer & Earn program, known for its unmatched cashback rewards and enhancing its status as the best crypto to buy right now . As 2025 nears, BlockDAG offers numerous opportunities for traders to explore as they strategize on maximizing their returns.

If the U.S. digital assets exchange can get the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to take its appeal and agree that the SEC was wrong about its accusations that Coinbase improperly handled the trading of unregistered securities, such a decision would echo throughout the wider crypto industry. Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York decided on Tuesday to approve a request from Coinbase to ask the higher court to consider one core question in the dispute, in a process known as an interlocutory appeal. And while Coinbase is chasing that matter, the rest of the case will sit idle. Failla noted she doesn't appreciate the company's ""efforts to cast aspersions on the SEC’s approach to crypto-assets,"" but she pointed out the clash in rulings from different federal courts on similar questions and decided that ""conflicting decisions on an important legal issue necessitate the Second Circuit’s guidance."" At the heart of the legal clash between the U.S. securities regulator and the leading U.S. crypto exchange is whether certain tokens traded on the platform should be considered securities, and thus be seen as breaching the law. Coinbase has argued, among other points, that the issuers of crypto tokens traded on its secondary market don't owe anything to the buyers, so the tokens don't tick the boxes of the legal standard for what makes a security, the so-called Howey test. The judge said she's granting the April 2024 request ""because it presents a controlling question of law regarding the reach and application of Howey to crypto-assets, about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and the resolution of which would advance the ultimate termination of the SEC’s enforcement action."" ""We appreciate the court's careful consideration,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal posted on social-media site X . ""On to the Second Circuit we go.""

In the end, this and other court disputes over what constitutes a crypto security could head toward the Supreme Court but finally run into irrelevance if Congress passes a new law to define how the assets and their trading should be regulated in the U.S. That's what the industry is aiming for with its political operations and lobbying efforts, focusing on steering this year's new Congress toward more industry-friendly legislation. The SEC's leadership is also about to change hands to Republican control, which is likely to mean more openness to the crypto industry.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 22:42:00

The AI firm also reportedly closed a deal with Panasonic to integrate its artificial intelligence models into the legacy electronics maker’s products. Artificial Intelligence firms had a strong year in 2024, and they look to have picked up the pace already in 2025. AI has become an umbrella that can include so many specialties and disciplines. AI Agents now operate X (formerly Twitter) accounts, can solve complex issues, and some, like Anthropic’s Claude, can browse Chrome as a human would. Anthropic is the latest beneficiary of the FOMO as it steals some of the shine from global leaders like OpenAI and Gemini. Panasonic teams up with Anthropic to release AI-enhanced family wellness coaching app Panasonic announced its partnership with Anthropic during the CES 2025 event. The app will be called Umi, and it is designed to help family members “care, coordinate, and connect” with one another. It is also supposed to help the family as a whole set goals like spending mealtime together or being more physically active, creating routines, and managing communal tasks. The user can preset goals via the app’s natural language voice interface. Panasonic reportedly aims for the app’s target audience to be families with members of all ages. The company stated during its CES demo that Umi can easily support caregivers by keeping them informed of the habits of elderly family members. Claude will not have autonomy over recommending advice because Panasonic plans to incorporate a wide range of wellness experts to help users establish and maintain healthy habits and routines. Umi will reportedly hit US markets later this year. Panasonic will make the app available to other members of its Panasonic Well’s Partner Collective, including Aaptiv, Precision Nutrition, SleepScore Labs, Addition Wealth, BlueApron, and Calm, so it is likely users will see its AI capabilities integrated into related products as well. The electronics company also plans to integrate Claude into other customer-facing systems like customer service, sales, and marketing. Panasonic also introduced its new “Panasonic Go” initiative, which is supposed to fast-track “AI-driven innovation” within the company. The firm has what some users on X have called ambitious plans, as it expects 30% of its revenue to come from “AI-driven hardware, software, and solution businesses” by 2030. Anthropic in advanced talks to raise $2 billion According to a Tuesday WSJ report , the AI startup is in advanced talks to raise $2 billion in a deal that would raise its valuation to $60 billion. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, revealed in 2023 it had secured a $500 million investment from Alphabet, which promised to invest another $1.5 billion over time. Amazon has also now invested a total of about $8 billion into Anthropic, with the latest investment being an immediate pledge of $1.25 billion, with the remaining $2.75 billion in funding expected to arrive this year. Amazon has serious stakes in the AI firm. Anthropic named Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. It is also using AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its models. This new investment means Amazon retains its minority stake in the startup. In November 2024, Anthropic revealed its model context protocol. It is a flagship product that allows Claude to integrate with tools like Google Maps and Google Calendar, meaning it can create an app or chatbot to take care of tasks like locating lunch spots, scheduling meetings, or even making restaurant reservations, according to Mike Barret, founder and chief strategy officer at ad agency Supernatural AI. “Anthropic is finding ways to make their AI more useful,” Barret said. This development pushes the company closer to making large language models more than just information providers but also doers that can take actionable steps across platforms.

A widely followed business survey data release, meanwhile, came in stronger-than-expected, suggestive that the dominant US service sector remains in rude health. As traders upped their bets on continued US economic strength, higher inflation ahead and fewer rate cuts from the Fed, long-term US bond yields jumped, with the US 10-year hitting its highest levels since April 2024 near 4.7%. That weighed on risk assets across the board – high yields in the market’s benchmark “risk free” asset tends to weigh on assets, and the riskier these assets are viewed, the more they are likely to decline. That explains why major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , which many traders view as a risk/liquidity play, are so sensitive to macro repricing events like this. With the Ethereum price now down roughly 10% from Monday’s highs in the mid-$3,700s, traders are asking is a new price collapse is here. Will Ethereum soon dump below $3,000, threatening an end to the post-Trump election victory bull run? Will Macro Headwinds Drive Ethereum Price Under $3,000? Macro has certainly been a major headwind to the crypto market, and broader risk assets, since the Fed’s hawkish policy meeting in mid-December. The central bank is clearly now more sensitive now to data that implies stickiness in inflation and economic strength, as Tuesday’s data did. The argument for more rate cuts in 2025 is increasingly weak, and could yet weaken further if Friday’s official US jobs report for December also comes in stronger than expected. That could add to the current market headwinds, and keep major cryptocurrencies, like the Ethereum price, on the defensive. In the medium-term, its tough to argue that easing liquidity conditions will be a major tailwind for crypto in 2025. The Fed continues to shrink its balance sheet following its 2020/2021 QE splurge. And indices of US liquidity show conditions have been broadly unchanged since around mid-2022. Arthur Hayes USD Liquidity Index , which is calculated by taking the Fed’s balance sheet minus the US Treasury General Account balance at the NY Fed plus the amount of accepted reverse repo bids at the NY Fed, shows US liquidity of currently around $6 trillion, still well below its late 2021 peaks in the $7 trillion region. US economic conditions, at least how they seem right now, likely mean the Fed won’t embark on substantial easing, and liquidity will likely remain around current levels in 2025. Analysts expecting 2025 to be a repeat of the kinds of moves seen during 2020/2021’s zero interest rate/QE fueled bull run may be left disappointed. All said, should financial conditions continue to tighten (seen by a further rise in US yields), then yes, Ethereum could certainly crash back below $3,000 in the short-term. But does a lack of incoming liquidity in 2025 mean the bull market is dead? Probably not. Here’s why. Ethereum Under $3,000, Buy The Dip? If the Ethereum price was to dump below $3,000 in the short-term, this could be a great opportunity for investors to accumulate more aggressively. Yes, liquidity conditions right now aren’t likely to be a big tailwind for crypto in 2025, but that could change in the coming years. More important, however, is the upcoming pro-crypto shift in the regulatory and adoption landscape in the US this year. Simply put, the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration is set to usher in a new golden age for the US crypto industry and markets more broadly. The US might be on the cusp of the establishment of an official Bitcoin reserve , which could kickstart a global race to accumulate the asset. This would be a huge headwind to the whole market. And even if that doesn’t happen, the Trump administration is packed with pro-crypto advocates that are set to create a better environment in the US for innovation and growth. 13 days until Gary Gensler steps down. 13 days until the most pro-crypto administration in history takes office. Trump’s cabinet is set to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital of the world.' Here’s everything you need to know about it pic.twitter.com/xVJLnzOoLN — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) January 7, 2025 Most importantly, anti-crypto zealot SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to leave the agency in under two weeks, and Trump’s proposed replacement is expected to end the agency’s crusade to destroy the industry. INTEL: Gary Gensler will step down as SEC Chair in 13 days — Solid Intel (@solidintel_x) January 7, 2025 This is particularly good news for the altcoin sector, which was hit hardest by the SEC’s regulation by enforcement drive in recent years. Trump and his family are also known supporters of Ethereum, owning the crypto in substantial amounts, and even launching a token on its blockchain. So yes, liquidity might not be a major factor this year, but 2025 could be crypto’s best-ever year in terms of gaining broader adoption and acceptance. Ethereum’s position as the only major altcoin with a spot ETF in the US, BlackRock’s anointed altcoin of choice, and the still undisputed kind of DeFi sets it up for a strong year.

Tokyo-based SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Japan’s SBI Group, has announced an agreement with a community of Solana supporters on the archipelago to give away an exclusive Solana-based NFT. SBI to give away Solana NFT to wallet holders The financial giant has agreed to give an NFT “present” to users of its SBI Web3 Wallet, with the aim of promoting the growth of Solana in Japan in 2025, in a joint campaign with Solana Superteam Japan , which is supported by the Solana foundation. The campaign is currently active and lasts until January 20th. “New Year NFT Present Campaign” Source: SBI Holdings. According to SBI’s press release (translated by Google): “This NFT represents the construction of the Web3 world centered on the Solana economy with a fortress-like structure, and the first sunrise viewed from the structure represents the dawn of a new Web3.” The NFT was designed by Solana Superteam Japan. Interestingly, the design is somewhat dystopian in appearance, with what appears to be “TOKYO STUPID GAMES” written in orange on the underside of the fortress balcony. SBI’s Web3 Wallet allows users in Japan to trade NFTs using Japanese yen, opening the market even to those who are not crypto-savvy. While the news is indeed bullish for fans of SBI and Solana, there are some caveats. Anons, true NFT degens, and fans of permissionless peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in the nation can count themselves out, as SBI’s Web3 Wallet requires an SBI VC Trade account, identification documents, and a stringent KYC (know-your-customer) process. For Solana fans looking for fun, volatile speculation, or just a middle finger to everyone (including themselves?), Fartcoin might be a better option for the new year.

WEMIX token prices since 2021. (Source: CoinGecko) The employees, some of whom still work at WeMade, are seeking damages of around $11 million. The group comprises members of the Wemade Tree subsidiary, WeMade’s former blockchain arm. The firm successfully developed WEMIX, which was first listed on crypto exchanges in 2020. WeMade then merged with WeMade Tree in February 2022.

They also claimed that the company had sent an email to the staffers “clearly promising them token compensation.” But WeMade’s attorney said that the plaintiffs’ claims centered on “a verbal contract” regarding token bonuses. However, the WeMade legal team denied that any such “verbal contract was concluded.” It also claimed the firm “only provided guidance” on “basic compensation plans.” The WeMade legal team lawyers said that “at the time, there were no established industry standards” for “firms to handle accounting conducted in crypto.” The same team said that “after discussing various matters at the company,” executives “realized that [crypto bonuses] would be burdensome” because “accounting standards were so unclear.” The WeMade legal team suggested the firm still intends to launch a WEMIX token bonus program “through consultation with company employees.” However, the plaintiffs said there had been a “criminal breach of trust” on the part of the company.

It’s vital to track the current positions of Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Hedera has recently reached a peak of about $0.40 but is now adjusting. Meanwhile, Toncoin price has slid below its average after hitting $7.20, but it’s expected to recover to around $6.20. In the spotlight, BlockDAG (BDAG) has captured the community’s attention with its proactive steps, highlighted in a recent AMA. The event showcased the launch of an incubator, a substantial grants program, and a new launchpad, among other initiatives. Dive into these developments to get a full grasp of the competitive edge BlockDAG is bringing to the table. Toncoin Price Outlook: A Dip Before a Potential Rise Toncoin price has been on a rollercoaster lately, dipping below its average after a peak at $7.20, hinting at a challenging road ahead. After a decline to $4.78, Toncoin fought back, climbing over $5.00 though still under the average thresholds. A surge above these levels could signal a bullish comeback. On the flip side, a drop beneath the 50-day SMA could ramp up sell-off actions, possibly driving its value down to $3.65. Currently, Toncoin trades around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past the average lines, possibly aiming for $6.20. If it sustains above these lines on the daily chart and overcomes the $6.50 barrier, the upward trend might kick back into gear. Hedera’s Price Movement: A Leap Over $0.40 Hedera’s price has recently surged past a crucial resistance after reaching near $0.40, suggesting the start of a potential upward trajectory. However, it still seeks further confirmation. Just days ago, Hedera bounced from its foundational level, making a significant breakout. The daily chart indicates the beginning of the fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci levels marking essential supports and resistances. After rallying from the 0.382 mark at $0.24, Hedera’s price soared 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI indicating rising momentum from previously high levels, keeping an eye on the Fibonacci resistances becomes essential for anticipating its next moves. BlockDAG Ignites the Blockchain Scene with New Growth Tools BlockDAG, an emerging leader in the layer-1 blockchain arena, has captured the spotlight with its latest AMA, positioning itself as a top trending crypto. This event showcased ambitious plans to enhance its ecosystem and spur development, echoing the early expansion seen in networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is forging ahead with a new launchpad designed to foster the creation of decentralized applications and other projects on the BlockDAG network. This platform is set to catalyze a wide array of initiatives, enhancing engagement and participation across the community. In a bold move, BlockDAG, in collaboration with Hacker Earth, will organize four significant hackathons in 2025, anticipated to attract over 15,000 developers and spark hundreds of projects. Additionally, a robust $10 million grants program is slated to begin in February, offering financial support from $5,000 to $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that meet the criteria. Moreover, an ambassador program is being launched to incorporate global representatives, and a strategic partnership with an incubator will provide mentorship, resources, and guidance, all aimed at propelling promising projects to success on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG’s recent milestones underscore its trajectory of progress. Its ongoing crypto presale has amassed over $176.5 million and distributed over 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in presale batch 27, early participants have seen a staggering 2380% ROI. These initiatives underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to building a robust ecosystem and shaping its path as a prime choice heading into 2025. Wrapping Up: BlockDAG Steals the Spotlight Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to be prominent in the domain of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently surpassing $0.40 and Toncoin price stabilizing around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s strategic endeavors, like the $10 million grants program, a global incubator, and a launchpad for new projects, that are enhancing its allure. The success of the project’s crypto presale , which raised $176.5 million and delivered an impressive 2380% ROI since its inception, positions BlockDAG as an attractive proposition as we move towards 2025. For those keen on engaging with a project that combines solid growth with extensive community involvement, staying updated on these top trending cryptos and grasping the market shifts are crucial.

More than that - the same software that can win the math olympics and write novels can also control physical robots, allowing one digital persona to operate across the digital and physical worlds. So yes, robots walking around your neighborhood, or working alongside you, will have consistent opinions and actions on X/Twitter, on prediction markets, and in the real world. But there’s a major gap. How do we integrate thinking machines into human society, from schools, hospitals, factories to our homes and daily life? Most of the systems we’ve built are for other humans and make strong assumptions of having a fingerprint, parents, and a birthdate, none of which are true for thinking machines. There is also broad uncertainty about how to regulate thinking machines - do we outlaw them, pause their development, or try to limit their ability to synthesize human-intelligible emotions (as in the European Union)? Which regional laws apply to a 200B parameter LLM running on a computer in low earth orbit, that’s controlling the actions of a trading bot, or a physical robot in the New York SEC office on Pearl Street? What is needed is a global system that supports financial transactions, allows humans and computers to come together to vote and set rules, is immutable and public, and is resilient. Fortuitously, thousands of innovators and developers have spent the last 16 years building exactly that - a parallel framework for decentralized governance and finance. From the very beginning, the point was to support “non-geographic communities experimenting with new economic paradigms” by building a system that “doesn't much care who it talks to” ( Satoshi 2/13/09 ). It’s now more clear what that meant - unlike the rest of the human-focused tech, financial, and regulatory stack, blockchains and smart contracts don’t much care if they are being used by humans or thinking machines, and gracefully accommodate all of us. For this reason, decentralized crypto networks offer the vital infrastructure that's needed to allow this burgeoning sector to flourish. The benefits will be tangible across healthcare, education and defense. Several hurdles will need to be overcome. Seamless human machine and machine machine collaboration is essential — especially in high-stakes environments such as transportation, manufacturing, and logistics. Smart contracts enable autonomous machines to discover one another, communicate securely, and form teams to complete complex tasks. Presumably, low latency data exchange (e.g. among robot taxis) will happen off chain, for example in virtual private networks, but the steps leading up to that, such as discovering humans and robots able to drive you to the airport, are well suited for decentralized markets and actions. Scaling solutions such as Optimism will be critical to accommodate these transactions and traffic. The fragmented regulations around the world is another factor slowing innovation. While some jurisdictions such as Ontario are ahead of the curve when it comes to autonomous robotics, most are not. Decentralized governance tackles this by establishing programmable, blockchain-based rule sets that deliver much-needed uniformity. Creating global standards for safety, ethics and operations is critical for ensuring that autonomous robots can be rolled out across borders at scale, without compromising safety or compliance. Decentralized autonomous organizations, otherwise known as DAOs, help accelerate research and development in robotics and AI. Traditional sources of funding are both slow and siloed, holding the industry back. Token-based models such as DeSci DAO platform remove these bottlenecks, while giving everyday investors potential incentives to get involved. Likewise, some of the developing business models for AI involve micropayments and sharing of revenue with data- or model- providers, which can be accommodated with smart contracts. Combined, these advantages will help fast-track the development of autonomous robots, with a plethora of compelling use cases. A new paradigm for robotics and thinking machines It’s easy to fear that cognition is a zero sum game, and that the broad availability of smart machines will directly compete with humans. But the reality is that there are severe shortages of well educated humans in education, healthcare, and many other sectors. Research by UNESCO recently revealed a worldwide teacher shortage that there's an ""urgent need for 44 million primary and secondary teachers worldwide by 2030"" — and that's before you consider the assistants who offer one-on-one support in classrooms and help struggling students to keep up with their peers. Autonomous robots can deliver huge advantages here, tackling significant shortages across the education sector. Imagine a child being able to learn about a complicated concept with a robot sitting next to them, to walk them through a new concept of skill — reinforcing their understanding about a subject while enhancing their social skills. We are used to humans teaching robots, and this being a one way street, but that is changing. Meanwhile, the WHO has warned of a ""health workforce crisis."" There's a total shortfall of 7.2 million professionals across 100 countries — and given the world faces an aging population, this gap is expected to accelerate to 12.9 million by 2035. The industry is facing shortages in critical areas like nursing, primary care, and allied health. This crisis is affecting the quality of care patients receive and threatening the ability of healthcare professionals to do their jobs. From monitoring patients with chronic diseases, assisting surgical procedures, to offering companionship for the elderly, autonomous robots can play a crucial role in alleviating the workloads of nurses and doctors. Without being prompted, they can monitor supplies of medicines and equipment — ordering in additional stock when required. When you factor in other use cases such as transporting medical waste, cleaning treatment rooms and assisting in surgeries, it's clear to see that robotics can drive greater productivity — and consistency — at a time when the healthcare sector needs it. Autonomous systems are already reshaping the defense sector, primarily involving swarms of drones and naval surface assets, and we're barely scratching the surface when it comes to the advantages robotics can bring — executing tasks that may be unsafe or impossible for humans. From prototypes to practical use All of this may seem abstract and straight out of the 22nd century, but Ethereum is being used today to store decision and action guardrails for AIs and robots, and as reported by Coinbase , AI agents are using crypto to transact amongst themselves. The open and auditable structure of decentralized crypto networks allows robotics developers to securely share data, models, and breakthroughs. This accelerates the transition of autonomous robots from prototypes to real-world applications, enabling their deployment in critical areas like hospitals and schools faster than ever. When you walk down the street with a humanoid robot, and people stop and ask - “Hey aren’t you scared” you can tell them - no I’m not, because the laws governing this machine’s actions are public and immutable, and then you can give them the a link to the Ethereum contract address where those rules are stored. Decentralized ledgers can also act as coordination hubs, allowing robots in heterogeneous systems to find one another and coordinate without centralized intermediaries. This is conceptually similar to the standard defence C3 technology (command, communication, and control), except that the infra is decentralized and public. Immutable records ensure that every exchange and action is traceable, creating a trusted foundation for collaboration. For robot-to-robot interactions, smart contracts streamline task allocation and resource sharing, enabling efficient coordination. In robot-to-human interactions, privacy-centric decentralized systems can secure sensitive data, such as biometric or medical information, fostering trust and accountability. This new world may invoke fear - what does this all mean for us? - but everyone reading this article has been working on making it come true for almost 2 decades now, by building the infrastructure that will handle governance, teaming, communication, and coordination of humans with thinking machines.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 23:58:02

However, while Dogecoin gains attention, RCO Finance (RCOF) , a cutting-edge DeFi project is projected to skyrocket from $0.07 to $2, an impressive 28x growth, long before Dogecoin reaches its target. Let’s explore why Dogecoin remains a strong contender, how RCO Finance’s features and market potential make it a standout, and why investors are flocking to this emerging DeFi powerhouse. Dogecoin’s Gradual Ascent to $0.7 Dogecoin has evolved into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, backed by a loyal community and prominent figures like Elon Musk. With its increasing adoption for payments and growing ecosystem, Dogecoin is slowly but steadily working its way toward a price of $0.7. Key Drivers of Dogecoin’s Price Increase Community Support The Dogecoin community remains its strongest asset, driving demand and keeping the project relevant even in bear markets. Elon Musk’s Influence Musk’s frequent mentions of Dogecoin and Tesla’s acceptance of it for certain products have boosted its credibility. Wider Adoption Businesses integrating Dogecoin as a payment option, combined with its low transaction fees, are further solidifying its position in the market. While the Dogecoin price’s journey to $0.7 is promising, its gradual growth rate leaves room for faster-moving projects like RCO Finance to take the spotlight. RCO Finance: From $0.07 to $2, The DeFi Giant in the Making Unlike the Dogecoin price, which relies heavily on hype and community momentum, RCO Finance (RCOF) is an advanced financial platform built on substance, offering revolutionary features that appeal to both novice and expert investors. AI-Powered Investment Strategies RCO Finance uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create personalized investment strategies tailored to individual user goals. This ensures optimal portfolio performance without requiring extensive market knowledge.

KYC-Free Privacy Operating within a KYC-free ecosystem, RCO Finance prioritizes user privacy while offering seamless access to decentralized financial products. Comprehensive Asset Options The platform supports over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, allowing for unparalleled portfolio diversification. High ROI Potential With its token price currently at $0.07 in presale, RCO Finance is expected to reach $2 soon after its launch on major exchanges, a growth trajectory that far outpaces Dogecoin’s projected gains. The RCOF Presale: A Golden Opportunity RCO Finance’s ongoing presale is one of the most talked about in the crypto space. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to hit $2; a remarkable 28x return, shortly after its launch. Why Invest in the Presale? Early Entry Advantage : You get to secure tokens at the lowest possible price. High Growth Potential : A projected jump to $2 ensures exponential returns. Access to Exclusive Features : Early investors gain priority access to RCO Finance’s suite of tools. As the presale progresses, the price will increase, with the next stage set at $0.2142. The time to act is now for investors seeking to maximize their returns. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price is expected to rise above $0.7, its growth trajectory remains gradual, driven by community support and mainstream adoption. On the other hand, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unparalleled ROI potential, with a clear path to $2 from its current presale price of $0.07. For investors, the choice doesn’t have to be binary. A balanced portfolio that includes both Dogecoin for steady gains and RCO Finance for exponential growth ensures exposure to the best of both worlds.

33767162,[object Object],1736294407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Flips Positive As Market Euphoria Increases, A Rally Imminent?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-index-flips-positive/,"With a significant move at the start of the week, Bitcoin has revisited the pivotal $100,000 milestone once again. This move has triggered a wave of fresh optimism among crypto enthusiasts as several key metrics have also seen positive movements alongside the recent upswing. BTC’s Market Dynamics Undergoes A Shift Bitcoin’s market dynamics are showing signs of a bullish shift as the Coinbase Premium Index metric moves in a positive direction . The recent upsurge in Bitcoin’s price appears to have triggered a notable change in the critical metric. This index, which reflects the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other crypto exchanges, often serves as an indicator of increased demand from US-based institutional investors. As the metric turns positive, this shift suggests renewed market confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects, which could catalyze its next price rally. It is important to note that the development comes after the Coinbase Premium Index witnessed a persistent decline, falling to a 12-month low. Just before the US Presidential elections, the metric fell as low as -0.200 in October last year due to increased uncertainty within the sector. Meanwhile, on the last day of 2024, the index dropped even more to about -0.237, the lowest level in the past 12 months. Furthermore, the sharp drop was fueled by heightened selling pressure in the US markets after BTC declined to the $91,500 price level. Typically, a huge decrease in the Coinbase Premium Index can lead to an unfavorable environment for Bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory. With the key metric turning positive for the first time in 2025 in tandem with a surge above $102,000, BTC’s near-term prospects look promising once again. Data from leading on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that the index has risen to nearly 0.001. Addressing the impact of US investors on the market, the platform highlighted that their actions have served as a leading indicator for the crypto market ever since the Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Taded Funds (ETFs) were approved. At 18:04 local time, Coinbase reported a single block outflow of 4,012 BTC, in addition to the Coinbase Premium Index turning positive. These data imply that buying pressure is once again becoming the dominant factor in US investors’ behavior. Upside Momentum Signals More Gains For Bitcoin BTC climbed to about $102,000 on Monday following a renewed upward momentum. This move has triggered a wave of fresh optimism among investors about its short-term and long-term potential. Examining the surge, Titan of Crypto, a market expert, noted that Bitcoin is attempting a key breakout that might fuel its uptrend. Specifically, BTC is attempting a breakout from the Power Law Corridor trend, a bullish pattern that often precedes an upswing. According to the analyst, the Power Law Corridor’s blue line is being tested by BTC, which is currently acting as resistance.

38673253,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671882,1736294415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/38673253.jpeg,Bitcoin At Risk Of Supply Shock As ETF Issues Buy More BTC Than Was Produced In December,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-risk-supply-shock-etf/,"The world’s largest cryptocurrency may be at risk of a supply shock as demand from United States (US) Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has surged far beyond expectations. In December 2024, the volume of BTC acquired through Spot Bitcoin ETFs more than tripled the amount mined during that same month, underscoring the severe imbalance between supply and demand. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Trigger Supply Shock Risks In December 2024, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased an astonishing 51,500 BTC. On the other hand, BTC miners produced only 13,850 coins during the same period, according to data from Blockchain.com. This indicates that Bitcoin ETFs alone purchased nearly four times the amount BTC miners generated and supplied to the market that month. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent According to reports, the demand for ETFs in December was nothing short of extraordinary, exceeding the available supply by approximately 272%. This massive increase in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has raised concerns about a potential BTC supply shock, with analysts suggesting that it could happen soon. Specifically, Lark Davis, a crypto analyst, announced earlier in December that “a massive supply shock is imminent.” The analyst based this alarming forecast on the significant accumulation of BTC from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Davis disclosed that at some point in December, BTC ETFs had bought 21,423 BTC; meanwhile, miners had produced only 3,150 BTC around the same time. The analyst also noted that BTC ETFs globally held approximately 1,311,579 BTC as of December 17, 2024. This amount, valued at $139 billion, accounts for 6.24% of BTC’s total supply of 19.8 million. Given this staggering figure, Davis projects that during peak bull market phases, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could hold 10-20% of BTC’s total supply, raising more concerns about a major supply shock. Concentration Of Spot BTC Inflows In December Data from Glassnode has revealed that Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $4.63 billion in December, almost doubling their 2024 monthly average of $2.77 billion. Notably, Glassnode disclosed that the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows was more concentrated during the first half of the month, while the second half saw outflows, with December 26 being the exception. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Not surprisingly, the timing for this surge and subsequent decline in Bitcoin ETF inflows aligns with BTC’s price movements in December. At the beginning of the month, BTC experienced upward momentum, skyrocketing to a new ATH above $108,000 on December 17, fueled by the bull market hype and soaring demand. However, following this peak, BTC’s price saw a sharp decline, a drop that coincided with the timing of significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, as reported by Glassnode. Despite the surge in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs in December, new data shows that investors have extended their accumulation trend into January 2025. On January 3, investors purchased over $900 million worth of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs acquired an additional 9,500 BTC, worth over $966 million at the current market price.

Although, experts caution that a drop below $400 could indicate a negative trend. Meanwhile, Atua.ai and Bitgert are joining forces to bring AI innovations to Bitgert’s decentralized system, aiming to broaden their role in the web3 ecosystem. In addition, Web3Bay is innovating in Web3 e-commerce with its platform that lets users control the sale and purchase of digital assets, cut down on transaction costs, and participate in governance through its 3BAY token, which is in its presale phase. The token’s anticipated starting price is $0.195, presenting a significant 6430% potential gain for early participants. Bittensor Continues to Trend as Prices Rise \Bittensor’s market performance shows a robust 30% increase over the past three days, driven by strong market interest. The price has crossed the 200-day EMA, with bullish signs from both candlestick formations and RSI divergence suggesting further potential increases. If Bittensor maintains its upward trajectory, the price might exceed $1000. However, given the unpredictable nature of the market, a fall below $400 could lead to a downturn. Despite the positive signs, analysts urge investors to proceed with caution. Atua.ai and Bitgert Collaborate to Boost the Web3 Ecosystem Atua.ai has partnered with Bitgert to integrate AI into Bitgert’s decentralized cryptocurrency platform, enhancing the web3 ecosystem. This partnership is expected to improve trading tools and user experiences by offering AI-driven solutions. Atua.ai users will have easier access to a diverse range of digital assets, which helps increase adoption. Furthermore, Bitgert’s extensive reach will open new opportunities for Atua.ai across various industries such as education, advertising, and entertainment, setting the stage for both entities to expand their brand influence within the web3 space. From Shopping to Governance: How Web3Bay is Shaping the Next Era of E-commerce Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by providing users with authentic ownership and governance. It operates on layer-1 blockchain technology, enabling users to manage their data and transact digital assets, actively shaping the platform’s evolution. In contrast to centralized platforms, Web3Bay empowers its users to make crucial decisions through voting with the 3BAY token, promoting a community-led development that enhances transparency and trust. A major advantage of Web3Bay is its reduced transaction fees. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform significantly lowers the costs usually associated with centralized e-commerce services. This reduction in fees facilitates a more conducive environment for small businesses, fostering a truly global marketplace where users can engage in buying and selling digital assets more affordably. Web3Bay further incentivizes its community by rewarding active users with the 3BAY token. Participation in transactions, staking, and active engagement on the platform are all ways users can earn rewards, contributing to a dedicated and vibrant community. Moreover, Web3Bay accommodates both seasoned crypto users and beginners by supporting widely-used payment methods like PayPal, merging traditional Web2 commerce dynamics with the innovative, decentralized Web3 ecosystem, thus widening its user base. Currently, the 3BAY token is in its presale phase, having already gathered over $460,000. Priced at $0.0039675 during its 3rd stage, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering an astounding potential for a 6430% return on investment for early participants. With Web3Bay poised to revolutionize practical applications, the value of the 3BAY token is expected to see significant growth, promising substantial returns for early investors. Final Thoughts The recent trends in Bittensor suggest growth potential, yet caution is advised due to the market’s instability. Meanwhile, the partnership between Atua.ai and Bitgert is set to enhance the web3 ecosystem with innovative AI applications. However, Web3Bay is making notable progress in the Web3 sector by offering a platform that is community-driven, has lower fees, and connects Web2 with Web3 commerce. With the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.0039675, it is an opportune moment to engage with the Web3Bay ecosystem and potentially benefit from substantial future gains.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 00:22:00

The Seychelles based parent company made this announcement as the platform continues to expand its presence across the Latin American region. Bitfinex Gains DASP License in El Salvador, Strengthening Latin America Presence As reported on X recently, Bitfinex Derivatives has become the latest to obtain a DASP license in El Salvador. With this license, the platform is able to offer its derivatives service through a new subsidiary called Bitfinex Derivatives El Salvador S.A. de C.V. The company statement adds that the users have to agree to the terms in order to continue using the service. The move to El Salvador aligns with Bitfinex’s strategy to strengthen its foothold in Latin America. The company noted its mission to deliver advanced trading solutions. This further reinforces Bukele’s government position as a key player in the crypto economy. The trading platform stated, “To continue to use the Derivative Services on or after this date, you will be required to accept the Bitfinex Derivatives El Salvador S.A. de C.V. terms of service. “ Enhanced Trading Solutions Through Bitfinex Derivatives With the DASP license, Bitfinex will provide innovative derivatives trading services to its users. These services include options, perpetual futures, and other advanced trading instruments. Bitfinex has partnered with providers like Thalex to enhance its offerings and expand accessibility. This licensing ensures compliance with local crypto regulations , providing users with a secure trading environment. The updated framework will attract more institutional and retail traders, boosting its presence in the Latin American region. El Salvador’s Role in the Global Crypto Economy El Salvador has solidified its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. The country pioneered Bitcoin adoption as legal tender in 2021 and continues to grant licenses to crypto platforms. Bitfinex was the first crypto exchange to secure DASP registration in El Salvador in 2021, followed by Bitfinex Securities obtaining a Digital Assets License. Nayib Bukele’s government has been providing encouraging policies and making sound investments in the crypto industry. By the end of December 2024, the Bukele’s government had bought more than 6,000 BTC, which proves it’s focus on the cryptocurrency. Moreover, El Salvador plans to accelerate Bitcoin accumulation, adding to its current reserves valued at approximately $596 million. Despite retiring the Chivo wallet and IMF restrictions limiting Bitcoin use in public transactions, the government remains committed to advancing Bitcoin education and capital market development as part of its strategy.

38674325,https://coingape.com/?p=232447,1736296911,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Canadian Firm Sol Strategies Announces Strategic Investment In Solana,https://coingape.com/canadian-firm-sol-strategies-announces-strategic-investment-in-solana/,"Toronto-based Sol Strategies Inc. has announced a CAD $25 million investment in the Solana ecosystem to bolster its position as a leading player in blockchain staking operations and acquisitions. Sol Strategies Strategic Investment In Solana Sol Strategies, a Canadian publicly traded company, has promised CAD $25 million to the Solana ecosystem through an unsecured revolving credit facility. This financing agreement which has been made at the interest rate of 5% per annum will assist the company in the purchase of Solana tokens (SOL), an expansion of the staking services and the search for strategic acquisitions. The company said that it has in fact utilized $4m from the facility and intends to spend the balance over the next two years. In a press release made by the chief executive officer Leah Wald, the firm aims to boost the returns it offers to its shareholders and at the same advance Solana digital asset. Wald said “This new position in Solana will enable the further development of the ecosystem, and enhance our staking operations.” The credit line is being extended by company chairman and director Antanas Guoga and will be valid until January 6, 2027. Guoga was also optimistic about the capabilities of both Sol Strategies and Solana, focusing on the future of the blockchain. Pivot to Solana Following Rebranding Sol Strategies, formerly called Cypherpunk Holdings, repositioned its business in 2024 and shifted its focus to only build products within the Solana ecosystem. The rebranding was a part of the process when the company aimed to become one of the biggest Solana validators and participants of the ecosystem. During Wald’s tenure at the firm, it sold off non-strategic investments, including its equity interest in Animoca Brands that was once a major investment. Sol Strategies has been able to divert its capital and put it towards buying Solana tokens and its validator business. At the end of the year 2024, the firm had invested in more than 1.5 million SOL tokens, which was worth approximately CAD $450 million. HODL’s symbol has changed to match the company’s focus on Solana, allowing investors to indirectly invest in the blockchain. The analysts have compared this approach to that employed by the firms such as MARA and Riot Platforms where clients get exposure to Bitcoin through mining. SOL’s Growing Role in Web3 Innovation The main advantage of Solana is the high speed of transactions, the prospect of scaling and the possibility to work with DeFi and NFT. As more firms shift their focus to particular blockchain platforms, Solana has become one of the most popular destinations for businesses that want to expand within the Web3 ecosystem. Sol Strategies has already invested more than 140000 SOL tokens that are owned by the company directly, to strengthen Solana network. In this case, the company engages in validator operations to reinforce the blockchain and, at the same time, gain rewards and increase the amount of holdings. The company also detailed its intention to increase its activity in the decentralized finance and liquidity provision space. This strategic expansion is in synergy with the general market dynamics as companies with a focus on blockchain technology direct their investments to high growth platforms. Solana Price Analysis Points To Breakout Solana (SOL) is among the assets that have shown significant rebound over the past few months with the price of the asset forming a V-shaped pattern. At the time of writing, Solana price is trading at $254 with the first barrier at $254.35. According to market analysts, SOL prices could rise to $302 and further to $345.76 if the buying pressure continues. The investment from Sol Strategies comes as Solana is experiencing a surge in investor interest in the blockchain due to its use in DeFi and NFTs. Solana’s ecosystem could be further supported by the company’s CAD $25 million, which may also improve the liquidity and staking of the ecosystem. In its recent announcement, Sol Strategies is also set to gain from the price rise of Solana. The company has high expectations that the blockchain can create sustainable shareholder value owing to its potential for growth.
