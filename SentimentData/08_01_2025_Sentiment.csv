Hayes began his essay by setting a vivid scene from Japan’s Hokkaido ski resorts, likening dangerous backcountry conditions caused by insufficient snow cover over sharp bamboo grass (sasa) to potential market obstacles that could cut short crypto rallies. He observes that 2025 has kicked off amid robust snowfall in Hokkaido—an apt metaphor for what he sees as a liquidity “dumping” that could propel digital asset prices upward. Nonetheless, he warns that the political and fiscal environment in the United States may introduce unexpected hazards. Why March Could Mark The Next Peak For Crypto “As we begin 2025, the question on crypto investors’ minds is whether the Trump pump can continue,” Hayes writes, referencing the initial optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s second term. While Hayes believes “the high expectations for policy action out of the Trump camp set up the market for disappointment,” he maintains that any short-term negativity could be offset by a powerful “dollar liquidity impulse.” Related Reading: Crypto Trader Nets $17 Million From AI Coins: Here’s What He’s Buying Now Hayes underscores that the Fed’s RRP has been critical for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Since the third quarter of 2022, the facility’s unwinding has correlated positively with crypto and equities prices. “Bitcoin bottomed in Q3 2022 when the Fed’s Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) reached its zenith,” he explains, noting that US Treasury Secretary Janet “Bad Gurl” Yellen facilitated a shift from issuing longer-dated coupon bonds to issuing shorter-dated T-bills. This approach, he argues, effectively drained more than $2 trillion from the RRP, injecting liquidity into global markets. Now, with the RRP falling to almost zero, the Fed has “belatedly changed the policy rate of the RRP” to make it less attractive. Hayes points out that it still represents a potential $237 billion injection into markets once the remaining RRP funds move into higher-yielding Treasury bills. Meanwhile, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) removes $60 billion per month, totaling $180 billion between January and March. Netting both factors yields a $57 billion injection over the quarter. Another major focus in Hayes’s thesis is the Treasury General Account. As debt ceiling negotiations loom, the Treasury’s inability to issue new debt means it can only cover expenses by spending down the TGA—an action that releases liquidity. “Because the aggregate amount of debt cannot rise until the US Congress increases the debt ceiling, the Treasury can only spend funds from its checking account, the TGA,” Hayes writes, noting that the balance stands at around $722 billion. Related Reading: This Week’s Top Crypto Catalysts: What Investors Need To Watch He estimates that without a debt ceiling resolution, the TGA could be exhausted by May or June. For crypto markets, the crux of the matter is the timescale for a deal in Congress. The essay highlights Trump’s narrow majority and the likelihood that Republicans who position themselves as fiscally conservative will not grant quick or easy consent. Democrats, Hayes adds, are unlikely to facilitate enabling more spending for a president they oppose—further fueling legislative brinkmanship. According to Hayes’s calculations, TGA drawdowns could release an additional $555 billion from January through March. If combined with the $57 billion net liquidity from the Fed’s RRP and QT adjustments, total dollar liquidity could rise by as much as $612 billion in the first quarter. Hayes zeroes in on March as the critical juncture—when this liquidity surge might begin to wane and expectations for new federal spending or pro-crypto legislation from the Trump administration may not materialize on schedule. “I believe I answered the question I posed at the outset. That is, the sasa of a letdown by team Trump on his proposed pro-crypto and pro-business legislation can be covered by an extremely positive dollar liquidity environment,” he states, before concluding that peak liquidity could subside quickly once the market anticipates the debt ceiling’s resolution and the subsequent refilling of the TGA. From a historical lens, Hayes cites Bitcoin’s price action in 2024, which peaked in mid-March around $73,000, then drifted sideways and tumbled just before the April 15 tax deadline. The reasoning, he suggests, is straightforward: as soon as TGA spending has run its course, the net positive liquidity picture reverts to neutral or negative, leaving risk assets vulnerable. While Hayes acknowledges that Chinese credit expansion, Bank of Japan interest rate policies, and the Trump administration’s potential dollar devaluation strategy against other major currencies or gold could upend his timeline, he trusts that RRP and TGA mechanics are reliable near-term gauges. Crucially, these twin sources of liquidity appear powerful enough to overshadow any disappointment about Trump’s policies until at least the end of March. “None of these major macroeconomic issues can be known a priori, but I have confidence in the math behind how the RRP and TGA balances will change over time,” he says, underscoring that the surging crypto and stock markets since late 2022 align with the massive drain in the RRP. Hayes concludes by suggesting that, historically, markets often provide significant selling opportunities in the first quarter. By springtime, investors might want to take profits and “chill on the beach” while waiting for improved liquidity conditions to re-emerge in the second half of the year. “Right on schedule, just like almost every other year, it will be time to sell in the late stages of the first quarter,” Hayes concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $101,344.

Join One of The Top New Meme Coins to Buy Today,https://thecoinrise.com/couldnt-jump-on-the-popcat-bandwagon-join-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-buy-today/,"If you’ve been anywhere near the crypto world recently, you’ve probably noticed one thing: meme coins are more than just a joke. They’re a cultural phenomenon, a chance to invest in something fun with explosive potential. Over the years, meme coins have turned everyday investors into millionaires, from Dogecoin’s viral rise to Shiba Inu’s domination of the market. And now, the buzz is all about BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new meme coin making waves with its jaw-dropping features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a referral program, and staking rewards boasting an eye-popping 90% APY. But hang on, what about POPCAT, the meme coin that went viral overnight? Let’s dive in and compare these two to see why BTFD Coin deserves the spotlight as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s Breaking All the Rules BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a full-blown ecosystem designed to reward investors from the moment they get in. The presale has been a masterclass in building FOMO, raising over $5 million so far and selling more than 63 billion coins to over 7,800 holders. With a starting price of just $0.000004, BTFD raced through its first 10 presale stages in just two weeks. Now in Stage 13, you can snag it for $0.000142, but don’t sleep on this—the final listing price is $0.0006, meaning there’s still a massive opportunity for early birds. Picture this: a Play-to-Earn game where you’re not just gaming but stacking up real-world rewards. BTFD’s Bulls Squad game brings NFTs to life with interactive gameplay that’s more than just pretty pictures. You collect, trade, and use these NFTs to earn $BTFD, making it a solid win-win for gamers and investors. Who needs regular games when you can make bank while having fun? Alright, let’s talk staking. At a staggering 90% APY, this isn’t just another staking pool. It’s a money machine. Every $1,000 staked could earn you $900 in a year, and that’s without touching the principal. Plus, the BTFD staking program is super easy to use, meaning you don’t need to be some blockchain wizard to start earning. Want to bring your friends along for the ride? With BTFD’s referral program, you can earn extra tokens for every person you convince to join. It’s like getting paid to help your buddies level up—how cool is that? Here’s where it gets juicy. Imagine you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin. That’d get you about 52,816,901 $BTFD. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash would be worth a staggering $31,690. That’s a 322% return. Tell me, where else can you get returns like that? POPCAT (POPCAT): The Viral Challenger POPCAT is another meme coin that’s been turning heads lately, but it’s playing a slightly different game. Launched with a bang thanks to its viral marketing campaigns, POPCAT has quickly captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts, especially those who love its playful homage to internet culture. The coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity. POPCAT’s creators leaned into its meme-worthy origins, using the famous Popcat meme to spark curiosity. Think of it as Dogecoin’s cheeky cousin—cute, relatable, and undeniably viral. And while it’s undoubtedly fun, the question remains: Does it have the depth to go the distance? Unlike BTFD, POPCAT doesn’t offer a robust ecosystem. Sure, it’s fun to hold and watch your portfolio grow when the market gets hyped, but the lack of tangible use cases—like staking or a P2E game—makes it more of a speculative play. That said, its community is passionate, and in crypto, that can sometimes be enough. Crypto analysts are mixed on POPCAT. While some see potential for short-term gains due to its viral nature, others warn of its lack of utility and staying power. Current forecasts suggest modest growth if the hype continues, but it’s not offering the kind of returns BTFD is projected to deliver. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to jump in?

From its 90% APY staking to the Bulls Squad, P2E game, it’s building a meme coin ecosystem that delivers real value, not just laughs. Add to that its referral program and stellar presale performance, and it’s clear why BTFD is topping the charts as one of the top new meme coins to buy today. The window to get in at a discounted price is closing fast. With the presale already in Stage 13 and a listing price of $0.0006 around the corner, the time to act is now.

Ethereum price analysis suggests a potentially significant shift, as the symmetrical triangle formation on the chart may either surge to $3,980 or fall to $2,920, drawing keen interest from market watchers. In the meantime, the Dogecoin price remains near the critical $0.300 mark, leading to discussions on whether it can rebound if this level remains intact. BlockDAG (BDAG) is on an upward path with its Refer & Earn program, which rewards users with 6% to 10% USDT cashback on each transaction, with no limit to how much they can earn. BlockDAG’s impressive presale, which gathered over $176.5 million, along with its scalable rewards and potential for high returns, firmly establishes it among the best crypto to buy right now! Dogecoin Price Stable Amid Potential for Upward Movement The Dogecoin price has recently fallen by 23% over ten days but now teeters at the pivotal $0.300 support. Observers are watching to see if this marks a temporary decline or a move to lower levels. Current trading suggests an effort to maintain the $0.300 level, which could indicate an impending bullish shift if it holds. Trader Tradigrade’s insights on X point to a potential recovery for Dogecoin price, with signs of an upward trend on the horizon. If the price remains above its 20-day EMA, it could draw renewed buying interest, possibly leading to a price increase. However, a drop below $0.300 might trigger increased selling pressure, marking a critical moment for DOGE. Ethereum Price Analysis Indicates a Possible Major Shift Significant attention is on Ethereum price analysis as it currently navigates a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. Technical analyst Carl Runefelt’s recent X post suggests a likely substantial movement. Ethereum price analysis forecasts either a push to $3,980 or a decline to $2,920. The price stabilization around $3,419 shows resilience despite market fluctuations, with critical levels at $3,300 support and $3,550 resistance. The outcome of this pattern could define Ethereum’s immediate market direction, with anticipation building around these pivotal points. BlockDAG’s Cashback Rewards Through Its Refer & Earn Program BlockDAG has revamped the way users benefit with its Refer & Earn USDT system, offering immediate cashback that ranks as one of the most beneficial in the cryptocurrency sphere. Referrers get a 6% cashback on their first referral transaction, which increases to 10% for any additional purchases within the next 24 hours. Buyers also enjoy a steady 6% cashback, ensuring rewards for everyone involved. Since its launch, BlockDAG has collected over $176.5 million from its presale and has distributed over 17.7 billion coins. Currently, each BDAG is valued at $0.0248, providing an impressive 2,380% ROI to early participants. The Refer & Earn system allows unlimited referral rewards with immediate USDT payouts, making it a seamless opportunity for earning. The structure of the referral program is clear-cut, resetting daily at 00:00 UTC to ensure fairness and transparency. The time-sensitive nature of these increased cashback rates has led to strong engagement as users take advantage of the growing rewards for repeated transactions. As the 27th presale batch of BlockDAG nears a sellout, its mix of affordability, community-focused incentives, and scalable rewards mark it as a leading choice among cryptocurrency ventures. The strong metrics from BlockDAG’s performance, combined with the lucrative referral program, highlight it as one of the best cryptos to buy right now for those looking for significant rewards and cashback opportunities. The Bottom Line The crypto market wraps up the fourth quarter with cautious optimism and promising opportunities. Ethereum price analysis points to a crucial moment, with its current symmetrical triangle pattern suggesting a possible major price shift. This could lead to a significant rise to $3,980 or a fall to $2,920, shaping its short-term direction. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price stays in the spotlight, maintaining around the $0.300 support level, with ongoing debates about its potential rise or further drop. BlockDAG continues to draw interest with its interesting Refer & Earn program, known for its unmatched cashback rewards and enhancing its status as the best crypto to buy right now . As 2025 nears, BlockDAG offers numerous opportunities for traders to explore as they strategize on maximizing their returns.

If the U.S. digital assets exchange can get the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to take its appeal and agree that the SEC was wrong about its accusations that Coinbase improperly handled the trading of unregistered securities, such a decision would echo throughout the wider crypto industry. Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York decided on Tuesday to approve a request from Coinbase to ask the higher court to consider one core question in the dispute, in a process known as an interlocutory appeal. And while Coinbase is chasing that matter, the rest of the case will sit idle. Failla noted she doesn't appreciate the company's ""efforts to cast aspersions on the SEC’s approach to crypto-assets,"" but she pointed out the clash in rulings from different federal courts on similar questions and decided that ""conflicting decisions on an important legal issue necessitate the Second Circuit’s guidance."" At the heart of the legal clash between the U.S. securities regulator and the leading U.S. crypto exchange is whether certain tokens traded on the platform should be considered securities, and thus be seen as breaching the law. Coinbase has argued, among other points, that the issuers of crypto tokens traded on its secondary market don't owe anything to the buyers, so the tokens don't tick the boxes of the legal standard for what makes a security, the so-called Howey test. The judge said she's granting the April 2024 request ""because it presents a controlling question of law regarding the reach and application of Howey to crypto-assets, about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and the resolution of which would advance the ultimate termination of the SEC’s enforcement action."" ""We appreciate the court's careful consideration,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal posted on social-media site X . ""On to the Second Circuit we go.""

In the end, this and other court disputes over what constitutes a crypto security could head toward the Supreme Court but finally run into irrelevance if Congress passes a new law to define how the assets and their trading should be regulated in the U.S. That's what the industry is aiming for with its political operations and lobbying efforts, focusing on steering this year's new Congress toward more industry-friendly legislation. The SEC's leadership is also about to change hands to Republican control, which is likely to mean more openness to the crypto industry.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-07 22:42:00

The AI firm also reportedly closed a deal with Panasonic to integrate its artificial intelligence models into the legacy electronics maker’s products. Artificial Intelligence firms had a strong year in 2024, and they look to have picked up the pace already in 2025. AI has become an umbrella that can include so many specialties and disciplines. AI Agents now operate X (formerly Twitter) accounts, can solve complex issues, and some, like Anthropic’s Claude, can browse Chrome as a human would. Anthropic is the latest beneficiary of the FOMO as it steals some of the shine from global leaders like OpenAI and Gemini. Panasonic teams up with Anthropic to release AI-enhanced family wellness coaching app Panasonic announced its partnership with Anthropic during the CES 2025 event. The app will be called Umi, and it is designed to help family members “care, coordinate, and connect” with one another. It is also supposed to help the family as a whole set goals like spending mealtime together or being more physically active, creating routines, and managing communal tasks. The user can preset goals via the app’s natural language voice interface. Panasonic reportedly aims for the app’s target audience to be families with members of all ages. The company stated during its CES demo that Umi can easily support caregivers by keeping them informed of the habits of elderly family members. Claude will not have autonomy over recommending advice because Panasonic plans to incorporate a wide range of wellness experts to help users establish and maintain healthy habits and routines. Umi will reportedly hit US markets later this year. Panasonic will make the app available to other members of its Panasonic Well’s Partner Collective, including Aaptiv, Precision Nutrition, SleepScore Labs, Addition Wealth, BlueApron, and Calm, so it is likely users will see its AI capabilities integrated into related products as well. The electronics company also plans to integrate Claude into other customer-facing systems like customer service, sales, and marketing. Panasonic also introduced its new “Panasonic Go” initiative, which is supposed to fast-track “AI-driven innovation” within the company. The firm has what some users on X have called ambitious plans, as it expects 30% of its revenue to come from “AI-driven hardware, software, and solution businesses” by 2030. Anthropic in advanced talks to raise $2 billion According to a Tuesday WSJ report , the AI startup is in advanced talks to raise $2 billion in a deal that would raise its valuation to $60 billion. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, revealed in 2023 it had secured a $500 million investment from Alphabet, which promised to invest another $1.5 billion over time. Amazon has also now invested a total of about $8 billion into Anthropic, with the latest investment being an immediate pledge of $1.25 billion, with the remaining $2.75 billion in funding expected to arrive this year. Amazon has serious stakes in the AI firm. Anthropic named Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. It is also using AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its models. This new investment means Amazon retains its minority stake in the startup. In November 2024, Anthropic revealed its model context protocol. It is a flagship product that allows Claude to integrate with tools like Google Maps and Google Calendar, meaning it can create an app or chatbot to take care of tasks like locating lunch spots, scheduling meetings, or even making restaurant reservations, according to Mike Barret, founder and chief strategy officer at ad agency Supernatural AI. “Anthropic is finding ways to make their AI more useful,” Barret said. This development pushes the company closer to making large language models more than just information providers but also doers that can take actionable steps across platforms.

A widely followed business survey data release, meanwhile, came in stronger-than-expected, suggestive that the dominant US service sector remains in rude health. As traders upped their bets on continued US economic strength, higher inflation ahead and fewer rate cuts from the Fed, long-term US bond yields jumped, with the US 10-year hitting its highest levels since April 2024 near 4.7%. That weighed on risk assets across the board – high yields in the market’s benchmark “risk free” asset tends to weigh on assets, and the riskier these assets are viewed, the more they are likely to decline. That explains why major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , which many traders view as a risk/liquidity play, are so sensitive to macro repricing events like this. With the Ethereum price now down roughly 10% from Monday’s highs in the mid-$3,700s, traders are asking is a new price collapse is here. Will Ethereum soon dump below $3,000, threatening an end to the post-Trump election victory bull run? Will Macro Headwinds Drive Ethereum Price Under $3,000? Macro has certainly been a major headwind to the crypto market, and broader risk assets, since the Fed’s hawkish policy meeting in mid-December. The central bank is clearly now more sensitive now to data that implies stickiness in inflation and economic strength, as Tuesday’s data did. The argument for more rate cuts in 2025 is increasingly weak, and could yet weaken further if Friday’s official US jobs report for December also comes in stronger than expected. That could add to the current market headwinds, and keep major cryptocurrencies, like the Ethereum price, on the defensive. In the medium-term, its tough to argue that easing liquidity conditions will be a major tailwind for crypto in 2025. The Fed continues to shrink its balance sheet following its 2020/2021 QE splurge. And indices of US liquidity show conditions have been broadly unchanged since around mid-2022. Arthur Hayes USD Liquidity Index , which is calculated by taking the Fed’s balance sheet minus the US Treasury General Account balance at the NY Fed plus the amount of accepted reverse repo bids at the NY Fed, shows US liquidity of currently around $6 trillion, still well below its late 2021 peaks in the $7 trillion region. US economic conditions, at least how they seem right now, likely mean the Fed won’t embark on substantial easing, and liquidity will likely remain around current levels in 2025. Analysts expecting 2025 to be a repeat of the kinds of moves seen during 2020/2021’s zero interest rate/QE fueled bull run may be left disappointed. All said, should financial conditions continue to tighten (seen by a further rise in US yields), then yes, Ethereum could certainly crash back below $3,000 in the short-term. But does a lack of incoming liquidity in 2025 mean the bull market is dead? Probably not. Here’s why. Ethereum Under $3,000, Buy The Dip? If the Ethereum price was to dump below $3,000 in the short-term, this could be a great opportunity for investors to accumulate more aggressively. Yes, liquidity conditions right now aren’t likely to be a big tailwind for crypto in 2025, but that could change in the coming years. More important, however, is the upcoming pro-crypto shift in the regulatory and adoption landscape in the US this year. Simply put, the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration is set to usher in a new golden age for the US crypto industry and markets more broadly. The US might be on the cusp of the establishment of an official Bitcoin reserve , which could kickstart a global race to accumulate the asset. This would be a huge headwind to the whole market. And even if that doesn’t happen, the Trump administration is packed with pro-crypto advocates that are set to create a better environment in the US for innovation and growth. 13 days until Gary Gensler steps down. 13 days until the most pro-crypto administration in history takes office. Trump’s cabinet is set to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital of the world.' Here’s everything you need to know about it pic.twitter.com/xVJLnzOoLN — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) January 7, 2025 Most importantly, anti-crypto zealot SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to leave the agency in under two weeks, and Trump’s proposed replacement is expected to end the agency’s crusade to destroy the industry. INTEL: Gary Gensler will step down as SEC Chair in 13 days — Solid Intel (@solidintel_x) January 7, 2025 This is particularly good news for the altcoin sector, which was hit hardest by the SEC’s regulation by enforcement drive in recent years. Trump and his family are also known supporters of Ethereum, owning the crypto in substantial amounts, and even launching a token on its blockchain. So yes, liquidity might not be a major factor this year, but 2025 could be crypto’s best-ever year in terms of gaining broader adoption and acceptance. Ethereum’s position as the only major altcoin with a spot ETF in the US, BlackRock’s anointed altcoin of choice, and the still undisputed kind of DeFi sets it up for a strong year.

Tokyo-based SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Japan’s SBI Group, has announced an agreement with a community of Solana supporters on the archipelago to give away an exclusive Solana-based NFT. SBI to give away Solana NFT to wallet holders The financial giant has agreed to give an NFT “present” to users of its SBI Web3 Wallet, with the aim of promoting the growth of Solana in Japan in 2025, in a joint campaign with Solana Superteam Japan , which is supported by the Solana foundation. The campaign is currently active and lasts until January 20th. “New Year NFT Present Campaign” Source: SBI Holdings. According to SBI’s press release (translated by Google): “This NFT represents the construction of the Web3 world centered on the Solana economy with a fortress-like structure, and the first sunrise viewed from the structure represents the dawn of a new Web3.” The NFT was designed by Solana Superteam Japan. Interestingly, the design is somewhat dystopian in appearance, with what appears to be “TOKYO STUPID GAMES” written in orange on the underside of the fortress balcony. SBI’s Web3 Wallet allows users in Japan to trade NFTs using Japanese yen, opening the market even to those who are not crypto-savvy. While the news is indeed bullish for fans of SBI and Solana, there are some caveats. Anons, true NFT degens, and fans of permissionless peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in the nation can count themselves out, as SBI’s Web3 Wallet requires an SBI VC Trade account, identification documents, and a stringent KYC (know-your-customer) process. For Solana fans looking for fun, volatile speculation, or just a middle finger to everyone (including themselves?), Fartcoin might be a better option for the new year.

WEMIX token prices since 2021. (Source: CoinGecko) The employees, some of whom still work at WeMade, are seeking damages of around $11 million. The group comprises members of the Wemade Tree subsidiary, WeMade’s former blockchain arm. The firm successfully developed WEMIX, which was first listed on crypto exchanges in 2020. WeMade then merged with WeMade Tree in February 2022.

They also claimed that the company had sent an email to the staffers “clearly promising them token compensation.” But WeMade’s attorney said that the plaintiffs’ claims centered on “a verbal contract” regarding token bonuses. However, the WeMade legal team denied that any such “verbal contract was concluded.” It also claimed the firm “only provided guidance” on “basic compensation plans.” The WeMade legal team lawyers said that “at the time, there were no established industry standards” for “firms to handle accounting conducted in crypto.” The same team said that “after discussing various matters at the company,” executives “realized that [crypto bonuses] would be burdensome” because “accounting standards were so unclear.” The WeMade legal team suggested the firm still intends to launch a WEMIX token bonus program “through consultation with company employees.” However, the plaintiffs said there had been a “criminal breach of trust” on the part of the company.

It’s vital to track the current positions of Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Hedera has recently reached a peak of about $0.40 but is now adjusting. Meanwhile, Toncoin price has slid below its average after hitting $7.20, but it’s expected to recover to around $6.20. In the spotlight, BlockDAG (BDAG) has captured the community’s attention with its proactive steps, highlighted in a recent AMA. The event showcased the launch of an incubator, a substantial grants program, and a new launchpad, among other initiatives. Dive into these developments to get a full grasp of the competitive edge BlockDAG is bringing to the table. Toncoin Price Outlook: A Dip Before a Potential Rise Toncoin price has been on a rollercoaster lately, dipping below its average after a peak at $7.20, hinting at a challenging road ahead. After a decline to $4.78, Toncoin fought back, climbing over $5.00 though still under the average thresholds. A surge above these levels could signal a bullish comeback. On the flip side, a drop beneath the 50-day SMA could ramp up sell-off actions, possibly driving its value down to $3.65. Currently, Toncoin trades around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past the average lines, possibly aiming for $6.20. If it sustains above these lines on the daily chart and overcomes the $6.50 barrier, the upward trend might kick back into gear. Hedera’s Price Movement: A Leap Over $0.40 Hedera’s price has recently surged past a crucial resistance after reaching near $0.40, suggesting the start of a potential upward trajectory. However, it still seeks further confirmation. Just days ago, Hedera bounced from its foundational level, making a significant breakout. The daily chart indicates the beginning of the fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci levels marking essential supports and resistances. After rallying from the 0.382 mark at $0.24, Hedera’s price soared 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI indicating rising momentum from previously high levels, keeping an eye on the Fibonacci resistances becomes essential for anticipating its next moves. BlockDAG Ignites the Blockchain Scene with New Growth Tools BlockDAG, an emerging leader in the layer-1 blockchain arena, has captured the spotlight with its latest AMA, positioning itself as a top trending crypto. This event showcased ambitious plans to enhance its ecosystem and spur development, echoing the early expansion seen in networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is forging ahead with a new launchpad designed to foster the creation of decentralized applications and other projects on the BlockDAG network. This platform is set to catalyze a wide array of initiatives, enhancing engagement and participation across the community. In a bold move, BlockDAG, in collaboration with Hacker Earth, will organize four significant hackathons in 2025, anticipated to attract over 15,000 developers and spark hundreds of projects. Additionally, a robust $10 million grants program is slated to begin in February, offering financial support from $5,000 to $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that meet the criteria. Moreover, an ambassador program is being launched to incorporate global representatives, and a strategic partnership with an incubator will provide mentorship, resources, and guidance, all aimed at propelling promising projects to success on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG’s recent milestones underscore its trajectory of progress. Its ongoing crypto presale has amassed over $176.5 million and distributed over 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in presale batch 27, early participants have seen a staggering 2380% ROI. These initiatives underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to building a robust ecosystem and shaping its path as a prime choice heading into 2025. Wrapping Up: BlockDAG Steals the Spotlight Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to be prominent in the domain of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently surpassing $0.40 and Toncoin price stabilizing around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s strategic endeavors, like the $10 million grants program, a global incubator, and a launchpad for new projects, that are enhancing its allure. The success of the project’s crypto presale , which raised $176.5 million and delivered an impressive 2380% ROI since its inception, positions BlockDAG as an attractive proposition as we move towards 2025. For those keen on engaging with a project that combines solid growth with extensive community involvement, staying updated on these top trending cryptos and grasping the market shifts are crucial.

More than that - the same software that can win the math olympics and write novels can also control physical robots, allowing one digital persona to operate across the digital and physical worlds. So yes, robots walking around your neighborhood, or working alongside you, will have consistent opinions and actions on X/Twitter, on prediction markets, and in the real world. But there’s a major gap. How do we integrate thinking machines into human society, from schools, hospitals, factories to our homes and daily life? Most of the systems we’ve built are for other humans and make strong assumptions of having a fingerprint, parents, and a birthdate, none of which are true for thinking machines. There is also broad uncertainty about how to regulate thinking machines - do we outlaw them, pause their development, or try to limit their ability to synthesize human-intelligible emotions (as in the European Union)? Which regional laws apply to a 200B parameter LLM running on a computer in low earth orbit, that’s controlling the actions of a trading bot, or a physical robot in the New York SEC office on Pearl Street? What is needed is a global system that supports financial transactions, allows humans and computers to come together to vote and set rules, is immutable and public, and is resilient. Fortuitously, thousands of innovators and developers have spent the last 16 years building exactly that - a parallel framework for decentralized governance and finance. From the very beginning, the point was to support “non-geographic communities experimenting with new economic paradigms” by building a system that “doesn't much care who it talks to” ( Satoshi 2/13/09 ). It’s now more clear what that meant - unlike the rest of the human-focused tech, financial, and regulatory stack, blockchains and smart contracts don’t much care if they are being used by humans or thinking machines, and gracefully accommodate all of us. For this reason, decentralized crypto networks offer the vital infrastructure that's needed to allow this burgeoning sector to flourish. The benefits will be tangible across healthcare, education and defense. Several hurdles will need to be overcome. Seamless human machine and machine machine collaboration is essential — especially in high-stakes environments such as transportation, manufacturing, and logistics. Smart contracts enable autonomous machines to discover one another, communicate securely, and form teams to complete complex tasks. Presumably, low latency data exchange (e.g. among robot taxis) will happen off chain, for example in virtual private networks, but the steps leading up to that, such as discovering humans and robots able to drive you to the airport, are well suited for decentralized markets and actions. Scaling solutions such as Optimism will be critical to accommodate these transactions and traffic. The fragmented regulations around the world is another factor slowing innovation. While some jurisdictions such as Ontario are ahead of the curve when it comes to autonomous robotics, most are not. Decentralized governance tackles this by establishing programmable, blockchain-based rule sets that deliver much-needed uniformity. Creating global standards for safety, ethics and operations is critical for ensuring that autonomous robots can be rolled out across borders at scale, without compromising safety or compliance. Decentralized autonomous organizations, otherwise known as DAOs, help accelerate research and development in robotics and AI. Traditional sources of funding are both slow and siloed, holding the industry back. Token-based models such as DeSci DAO platform remove these bottlenecks, while giving everyday investors potential incentives to get involved. Likewise, some of the developing business models for AI involve micropayments and sharing of revenue with data- or model- providers, which can be accommodated with smart contracts. Combined, these advantages will help fast-track the development of autonomous robots, with a plethora of compelling use cases. A new paradigm for robotics and thinking machines It’s easy to fear that cognition is a zero sum game, and that the broad availability of smart machines will directly compete with humans. But the reality is that there are severe shortages of well educated humans in education, healthcare, and many other sectors. Research by UNESCO recently revealed a worldwide teacher shortage that there's an ""urgent need for 44 million primary and secondary teachers worldwide by 2030"" — and that's before you consider the assistants who offer one-on-one support in classrooms and help struggling students to keep up with their peers. Autonomous robots can deliver huge advantages here, tackling significant shortages across the education sector. Imagine a child being able to learn about a complicated concept with a robot sitting next to them, to walk them through a new concept of skill — reinforcing their understanding about a subject while enhancing their social skills. We are used to humans teaching robots, and this being a one way street, but that is changing. Meanwhile, the WHO has warned of a ""health workforce crisis."" There's a total shortfall of 7.2 million professionals across 100 countries — and given the world faces an aging population, this gap is expected to accelerate to 12.9 million by 2035. The industry is facing shortages in critical areas like nursing, primary care, and allied health. This crisis is affecting the quality of care patients receive and threatening the ability of healthcare professionals to do their jobs. From monitoring patients with chronic diseases, assisting surgical procedures, to offering companionship for the elderly, autonomous robots can play a crucial role in alleviating the workloads of nurses and doctors. Without being prompted, they can monitor supplies of medicines and equipment — ordering in additional stock when required. When you factor in other use cases such as transporting medical waste, cleaning treatment rooms and assisting in surgeries, it's clear to see that robotics can drive greater productivity — and consistency — at a time when the healthcare sector needs it. Autonomous systems are already reshaping the defense sector, primarily involving swarms of drones and naval surface assets, and we're barely scratching the surface when it comes to the advantages robotics can bring — executing tasks that may be unsafe or impossible for humans. From prototypes to practical use All of this may seem abstract and straight out of the 22nd century, but Ethereum is being used today to store decision and action guardrails for AIs and robots, and as reported by Coinbase , AI agents are using crypto to transact amongst themselves. The open and auditable structure of decentralized crypto networks allows robotics developers to securely share data, models, and breakthroughs. This accelerates the transition of autonomous robots from prototypes to real-world applications, enabling their deployment in critical areas like hospitals and schools faster than ever. When you walk down the street with a humanoid robot, and people stop and ask - “Hey aren’t you scared” you can tell them - no I’m not, because the laws governing this machine’s actions are public and immutable, and then you can give them the a link to the Ethereum contract address where those rules are stored. Decentralized ledgers can also act as coordination hubs, allowing robots in heterogeneous systems to find one another and coordinate without centralized intermediaries. This is conceptually similar to the standard defence C3 technology (command, communication, and control), except that the infra is decentralized and public. Immutable records ensure that every exchange and action is traceable, creating a trusted foundation for collaboration. For robot-to-robot interactions, smart contracts streamline task allocation and resource sharing, enabling efficient coordination. In robot-to-human interactions, privacy-centric decentralized systems can secure sensitive data, such as biometric or medical information, fostering trust and accountability. This new world may invoke fear - what does this all mean for us? - but everyone reading this article has been working on making it come true for almost 2 decades now, by building the infrastructure that will handle governance, teaming, communication, and coordination of humans with thinking machines.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-07 23:58:02

However, while Dogecoin gains attention, RCO Finance (RCOF) , a cutting-edge DeFi project is projected to skyrocket from $0.07 to $2, an impressive 28x growth, long before Dogecoin reaches its target. Let’s explore why Dogecoin remains a strong contender, how RCO Finance’s features and market potential make it a standout, and why investors are flocking to this emerging DeFi powerhouse. Dogecoin’s Gradual Ascent to $0.7 Dogecoin has evolved into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies, backed by a loyal community and prominent figures like Elon Musk. With its increasing adoption for payments and growing ecosystem, Dogecoin is slowly but steadily working its way toward a price of $0.7. Key Drivers of Dogecoin’s Price Increase Community Support The Dogecoin community remains its strongest asset, driving demand and keeping the project relevant even in bear markets. Elon Musk’s Influence Musk’s frequent mentions of Dogecoin and Tesla’s acceptance of it for certain products have boosted its credibility. Wider Adoption Businesses integrating Dogecoin as a payment option, combined with its low transaction fees, are further solidifying its position in the market. While the Dogecoin price’s journey to $0.7 is promising, its gradual growth rate leaves room for faster-moving projects like RCO Finance to take the spotlight. RCO Finance: From $0.07 to $2, The DeFi Giant in the Making Unlike the Dogecoin price, which relies heavily on hype and community momentum, RCO Finance (RCOF) is an advanced financial platform built on substance, offering revolutionary features that appeal to both novice and expert investors. AI-Powered Investment Strategies RCO Finance uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create personalized investment strategies tailored to individual user goals.

KYC-Free Privacy Operating within a KYC-free ecosystem, RCO Finance prioritizes user privacy while offering seamless access to decentralized financial products. Comprehensive Asset Options The platform supports over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, allowing for unparalleled portfolio diversification. High ROI Potential With its token price currently at $0.07 in presale, RCO Finance is expected to reach $2 soon after its launch on major exchanges, a growth trajectory that far outpaces Dogecoin’s projected gains. The RCOF Presale: A Golden Opportunity RCO Finance’s ongoing presale is one of the most talked about in the crypto space. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to hit $2; a remarkable 28x return, shortly after its launch. Why Invest in the Presale? Early Entry Advantage : You get to secure tokens at the lowest possible price. High Growth Potential : A projected jump to $2 ensures exponential returns. Access to Exclusive Features : Early investors gain priority access to RCO Finance’s suite of tools. As the presale progresses, the price will increase, with the next stage set at $0.2142. The time to act is now for investors seeking to maximize their returns. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price is expected to rise above $0.7, its growth trajectory remains gradual, driven by community support and mainstream adoption. On the other hand, RCO Finance (RCOF) offers unparalleled ROI potential, with a clear path to $2 from its current presale price of $0.07. For investors, the choice doesn’t have to be binary. A balanced portfolio that includes both Dogecoin for steady gains and RCO Finance for exponential growth ensures exposure to the best of both worlds.

In December 2024, the volume of BTC acquired through Spot Bitcoin ETFs more than tripled the amount mined during that same month, underscoring the severe imbalance between supply and demand. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Trigger Supply Shock Risks In December 2024, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased an astonishing 51,500 BTC. On the other hand, BTC miners produced only 13,850 coins during the same period, according to data from Blockchain.com. This indicates that Bitcoin ETFs alone purchased nearly four times the amount BTC miners generated and supplied to the market that month. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gaussian Channel Turns Green On The 4-Hour Chart, Why A New ATH Above $1 Is Imminent According to reports, the demand for ETFs in December was nothing short of extraordinary, exceeding the available supply by approximately 272%. This massive increase in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs has raised concerns about a potential BTC supply shock, with analysts suggesting that it could happen soon. Specifically, Lark Davis, a crypto analyst, announced earlier in December that “a massive supply shock is imminent.” The analyst based this alarming forecast on the significant accumulation of BTC from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Davis disclosed that at some point in December, BTC ETFs had bought 21,423 BTC; meanwhile, miners had produced only 3,150 BTC around the same time. The analyst also noted that BTC ETFs globally held approximately 1,311,579 BTC as of December 17, 2024. This amount, valued at $139 billion, accounts for 6.24% of BTC’s total supply of 19.8 million. Given this staggering figure, Davis projects that during peak bull market phases, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could hold 10-20% of BTC’s total supply, raising more concerns about a major supply shock. Concentration Of Spot BTC Inflows In December Data from Glassnode has revealed that Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $4.63 billion in December, almost doubling their 2024 monthly average of $2.77 billion. Notably, Glassnode disclosed that the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows was more concentrated during the first half of the month, while the second half saw outflows, with December 26 being the exception. Related Reading: XRP Price Sets Bullish Flag Continuation On The Daily Chart, Next Stop $10? Not surprisingly, the timing for this surge and subsequent decline in Bitcoin ETF inflows aligns with BTC’s price movements in December. At the beginning of the month, BTC experienced upward momentum, skyrocketing to a new ATH above $108,000 on December 17, fueled by the bull market hype and soaring demand. However, following this peak, BTC’s price saw a sharp decline, a drop that coincided with the timing of significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, as reported by Glassnode. Despite the surge in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs in December, new data shows that investors have extended their accumulation trend into January 2025. On January 3, investors purchased over $900 million worth of BTC through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs acquired an additional 9,500 BTC, worth over $966 million at the current market price.

Although, experts caution that a drop below $400 could indicate a negative trend. Meanwhile, Atua.ai and Bitgert are joining forces to bring AI innovations to Bitgert’s decentralized system, aiming to broaden their role in the web3 ecosystem. In addition, Web3Bay is innovating in Web3 e-commerce with its platform that lets users control the sale and purchase of digital assets, cut down on transaction costs, and participate in governance through its 3BAY token, which is in its presale phase. The token’s anticipated starting price is $0.195, presenting a significant 6430% potential gain for early participants. Bittensor Continues to Trend as Prices Rise \Bittensor’s market performance shows a robust 30% increase over the past three days, driven by strong market interest. The price has crossed the 200-day EMA, with bullish signs from both candlestick formations and RSI divergence suggesting further potential increases. If Bittensor maintains its upward trajectory, the price might exceed $1000. However, given the unpredictable nature of the market, a fall below $400 could lead to a downturn. Despite the positive signs, analysts urge investors to proceed with caution. Atua.ai and Bitgert Collaborate to Boost the Web3 Ecosystem Atua.ai has partnered with Bitgert to integrate AI into Bitgert’s decentralized cryptocurrency platform, enhancing the web3 ecosystem. This partnership is expected to improve trading tools and user experiences by offering AI-driven solutions. Atua.ai users will have easier access to a diverse range of digital assets, which helps increase adoption. Furthermore, Bitgert’s extensive reach will open new opportunities for Atua.ai across various industries such as education, advertising, and entertainment, setting the stage for both entities to expand their brand influence within the web3 space. From Shopping to Governance: How Web3Bay is Shaping the Next Era of E-commerce Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by providing users with authentic ownership and governance. It operates on layer-1 blockchain technology, enabling users to manage their data and transact digital assets, actively shaping the platform’s evolution. In contrast to centralized platforms, Web3Bay empowers its users to make crucial decisions through voting with the 3BAY token, promoting a community-led development that enhances transparency and trust. A major advantage of Web3Bay is its reduced transaction fees. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform significantly lowers the costs usually associated with centralized e-commerce services. This reduction in fees facilitates a more conducive environment for small businesses, fostering a truly global marketplace where users can engage in buying and selling digital assets more affordably. Web3Bay further incentivizes its community by rewarding active users with the 3BAY token. Participation in transactions, staking, and active engagement on the platform are all ways users can earn rewards, contributing to a dedicated and vibrant community. Moreover, Web3Bay accommodates both seasoned crypto users and beginners by supporting widely-used payment methods like PayPal, merging traditional Web2 commerce dynamics with the innovative, decentralized Web3 ecosystem, thus widening its user base. Currently, the 3BAY token is in its presale phase, having already gathered over $460,000. Priced at $0.0039675 during its 3rd stage, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering an astounding potential for a 6430% return on investment for early participants. With Web3Bay poised to revolutionize practical applications, the value of the 3BAY token is expected to see significant growth, promising substantial returns for early investors. Final Thoughts The recent trends in Bittensor suggest growth potential, yet caution is advised due to the market’s instability. Meanwhile, the partnership between Atua.ai and Bitgert is set to enhance the web3 ecosystem with innovative AI applications. However, Web3Bay is making notable progress in the Web3 sector by offering a platform that is community-driven, has lower fees, and connects Web2 with Web3 commerce. With the 3BAY token currently priced at $0.0039675, it is an opportune moment to engage with the Web3Bay ecosystem and potentially benefit from substantial future gains.

The meme coin world has always been full of surprises. From Dogecoin’s rise to fame to Shiba Inu’s record-breaking journey, the crypto space has seen coins go from mere jokes to massive investment opportunities. Shiba Inu made history as one of the most recognised meme coins, backed by its strong community and ecosystem. But as the crypto world evolves, new players like BTFD Coin ($BTFD) are emerging with innovative features that could make them the best new meme coins to join this week. BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s shaping the future of the space with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking programme, and a strong community known as the Bulls Squad. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin might be your next big opportunity and how it stands out in a market once dominated by Shiba Inu. BTFD Coin: Combining Innovation and Community Power BTFD Coin is creating buzz not only because of its $5 million presale milestone but also for its groundbreaking Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that launched on January 1, 2025. This P2E game is a central piece of its ecosystem, offering players the chance to earn $BTFD tokens by completing challenges, competing on leaderboards, and unlocking rewards. It’s more than a game—it’s a platform where investment and entertainment merge seamlessly. The 90% APY staking programme is another major highlight, giving investors an unmatched opportunity for passive income. For instance, if you invest $12,000 during Stage 13 at $0.000142 per token, you’ll secure approximately 84,507,042 $BTFD tokens. By staking these tokens for a year, you could earn an additional 76,056,337 tokens. If BTFD reaches its projected listing price of $0.0006, the total value of your investment could soar to $96,339. Beyond these features, the Bulls Squad—a growing community of over 7,800 holders—is the backbone of BTFD’s success. With a vibrant network of supporters driving the project’s visibility, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Buying $BTFD is quick and easy. Start by setting up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Visit the official BTFD Coin presale page , connect your wallet, and select your investment amount. Confirm your purchase, and once the presale ends, your tokens will be available to claim. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That Made History Shiba Inu entered the crypto space in 2020 as a community-driven token with big ambitions. Over time, it has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem with features like ShibaSwap, its decentralised exchange, and strategic initiatives like token burns to manage supply. These efforts have cemented its place as a pioneer in the meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s growth is a testament to the power of community and innovation. Its ability to transform from a simple meme coin to a recognised digital currency shows the potential that lies within this space. But while Shiba Inu continues to thrive, newer coins like BTFD are stepping in with fresh ideas, signalling that the meme coin landscape is far from static. The Final Thoughts Based on market trends and the growing excitement around BTFD Coin, it’s clear that this project has all the ingredients for success. Shiba Inu might have set the stage for meme coin dominance, but BTFD Coin is ready to take things to the next level. With its P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a dedicated community, it’s shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Don’t miss out on this chance to secure your spot in one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of the revolution.

Pepe Eats SUI (PEPESUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Eats SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Eats SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Eats SUI launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Eats SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Eats SUI by entering its contract address – 2bHEDqPL1Y163dismYu4Ft3UT6Dbet9YwjHggGPoVje7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|SUI,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 00:22:00

The Seychelles based parent company made this announcement as the platform continues to expand its presence across the Latin American region. Bitfinex Gains DASP License in El Salvador, Strengthening Latin America Presence As reported on X recently, Bitfinex Derivatives has become the latest to obtain a DASP license in El Salvador. With this license, the platform is able to offer its derivatives service through a new subsidiary called Bitfinex Derivatives El Salvador S.A. de C.V. The company statement adds that the users have to agree to the terms in order to continue using the service. The move to El Salvador aligns with Bitfinex’s strategy to strengthen its foothold in Latin America. The company noted its mission to deliver advanced trading solutions. This further reinforces Bukele’s government position as a key player in the crypto economy. The trading platform stated, “To continue to use the Derivative Services on or after this date, you will be required to accept the Bitfinex Derivatives El Salvador S.A. de C.V. terms of service. “ Enhanced Trading Solutions Through Bitfinex Derivatives With the DASP license, Bitfinex will provide innovative derivatives trading services to its users.

El Salvador’s Role in the Global Crypto Economy El Salvador has solidified its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. The country pioneered Bitcoin adoption as legal tender in 2021 and continues to grant licenses to crypto platforms. Bitfinex was the first crypto exchange to secure DASP registration in El Salvador in 2021, followed by Bitfinex Securities obtaining a Digital Assets License. Nayib Bukele’s government has been providing encouraging policies and making sound investments in the crypto industry. By the end of December 2024, the Bukele’s government had bought more than 6,000 BTC, which proves it’s focus on the cryptocurrency. Moreover, El Salvador plans to accelerate Bitcoin accumulation, adding to its current reserves valued at approximately $596 million. Despite retiring the Chivo wallet and IMF restrictions limiting Bitcoin use in public transactions, the government remains committed to advancing Bitcoin education and capital market development as part of its strategy.

Wald said “This new position in Solana will enable the further development of the ecosystem, and enhance our staking operations.” The credit line is being extended by company chairman and director Antanas Guoga and will be valid until January 6, 2027. Guoga was also optimistic about the capabilities of both Sol Strategies and Solana, focusing on the future of the blockchain. Pivot to Solana Following Rebranding Sol Strategies, formerly called Cypherpunk Holdings, repositioned its business in 2024 and shifted its focus to only build products within the Solana ecosystem. The rebranding was a part of the process when the company aimed to become one of the biggest Solana validators and participants of the ecosystem. During Wald’s tenure at the firm, it sold off non-strategic investments, including its equity interest in Animoca Brands that was once a major investment. Sol Strategies has been able to divert its capital and put it towards buying Solana tokens and its validator business. At the end of the year 2024, the firm had invested in more than 1.5 million SOL tokens, which was worth approximately CAD $450 million. HODL’s symbol has changed to match the company’s focus on Solana, allowing investors to indirectly invest in the blockchain. The analysts have compared this approach to that employed by the firms such as MARA and Riot Platforms where clients get exposure to Bitcoin through mining. SOL’s Growing Role in Web3 Innovation The main advantage of Solana is the high speed of transactions, the prospect of scaling and the possibility to work with DeFi and NFT. As more firms shift their focus to particular blockchain platforms, Solana has become one of the most popular destinations for businesses that want to expand within the Web3 ecosystem. Sol Strategies has already invested more than 140000 SOL tokens that are owned by the company directly, to strengthen Solana network. In this case, the company engages in validator operations to reinforce the blockchain and, at the same time, gain rewards and increase the amount of holdings. The company also detailed its intention to increase its activity in the decentralized finance and liquidity provision space. This strategic expansion is in synergy with the general market dynamics as companies with a focus on blockchain technology direct their investments to high growth platforms. Solana Price Analysis Points To Breakout Solana (SOL) is among the assets that have shown significant rebound over the past few months with the price of the asset forming a V-shaped pattern. At the time of writing, Solana price is trading at $254 with the first barrier at $254.35. According to market analysts, SOL prices could rise to $302 and further to $345.76 if the buying pressure continues. The investment from Sol Strategies comes as Solana is experiencing a surge in investor interest in the blockchain due to its use in DeFi and NFTs. Solana’s ecosystem could be further supported by the company’s CAD $25 million, which may also improve the liquidity and staking of the ecosystem. In its recent announcement, Sol Strategies is also set to gain from the price rise of Solana. The company has high expectations that the blockchain can create sustainable shareholder value owing to its potential for growth.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 306,200 followers on the social media platform X that FLOKI appears to have completed an ABC correction on the daily chart. Bluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to ignite a five-wave upside move after completing an ABC retracement. “FLOKI is another major meme looking turbo bullish in my opinion and heading to ATHs. Price action from the November highs looking like another high timeframe ABC with a fresh impulse looking underway, ATH before the end of the cycle is inevitable in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will surge close to $0.0004 by March. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.0002. The analyst is also watching the US dollar index (DXY), which traders use as a barometer for investors’ risk appetite. According to Bluntz, the DXY looks bearish after respecting a key Fibonacci resistance level and concluding an ABC upside correction. He now expects the index to drop below 100. “DXY looks topped now, hit 108 as I expected, wicked a major 0.618 level, and looks like a long slow ABC up after an impulsive move to the downside. Risk assets held up extremely well while DXY pumped which was counterintuitive. I think we start heading back below 99 in 2025.” Source: Bluntz/X A bearish DXY chart typically suggests that investors are unloading their US dollars to accumulate risk assets such as crypto and stocks. At time of writing, the DXY is hovering at 108.

Table of Contents When the crypto cop packs up From hater to believer When memes meet government Crypto and AI walk into the white house Michael Saylor’s mega Bitcoin stack SEC gets a slice of humble pie CZ vs. the meme coin craze Inverse cramer still working Peter Schiff’s bubble talk When the crypto cop packs up The first and foremost — and arguably the best crypto tweet of 2024 came from none other than Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Nov. 21, he announced his resignation via a concise thread on Twitter, stating, “On January 20, 2025, I will be stepping down as SECGov Chair.” On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as @SECGov Chair. A thread 🧵⬇️ — Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) November 21, 2024 Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair, which began in 2021, has been nothing short of polarizing for the crypto industry. Known for his no-nonsense approach, he led an aggressive regulatory crackdown, describing the sector as “rife with fraud and hucksters.” Under his leadership, the SEC launched a record-breaking 46 enforcement actions against crypto-related entities in 2023 alone, marking a sharp 53% increase compared to 2022. In his post, Gensler credited the SEC’s staff as “true public servants” and emphasized the Commission’s focus on “protecting investors” and “enforcing the law without fear or favor.” However, the crypto community viewed this announcement through a very different lens. Many perceived it as the end of what they considered an overly harsh era of regulation. Social media, particularly the sphere of crypto Twitter influencers, reacted with outright relief. Adding to the intrigue, Gensler’s resignation sets the stage for Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance, to take the helm. Atkins’ nomination by President-elect Donald Trump has fueled speculation about a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto, presenting a stark contrast to Gensler’s approach. From hater to believer The next major entry in the best crypto tweets of 2024 came from Donald J. Trump on Oct. 31, just days before the U.S. presidential elections. I would like to wish our great Bitcoiners a Happy 16th Anniversary of Satoshi’s White Paper. We will end Kamala’s war on crypto, & Bitcoin will be MADE IN THE USA! VOTE TRUMP! #Bitcoin #FreeRossDayOne — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2024 In this tweet, Trump celebrated the 16th anniversary of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) white paper, extended his best wishes to the Bitcoin community, and vowed to “end Kamala’s war on crypto” while ensuring that Bitcoin would be “Made in the USA.” Trump’s message marked a striking departure from his earlier views on crypto. During his first presidential term, he frequently dismissed crypto as speculative and unreliable, raising concerns about its use in illegal activities. By mid-2024, however, his stance had shifted dramatically. Trump’s promises go beyond rhetoric. During a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, he met with Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. The discussions reportedly included ambitious proposals, such as establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to be managed by the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund—an idea Trump had previously floated during his Nashville speech in July. Trump has also outlined plans to ensure Bitcoin mining is “Made in the USA,” with the goal of positioning the U.S. as a global hub for crypto infrastructure. He has even expressed support for controversial measures, such as pardoning figures like Ross Ulbricht. When memes meet government The next best crypto tweet came from none other than Elon Musk. On Nov. 13, Musk shared a striking graphical image of a dog with the acronym “DOGE” prominently displayed. The image header read “Department of Government Efficiency.” pic.twitter.com/4K0ruu7UMS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 13, 2024 The tweet wasn’t just a playful nod to Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the meme coin Musk has famously supported for years — it also carried a deeper connection to real-world events. President-elect Trump had recently announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative aimed at reducing bureaucratic waste and streamlining federal operations. Musk, along with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, was named as one of the leaders of this new department. The choice of acronym, DOGE, seemed to be a deliberate, Musk-like move to merge his well-documented love for Dogecoin with his new governmental role. For those who have followed Musk’s crypto journey, his association with Dogecoin comes as no surprise. He’s long been referred to as the “Dogefather,” a title earned through his relentless promotion of the DOGE. Elon Musk’s tweets about cryptocurrency have repeatedly influenced Dogecoin’s price, transforming it from a joke coin into a legitimate player in the crypto market. His history with DOGE includes everything from calling it “the people’s crypto” to suggesting it could become the currency of Mars. Crypto and AI walk into the white house The fourth entry in our top crypto tweets of 2024 features Donald J. Trump’s repost from his Truth Social account, announcing the appointment of David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David… — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 6, 2024 Trump’s announcement stated, “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas… and will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for.” This announcement makes clear how far crypto and AI have come from their early days as fringe industries met with skepticism. Today, these sectors are acknowledged as critical pillars of the future economy. With this new position, Trump continues his push to bring crypto-friendly voices into the policy-making process, signaling a clear intent to promote growth and leadership in both fields. As the founding-era COO of PayPal, Sacks was part of the legendary “PayPal Mafia,” a group of tech leaders who went on to create some of the most iconic companies of their time. Additionally, Sacks has been a prominent figure in Silicon Valley for over two decades. His crypto journey began as early as 2017, when he described Bitcoin as the cornerstone of a “decentralized web” and the “internet of money.” Michael Saylor’s mega Bitcoin stack The next entry comes from Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, a company renowned for its relentless acquisition of Bitcoin. In a Dec. 15 tweet, Saylor announced the latest milestone, stating, “MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin… As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin.” MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in 2020, MicroStrategy has steadily increased its holdings through a combination of cash flow and debt financing. With 439,000 BTC in its reserves, the firm now stands as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the fourth-largest holder overall. For perspective, the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, remains the largest entity, controlling over a million BTC. Following Satoshi is BlackRock’s IBIT BTC ETF, which holds 553,460 BTC. Saylor’s tweet also points to impressive returns. With a quarter-to-date yield of 46.4% and a year-to-date yield of 72.4%, MSTR has cemented itself as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. SEC gets a slice of humble pie The next crypto tweet of 2024 comes from Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple ( XRP ), following a key development in the company’s legal battle with the SEC. On Nov. 29, Garlinghouse tweeted: “The SEC asked for $2B, and the Court reduced their demand by ~94%, recognizing that they had overplayed their hand. This is a victory for Ripple, the industry, and the rule of law. The SEC’s headwinds against the whole of the XRP community are gone.” The SEC asked for $2B, and the Court reduced their demand by ~94% recognizing that they had overplayed their hand. We respect the Court’s decision and have clarity to continue growing our company. This is a victory for Ripple, the industry and the rule of law. The SEC’s… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 7, 2024 Ripple’s legal saga with the SEC began in December 2020, when the agency accused the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. The case quickly became a flashpoint for the broader crypto industry, reflecting the growing tensions between regulators and the sector. Ripple consistently argued that XRP should not be classified as a security, citing its utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. The SEC, under Gary Gensler’s leadership, pursued the case aggressively as part of a broader crackdown on the industry. In July 2023, Ripple secured an initial partial victory when a court ruled that certain XRP sales — particularly those on secondary markets — did not constitute securities transactions. However, the case was far from over. The SEC continued its push, demanding an unprecedented $2 billion in penalties from Ripple. The turning point came in August 2024, when a court drastically reduced the SEC’s demand, ordering Ripple to pay a $125 million civil penalty — just under 6% of the original amount sought. Despite this significant win for Ripple, the SEC’s subsequent appeal indicates that the legal battle may not yet be entirely resolved. CZ vs. the meme coin craze The next standout in the top crypto tweets of 2024 comes from Changpeng Zhao, or simply CZ, the founder and ex-CEO of Binance. On Nov. 26, CZ expressed his unease with the booming meme coin trend, tweeting, “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ‘a little’ weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain.” I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ""a little"" weird now. Let's build real applications using blockchain. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 26, 2024 Meme coins have taken 2024 by storm, dominating crypto conversations and becoming the hottest sector in the space. While classics like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) set the stage, today’s frenzy is fueled by platforms like Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL ) based ecosystem designed to make launching and trading meme coins as simple as posting a tweet. The stats back up the hype. According to Dune Analytics, meme coin trading on Pump.fun made up a jaw-dropping 62.3% of all decentralized exchange ( DEX ) activity on the Solana blockchain in November — a figure that’s been climbing steadily for months. Among the most buzzworthy tokens are Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ), Just a Chill Guy ( CHILLGUY ), and Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ). Each of these coins has tapped into quirky narratives and speculative excitement, drawing in traders from all corners of the crypto world. Inverse cramer still working The eighth noteworthy entry in the top cryptocurrency tweets of 2024 comes from Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money and a polarizing figure in the financial world. On Aug. 5, Cramer waded into the age-old debate between traditional assets and crypto, tweeting, “Remember this: gold held up a lot better than crypto…” Remember this: gold held up a lot better than crypto… — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) August 5, 2024 The post immediately sparked reactions, particularly from fans of the infamous “Inverse Cramer” phenomenon. The idea is simple: do the opposite of what Cramer advises, and you’re more likely to profit. Cramer’s August tweet proved to be another classic example. At the time, gold was trading at $2,411 per ounce, while Bitcoin sat around $54,000. Fast forward to Dec. 20, and gold has inched up to $2,606 — a respectable but modest 8% gain. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has skyrocketed to $98,000, delivering a jaw-dropping 81% return in just a few months. If you followed the Inverse Cramer playbook this year, it’s safe to say you’ve had a very profitable year. Peter Schiff’s bubble talk The final entry in our top crypto tweets of 2024 fittingly comes from Peter Schiff, Bitcoin’s most persistent critic and a vocal advocate for gold. On Dec. 16, Schiff took yet another jab at Bitcoin, tweeting, “Congratulations Bitcoiners on blowing the biggest bubble ever!” About 400 publicly traded dot-com companies went bankrupt when the bubble popped. At their peak, those 400 companies had a market cap of $1.7 trillion. The current market cap of #Bitcoin alone now exceeds $2 trillion. Congratulations Bitcoiners on blowing the biggest bubble ever! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 16, 2024 His post drew comparisons between Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap and the $1.7 trillion valuation of dot-com companies at their peak before the infamous bubble burst. The crypto community, predictably, wasn’t about to let this slide. Jeff Park of Bitwise Investments fired back with a sarcastic reply: “Thank you for your insights, Peter. Keep up the good work!” Thank you for your insights Peter. Keep up the good work! — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) December 16, 2024 Schiff’s disdain for Bitcoin is nothing new. He’s been calling it everything from a “Ponzi scheme” to “fool’s gold” since its early days. Despite his dire warnings, Bitcoin has defied expectations, climbing to new all-time highs and achieving widespread institutional adoption. Ironically, Schiff’s relentless pessimism has made him something of an unofficial mascot for Bitcoin rallies. His critiques are often met with memes and tweets celebrating his uncanny ability to be wrong at the worst possible times. While it’s unlikely Schiff will ever change his tune, his comments have become a source of amusement for Bitcoin enthusiasts.",Feature|Changpeng Zhao|Donald Trump|Gary Gensler|Twitter|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-08 01:23:00

The psychological milestone had been a key resistance level, with many investors and analysts closely monitoring BTC’s price action for clues about its next big move. The recent breakout above $100K signals renewed market optimism, yet the question remains: can Bitcoin maintain its momentum? Related Reading: Solana Back Above Weekly & Monthly Support Levels – Analyst Expects New ATH Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting a critical pattern forming in Bitcoin’s 1-hour time frame. According to Runefelt, Bitcoin is currently shaping a symmetrical triangle, a classic chart pattern that typically precedes a significant price movement. The pattern suggests that Bitcoin is coiling for a decisive breakout or breakdown, with the next few days—or even hours—potentially shaping its short-term trajectory. This pivotal moment for Bitcoin comes as the broader crypto market experiences renewed energy following a sluggish end to the previous year. Investors are optimistic yet cautious, as the technical setup could signal either a continued rally or a temporary setback. With BTC back in six-figure territory, the stage is set for a critical period that could define the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Breaks Above $100K But Faces Risks Bitcoin has surged to $102,700 with impressive strength, fueling optimism for a highly bullish year ahead. Investors are closely watching the market leader, which continues to show resilience after reclaiming the $100K mark. However, BTC is not without risks; any loss of current levels could result in a significant pullback, potentially shaking confidence in the ongoing rally. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s formation of a symmetrical triangle on the hourly timeframe. This classic chart pattern often precedes a sharp breakout or breakdown, signaling heightened market activity. Runefelt emphasized that the next move could occur as the price consolidates tightly within the triangle. Runefelt outlined key price targets for traders to watch. A close below the $100K mark would act as a bearish signal, potentially invalidating the bullish structure built over recent weeks. Conversely, a breakout above $103K would confirm bullish momentum and set the stage for a continuation of the rally.

While optimism surrounds the possibility of a sustained bull cycle, the potential for increased volatility underscores the need for caution in this pivotal period. Testing Fresh Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $101,400 after a decisive 4-hour breakout above the critical $100K mark, sparking renewed optimism among investors. This clean breakout has pushed BTC into fresh liquidity above the psychological level of $100K, a sign of strength as the market leader attempts to maintain bullish momentum. However, the battle is far from over. While Bitcoin’s price action remains promising, bulls need to push the price higher to assert full control. The next major hurdle lies at $103,600, a key resistance level that, if broken, could pave the way for a massive rally. A strong move above this mark would confirm Bitcoin’s bullish structure and likely attract more buyers, driving the price into new all-time highs.

Recognized as some of the most profitable crypto miners, these units have surpassed 15,200 sales. As the 2025 launch approaches, these miners are set to deliver unmatched scalability and benefits for early adopters. SHIB Price Climbs as Major Transactions Increase On Tuesday, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price saw a significant rise, spurred by a 265% boost in whale transactions and improved sentiment across the crypto market. Market experts like Ali Martinez have identified buying opportunities on SHIB’s daily chart, suggesting potential price increases to $0.000026 or $0.000029. Crypto analyst The Moon Show noted a bullish ascending triangle formation, setting a conservative target of $0.000056 in the current cycle. Accompanying this, large transactions exceeding $100,000 jumped from 118 to 180, coupled with a steady flow of 4.7 million daily transactions on Shibarium, emphasizing growing interest in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price from major players. SUI Price Forecast for 2025: Potential for Up to 359% Growth The SUI price prediction for 2025 reveals strong upward potential, with price targets ranging from $6.13 to $21.36. Analysts are forecasting an average price of $12.25 for the year, with January expected to show the most significant increase, possibly reaching a 359% rise from current levels. In the near term, SUI is expected to grow by 27.7%, aiming for a price of $5.94 by January 2025.

BlockDAG Miners: 15.2K Units Sold, Gearing Up for 2025 Launch BlockDAG miners are transforming the domain of cryptocurrency mining through a blend of high performance and sustainable practices. These miners are engineered to use less energy while increasing earnings, achieving a new level of efficiency with exceptional hashing power per watt. Their advanced hybrid consensus protocol enhances both scalability and security, providing a competitive advantage in the fast-changing cryptocurrency market. As the 2025 launch of BlockDAG approaches, the emphasis on environmentally friendly technology positions these miners as essential tools in modern crypto mining. The upcoming 2025 launch has propelled BlockDAG to new heights, with sales topping 15,200 miners. The X30 model stands out for its efficiency, with the capability to mine up to 600 BDAG coins daily. Situated between the smaller X10 and the more robust X100, the X30 strikes an ideal balance of performance and scalability, suiting a broad spectrum of mining operations. Its effective return on energy makes BlockDAG’s offerings some of the most profitable crypto miners on the market. The strong presale results underscore the rapid appreciation of the coin’s value, offering a unique chance for those who get involved early. With more than $176.5 million accumulated in the presale and a dramatic 2,380% increase in BDAG’s value, the excitement for BlockDAG miners is unwavering. As we move closer to the 2025 launch, miner availability is dwindling, and demand is surging. For those aiming to establish a position in the crypto market, the opportunity to act is now—before the increase in mining difficulty and the addition of BDAG to major exchanges potentially heightens the competition. Closing Insights As the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price continues to rise, bolstered by increased activity from large-scale traders, it highlights the persistent popularity of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Likewise, the SUI price prediction for 2025 suggests a promising future, with the potential for substantial growth driven by market dynamics and analytical indicators. Yet, it is BlockDAG that captures the most attention with its advanced mining technology, setting new standards for profitability. Having sold over 15,200 units, BlockDAG’s miners are acclaimed as among the most profitable crypto miners currently available. With the 2025 launch on the horizon and demand increasing, securing a BlockDAG miner now might be the most prudent strategy for those looking to benefit from future developments.

DeFi developers will also be able to integrate RLUSD support into their applications for several use cases, such as lending and trading. Ripple’s press release disclosed that RLUSD stablecoin users would also extensively use Chainlink’s decentralized data feeds to monitor smart contracts. RLUSD users can connect their smart contract applications to any API through Chainlink’s ‘request and response’ model, facilitating interoperability between on-chain and off-chain systems. Chainlink will provide RLUSD with the essential infrastructure and ecosystem to power the movement of secure data and tokenized real-world assets. With Chainlink, RLUSD will tap into the $867 trillion tokenized real-world asset industry through exchanges like Uphold, Bullish, Keyrock, Bitso, and Coinmena. Chainlink’s infrastructure has reportedly enabled over $18 trillion in transaction value so far. Ripple’s RLUSD uses Chainlink to provide fair market asset prices . @Ripple x @Chainlink : $RLUSD has adopted the Chainlink standard for verifiable data to fuel DeFi adoption with real-time, secure pricing data. The future of stablecoins is here: https://t.co/mq3cThLGQJ pic.twitter.com/993Ac0o282 — Ripple (@Ripple) January 7, 2025 Ripple chose Chainlink Price Feeds after reviewing several Oracle solutions because it provided opportunities for RLUSD-supporting DeFi applications to access fresh asset prices. The data will be supplied directly on-chain via a reliable tamper-proof system. According to Ripple, the fair market asset prices will reflect a volume-weighted average from off-chain and on-chain trading environments. The decentralized Oracle network infrastructure will fetch, aggregate, and deliver financial market data onto the Ethereum blockchain. Ripple claimed that Chainlink Price Feeds sourced high-quality data from premium data aggregators. The data aggregated from hundreds of exchanges is weighted by volume and cleaned of ‘wash trading.’ According to Ripple, Chainlink’s data was, therefore, inherently resistant to inaccuracies and manipulation of any single or set of exchanges. “As RLUSD scales across DeFi ecosystems, reliable and transparent pricing is essential to maintaining stability and building trust in its utility within decentralized markets.” -Jack McDonald, SVP, Stablecoin at Ripple McDonald said Ripple was bringing trusted data on-chain to further strengthen Ripple’s stablecoin utility across institutional and DApps by leveraging the Chainlink standard. Eid echoed McDonald’s sentiments, saying that having access to critical on-chain data would accelerate the adoption process for the RLUSD stablecoin. Chainlink provides secure node operators in a decentralized network Chainlink Price Feeds node operators were secured by independent, security-reviewed, and ‘Sybil-resistant’ oracle nodes run by blockchain DevOps teams, traditional enterprises, and data providers. Ripple said the Chainlink nodes remained reliable even during infrastructure outages or high gas prices. The Chainlink Price Feeds were also decentralized at the data source, Oracle node, and Oracle network levels. They generated robust protections against downtime and manipulation by the Oracle network or data provider. Chainlink provided a strong reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allowed users to independently verify node operators’ historical and real-time performance. Ripple reduced RLUSD’s on-chain, counterparty, credit, and liquidity risks by using Chainlink’s ‘Proof of Reserve’ to verify the protection of cross-chain tokenized assets against over-minting. Enabling automated risk management unlocked the programmatic utility for the RLUSD stablecoin, which was launched only last month. The token, issued on the Ethereum blockchain and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has a market cap of $72.3 million, according to Coingecko’s data . Ripple believes Chainlink will play a crucial role in ensuring that RLUD’s off-chain data is credibly neutral for all users. Ripple believes combining multiple layers of decentralization and cryptoeconomic incentives will ensure high accountability. Chainlink’s decentralized infrastructure could help prevent ‘black swan events’ like the recent NYSE glitch. Listed prices of several securities dropped by up to 99% due to the failure of NYSE’s centralized infrastructure. Chainlink’s viable and future-proof approach will use the CCIP to solve the interoperability problem. Ripple highlighted that Chainlink can also retrieve data from off-chain sources and deliver it on-chain promptly and securely. The decentralized blockchain oracle network is expanding its presence in the MENA region, creating opportunities for more RLUSD adoption.

In a surprising development, JPMorgan analysts have turned their attention to PropiChain , an emerging competitor to Dogecoin. According to their analysis, PropiChain could deliver staggering returns of 67,089%, provided its ambitious roadmap and market adoption goals come to fruition. This unexpected endorsement from a traditional banking titan signals a seismic shift in the way mainstream financial institutions perceive blockchain innovations, particularly those with real-world applications like PropiChain. Dogecoin’s Journey: A Tough Act to Follow Before diving into why JPMorgan is bullish on PropiChain, let’s reflect on the enduring appeal of Dogecoin . What began as a lighthearted meme token evolved into a cryptocurrency juggernaut, fueled by a passionate community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s widespread adoption as a payment method and its playful branding have given it a strong foothold in the crypto market. However, critics often point to its limited utility or robust infrastructure as limitations for long-term growth. This is where PropiChain excels. With a laser focus on disrupting the trillion-dollar real estate industry, PropiChain combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and fractional ownership to offer a utility that Dogecoin lacks. What is PropiChain, and Why is JPMorgan Bullish? PropiChain is a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to revolutionize real estate investments. By tokenizing physical properties, it enables investors to buy and sell fractional shares of real estate assets. This innovation solves major challenges in the traditional real estate market, such as high entry costs, lack of liquidity, and limited accessibility. Key Features Driving JPMorgan’s Optimism Fractional Ownership : PropiChain makes it possible for anyone to invest in premium real estate properties with as little as $100. AI-Powered Insights : The platform uses artificial intelligence for property valuation and market analysis, ensuring investors make informed decisions. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain integrates with the metaverse, offering virtual property tours and enabling global investors to collaborate seamlessly. Rental Income : Token holders earn proportional rental income, providing a steady stream of passive earnings. These features make PropiChain a unique player in the crypto space, blending blockchain innovation with tangible financial opportunities. JPMorgan’s Forecast: Why 67,089% Growth Is Possible According to JPMorgan analysts, PropiChain’s potential lies in its ability to tap into the $300 trillion real estate market. If the platform achieves even a fraction of this market, the returns for early investors could be astronomical. What Needs to Happen for the Prediction to Materialize Widespread Adoption : PropiChain must secure partnerships with real estate agencies, developers, and property management firms. Regulatory Clarity : Like all blockchain projects, PropiChain’s success hinges on favorable regulations, particularly in major markets like the US and EU. Presale Success : The ongoing presale is critical. With tokens currently priced at $0.011, the price will rise to $0.023 in the next stage. Early participation could yield exponential returns. Presale: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. As the presale transitions to Stage 3, the price will jump to $0.023, offering early investors a significant advantage. This price hike mirrors the early days of Dogecoin, which saw meteoric rises after initial adoption. However, PropiChain’s real-world utility positions it for sustained growth rather than short-term hype. For those considering entry, the presale represents a rare opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before the project gains mainstream traction. The endorsement from JPMorgan isn’t the only vote of confidence for PropiChain. The project has undergone a BlockAudit review , ensuring the security of its smart contracts, and is listed on CoinMarketCap , adding credibility to its offering. Conclusion While Dogecoin will always hold a special place in the crypto community, PropiChain’s real estate investments approach sets it apart as a high-growth opportunity. JPMorgan’s bullish forecast underscores its potential to deliver life-changing returns for early adopters. With the presale in full swing and the price poised to increase, there’s no better time to invest. A small investment today could yield huge gains, making PropiChain a no-brainer for smart investors.

They intend to do this by introducing a “lattice-based” hashing system that reduces the effort needed to keep track of the state of every user account. Hashing is the cryptographic process of turning data into a standardized 64-character code that can’t be reverse-engineered, while the state is a snapshot of the data stored in a blockchain. So instead of taking a snapshot of every user on the entire blockchain, and “recalculating everything, it will only update accounts that have changed,” explained research firm Republik Labs in an X post. “This is faster, simpler, and uses fewer resources, letting Solana handle millions (or billions) of accounts more easily.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|SOL|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-08 02:02:02

The meeting that happened at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort is an important beginning to the year 2025 for Ripple especially with the current changes happening in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple CEO and CLO Meeting with Donald Trump On Monday evening, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed his meeting with Donald Trump and Stuart Alderoty on the platform X (previously Twitter). “Had a great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty. ”Great start to 2025!” he posted indicating that things are looking good for Ripple. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s legal head, also commented on the event, joking about the dinner’s menu: “The beef bourguignon was really good.” The dinner at Mar-a-Lago takes place at a time when Ripple has been building up its steam with wins against the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court.In line with the optimism, crypto analysts have provided bullish signals for XRP, some of whom have forecasted a price surge to $3. John Deaton Breaks Silence on Ripple CEO Meet Up Ripple has recently come into the limelight for its legal victory against the SEC where the latter had alleged that the company and Garlinghouse sold unregistered securities via XRP. The lawsuit that lasted for more than two years concluded with the victory of Ripple, which opened up new possibilities for the future of the cryptocurrency market. John E. Deaton, a pro XRP lawyer and following the case commented on X that Ripple’s win means that the company has remained unshaken. He also pointed to the SEC’s aggressive approach in the litigation process, which involved serving Garlinghouse with personal subpoenas to produce financial information. ”Ripple and Brad disclosed every XRP transaction that has ever taken place, but the SEC acted misconduct when it came to discovery,” Deaton said. However, Ripple has come out even stronger, suggesting that more positive outcomes are in the offing for the company and the sector as a whole. Cynthia Lummis Chats With US SEC Potential Chairman Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse has also noted recent expansion of Ripple’s activities within the United States which shows that the focus has shifted back to the domestic market.He disclosed that three quarters of the new positions at Ripple are based in the United States, something that was not the case in the past given the company’s focus on the international market. Furthermore, the company signed up more US business contracts in the last six weeks of the year 2024 than it had in the six months prior to that period. The dinner comes after several meetings between politicians and crypto enthusiasts. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for blockchain technology, has also been engaging with Paul Atkins, the man expected to be named SEC chairman by President-elect Trump. These discussions focus on the need to reform the SEC’s rule making process and to advance the use of digital assets. Ripple’s Growing Market Influence Ripple is also coming up strongly in the blockchain space with new products being introduced. Ripple President Monica Long stated that the stablecoin, RLUSD, which was recently launched, is expected to be listed on multiple platforms. At the same time, the company has joined Chainlink to work on the integration of secure and accurate pricing of RLUSD into the DeFi ecosystem. In these developments, Ripple has witnessed a rise in its valuation due to the increased prices of XRP and the increasing adoption of its solutions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has earlier stated that the $11 billion valuation of the company is quite dated given the current situation.

Despite this bearish outlook, long-term holders appear to be accumulating the tokens and seem to be taking advantage of the recent price decline, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. XRP Fails to Hold Bullish Outlook Before this crash, the overall market sentiment appeared bullish , with XRP seeming poised for a mega rally. However, the recent price decline has shifted the overall market sentiment, including for XRP. On January 2, 2024, XRP broke out from a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and subsequently moved into a consolidation zone, which the altcoin maintained for four trading days. However, the recent price crash has breached XRP’s consolidation zone and suggests a major price decline in the near future. $60.7M in XRP Outflow from Exchanges Amid this price decline, whales and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the asset, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of a significant $60.7 million worth of XRP in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinglass In cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, which is often seen as a sign of accumulation. Additionally, outflows may indicate a potential buying opportunity and the possibility of an upside rally.

It’s crucial to stay updated on the latest from top trending cryptos—Toncoin, Hedera, and BlockDAG. Recently, Hedera hit a high near $0.40 but is now adjusting, while Toncoin has slipped below its usual range after peaking at $7.20, with projections pointing towards $6.20. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has been making waves with its bold initiatives, revealed during a captivating AMA session. This session introduced a slew of exciting new developments including an incubator, a grants program, and a launchpad, marking it a key player in the blockchain field. Delve into these updates to get a handle on what’s heating up in this competitive space. Toncoin Price Insights: Potential Dips Could Set the Stage for Gains Toncoin has been on a wild ride, dipping below its average after hitting $7.20, suggesting some bearish trends ahead. The price fell to $4.78 but rebounded slightly above $5.00, still under the moving averages. Should Toncoin surge past these averages, we might see a resurgence. Conversely, if it dips below the 50-day SMA, the price could plummet to as low as $3.65. Currently, Toncoin is priced around $5.64. On the 4-hour chart, Toncoin is pushing past average levels, aiming for $6.20. On the daily chart, maintaining positions above these averages and breaking through the $6.50 resistance could signal a bullish revival. Hedera Price Momentum: Soaring Past $0.40 Hedera’s price dynamics are heating up, recently breaking out from a descending triangle pattern after touching near $0.40, suggesting the start of an upward trend, awaiting further validation. Just a few days back, Hedera rallied from its base, breaking through significant resistance. The daily chart now hints at an upcoming fifth wave in the Elliott Wave sequence, with Fibonacci tools spotlighting critical support and resistance areas. After a robust rebound from the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.24, the price surged 39% to $0.34 on December 24. With the RSI climbing from high levels, the growing momentum could lead to critical movements in the near future, keeping all eyes on Fibonacci barriers. BlockDAG’s Latest AMA Reveal BlockDAG, a rising layer-1 blockchain project, is now among the top trending cryptos, following its recent AMA that unveiled new initiatives to boost its ecosystem and expand growth opportunities. These developments echo the formative stages of well-known networks like Ethereum and Solana. The team is eagerly developing a new launchpad to support the roll-out of decentralized applications and projects on the BlockDAG network, poised to enhance participation and energize the ecosystem. BlockDAG is gearing up to host four significant hackathons in 2025, expecting to attract over 15,000 developers and catalyze hundreds of new projects. To bolster these efforts, they are introducing a $10 million grants program in February, awarding amounts between $5,000 and $100,000 in USDT and BDAG coins to teams that qualify. Moreover, an ambassador program is being set up to integrate global representatives, and a collaboration with an incubator will provide essential mentorship, resources, and guidance to promising projects, ensuring they thrive on the BlockDAG network. BlockDAG continues to impress with its significant milestones. Its ongoing crypto presale has successfully raised over $176 million and distributed more than 17.7 billion coins. With the BDAG coin currently priced at $0.0248 in the 27th presale batch, early participants have seen an astonishing 2380% ROI. These achievements underscore BlockDAG’s commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem and its readiness to be a leading choice for participants as we approach 2025. Final Say Toncoin price and Hedera coin price continue to hold strong in the list of top trending cryptos, with Hedera recently exceeding $0.40 and Toncoin maintaining around $5.64. However, it’s BlockDAG’s targeted initiatives, including a robust $10 million grants program, a worldwide incubator, and a dedicated launchpad for new projects, that are raising its profile. The initiative’s crypto presale has not only raised $176 million but also achieved a phenomenal 2380% ROI from the first batch, showcasing BlockDAG’s dynamic approach to growth. This strategy sets BlockDAG apart as a standout opportunity for those aiming to engage with a project that combines consistent expansion with significant community involvement.

Investors are closely watching both of these well-established tokens, anticipating further gains. However, while DOGE and XRP continue to capture attention, there’s a new altcoin gem emerging with the potential to deliver even bigger gains – Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.004875 during its presale, Lightchain AI presents a fresh opportunity for investors to secure significant returns in 2025 and beyond. Dogecoin and XRP Strong Price Movements, But Can They Sustain Growth? Dogecoin and XRP has shown big price jumps, with Dogecoin going up more than 30% to about $0.30 and XRP getting up to near $2.43. These actions are mostly linked to hopes of a better crypto-supportive rule setup under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he wants to cut back on digital-asset rules. Also, the choice of crypto backer Elon Musk to run the Department of Government Efficiency has made market hope grow. Bu͏t, the durability of this rise stays unclear; as it really relies on the true use of good rules and the fixing of current legal fights like Ripple’s battle with the SEC. Investors should exercise caution, as the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market can lead to rapid changes in asset values. Lightchain AI New Altcoin with Explosive Potential While Dogecoin and XRP have their moments in the sun, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a major contender for the next big altcoin surge. Lightchain AI is a blockchain-based platform that integrates artificial intelligence and decentralized solutions to address real-world challenges across industries such as data processing, AI model training, and data privacy. Unlike DOGE, which is largely driven by community speculation, and XRP, which is limited to the cross-border payments space, Lightchain AI offers real-world applications with massive potential for adoption across various sectors. The presale of Lightchain AI , priced at $0.004875, has already raised significant investor interest. Analysts predict that Lightchain AI is poised for exponential growth, with predictions for 1000% returns by 2025. The project’s real-world use cases in decentralized AI solutions for industries that require secure, scalable infrastructure make it one of the most promising altcoins to invest in this year. Road Ahead for Lightchain AI Looking ahead to 2025, Lightchain AI is set to disrupt the blockchain and AI markets. As demand for decentralized AI solutions and blockchain scalability continues to rise, Lightchain AI’s platform will be well-positioned to meet these needs. The project’s combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world applications, and strong investor backing makes it one of the most exciting altcoins for investors looking for significant returns. As the crypto market matures, projects like Lightchain AI , which focus on delivering real value and addressing real-world problems, will gain prominence. For those looking for an investment that goes beyond the hype, Lightchain AI offers a rare opportunity to get in early and benefit from its explosive growth.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Crossed Above Its 14-Day SMA In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed a pattern that has recently formed in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The “Coinbase Premium Index” is an indicator that keeps track of the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This indicator is useful for determining how the buying or selling behaviors differ between the userbases of the two cryptocurrency exchange titans. Positive values imply the users on Coinbase are buying at a higher rate or selling at a lower rate than the ones on Binance. Similarly, negative values imply that Binance users have pushed the BTC price higher than on Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Breaks Equilibrium: Whales Scoop Up 240,000 BTC Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index, as well as its 14-day simple moving average (SMA), over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index plunged under its 14-day SMA and into the red territory last month. The cryptocurrency’s price plummeted alongside this venture into the negative zone for the indicator, suggesting the shift in the metric occurred not because of Binance users buying more, but rather due to Coinbase investors taking to selling. The activity of Coinbase users, who are predominantly from the US, has actually played a key role in BTC price action this year, with the asset’s value often finding itself closely mimicking the trend in the Coinbase Premium Index. Thus, it’s not surprising to see that these investors were the drivers for the recent crash as well. From the chart, it’s visible that users on the exchange continued to sell into the new year, but during the last few days, the metric has finally shown a reversal. With this surge, its value has crossed back above the 14-day SMA, potentially implying a return of momentum in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps 20%, But Social Media Still Bearish: Green Signal For Rally? CryptoQuant has pointed out that the last time the cryptocurrency showed a similar trend was back in November. Following this previous crossover, the indicator saw a break into the positive region, alongside which Bitcoin enjoyed a rally from the $69,000 level to the new all-time high of $108,000. It now remains to be seen whether this is the start of a fresh wave of buying from American traders and if it would be similarly bullish for BTC this time as well. Signs have been looking positive so far, as the asset has witnessed recovery above the $100,000 mark since the crossover appeared. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $100,900, up over 7% in the last week.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-08 03:07:00

Fusing AR, AI, and GPS technology into a stylized low-poly world, this upcoming MMORPG invites players to explore real-world locations, conquer lands, and meet heroes spanning from ancient legends to futuristic warriors. The finish line is in sight, with the final stretch of development planned over the coming months, and excitement is already building for what promises to be a genre-defining launch. At its heart, Chaos on the Chains is all about strategic depth wrapped in an ever-evolving narrative. From forging alliances to launching full-scale invasions, every decision made leaves a lasting mark in multiple realms. Thanks to GPS and AR, the borders of the in-game world intersect with the player’s own neighborhood—meaning they can literally expand their empire by stepping outside their front door. This real-world immersion is further enhanced by AI-driven NPCs and surprise appearances from the development team itself. One moment, they could be battling a historically inspired knight; the next, they might find themselves in a showdown with a developer—or even the CEO. Each season unveils new story arcs, quests, and in-game events, so there’s always a fresh challenge on the horizon. Whether players specialize in stealthy raids or prefer taking territories head-on, the open-world approach ensures they can progress on their own terms. And because Chaos on the Chains runs on mobile devices, their next great conquest is never more than a swipe away. Being Part of the Chaos: TGE In anticipation of our Token Generation Event (TGE), we’re excited to welcome new community members. Early adopters of the Chaos on the Chains token will enjoy exclusive perks, from limited-edition gear to priority access in future expansions.

Not much, especially when projects like Book of Meme (BOME) are pushing boundaries with decentralised storage for meme culture, and Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) keeps it lowkey with its relaxed vibe and growing community. With meme coins on everyone’s radar, these new contenders are grabbing attention, but can they deliver the same excitement as BTFD Coin, which is rewriting the rules with its high-yield staking and play-to-earn game? Meme coins have come a long way from their humble beginnings, evolving into a cultural phenomenon that blends entertainment, community, and financial opportunities. Among the newest contenders, BTFD Coin stands out as a potential game-changer with its impressive 90% APY staking rewards, the launch of its play-to-earn game on January 1, and a rapidly growing community of over 7,800 holders. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin, BOME, and CHILLGUY are the best new meme coins to buy this week . BTFD Coin: 90% APY Staking Creates a Bullish Buzz Have you ever wished for a meme coin that doesn’t just ride the hype but offers actual rewards for holding? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin ($BTFD) brings to the table. Currently, in its 13th presale stage at $0.000142, the project has already raised over $5 million, selling more than 63 billion tokens. Investors are drawn to its jaw-dropping staking programme, promising an annual percentage yield of 90%. Why does this matter? Let’s crunch the numbers. Imagine you invest $7,000 in BTFD Coin today. At the presale price, that fetches you approximately 49,295,774 coins. By the end of the presale, when $BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $29,577.46—a whopping 322% return! And that’s without factoring in staking rewards. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is among the best new meme coins to buy this week. Beyond staking, the coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has captured the community’s imagination. Released on January 1, it’s already being hailed as a fun and engaging way to earn tokens. With these robust features and an ethos of “buying the dip” with strategic investments, BTFD Coin is more than just another meme project—it’s a movement. Buying $BTFD is easy: Set up a wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Head to the BTFD presale page , connect your wallet, and buy. Claim your tokens after the presale ends. The 16-stage presale is moving fast, and if you’re looking to run with the bulls, now’s the time to join the BTFD revolution. Book of Meme (BOME): Weekly Gains Spark Renewed Interest If memes are the language of the internet, Book of Meme (BOME) aims to create its ultimate library. Trading at $0.006871, BOME has seen a modest 11.22% weekly gain despite a 35.8% dip over the last month. Its trading volume is up by 7.89%, indicating renewed investor interest. What sets BOME apart is its ambitious plan to immortalise memes on decentralised platforms like Solana, Arweave, and IPFS. The project’s experimental nature seeks to redefine how we think about web3 culture, merging the worlds of memes, degenerate trading, and decentralised social media. Imagine a future where your favourite memes are forever etched into the blockchain—this is BOME’s vision. However, BOME has faced challenges. Its all-time high of $0.5106 from March 2024 feels like a distant memory, but with its unique use case, there’s potential for recovery. Analysts suggest that as blockchain adoption grows, so will interest in BOME, especially with its planned expansions into Bitcoin inscriptions. If you’re a meme lover who believes in the power of decentralisation, BOME might just be your ticket to combining culture with investment. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Analysts Predict $0.70 and Beyond For those who love a bit of fun without the fuss, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is all about keeping things, well, chill. The coin, currently trading at $0.1952, has experienced a 25.27% rise over the past week, though it’s still down 54% for the month. Despite this, CHILLGUY is building a loyal fan base, particularly among Gen Z and TikTok users who resonate with its laid-back “lowkey” attitude. The meme character behind CHILLGUY—decked out in a grey sweater, jeans, and red shoes—embodies a vibe that’s casual and unbothered. It’s a vibe that’s caught on, with predictions that the coin could hit $0.45, $0.70, or even $1 if the community continues to grow. CHILLGUY is a great example of how meme coins can capitalise on cultural trends to build their value. Its community-driven approach and relatable branding make it a fun addition to any meme coin portfolio. The Final Words Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that meme coins continue to dominate the crypto space, each with its unique flair. Book of Meme (BOME) offers a creative, decentralised spin on preserving internet culture, while Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) captures the zeitgeist of laid-back, lowkey vibes. With 90% APY staking rewards, live P2E game, and a presale price primed for massive returns, BTFD Coin shines as one of the best new meme coins to buy this week. Don’t miss out on this chance to join the bulls and own the dip. The presale is heating up, and opportunities like this don’t come around often.

They’re not just about digital money anymore; they’re transforming industries like finance, gaming, and even real estate. With blockchain technology evolving at a breakneck pace, the question isn’t whether you should invest in crypto but which ones deserve your attention. This year, one name stands out: Qubetics ($TICS). While Bitcoin and Ethereum paved the way, Qubetics is addressing real-world problems in ways its predecessors couldn’t. From tokenizing assets to enhancing liquidity, Qubetics offers solutions that could redefine how we invest. Let’s dive into the top 7 leading cryptos to invest in this year. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Unlocking Real-World Asset Tokenization Imagine owning a piece of prime real estate or rare art without shelling out millions. Qubetics makes this possible through its tokenized asset marketplace, where physical and digital assets are converted into tradable tokens. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about accessibility. Fractional ownership means investors can access opportunities that were once reserved for the elite. Want a slice of a luxury hotel? Or perhaps a share in a promising startup? Qubetics turns these dreams into reality. By addressing the issues of limited liquidity and lack of transparency, Qubetics is a game-changer for investors and businesses alike. Its secondary market ensures seamless trading, making it easier to manage and grow your portfolio. The presale numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics has sold over 405 million tokens to 13,600 holders, raising $9 million. At $0.0455 per token, it’s one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. But don’t wait too long—prices jump 10% in the next stage this weekend. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Gold Standard You can’t talk about crypto without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains the gold standard of digital assets. Its reputation as a store of value makes it a go-to for both seasoned and new investors. Bitcoin’s scarcity is its superpower. With only 21 million BTC ever to exist, it’s digital gold for a digital age. Whether you’re hedging against inflation or diversifying your portfolio, Bitcoin is as reliable as it gets. Sure, it’s not the fastest or most efficient blockchain out there, but its widespread adoption and network security are unmatched. If stability is your jam, Bitcoin is still one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. 3. Ethereum (ETH): The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that powers decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Think DeFi, NFTs, and even metaverse projects—all roads lead back to Ethereum. The move to Ethereum 2.0 has been a game-changer, reducing energy consumption and introducing staking rewards. This makes ETH not just a utility coin but also a lucrative investment. While gas fees can still be a pain, Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is hard to beat. If you’re looking for a versatile crypto with endless potential, ETH should be on your radar. 4. Polygon (POL): Scaling Ethereum Ethereum’s biggest problem? Scalability. Enter Polygon, the Layer 2 solution that makes Ethereum faster and cheaper. Whether you’re trading NFTs or using DeFi platforms, Polygon ensures smooth sailing without breaking the bank on gas fees. Its ecosystem is massive, hosting everything from decentralized exchanges to gaming platforms. And with partnerships from major global brands, Polygon isn’t just a crypto—it’s becoming a mainstream tech solution. If you believe in Ethereum but want something more cost-effective, Polygon is one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): The Fast and Scalable Blockchain Avalanche is all about speed. With transaction finality in less than a second, it’s perfect for applications that need high performance. From DeFi to enterprise solutions, Avalanche’s subnets make it easy to create custom blockchain networks. What sets Avalanche apart is its scalability without sacrificing decentralization. As demand for blockchain grows, AVAX is well-positioned to handle the load. Analysts are bullish, predicting significant price growth this year. If you’re looking for a crypto with both speed and scalability, AVAX should be on your list. 6. Ripple (XRP): Revolutionizing Payments Ripple’s XRP is a crypto with a mission: making cross-border payments faster and cheaper. Traditional banking systems are slow and expensive, but RippleNet is changing the game for financial institutions worldwide. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges, XRP’s utility keeps it in the spotlight. With partnerships in the banking sector and a focus on global adoption, Ripple is one of the leading cryptos to invest in this year if you’re looking for real-world use cases. 7. Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Blockchain Cardano is like the academic of the crypto world. Its research-first approach ensures that every upgrade is robust and sustainable. From energy efficiency to security, ADA checks all the boxes. Hydra, its Layer 2 scaling solution, promises to handle millions of transactions per second, making Cardano ready for mass adoption. Its ecosystem is growing, with projects in DeFi, NFTs, and social impact. If you value innovation and sustainability, Cardano is a no-brainer for your portfolio. Wrapping It Up Crypto investments can be overwhelming, but these seven projects stand out for their innovation and potential. Qubetics is leading the charge with its tokenized asset marketplace, solving real-world problems and democratizing investment. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational picks, while Polygon and Avalanche push the boundaries of scalability. Ripple and Cardano round out the list with their focus on payments and research-driven growth. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Ripple, and Cardano as the leading cryptos to invest in this year. Don’t wait—opportunities like these don’t last forever. Make your move today!

ETH is back to $3,350 and might struggle to start a fresh increase. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,750 zone. The price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,675 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,450 resistance level. Ethereum Price Dips Over 8% Ethereum price remained stable above the $3,650 level and extended its upward move like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,680 and $3,700 resistance levels. However, the bulls failed to push the price above the $3,750 resistance. A high was formed at $3,742 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear move below $3,650 and $3,550. There was also a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,675 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A low was formed at $3,356 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,356 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,500 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,356 low. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,750 resistance zone or even $3,880 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,450 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,350 level. The first major support sits near the $3,320. A clear move below the $3,320 support might push the price toward the $3,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The price is now battling to stay above the $2.30 mark and if the price breaks below key support levels, particularly $2.24, it may hint at a change in market structure. The current range has shown key phases like the automatic rally, secondary tests, and now a spring phase, where XRP is aiming for a breakout. This pattern has been observed before in other charts, like Binance Coin’s price action in 2023. We’re essentially waiting for the final breakout from the current range, which could happen soon. The accumulation phase that began in early December seems to be nearing its conclusion. While the breakout may take some time to fully unfold, the range is close to completing, and the next move appears to be to the upside. Support Levels to Watch The key support levels to observe are $2.23, $2.21, $2.17, $2.29, and $2.24. These areas should be monitored for signs of reversal, but a clear breakout above certain levels will confirm further bullish movement. Breakout Signals and Market Outlook A breakout above the 50% Fibonacci level at $2.35 would signal the end of the immediate downside and potentially mark the start of an upside move. XRP is known to react quickly to such breakouts, so traders should stay alert. The Patience Game After over a month of range-bound movement, the end seems near.

The question you should ask yourself this January is simple: which project offers the best crypto investment opportunity? Toncoin (TON), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Remittix (RTX) all present unique advantages, but only one is set to truly shine. Presale Token Remittix Stands Out For its Practical Focus Remittix takes a different approach by addressing real-world issues in the $150 trillion global remittance market. It uses blockchain technology to simplify cross-border payments and offers speed and cost-efficiency that traditional systems like SWIFT can’t match. The presale price is still only $0.0193 and already raised over $2.1 million highlighting the massive demand for Remittix in today’s financial landscape. Remittix’s unique PayFi protocol bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance and allows for seamless global transactions without hidden fees or delays. What sets Remittix apart is its ability to combine innovation with inclusivity. It targets underbanked populations and so brings financial services to regions that are often overlooked by traditional banking systems. Toncoin Shows Promise But Raises Questions Toncoin is attracting attention thanks to significant whale activity, with over 1.55 billion TON coins, valued at $8.86 billion, exchanged in a single day. This surge has pushed TON’s price to $5.744, with trading volumes climbing 4.94% over the past week. Analysts predict a potential test of the $6 resistance level if the current bullish sentiment continues. However, Toncoin’s reliance on large-scale transactions raises concerns. Whale activity often leads to volatility, making TON a less predictable option for those seeking stability. Despite being just 32% below its all-time high of $8.24, the token’s sideways trading pattern suggests it lacks the consistent momentum needed to sustain growth. Memes Meet Payment Potential in Dogecoin Dogecoin is in the spotlight once again. This time, it’s fueled by speculation surrounding its integration into Elon Musk’s X Payments platform. If realized, its inclusion in X Payments could revolutionize the coin’s use case and drive adoption among creators and users. Despite this optimism, DOGE remains heavily influenced by media hype and the endorsement of figures like Musk. While it has the potential to reach $1—requiring a 261% increase—technical indicators hint at short-term corrections. A declining RSI and negative MACD suggest a cooling period before further gains. Although speculative assets like DOGE can yield high returns, they come with increased risk, making them less attractive for those seeking a balanced portfolio. Why Smart Investors Favor Remittix While Toncoin offers short-term gains and Dogecoin rides on speculative hype, Remittix presents a balanced, utility-driven investment. Its focus on addressing inefficiencies in cross-border payments aligns with the growing demand for practical blockchain solutions. Furthermore, the ongoing presale allows investors to secure RTX tokens at an attractive entry point, maximizing potential returns. Institutional investors often prioritize projects with clear value propositions and scalable market potential. Remittix meets these criteria, leveraging blockchain’s strengths to deliver real-world impact. In comparison, Toncoin’s reliance on whale activity and Dogecoin’s dependence on media-driven rallies make them less predictable choices for long-term portfolios. The Smarter Crypto Investment For those seeking sustainable growth and a tangible market impact, Remittix offers a compelling alternative to speculative assets. With its presale providing early entry, January is the time to explore RTX as a cornerstone of your crypto investment portfolio with its price projected to climb a massive 600% before the presale completion!

Starting January 8, 2025, DEEP is available for trading in the Korean Won (KRW) market. The trading will commence at 3:00 PM with a base price of 230 KRW, giving users the opportunity to trade the token directly against the national currency. Bithumb Launches DEEP Token Trading on Sui Network According to the Bithumb notice , DEEP token will work only on the Sui network, and the token deposits from other networks will not be accepted. The deposits and withdrawals were opened right after the announcement of the official timing limit which was two hours. According to Bithumb, it takes 20 network confirmations for deposits to be credited to users’ accounts. To foster a fair and secure trading process during its launch, some certain measures have been put in place. New buy orders are not accepted in the primary market during the first five minutes of trading session. The sell orders are also limited to within ±10% and ±100% of the base price during this time period. Additionally, the automated trading will be allowed only after the first trade has occurred. An official said in an interview, “These measures are put in place to protect the market and prevent price manipulation during the initial trading period.” The listing of DEEP comes after Bithumb added other tokens like PEAQ and Vana to its KRW market in recent days. Deposit and Withdrawal Guidelines In compliance with the Travel Rule, Bithumb has observed that deposits and withdrawals shall only be made through supported exchanges. Tokens received from other unsupported platforms will not be credited to users’ accounts and the refund process may extend to several months. Before transferring their DEEP tokens, users are recommended to double-check the deposit address as well as the network. The exchange also informed its users that dealings through restricted exchanges may result in account limitations in accordance with the exchange’s terms of service. “More specifically, when making deposits or withdrawals, please confirm that the token is on the same network and has the same address as your Bithumb account,” the exchange said. DEEP Token Performance and Technical Analysis The DeepBook Protocol (DEEP) has been quite bullish, with the price sitting at $0.1741 and a 24-hour trading volume of $56.1 million as of the time of writing. On the DEEPUSD 3-hour chart, the market has formed a rising wedge pattern, which is a bearish pattern. During the rally, the price is trading close to the resistance level of $0.1750 with the support levels being at $0.1536(50 MA) and $0.1174 (200 MA). DEEP/USD (source: TradingView) On the DEEP price chart the short-term 50 moving average is currently positioned above the long-term 200 moving average. This crossover is usually seen as a buy signal, meaning that the token has continued to rise in the short-term. Nevertheless, it seems that this momentum is slowing down as the price nears the upper border of the wedge. If the price falls downward from the pattern, analysts believe that it may continue to decline to $0.10 levels. On the contrary, if the $0.1750 level is breached on the upside, then there could be an upward trend.

The crash in crypto prices today was attributed to a significant rise in U.S. Treasury yields over the past decade. Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a report showing the December Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the private sector reached 54.1, up from November’s 52.1, adding to market volatility. Major altcoins also witnessed sharp declines, with most falling by 5% to 10% in the past 24 hours. Meme coins faced similar pressure, as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by 8% to 10% within the same timeframe. The global crypto market fell approximately 6%, now standing at $3.38 trillion. However, trading volume surged by 27%, reaching $162 billion as investors reacted to the market downturn. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL Down Major Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) saw sharp declines during the market crash.

Czech Central Bank Governor Opens the Discussion,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-as-a-reserve-asset-czech-central-bank-governor-opens-the-discussion/,"Governments and central banks, from the United States to Switzerland, are giving Bitcoin serious consideration as an alternative to traditional reserve assets, with the Czech Republic being one of the latest to signal interest. The governor of the Czech National Bank (ČNB), Aleš Michl, has floated Bitcoin as a potential diversification strategy for the country’s foreign exchange reserves. The latest comments signal a growing government interest in cryptocurrency as a savings tool. Czech Republic Joins The Bitcoin Conversation In an interview with CNN Prima News, Michl mentioned the possibility of acquiring “a few Bitcoin” for diversification purposes. However, he went on to clarify that such an acquisition would not constitute a significant investment for the bank. Any decision to purchase BTC would require approval from the ČNB’s seven-member board. The narrative surrounding Bitcoin has shifted significantly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2024. Once a skeptic, Trump has voiced support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset and proposed establishing a US BTC reserve to boost economic stability. Advocates of this plan suggest that Bitcoin’s finite supply could act as a hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar, with prominent supporters like Senator Cynthia Lummis arguing its potential as a valuable addition to national reserves. While critics in Congress have raised concerns, the idea continues to gain traction. Global Shift Toward Bitcoin Internationally, Switzerland is considering a similar step, with the Swiss National Bank exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin alongside gold in its reserves. A referendum could make Switzerland the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as an official reserve asset, aligning with its tradition of being a hub for financial innovation. In Germany, figures like former Finance Minister Christian Lindner have proposed that Bitcoin could help reduce dependency on the US dollar if adopted by the European Central Bank or the Bundesbank. Similarly, Hong Kong is also engaging in this global trend, as legislator Wu Jiezhuang advocated for integrating Bitcoin into financial reserves to ramp up economic resilience in December. This comes months after Legislative Council Member Johnny Ng stated that Hong Kong should follow the United States’ lead if the latter decides to implement a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Russia, too, has taken concrete steps to leverage Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international transactions in a bid to bypass Western sanctions and reduce reliance on the dollar. Meanwhile, Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People Party, officially proposed setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country.

His resignation marks the end of his tenure, during which he tirelessly pushed for the CFTC to have broader authority over cryptocurrency markets, though his efforts largely went unfulfilled. Behnam’s resignation date coincides with Trump’s inauguration, allowing the administration to appoint its Chief to drive its crypto policy agenda. Today, I announced my departure from @CFTC . After more than seven years at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, I will be stepping down from my position as Chairman on January 20th. My final day at the Commission will be Friday, February 7th. A 🧵 — Rostin Behnam (@CFTCbehnam) January 7, 2025 The CFTC has been in charge of commodity derivatives markets but has had little say regarding financial policy. The situation is about to change, and the agency is expected to be a critical player in President Trump’s administration, eager to advocate for more crypto-friendly policies. Behnam strongly pushed for CFTC to become the primary US crypto regulator While at the helm of CFTC, Behnan pushed for his commission to become the main Bitcoin regulator and have powers to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges. The entity also examined and sometimes tried to obstruct firms that allowed Americans to bet on US election outcomes. Behnan’s advocacy to give the commission legislative authority over crypto failed during his tenure. However, things look promising with the Republicans taking control of Congress and the White House. The CFTC could become more vibrant, expanding its jurisdiction to include major tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The CFTC chair joined the commission in 2017 as a member, and by 2021, he assumed the chairmanship position in an acting capacity. A year later, he was sworn in to become the official chairperson of the agency. Previously, he worked as an aide to former Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow. Several candidates have been suggested to replace Chairperson Behnam As Behnam prepares to leave, attention has turned to who will replace him. Many expect President Trump to elevate one of the two Republican commissioners, Summer Mersinger or Caroline Pham, to the role of chair. However, the president transition team has also fronted external candidates , including former Republican Commissioner Brian Quintenz, Josh Sterling, a former official, and Neal Kumar, an industry attorney. According to sources, the permanent chair must be approved by the Senate. The CFTC, as a crypto “regulator” under Behnam, appeared soft to the crypto industry and operated differently from the Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Gary Gensler. The SEC chair is a hardliner who made regulation decisions that were not comfortable for the industry. Despite its soft approach, the commission brought several lawsuits against crypto firms, including one that targeted the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX after it imploded in 2022. In 2023, it also charged Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao.

SOL price is now below $200 and showing a few bearish signs. SOL price started a fresh decline after it failed to stay above $220 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $200 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $204 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $205 zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price struggled to clear the $220-$225 zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $212 and $205 support levels. The price even dipped below the $200 handle. A low was formed at $196.73, and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $196 low.

The next major resistance is near the $210 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $196 low. The main resistance could be $213.

In a tweet published by José Maria Macedo, co-founder of Delphi Labs, BiG, which will manage assets close to €7 billion (about $7.2 billion) by 2023, announced this policy change. One of the largest Portuguese banks BIG is now blocking transfers to crypto exchanges, citing ECB guidance about ""risks associated to virtual assets""🤦 Crypto is inevitable, banks are dead, and these abuses of power will only redpill more ppl into moving their wealth on-chain pic.twitter.com/QFTfWCcKdz — José Maria Macedo (@ZeMariaMacedo) January 7, 2025 Macedo expressed disapproval of the bank’s activities, arguing that they could encourage more people to move their money to blockchain platforms. He said, “Cryptocurrency is inevitable, banks are dead, and these abuses of power will only red pill more ppl (people) into moving their wealth on-chain.” You might also like: Merely 2.6% of Portugals own crypto assets, data shows It is noteworthy that this restriction seems to be exclusive to BiG. Fiat payments to cryptocurrency platforms are still possible through other Portuguese banks, such as Caixa Geral de Depósitos , the biggest bank in the country, according to user reports. Portugal has long been seen as a country that welcomes cryptocurrency. The Portuguese Tax & Customs Authority announced in 2019 that cryptocurrency purchases and sales were tax-free, meaning they were not subject to value-added tax or capital gains tax. However, Portugal implemented a new crypto tax scheme in 2023 that imposed a 28% capital gains tax on short-term (less than 365 days) cryptocurrency holdings while leaving long-term (more than a year) holdings tax-free, except some tokens, such as securities, and those from particular jurisdictions. This action by the BiG is part of a larger trend in Europe where regulations are becoming more scrutinized of cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions’ interactions with cryptocurrency platforms will be impacted by the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which attempts to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets throughout the European Union. Countries throughout the world are regulating cryptocurrencies in a variety of ways. For example, in September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, requiring that it be used for payments. However, according to recent sources, El Salvador has consented to reduce its Bitcoin ( BTC ) projects in order to obtain a loan of $1.4 billion from the IMF . Businesses will no longer be required to utilize BTC as part of the arrangement, and the government will buy fewer BTC. As countries attempt to strike a balance between innovation and financial stability and security, these developments highlight the dynamic and changing global environment of cryptocurrency regulation.

This news has sparked excitement, especially considering the ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple. With the January 15 deadline fast approaching, along with Trump’s inauguration and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s upcoming resignation, the next few weeks hold significant importance. Enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting to see how these events will impact Ripple and its future. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton took to social media and shared his thoughts on the incredible comeback of Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, in the past two years. Deaton highlighted Garlinghouse and Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty, as key figures in the industry’s turnaround. I love America, warts and all!

Deaton criticized the SEC for using harsh and unfair tactics during the case, including pressuring Ripple’s customers and partners overseas. Despite Ripple providing full records of every XRP transaction, the SEC still tried to force Garlinghouse to hand over his personal financial details, including credit card statements. “Not only was Ripple unfairly sued, Garlinghouse was individually sued (in a non-fraud case). Anyone familiar with the Ripple litigation, and I am, knows the SEC played dirty, pushing ethical limits,” Deaton wrote. Deaton said that Garlinghouse fought back against the SEC’s bullying and refused to give in. His efforts, along with the support of Ripple’s legal team, led to a victory for the company.

38682011,https://timestabloid.com/?p=54025,1736313421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Spots Something Weird about XRP Pump,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-something-weird-about-xrp-pump/,"Market analysts are closely monitoring XRP’s price trajectory as its recent rally raised discussions about a potential extended bull run. According to cryptocurrency analyst Dom, significant shifts in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) could help XRP’s future price movements. In January 2025, XRP reached $2.45, marking a notable recovery that revived investor optimism. Based on historical market trends, Dom suggests that while the token recent gains are impressive, the true price surge might still be forthcoming. Relationship Between Bitcoin Dominance and XRP Performance Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market, is considered a key indicator for altcoin performance. Historically, significant drops in BTC.D have corresponded with periods of substantial growth for altcoins like XRP. Dom’s analysis said during the last two market cycles, Bitcoin dominance decreased by approximately 30%, leading to asset price increases exceeding 1,000%. In contrast, the current market cycle has only seen a modest 5% decline in BTC.D, suggesting the potential for further altcoin price appreciation if Bitcoin dominance falls further. Despite the relatively small decline in BTC.D, XRP has already achieved a remarkable 500% price increase since November 2024. The analyst believes this rally may be the early stage of a more substantial upward trend, driven by new capital entering the market. Altcoin Season Indicators The concept of “altcoin season” refers to a market phase where altcoins outperform Bitcoin, typically coinciding with a decline in Bitcoin dominance. Analysts are now anticipating the start of such a season, especially as BTC.D decreases gradually. XRP’s recent performance has fueled these expectations. In November 2024, the token surpassed the $1 mark for the first time in three years. This occurred despite Bitcoin dominance remaining high at around 58%. Dom described this as an anomaly, noting that the token’s growth usually aligns with a significant BTC.D drop. Market observers are now optimistic that a further decline in Bitcoin dominance will create favorable conditions for altcoins. Michaël van de Poppe, another prominent analyst, has emphasized the potential for significant altcoin gains during this phase. He attributes the current market strength to reduced regulatory uncertainty and the broader bullish momentum within the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Outlook Van de Poppe views the current market conditions as the onset of a new cryptocurrency bull cycle, offering substantial growth opportunities for altcoins. He believes the asset’s resilience during the extended bear market positions it well for potential gains in the coming months. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $2.43, reflecting a 10.77% increase over the past week. Analysts remain optimistic about its continued upward trajectory, particularly if Bitcoin dominance experiences further declines. In conclusion, the token’s performance demonstrates its capacity for substantial growth, even in the early stages of market shifts. Analysts expect the combination of declining Bitcoin dominance and increased market participation to soon drive significant opportunities for altcoin investors.

Coinbase Premium Index reveals bullish trends but hints at short-term dips ahead. Market capitalization rises as Bitcoin’s trading volume grows, signaling increased interest. Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 milestone, drawing attention from investors globally. The cryptocurrency recorded a 1.65% gain, pushing its price to $100,894.81 with a market capitalization of $1.99 trillion. This upward movement highlights the influence of the Coinbase Premium Index , a critical metric reflecting U.S. investor demand. The index shows how market behavior impacts Bitcoin’s trajectory and could point to further price increases. Coinbase Premium Index: A Key Market Signal In November 2024, when the Coinbase Premium Index turned positive, Bitcoin surged from $69,000 to $108,000. This trend signaled increasing interest from U.S.-based investors using Coinbase. 3 days ago, Coinbase Premium Index crossed SMA14 for the 1st time in 26 days—Bitcoin is now up 4% to $102K.

Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin gained attention in 2024 after its launch. Most crypto lovers scrutinized the digital currency pegged to the US dollar. Initially, the stablecoin was deployed in the Ethereum blockchain and XRP Ledger (XRPL). So far, 58,823,317 . 55 RLUSD is in supply , with a total of 795 holders. RLSUD has experienced 1761 transactions since launch, pointing to activeness in the market. Of the token supply, 40,000,043.01 tokens, accounting for 68% of the supply, remain in the Ripple deployer account. XRP ETF is next online after Bitcoin and Ether ETF approval Monica Long showed optimism about the XRP ETF, stating that 2025 may see the launch of several ETFs, but XRP might be in line with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. She said there are already filings for the XRP ETF that are only waiting for approvals. The approval of the XRP ETF will be delayed further as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the approving authority, is undergoing a transition. XRP and the SEC locked horns in a legal battle in 2020, during which the regulator accused XRP of engaging in unregistered securities offerings. Ripple won the case, and despite the SEC suggesting a fine of $2 billion, the judge only fined them $125 million. The RLUSD has also gained access to DeFi through Chainlink. Integrating Chainlink Price Feeds provides RLUSD with the essential infrastructure it needs to deliver accurate and decentralized pricing data to DeFi applications. This ensures that protocols using RLUSD for a broad range of financial activities can operate reliably and transparently. XRP adoption in Japan could drive market growth The Ripple stablecoin launch was timely. It happened when banks in Japan were set to adopt Ripple’s XRP Ledger, which would tilt the financial technology landscape. As SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao announced, the integration will improve cross-border payments and simplify currency exchanges. The XRP Ledger is among the most efficient and low-cost solutions for international remittance. It has the potential to revolutionize global banking systems. If the system is adopted by only 1% of Japan’s $6.372 trillion banking sector, XRP’s market capitalization could rise by $63.72 billion, resulting in XRP trading at $3.50. The widespread adoption of XRP in Japan could be the trigger.

Recent developments include a strategic partnership with Chainlink to enhance the adoption of its RLUSD stablecoin in decentralized finance (DeFi) and predictions from Ripple President Monica Long about the potential approval of an XRP spot ETF in 2025. Ripple and Chainlink Join Forces to Advance RLUSD Stablecoin Adoption in DeFi Ripple, the blockchain-based payment protocol, has announced a strategic partnership with Chainlink, the decentralized oracle network, to enhance the adoption and utility of Ripple USD (RLUSD), its enterprise-grade stablecoin. The collaboration, unveiled on Jan. 7, will introduce Chainlink’s decentralized price feeds for RLUSD on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger. This integration is expected to bolster the stablecoin’s presence in DeFi by providing tamper-proof, real-time market data, ensuring reliability, and mitigating risks associated with price manipulation and downtime. RLUSD, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is designed to facilitate secure and cost-effective transactions across payments, trading, lending, and various DeFi applications. Ripple’s integration with Chainlink enables developers to leverage accurate and consistent pricing data, empowering them to build more robust and reliable decentralized applications (dApps) using the stablecoin. Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization and Alliances at Chainlink Labs, expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating that the integration “is a great signal for the market” and that the team is excited to support the RLUSD launch. RLUSD represents Ripple’s vision for blockchain-based finance, offering a bridge between traditional financial systems and decentralized technologies. The stablecoin's integration with Chainlink is expected to address common challenges in DeFi, such as unreliable market data, by ensuring seamless data flow across its decentralized nodes. Ripple emphasized that consistent and high-quality data will support smart contracts and reduce manipulation or inaccuracies in price feeds. By incorporating RLUSD into dApps, developers can create more efficient and secure DeFi solutions that cater to enterprise needs. Stablecoins like RLUSD are increasingly recognized as vital components of the DeFi ecosystem. They provide a stable store of value, serve as a hedge against market volatility, and enable low-cost, borderless payments. Ripple’s foray into DeFi through RLUSD demonstrates the growing intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology. The partnership with Chainlink also positions Ripple to accelerate the adoption of RLUSD, empowering developers to integrate the stablecoin into various financial services. According to Cunningham, Ripple’s ability to endure market volatility and regulatory challenges is evidence of its role as a leader in the blockchain industry. Chainlink’s Expanding Influence in Blockchain Integration This collaboration is another milestone for Chainlink, which has been actively expanding its network to support blockchain interoperability. On Dec. 10, 2024, Chainlink integrated with Project Diamond, a digital asset platform for global institutions launched by Coinbase. This integration provided data feeds and full lifecycle management for tokenized assets, further showcasing Chainlink’s capabilities in connecting public and private blockchains with existing financial systems. Through its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, Chainlink has established itself as a crucial player in bridging blockchain networks and traditional financial institutions, enabling seamless data transfer and secure transactions. Ripple’s partnership with Chainlink signifies a shared commitment to advancing blockchain’s role in mainstream finance. With RLUSD’s integration into DeFi supported by Chainlink’s trusted infrastructure, both companies aim to set new benchmarks for stablecoin adoption and utility. The collaboration aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to expand its influence in the DeFi sector, offering innovative solutions that cater to both retail and institutional users. By leveraging Chainlink’s decentralized oracle technology, Ripple is well-positioned to lead the next wave of DeFi innovations, further solidifying RLUSD as a key player in the evolving digital asset landscape. Ripple President Monica Long Predicts XRP Spot ETF Approval in 2025 In related news, Monica Long, President of Ripple, has expressed optimism about the future of cryptocurrency spot ETFs in the United States, predicting that XRP could be the next digital asset to secure regulatory approval for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Speaking during a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg, Long forecasted that 2025 could mark a breakthrough year for cryptocurrency ETFs, with several launches anticipated. Long highlighted the growing momentum in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly around spot ETFs. Following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in recent years, she believes that XRP is well-positioned to join this select group. Ripple’s confidence in the approval of XRP spot ETFs aligns with broader trends in the cryptocurrency market. Institutional interest in digital assets has surged, with spot ETFs offering a regulated and familiar framework for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. The launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs marked a pivotal shift in the regulatory landscape, setting a precedent that could pave the way for other cryptocurrencies like XRP to follow. Long’s comments suggest that Ripple is positioning itself to capitalize on this momentum, further driving XRP adoption in the financial sector. In addition to her predictions for XRP, Long emphasized that 2025 could be a transformative year for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Ripple anticipates increased demand for stablecoin products as adoption of blockchain-based solutions accelerates globally. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which was officially launched in December 2024, has already made its debut on several trading platforms, including Bullish. The stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar, is designed to enable seamless transactions across payments, trading, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Long revealed that RLUSD is expected to secure additional listings on major exchanges in the near future, further expanding its accessibility and utility. Ripple has also hinted at forthcoming announcements regarding RLUSD’s availability, signaling continued growth in the stablecoin’s adoption. The integration of RLUSD into more platforms could enhance its role in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Positioning Ripple for Growth Ripple’s proactive approach to regulatory developments and its commitment to expanding its product offerings reflect its broader vision for blockchain-based finance. By advocating for XRP’s inclusion in spot ETF offerings and driving the adoption of RLUSD, Ripple is positioning itself as a leader in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Long’s comments shed light on the company’s strategic focus on both institutional and retail markets. With the anticipated approval of XRP spot ETFs and the growing adoption of RLUSD, Ripple aims to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to mature, Ripple’s leadership believes that regulatory clarity and innovation will be key drivers of growth. The potential approval of XRP spot ETFs in 2025 could mark a significant milestone, further legitimizing digital assets as an integral part of the global financial system. With its RLUSD stablecoin gaining traction and its efforts to secure regulatory approval for XRP ETFs, Ripple is poised to capitalize on the increasing demand for blockchain-based financial solutions. If Long’s predictions come to fruition, 2025 could indeed be a landmark year for Ripple and the cryptocurrency industry at large.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-08 05:30:00
33767162,[object Object],1736314232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum Takes Early Q1 Lead Showing Post-Halving Strength – Will History Repeat?,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-takes-early-q1-lead-showing-post-halving-strength-will-history-repeat/,"After a lackluster 2024, Ethereum has started 2025 with a bang, surging over 13% since the year began. This impressive performance has reignited optimism among investors who are anticipating a bullish year for ETH and the broader altcoin market. Ethereum’s early strength has raised the critical question: Can it outperform Bitcoin in this post-halving year? Top analyst Daan recently shared insightful data highlighting ETH’s early lead over BTC, driven by positive sentiment and historical patterns of strong seasonality. In his analysis, Daan pointed out that ETH often performs well during the first quarter, particularly in post-halving years, setting the stage for a potential altseason. This historical trend has many investors eyeing ETH as a promising contender for market dominance in 2025. While Bitcoin remains the market leader , Ethereum’s early momentum could pave the way for it to challenge BTC’s dominance this year. The combination of favorable market conditions, improving sentiment, and Ethereum’s strong start suggests that the altcoin leader is ready to reclaim its position as a top-performing asset. As the market gears up for what could be a historic year, all eyes are on ETH to see if it can maintain its momentum and outshine Bitcoin. Ethereum Shows Strength But Faces Key Challenges Ethereum has entered the new year on a bullish note, sparking optimism among analysts and investors alike. However, for ETH to confirm a sustained uptrend, it must reclaim and hold last year’s highs. The early signs are promising, with ETH showing a 13% gain since the start of the year. Post-halving years are historically favorable for altcoins, and 2025 appears to be following the trend. Top analyst Daan shared insightful data on X , highlighting Ethereum’s strong start compared to Bitcoin. He noted that ETH is taking an early lead against BTC, supported by positive sentiment and strong seasonality patterns. Historically, ETH has performed well in the first quarter of post-halving years, setting the stage for a potential altseason. This historical context gives investors confidence that Ethereum could outperform in the months ahead. Daan emphasized that while Ethereum is gaining momentum, the race between ETH and BTC will be one to watch closely. He believes both assets will emerge as winners this year, each offering unique opportunities for growth. For ETH, reclaiming key levels and maintaining its early momentum is critical to ensuring it lives up to these high expectations. The coming weeks will be crucial as ETH seeks to capitalize on its early lead. With market conditions appearing favorable and a history of strong first-quarter performance, Ethereum is positioned for a potentially groundbreaking 2025. However, it will need to navigate market challenges and prove its resilience to sustain the bullish outlook. ETH Tests Key Support Ethereum is currently trading at $3,636, testing the critical 4-hour 200 moving average as support. This level is crucial for determining the next phase of ETH’s price action. If the price holds above this moving average in the coming hours, it could signal a strong foundation for a rebound toward higher supply zones, setting the stage for further bullish momentum. However, a brief deviation into lower supply zones could still be a healthy move for ETH. If such a dip occurs, it is essential that the price recovers quickly—ideally within a few days—to maintain the bullish outlook. A sustained decline could introduce uncertainty and test investor confidence in Ethereum’s upward trajectory. For the bullish trend to remain intact, ETH must hold firmly above the $3,500 level. This mark serves as a critical support zone, and losing it would risk deeper corrections. On the other hand, reclaiming the $3,900 level is equally important, as it would reinforce the bullish structure and open the door to a larger rally.

Garlinghouse used the caption, “Strong start to 2025!” Although it is evident that the three met, the meeting details are still unclear, but could be more inclined towards crypto legislation. The meeting comes at a crucial time for Ripple, the eve of a critical deadline for the case between the U.S. regulator and the blockchain venture specializing in cross-border payments. Great dinner last night with @realDonaldTrump & @s_alderoty . Strong start to 2025! pic.twitter.com/UjM6lahUG4 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 8, 2025 Garlinghouse has recently expressed optimism about Trump’s future impact on the crypto industry. On January 5th, the executive highlighted on X that Trump’s bull market is real. Garlinghouse said Trump’s effect on the crypto industry is personal for Ripple. He cited the years-long battle Ripple had with the U.S. financial watchdog (The US SEC) under Gary Gensler’s reign. According to the X post, Garlinghouse explained that Gensler’s SEC effectively froze business opportunities for Ripple in the United States. He also emphasized that the optimism behind Trump’s involvement in the digital asset landscape is “obvious and well deserved.” Garlinhouse also explained that 75% of Ripple’s open roles originate from the U.S., compared to the last four years when a vast majority of Ripple hires were outside the U.S. Garlinghouse also detailed that Ripple has garnered more US deals since Trump won the elections than in the preceding six months. Garlinghouse said that Trump and his incoming administration, including crypto-oriented appointments Scott Bessent, David Sacks, and Paul Atkins, are already jumpstarting innovation and job growth in the US despite the fact that he has yet to be sworn in. Garlinghouse also expressed his belief that the “Trump effect” is already making crypto great again. During an interview with 60 Minutes, Brad Garlinghouse said Trump embraced crypto, and crypto embraced Donald Trump. According to crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, Ripple’s XRP has shed 3.19% in the last 24 hours, bringing its seven-day gain to 10.58%. The digital asset boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $8.2 billion and a market capitalization of $133.4 billion at the time of this publication. Trump meets crypto exchange CEOs Brian Armstrong and Kris Marszalek The Trump-Garlinghouse-Alderoty dinner is Trump’s latest meeting with leading crypto figures since his re-election on November 5th. On November 19th, Trump’s newfound influence in the crypto industry resulted in a call between the president-elect and Coinbase’s founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong. Sources familiar with the meeting anonymously revealed that Armstrong and Trump mainly touched on crypto appointments, although the two did not discuss specific individuals and appointments. During the campaign period, Armstrong and his company donated nearly $50 million to support pro-crypto candidates, including the president-elect, who once claimed crypto and Bitcoin were scams. On November 18th, The Wall Street Journal reported that Armstrong and Trump were going to meet privately, but no further reports have surfaced to confirm if the meetup happened. On December 17th, Trump also met Kris Marszalek, the CEO of crypto exchange Crypto.com, at the Florida golf course. According to an anonymous lead from a source familiar with the meeting, the two discussed crypto-related appointments and Trump’s plan to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the U.S. Treasury. In October, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after receiving a Wells notice indicating the regulator’s intention to bring an enforcement action against the Singapore-based crypto exchange. However, the exchange voluntarily withdrew the suit, citing its intentions to work with Trump’s incoming administration.

As BTC price faced a 5.46% plunge, Ethereum price marked an 8.97% drop, trading at $3,348 while XRP & SOL recorded 4.25% & 9.12% loss, respectively. Dogecoin & Cardano also faced massive pullbacks of over 10% & 9%, with the other altcoins marking a similar pullback. The global trading volume has reached above $170 billion with a rise of over 33.12%, while the market capitalisation dropped to $3.36 trillion, a 6.38% squeeze. What went wrong? Why are crypto markets plunging hard? Two prominent events are scheduled for a short while now: ADP Nonfarm Employment and the FOMC minutes. While ADP is a sneak peek into the labour market’s health, setting the tone before the big reveal, the FOMC minutes dive into the minds of the Fed. It sheds light on their perspective about the rates that will have an impact on the BTC price. What’s next for the BTC price and the entire market? Considering the liquidations, they have again reached the peak of around $558 million in long, with Bitcoin alone recording close to $100 million. However, the pressure has not waned yet as the tokens continue to face equally for either side. The above liquidation heatmap by Coinglass suggests the bears are setting up shorts at interesting levels. If the Bitcoin price rebounds to $98,600, then over $35 million will be liquidated, and if it further reclaims levels above $103,300, then more than $66 million will receive the same fate. In short, the traders still appear to be either pessimistic or are unsure of the sustainability of the start token. However, the volatility rollercoaster is always good to maintain a healthy trend and hence, a potential drop is expected to attract significant volume onto the platform. The start of 2025 has been recorded as one of the most bullish one’s in recent history, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, & other altcoins managing to hold above the pivotal range. Regardless of the corrections, some of the altcoins, like XRP, XLM, BNB, etc., and a few more are demonstrating strength, suggesting a rebound could be nearby. Meanwhile, the BTC dominance continues to remain within daire straits, which indicates a potential altseason may also be on the horizon.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 05:46:23

Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, dropped to $96,000 from $102,000, marking a significant fall. Here are the key reasons why Bitcoin’s (BTC) price drops. Key Reasons for the Drop Bitcoin’s price dip coincided with a rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, driven by December’s stronger PMI data. The Institute for Supply Management reported a jump to 54.1 , up from 52.1 in November, signaling unexpected growth in the U.S. services sector This raised fears of inflation staying high, which could delay the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cuts. However, higher yields often hurt risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the November JOLTS report showed an increase in job openings, although hiring slowed down. Meanwhile, Worker confidence also dropped, as seen in the lower quit rate, which fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Impact on the Market The drop in the crypto market added significant pressure on traders, leading to the liquidation of $561 million worth of long positions in just a single day. The largest liquidation order came from Binance, involving $17.74 million in ETHUSDT. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies also suffered, with Ethereum losing over 8% and Solana falling more than 9%, and XRP by 5%. Bitcoin ETF Recorded an Outflow The price drop also negatively affected Bitcoin ETF inflows. After two consecutive days of inflows, Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows of $543.7 million on 7 January. The biggest outflows came from companies like Ark Investment, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity, all of which had previously invested large amounts into Bitcoin ETFs. What’s Next for Bitcoin? According to Glassnode analyst James Check , Bitcoin’s sell pressure is easing, but fresh demand is also slowing. Spot trading volumes have dropped by 53% since November, showing reduced market activity. However, if the market regains momentum, reaching $100,000 again remains a key target for traders. On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $95,668 support level the price could drop further to $93,625.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 05:57:51

Thanks to this disruptive potential, Rollblock has enjoyed phenomenal growth recently, recording a 600% surge in deposits and signups for the month of December. This is expected to double in January as word of mouth spreads. Rollblock recently introduced a sports betting league, allowing for live bets across thousands of international sporting events. There are also over 700 fully immersive, AI-powered gaming experiences that deliver truly memorable gaming experiences. All payouts are made using the native currency RBLK, which offers holders a huge range of rewards, including the ability to stake coins for up to 30% in risk-free passive income. These staking rewards are not printed out of thin air, as is so often the case in crypto gaming. Instead, each week, the platform will buy up RBLK on the open market, creating a deflationary supply that means RBLK grows scarcer over time. 60% of these purchases are immediately burned, while the rest reach the diamond-handed staking community through staking rewards. It looks likely that stage 9 coins will sell out in the coming days, leading the RBLK price to rally from the current level of $0.0445.

For a brief time, Solana was trading over $220 this week, following its bounce from $175 in recent weeks. Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal remains incredibly bullish on Solana, commenting that “the long-term Solana chart is stupid bullish…” He shared a chart on X to show that Solana has broken out of its channel and flipped resistance to support. This could be enough to send Solana convincingly above $300 in the weeks ahead. Sui rises 600%: Is this just the start? Pal is also exceptionally bullish on Sui , claiming that this upstart layer-1 chain is “pressing its nose against the ceiling… After this, it should go into hyperspace.” Sui is regarded as a potential Solana killer, offering rapid transaction speed and effortless DApp deployment. Sui has been on a tear recently, gaining 23% this week as the Sui price hit $5.16. After a 600% rally in 6 months, Sui is possibly due for a period of consolidation here but could continue to surprise in Q1. Rollblock taking the lead to disrupt the GambleFi space Going into 2025, Sui and Solana will continue to dominate the layer-1 space this year. However, Rollblock has the momentum and potential to disrupt the GambleFi niche offering massive returns in the process. Early adopters have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this project, and many have already reaped the rewards of Rollblock’s rapid ascent with over 300% gains to date.

The latest insight reveals that there has been an interesting move in Binance’s Netflow Simple Moving Average (SMA14), a key indicator often associated with shifts in Bitcoin’s short-term price direction. Historically, this metric has provided reliable signals regarding the platform’s investor sentiment and accumulation behavior. Related Reading: Anticipating A ‘2025 Super Cycle’: Bitcoin Rallies With Trump’s Regulatory Reforms On The Horizon Binance Netflow Data Signals Accumulation Phase A recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, sheds light on Binance’s Netflow data from the past 90 days. According to Kesmeci, whenever the Netflow SMA14 moves into positive territory, Bitcoin tends to face short-term selling pressure, leading to temporary corrections. Conversely, when this indicator turns negative, it suggests a shift in investor sentiment toward accumulation, potentially signaling a short-term bullish trend. On January 6, 2025, Binance’s Netflow metrics revealed some notable insights. The Netflow on Binance recorded a value of -5,407 BTC, while the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA14) for Netflow stood at -483 BTC. These negative readings indicate that more Bitcoin is leaving the exchange than entering it, a behavior commonly associated with investor accumulation. Binance Netflow SMA14 Turns Negative “Both metrics confirm that investor behavior on Binance is leaning toward accumulation. This trend strongly supports the case for upward movement in Bitcoin’s price over the short term.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/jSkRZ2TjLk pic.twitter.com/Rau37VjBQN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 7, 2025 Historically, such trends have acted as early indicators of potential upward price movement, as reduced Bitcoin availability on exchanges reduces immediate selling pressure. When Bitcoin holders move their assets off exchanges, it usually signals their intent to hold long-term rather than sell. This pattern of behavior contributes to a supply squeeze scenario, where lower liquidity on trading platforms creates upward price pressure. The fact that Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume gives this indication more credibility as the platform often serves as a barometer for broader market sentiment. Kesmeci concluded: In summary, both metrics confirm that investor behavior on Binance is leaning toward accumulation. This trend strongly supports the case for upward movement in Bitcoin’s price over the short term. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to be losing steam, as recent price action shows limited strength to sustain a rally. Just 24 hours ago, Bitcoin was trading above $102,000 after a 4% uptick. However, the asset has since retreated, erasing most of those gains and stabilizing just above the $100,000 threshold.

Accompanied by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty, the dinner highlights Ripple’s expanding influence amidst the changing regulatory environment in the US, sparking optimism for the crypto market in 2025. With plans to slay 2025 with IPO and stablecoin Ripple is all set to acquire its lost territory. This closed-door meeting could be much more than just what we can imagine. Are we expecting an XRP ETF too? https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1876783603603939438 Ripple’s Dinner Date with Trump, What’s Cooking? On the social media platform X, Garlinghouse shared his excitement about the meeting, describing it as a “great start to 2025.” Alderoty also commented on the event with a lighthearted remark about the menu, but the dinner carries weighty implications. It comes as Ripple celebrates recent court victories against the U.S. SEC, solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto space. The meeting hints that Ripple can get through the legal battle with SEC and this meeting is very crucial since Ripple and the wider industry are manifesting for a dismissal of Ripple vs SEC setting a crypto milestone. Ripple is not losing ground Ripple’s groundbreaking legal victory against the SEC, which had accused the company of selling unregistered securities via XRP, continues to shape its future. Attorney John E. Deaton, a pro-XRP advocate, noted that Ripple’s transparency throughout the case underscored the SEC’s aggressive litigation tactics. Despite these challenges, Ripple emerged stronger, opening doors for further advancements in the cryptocurrency sector. Amid this legal progress, analysts are optimistic about XRP’s potential. Some forecasts predict the token could surge to $3, driven by increasing adoption and confidence in Ripple’s solutions. XRP currently trades at $2.44, with a 14% rise over the past week, signaling strong market momentum. Expanding U.S. Operations Ripple is also shifting focus back to the U.S. market, with 75% of its new positions now based domestically. The company secured more U.S. business contracts in late 2024 than in the previous six months combined, signaling robust growth. At the same time, political discussions, including those between Senator Cynthia Lummis and SEC chairman candidate Paul Atkins, emphasize the importance of regulatory reform to foster digital asset innovation. Ripple is currently holding its market position with new product launches, such as the RLUSD stablecoin, which is set to expand across multiple platforms. The company has also partnered with Chainlink to integrate secure pricing into the DeFi ecosystem, further boosting its valuation. As Ripple enters 2025, this epic meeting with Trump symbolizes a transformative year ahead, both for the company and the broader crypto space. With legal wins, product innovation, and strategic collaborations, Ripple is poised to lead the blockchain industry.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 06:05:47

Ripple’s Bold Predictions for 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market is manifesting for new crypto ETFs in 2025 which can help the market to recover the December losses. The top focus right now is XRP, Ripple President Monica Long has sparked fresh excitement in the crypto world, predicting that XRP could be next in line for spot ETF approval in the U.S. Following the SEC’s green light for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, the potential approval of an XRP ETF is gaining momentum, fueling speculation about Ripple’s future dominance in the market. XRP ETFs are crucial to bring fresh capital since Ripple needs financial backing to support its crypto plans this year. Ripple has lost over $150 million in the legal battle with the SEC over the years and with changing political scene they are confident that XRP will be back in again. Moreover, ETFs have given the market an option to diversify their investment with Bitcoin’s price touching $100K, new ETFs with low cap could bring more investors to the crypto space. Ripple’s Bold Vision for XRP In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Long revealed that several companies have already filed for spot XRP ETFs. Ripple expects these filings to gain traction in 2025, marking a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. Ripple’s ambitions extend beyond ETFs, with plans for an IPO, stablecoin expansion, and broader market influence, all of which signal its determination to solidify XRP’s position as a leading asset. Stablecoin Expansion with RLUSD Ripple’s recently launched RLUSD stablecoin is another key part of its growth strategy. Already listed on big platforms like Uphold, RLUSD is set to expand its reach further, with more major exchange listings expected soon. Long emphasized that 2025 is shaping up to be a significant year for the crypto industry, with stablecoins playing a vital role in driving adoption and growth. XRP ETF: Hype or Reality? Despite the positive sentiments so far, XRP has failed to touch its previous ATH of $3. Yet the market has high expectations with XRP ETFs as this could give the coins an instant boost like it did for Bitcoin last year. With recent developments, including Brad Garlinghouse’s meeting with Donald Trump and Ripple’s continued legal victories, the company is positioning itself as a major player in the next phase of cryptocurrency adoption. Ripple’s bold moves and strategic plans could make 2025 a defining year for XRP, potentially setting the stage for it to compete with Bitcoin and Ethereum as regulatory clarity unfolds.

This Altcoin Looks Primed for a Massive Price Rally in January 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is one area where trailblazers are often the biggest beneficiaries. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are perfect examples—those who entered early have seen big returns. Nevertheless, IntelMarkets (INTL) is causing a lot of talk, and it may be one of the top crypto coins for 2025. This phase eight presale star has already soared 710%, and this number will continue rising. Since it aims to revolutionize crypto trading by launching the first AI-powered smart trading platform, experts hint it may be the next 3x token in 2025. Although market analysts like Crow and Iced have made some bold price predictions for ETH and SOL, all eyes are on INTL as it may have higher upside potential. IntelMarkets (INTL) Gains Traction As Price Surges 710% While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) show some good price growth, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making headlines in the crypto arena. It has managed to raise over $5M in its crypto ICO event so far. Projections indicate this number reaching $10M before January ends. With over 14M INTL tokens already sold in phase eight of its presale alone, it is clear interest is high. This altcoin will power the upcoming IntelMarkets platform , which aims to become the top crypto trading platform. It will be built with AI technology supporting every layer to accomplish this. Therefore, traders will use self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time and up to 1000x leverage on capital. These features could make IntelMarkets a fan-favorite for millions of traders. By holding the INTL token, people will get governance voting rights and up to 30% discounts on trading fees. Currently, one INTL costs just $0.073, which is a 710% rise from its starting price of $0.009. But phase nine of the presale will bring this altcoin price to $0.082. A Tier-1 CEX listing is also expected to bring INTL to $0.11. This could make INTL one of the altcoins to watch for fast returns. Crow: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) Will Hit $10,000 Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best cryptos right now. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has jumped nearly 10% in the past week alone. During that time, the Ethereum price surged from around $3,400 to over $3,600. Market analyst Crow remains bullish on Ethereum (ETH). According to his X post, this altcoin will trade at $10,000 in 2025. This Ethereum price prediction has excited many traders. However, the high market cap of the Ethereum coin, which now stands at $438B, may slow its growth. Since ETH will need a lot of new money for its price to surge, many traders are sidestepping it for tokens like INTL, which will not face this issue. Solana (SOL) Price Could Reach $300, Expert Claims As one of the top 10 altcoins, Solana (SOL) has also been showing some good price growth. On the one-week chart, the Solana price increased from around $190 to over $210. In other words, it saw over a 10% surge in just a few short days. Thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Iced, the crypto community is excited about Solana (SOL). In a recent X post, he told his followers that this token may soar to $300 as his Solana price prediction. Nevertheless, even if the Solana crypto manages to see a price surge, many traders think its highest upswings have passed. On the YTD chart, its value has soared over 120%. This could make a lot more investors turn to INTL instead. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Like Ethereum (ETH) & Solana (SOL)? The crypto market hardly ever allows do-overs, but IntelMarkets (INTL) could be one of those rare opportunities for those who missed out on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). In 2025, INTL is seen to become a game-changer with its groundbreaking technology, strong fundamentals and upside potential. Since it will also tap into the AI market, which could be worth $826B by 2030, as per Statista, its long-term growth potential may stand out. Due to all these factors, experts foresee a potential 3x surge in 2025 for this altcoin.

DOGE plunged 10%, with Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, BNB Chain’s BNB and ether (ETH) down at least 7%. Bitcoin fell 5.5%, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, fell 7.1%. Crypto-tracked futures betting on higher prices saw liquidation of $560 million, data shows , setting a relatively high level at the start of the year. Losses in crypto tracked those in U.S. stocks. The latest Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on U.S. service providers was stronger than anticipated, with the prices-paid measure reaching its highest point since early 2023. Concurrently, U.S. job openings rose more than forecasted. These developments led to a decline in Treasury securities across various maturities, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May. A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the inability to meet the margin requirements. When many traders are forced to sell at the same time due to long liquidations, it creates a cycle where falling prices lead to more liquidations, which in turn causes prices to drop more. As such, market watchers consider Tuesday’s drop to be a blip in the long term. “Markets took a hit yesterday, with Bitcoin and Ethereum dropping hard, mostly because stronger-than-expected U.S. job data dimmed hopes for more rate cuts this year,” shared Vince Yang, CEO and cofounder of zkLink in a Telegram message. “It’s the kind of broader sentiment shift we’ve seen before, nothing unusual for crypto.” “That said, we are still optimistic. History shows these dips often pave the way for bigger bullish movements, especially with where we are in the market cycle now, and with a more crypto-friendly administration in the US coming in, there’s every reason to believe we’re heading for some exciting times ahead,” Yang added. Singapore-based QCP Capital, however, sticks to their view of a shaky period for crypto markets in January. “It won’t be smooth sailing into January, as structural risks loom,” QCP said in a Telegram broadcast on Wednesday. “The U.S. Treasury debt ceiling reinstatement is projected to be reinstated mid-month, requiring the Treasury to adopt ""extraordinary measures"" to fund government expenditures.” “This could trigger market volatility as discussions around the issue intensify,” QCP added.",Markets,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-08 07:11:06

This coalition intends to support over 4 million users who were adversely impacted by the WazirX hack that occurred in July 2024, in which the exchange lost $230 million . Protection for the Sufferers of the Grand Theft The WazirX WazirX - legal@wazirx.com Centralised Exchange Crypto trading and Information security breach brought down about 45% of the entire crypto assets of the exchange and made the users unhappy. The most important element of the recovery plan developed by coinswitch coinswitch - Centralised Exchange is to enable victims to reclaim their funds, receive some of the rewards, and get back into the cryptocurrency trading business. The program , which is being run completely from scratch with the funds that CoinSwitch has on its balance, speaks about the sincere desire of the platform to create trust in the Indian crypto market . The crypto exchange CoinSwitch which has recently garnered investments from Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and Coinbase Ventures has $300 million in its funding pool and has registered over 20 million users. Staples of the Recovery Program The ₹600-crore recovery plan, valid for 24 months, offers affected WazirX users: Upfront signup rewards: On this basis, qualified users will be able to earn up to 10 per cent of the deposited funds within 2 years. Referral benefits: This is good news to users as it means they can be able to reclaim up to 5% of the deposited amount, by providing information to other victims of the hack. Revenue redistribution: The trading revenues that will result from the program will be collective trade that will be recovered proportionally in different user losses. Accordingly, the users of the platform must produce their WazirX account balance statements to validate their statements. CoinSwitch will keep track of such losses, compute them, and disburse them. Co-founder of CoinSwitch Ashish Singhal stated that the company continues working to support the crypto community even in the moments it is under pressure. He said, Once WazirX starts allowing withdrawals from crypto, such claims can be analyzed, AUM ascertained and the subsequent rewards calculated. The exchange platform that hosts 33% of Indian crypto consumers noted that 87% of its consumers contribute roughly 8% towards claims on any of the platforms it has. However, the exchange said that it incurred a loss of more than ₹1,900 crore because of the hack. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : CoinDCX Users Slam Exchange Over Withdrawal Restrictions and Delayed Support , This relief, CoinSwitch expects users to regain within 6-8 months of WazirX unlocking funds.

Beyond these, CoinSwitch is also actively helping the affected community and, in the process, ensuring that the platform is also supporting the sustainable development of the sector. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Baby Dogecoin (BabyDoge) is proving they can, with a 9.37% weekly rise and a trading volume surge of 22.04%. Meanwhile, Dogs (DOGS) is expanding its vibrant community on the TON Blockchain, leveraging Telegram’s massive user base to create an interactive, tokenised ecosystem. But standing out among these is BTFD Coin (BTFD), which is making waves with its innovative referral programme, lucrative staking rewards, P2E game, and impressive presale performance. Meme coins have transformed the crypto world, blending humour with real utility. Among the new contenders, BTFD Coin shines as a standout, empowering its “Bulls Squad” community through a unique rewards system and a presale that’s already raised over $5 million. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin, BabyDoge, and DOGS are the best new meme coins to join for short term . BTFD Coin: Referral Programme Powers the Bulls Squad What if you could earn free crypto while helping your favourite coin grow? That’s the promise of BTFD Coin’s referral programme , a unique feature designed to reward its rapidly growing Bulls Squad community. With over 7,800 holders already onboard and more than 63 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin isn’t just building a community—it’s creating an army of loyal supporters. The referral programme is simple but powerful. Share your unique referral code with friends, family, or your online network, and both you and your referrals earn rewards. Anyone using your code gets an extra 10% $BTFD on purchases of $50 or more, while you receive 10% of the purchased amount if you rank among the top 20 referrers by month’s end. It’s a win-win setup that not only benefits individuals but also strengthens the BTFD ecosystem as more investors join the movement. Here’s how the numbers stack up. If you invest $25,000 in Stage 13 of the presale at $0.000142, you’ll receive approximately 176,056,338 $BTFD tokens. Once $BTFD lists at $0.0006, your investment could grow to a whopping $105,633—and that’s without factoring in the additional rewards from referrals or staking. The referral programme offers a unique chance to multiply earnings while playing an active role in the coin’s success. Joining BTFD Coin’s presale is straightforward. Connect your wallet to the presale page , fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and secure your tokens before the price increases. With only three stages left, now is the perfect time to “own the dip” and be part of the Bulls Squad. Baby Dogecoin: Weekly Gains and Community-Driven Innovation Baby Dogecoin (BabyDoge) continues to thrive as the leading meme coin on the BNB chain, with a 9.37% weekly price increase and a 22.04% surge in trading volume. Originally created as a playful spin-off of Dogecoin, BabyDoge has carved out a niche as a community-focused token dedicated to promoting animal welfare and pet adoption. One of BabyDoge’s standout features is its AI image generator, which allows users to create unique BabyDoge-themed characters, memes, and images. This tool not only empowers the community to engage creatively but also enables users to mint their creations as NFTs using BabyDoge tokens. Additionally, BabyDogeSwap.com offers a comprehensive platform for token swaps, farming, and more, reinforcing the token’s utility within its ecosystem. BabyDoge’s philanthropic efforts also set it apart. Having donated over 81,000 pounds of dog food to animal shelters, it’s the only meme coin with an official world record for its charitable impact. For investors who value a project with real-world contributions, BabyDoge combines feel-good initiatives with strong market performance. Dogs: Expanding Community on Telegram’s Blockchain Dogs (DOGS) is redefining meme coins with a vibrant community rooted in the TON Blockchain, leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and meme culture. Trading at $0.0005621, DOGS has remained stable with a 0.25% daily increase, despite a challenging monthly decline of 33.8%. The DOGS community revolves around its mascot, originally created by Telegram’s founder, and uses tokenised stickers and gamified rewards to engage its users. The goal? To introduce millions of Telegram users to blockchain technology in a fun, interactive way. By focusing on community ownership and fair rewards distribution, DOGS has created an ecosystem where every holder feels like a key player. As blockchain adoption within Telegram grows, DOGS is well-positioned to attract new users and expand its reach.

Let’s discuss how this meeting impacts XRP price and price prediction for January 2025. Read More: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Confirms Mar-a-Lago Meeting with Donald Trump Impact of Ripple CEO & President-elect Donald Trump’s Meet on XRP Price A recent X post revealed that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghosue and CLO Stuart Alderoty met with President-elect Donald Trump for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. This development for Ripple comes after Brad Garlinghouse’s recent comment about the most “ pro-crypto congress ” ever. It shows that things are falling into place for the crypto space but more so for Ripple and XRP. Ripple CEO Meets President Donald Trump This meeting could be considered one of the most bullish developments for Ripple and XRP after their win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two reasons. Reason 1: Crypto has been in the crosshairs of regulators under Biden’s administration. Digital asset companies and developers were being sued. However, with Trump winning the US presidential elections, the outlook has flipped on its head. The recent dinner with Trump is a subtle hint that 2025 will be a good year for Ripple with the “backing” of Trump and US regulators. Reason 2: Ripple’s win in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit propelled XRP’s value to double in under 24 hours. Unlike this situation, the meeting with Trump will likely serve as a foothold that helps XRP, the remittance token, flourish in the long run. These reasons will open the door for partnerships that could positively impact the price of Ripple (XRP) . How will this development affect XRP price prediction for January 2025? Will it help raise the targets or reduce them? XRP Price Prediction This XRP price prediction for January is divided into two phases. The initial phase involves a correction that allows investors to accumulate XRP. The next phase will see Ripple skyrocket to new highs. The four-hour chart shows that XRP rose 126% between November 26 and December 3, pushing the price from $1.28 to $2.91. After this impulse move, a lack of bullish momentum coupled with profit-taking pushed Ripple to consolidate between the $2.17 and $2.91 range. XRP price today trades at $2.30 after 6.17% on Tuesday, but it’s likely to continue its descent. The key support levels for a short-term buying opportunity include the demand zone, extending from $1.99 to $2.13 and the 62% Fibonacci retracement level at $190. Investors must note that Bitcoin will be crucial in determining bias for XRP and the rest of the crypto markets. A recent CoinGape article noted that Bitcoin could sweep December lows before kickstarting a bull run. This drop in BTC aligns with the aforementioned correction thesis for Ripple, making these dips an opportunity to accumulate XRP. XRP/USDT 4-hour Chart XRP Price Targets For January 2025 Ideally, the timeline for a dip into $2 to $1.90 territory should occur around January 20, 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated. The last week of January 2025 should see a comeback in Bitcoin and altcoin season, allowing XRP to flourish. Investors who accumulated dips in the aforementioned zone should consider booking profits at 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $3.36, just under the all-time high of $3.40. From late January to early February, XRP price could set up a new ATH at around $3.5 to $4.0. Concluding Thoughts The meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President-elect Donald Trump could have a positive impact on XRP’s price. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the recent win against the SEC, Ripple is poised for a bullish run. The predicted correction in January 2025 will provide investors with an opportunity to accumulate XRP, which could then skyrocket to new highs, potentially reaching $3.5 to $4.0 by early February 2025.

On Tuesday, Jan. 7, the asset topped $102,000 after gaining 10% over the past week. However, most of those gains have now been wiped out . Nevertheless, BTC remains within its rangebound channel, which started to form in mid-December when it fell from its all-time high. Liquidations Near $700M Over the past 24 hours, over 235,000 traders were wrecked, with total liquidations coming in at $695 million, according to Coinglass. Around 90% of those were in long positions, with over $300 million being liquidated in both BTC and ETH trades. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance, with an ETH/USDT position valued at $17.7 million. “Cryptocurrencies saw a sharp correction due to plummeting US stocks such as Nvidia and Tesla,” commented derivatives provider Greeks Live, adding that market sentiment has turned pessimistic. It noted that the “mainstream view is affected by the strong dollar and the decline of US stocks, the trend of Bitcoin has not changed, the bull market is still there.” Others have suggested that the market nuke was due to hotter-than-expected jobs data in the US. The long end rallying is due in part to hotter than expected job openings, but maybe the real reason it is going up is due to ISM prices paid which also just came in: Actual: 64.4 Estimated: 57.5 Prior: 58.2 Has not been this high since Feb. 2023, making the market wonder if… — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) January 7, 2025 It was a “nasty reaction to the ISM PMI,” said CEHV partner Adam Cochran, who added: “This pushed investors over the edge to no longer expecting a high likelihood of rate cuts moving forward.” In a note on Jan. 8, 10x Research restressed the importance of macroeconomic data in predicting Bitcoin price movements. “The strengthening of the US dollar and the rise in US bond yields have been clear manifestations of these emerging headwinds,” for global liquidity and Bitcoin’s relationship with it, they stated. Altcoin Bloodbath Total capitalization has fallen by 7% to $3.53 trillion at the time of writing as the altcoins took the brunt of the losses and $225 billion exited the space. Ethereum took a massive hit, slumping 8% in a fall below $3,400, where it remains at the time of writing. ETH has now wiped out all gains over the past five days. The altcoins are a bloodbath as usual, with double-digit losses for Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche (AVAX), Hyperliquid (HYPE), Pepe (PEPE), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Bittensor (TAO).

In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $17.16 and $18.59, with an average price of $17.87. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily, it remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions.

Cryptocurrency value has spiked up to $2.284 low over the past 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency lost up to 6.80 percent of value from its previous close. The bearish swing remained high yesterday as the bears secured the lead. However, today the technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to support the cryptocurrency buyers. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise within global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, increasing the price to $2.284. The RSI, however, has risen above 52, the continual upside in the past week lead to a considerable improvement. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to nearly double from its current level. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Will XRP reach $10? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a high chance of reaching $10 by 2028. It is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.91T trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. Currently, the coin is trading at five times its value last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $18.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network A substantial XRP transfer valued at over $1 billion coincided with a 12% surge in XRP’s price on January 2, 2025. On-chain analysis showed Ripple transferred 500 million XRP from its escrow account to a different Ripple-owned wallet. Read more about it here .

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October.

DOGE and XRP attract attention as market conditions stabilize, but Lightchain AI steals the spotlight with its $8.5m presale and blockchain-AI solutions. Table of Contents Why DOGE, XRP are catching investor interest Why Lightchain AI is a new contender to watch Investors shouldn’t miss out on the crypto wave With market conditions stabilizing, now could be the perfect time to consider investing in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP), two established favorites in the crypto world. However, a new trending altcoin, Lightchain AI , is quickly gaining traction as a standout opportunity. Currently available at $0.004875 in its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised over $8.5 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. This emerging project offers an exciting chance to capitalize on early-stage momentum alongside established players like DOGE and XRP for the next crypto bull run. Why DOGE, XRP are catching investor interest Dogecoin and XRP have gotten more attention from investors lately because of good rules changes and market moves. After Donald Trump won the election, XRP jumped over 300%, getting to about $2.40, pushed by hopes for a friendlier rule setup for crypto with the new government. In the same way, DOGE saw a big jump, with its cost going up by 7% to almost $0.34, swayed by good mood in market and guessing trad͏es. This change has made DOGE and XRP good choices for buyers looking for chances in the changing world of digital money. Why Lightchain AI is a new contender to watch Lightchain AI is a new contender in the crypto space, quickly drawing attention for its smart approach to blockchain and AI integration. With its clear roadmap leading to a 2025 mainnet launch, the platform aims to address key challenges like scalability, security, and decentralized governance. Its unique tokenomics model ensures broad participation and sustainable growth, attracting early investors. The growing ecosystem, focus on transparency, and commitment to solving critical blockchain issues make Lightchain AI a project to watch for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of decentralized technology. Investors shouldn’t miss out on the crypto wave Investors often miss out on opportunities due to misinformation or hesitation. The crypto market is no exception, with fast-changing dynamics and complex technicalities contributing to investor skepticism. It’s important to conduct thorough research and have a long-term investment mindset when considering cryptocurrencies. With DOGE, XRP, and Lightchain AI offering distinct use cases, strong communities, and robust roadmaps, now could be the best time to diversify portfolios and take advantage of potential growth. Traders shouldn’t let the Lightchain presale opportunity pass them by. To learn more about Lightchain AI, visit their website , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

There’s a lot of support from experts for both top altcoins, but a third token is getting the more popular backing. FXGuys ($FXG) is a new crypto project that intends to raise the bar on trader welfare and newfound profits in the market. Think of it as a DeFi token sporting the bullish potential of a meme. Here is more on SOL, XRP, and $FXG and if they can turn $100 into $10,000. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Solana Prediction: SOL Price Set to Hit $260 Solana is one of the more vibrant networks in the crypto-verse, and last year was proof. While its SOL token didn’t have much going for it in terms of development, the meme coin frenzy that started with BONK and WIF sparked quite the run for the top DeFi token . And no, SOL might not be able to turn $100 into $10,000, but its price movements are promising, and investors are anticipating an uptrend. Currently, several analysts are backing SOL for a surge close to its ATH. The trend features a reversal from its descending channel, one that would see the already bullish Solana price hit $260 from its current $207. With SOL so close to its ATH at $263, the next stage from there is price discovery. SOL might not be able to turn $100 into $10,000, but FXGuys has the potential. FXGuys: Proprietary Trading to Propel New Crypto $FXG traders are about to become the biggest winners in the market, and the reason is not far-fetched. FXGuys is fronting a new development in crypto trading–proprietary trading. Proprietary trading is a concept where traders get to access capital funding to maximize their trading potential. In other words, FX Guys will be giving its traders capital funding so that they make more profits than they would have with their limited portfolios. The traders only have to buy trading challenges on the platform (the packages run from $25 to about $1100) and pass the objectives on the challenges to qualify for capital funding. The capital ranges from $2,500 to about $100,000, and traders get to keep 80% of their trading profits, while investors get the remaining 20%. Traders can access a range of trading instruments, as the FX Guys platform features the most diverse range of trading instruments\. About 120,000 trading instruments are available from the stock, Forex, crypto, and tokenized assets markets, giving any trader quite the list to choose from for their portfolios. With a portfolio that diverse, trading risks are at the barest minimum. The FXGuys project promises a paradise for crypto traders, and it’s no wonder that most of them are investing in $FXG tokens from the presale. You should be too, trader or not. Ripple (XRP) Could Be In for a Meteoric 2025 Ripple has had four difficult years so far, as its drawn-out lawsuit with the SEC saw the project stagnate significantly. Donald Trump’s administration promises a conducive regulatory environment for the crypto-verse, and tokens like Ripple’s XRP might be seeing some relief after all. XRP is preparing for better times ahead, too, as the on-chain metrics have improved greatly. Open Interest and Relative Strength Index are showing strong investor interest, with an 80% spike on the card. The most recent forecast saw XRP go 80% up if the token got past its $2.34 resistance. Ripple’s XRP is currently trading at $2.4 , 11.07% up on the weekly timeframe, and raring to rise rapidly. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Is the Best Bet to Turn $100 Into $10,000! After the dismal performances of many top altcoins like Solana and XRP. However, the SOL token has started the new year with an impressive momentum. Ripple’s XRP token is also getting positive shouts, especially following the change in government in the US. Both top altcoins and the new $FXG DeFi token have been predicted to turn $100 into $10,000 by mid-year. Meanwhile, $FXG is offering 150% in its presale to start off in the short term. The presale gains the short-term potential on SOL and XRP, and investors have now invested more than $3.3 million in the new crypto’s ongoing presale. New investors can get $FXG tokens now in Stage 2 at $0.04 and anticipate the launch date when the price goes up to $0.10. Join the bullish movement and lock in potential gains to turn $100 into $10,000.

Với mức ATH (mức giá cao nhất) mới đây của Bitcoin vượt $108.000, chúng ta thấy thị trường vẫn đang rất mạnh mẽ. Mặc dù khả năng điều chỉnh sâu hơn trong quý 1/2025 vẫn còn đó, nguồn cung thì ngày càng thắt chặt hơn, nhưng tâm lý lạc quan của các thợ đào cho thấy Bitcoin có vị thế tốt để tiếp tục tăng trưởng trong trung hạn. Tỷ lệ dự trữ thanh khoản , chỉ số theo dõi thời gian nguồn cung hiện tại đã giảm mạnh từ 41 tháng xuống chỉ còn 6,6 tháng, tức là lượng Bitcoin sẵn có trên thị trường chỉ đủ đáp ứng nhu cầu trong 6,6 tháng. Điều này cho thấy nguồn cung Bitcoin đang cạn kiệt nhanh chóng, đặc biệt rõ ràng trong các đợt tăng giá mạnh vào quý 1 và quý 4 năm 2024. Các thợ đào Bitcoin, những người thường bán ra lượng lớn Bitcoin trong những năm diễn ra halving, đã giảm lượng Bitcoin chuyển lên sàn giao dịch kể từ tháng 4/2024. Lượng Bitcoin mà thợ đào gửi lên sàn đang ở mức thấp nhất trong nhiều năm, vì họ đang nắm giữ lợi nhuận chưa thực hiện lớn và hold Bitcoin thay vì bán. Áp lực bán tổng thể từ các thợ đào, nhà đầu tư dài hạn và các nhóm khác đã giảm đáng kể . Việc giảm nguồn cung vào thị trường đã làm giảm bớt tác động của đợt điều chỉnh gần đây. Kết thúc năm 2024, nền kinh tế Mỹ với những bằng chứng tiếp tục cho thấy sự phục hồi , tuy nhiên, điều này cũng đi kèm với một số bất ổn kéo dài trên một số lĩnh vực chính. Thị trường lao động vẫn duy trì mạnh mẽ , khi số đơn xin trợ cấp thất nghiệp giảm xuống mức thấp nhất trong 8 tháng là 211.000 vào cuối tháng 12, bất chấp những dự đoán và củng cố niềm tin vào sức mạnh của nền kinh tế. Sự sụt giảm bất ngờ này, cùng với sự sụt giảm trong các yêu cầu tiếp tục, cho thấy thị trường lao động đang hạ nhiệt với tốc độ vừa phải mà không báo hiệu một cuộc suy thoái trên diện rộng. Dữ liệu lao động tích cực đã thúc đẩy tâm lý thị trường, củng cố đồng đô la và thúc đẩy mức tăng khiêm tốn trên Phố Wall. Ngược lại, lĩnh vực xây dựng lại cho thấy một bức tranh ảm đạm hơn, với chi tiêu bị đình trệ trong tháng 11 sau mức tăng trưởng khiêm tốn trong tháng 10. Lợi nhuận trong xây dựng nhà ở cho một gia đình đã bị bù đắp bởi sự sụt giảm trong nhà ở nhiều gia đình và đầu tư công. Lãi suất thế chấp tăng cao, do thị trường dự đoán những thay đổi trong chính sách tài khóa dưới thời chính quyền sắp tới, đang đè nặng lên nhu cầu nhà ở và các dự án mới. Ngành xây dựng phải đối mặt với những khó khăn đi kèm , bao gồm cả thuế quan tiềm năng, tình trạng thiếu lao động và bất ổn thương mại, có thể cản trở tăng trưởng bền vững bất chấp khả năng thúc đẩy từ chi tiêu cơ sở hạ tầng trong tương lai. Trong khi đó, lĩnh vực sản xuất cho thấy dấu hiệu phục hồi nhưng vẫn chịu áp lực. Chỉ số nhà quản trị mua hàng (PMI) đã tăng lên 49,3 trong tháng 12, mức cao nhất kể từ tháng 3, nhưng vẫn dưới ngưỡng tăng trưởng là 50. Mặc dù sản xuất và đơn đặt hàng mới được cải thiện, nhưng ngành sản xuất đã phải vật lộn để phục hồi hoàn toàn sau một thời gian dài suy thoái do chi phí vay cao hơn từ việc Cục Dự trữ Liên bang tăng lãi suất trước đó. Việc cắt giảm lãi suất gần đây và triển vọng kích thích tài khóa dưới thời chính quyền sắp tới mang đến một tia hy vọng, nhưng những lo ngại về chính sách thương mại và nhu cầu toàn cầu biến động tiếp tục phủ bóng đen lên triển vọng của lĩnh vực này. Cập nhật về các tin tức tiền điện tử tuần trước: Nghị sĩ Hoa Kỳ Mike Collins đã tiết lộ các khoản đầu tư vào tiền điện tử Ski Mask Dog (SKI), với tổng giá trị mua vào từ 1.001 đến 15.000 USD. Hồ sơ của ông, một trong những hồ sơ đầu tiên cho năm 2025, nhấn mạnh sự giao thoa ngày càng tăng giữa tài sản kỹ thuật số và chính trị, dấy lên nghi vấn về tính minh bạch và giám sát theo quy định. Trong khi đó, sàn giao dịch tiền điện tử FTX đã ngừng hoạt động vừa khởi động kế hoạch tái cấu trúc để hoàn trả cho những người dùng trước đây bị ảnh hưởng bởi sự sụp đổ năm 2022 của sàn. Khách hàng đã nộp đơn yêu cầu có thể mong đợi được hoàn trả trong vòng 60 ngày, với các yêu cầu nhỏ hơn sẽ được ưu tiên. MicroStrategy cũng đã công bố kế hoạch huy động tới 2 tỷ USD thông qua việc chào bán cổ phiếu ưu đãi vĩnh viễn. Sáng kiến ​​này là một phần trong “Kế hoạch 21/21” đầy tham vọng của công ty nhằm đảm bảo 42 tỷ USD trong ba năm để mua lại Bitcoin. Là công ty nắm giữ Bitcoin lớn nhất, với hơn 145.000 BTC, công ty tiếp tục củng cố vị thế của mình trên thị trường tài sản kỹ thuật số. Chúc các bạn một tuần giao dịch thành công!

The price of Bitcoin dropped drastically after topping $100K the day prior. The dip also affected major cryptocurrencies and caused over $150 million in liquidations. As of the time of publication, Bitcoin’s price dropped by more than 4% in the last 24 hours and hovers around $97,000. Ethereum also experienced an 8% dip in the last 24-hour period, while Solana dropped by more than 7% and XRP dropped by around 5%.

Bitcoin dropped over 5%, Ethereum fell around 8%, and Solana and XRP also saw declines. The total market cap decreased by 7.6% to $3.6 trillion, with $507… pic.twitter.com/f8nXKWbDat — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) January 8, 2025 The crypto market correction led to major liquidations, as data from CoinGlass showed that $388 million worth of long and short positions were nuked over the last 24 hours. The data also revealed that $230 million worth of liquidations came in the last four hours alone, with long positions making up the vast majority of the liquidations at $212 million. The data indicated that the figure was lower than the single largest 24-hour or hourly liquidation seen in the last month, which was around $856.7 million. The figures also revealed that more than 129,900 cryptocurrency traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours. The CoinGlass data highlighted that the largest single liquidation order was an ETHUSDT position on Binance, valued at more than $11.9 million. Crypto stocks MicroStrategy and Coinbase also dropped by more than 9% and 8%, respectively, while Bitcoin miners Core Scientific and MARA Holdings fell more than 6% and 7%, respectively. U.S. job openings data causes share drop in crypto prices “TLDR on why the market is dipping: US data came in hot, causing a bond yield spike. ISM index higher than expected, JOLTS job openings increased. We’re in the “good data is bad data” phase of the market for risk assets ahead of FOMC in 2 weeks.” ~ Miles Deutscher , Crypto analyst. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released new data on Tuesday showing 8.1 million job openings at the end of November, the highest level since May 2023 and an increase from the 7.84 million released in October. Data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also revealed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. Tuesday’s report also disclosed that the quitting rate, a sign of confidence among workers, dropped to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The hiring rate also dropped to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Consensus Cloud Solutions also revealed that it expects the U.S. economy to add 163,000 jobs, down from the 227,000 additions seen in November. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the signs of slowing in the labor market as “loser than pre-pandemi,” as the quitting and hiring rates fell lower than before the pandemic. The drop in crypto prices also came amid a sudden increase in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which climbed six basis points to 4.69%. Data released by the Institute for Supply Management indicated faster-than-expected growth in the U.S. service sector in December, which added to concerns about stickier inflation. Bank of Corp. strategists also predicted that traders could return to perceiving strong economic data as negative because it signaled that the Fed will need to keep rates elevated for longer. The central bank signaled last month that although it was cutting rates a third time, it may make fewer rate cuts in 2025 than investors had anticipated. Rate cuts have historically had a positive effect on Bitcoin, while hikes have had a negative impact. Thomas Tzitzouris at Strategas disclosed that this is bad news, and it is not just for Treasuries. With corporates trading at their tightest levels of the cycle adjusted for default risk, we’re entering a “danger zone” for both risk assets and safe havens.

However, at the time of writing, Ethereum has declined by more than 9% and is now trading below $3,350. Ethereum’s 1-month high is at $4,098.29, while the 1-month low is $3,103.37, showing the current range within which Ethereum has been trading. According to experts, a break below $3,540 could signal the end of the bullish momentum and favor a bearish scenario. In this case, Ethereum could experience a correction, with support levels between $2,400 and $3,160. If these levels hold, Ethereum may be able to recover and move higher. If the price continues to rise from here, the bullish Scenario would gain strength, and Ethereum could potentially reach $4,000 or more. A Look At The Technicals: Currently, the price action is stuck near the 3-standard deviation resistance at $3,620.49, which indicates a significant barrier to further upward momentum. Additionally, the 3-10-16 day MACD moving average has stalled around $3,613.10, signaling potential indecision in the market. Analyst Weighs In Analyst Josh of Crypto World said that Ethereum is currently forming a potential bullish pattern called an inverse Head and Shoulders on the weekly chart. However, this pattern is not yet confirmed. To confirm it, Ethereum needs to break above the $4,000 to $4,100 level with a weekly close. If that happens, it could set a price target near $7,000, offering a major trading opportunity. Right now, Ethereum is trading in a range. The resistance is between $3,900 and $4,100. For the short-term trend, the analyst said that Ethereum appears more bullish than bearish as it is making higher lows and higher highs, and has recently broken above a key resistance level.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 07:26:31

RLUSD is issued on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, which makes it natively compatible with smart contract applications and DeFi. . @Ripple has adopted the Chainlink standard to access highly secure & reliable pricing data around the recently launched Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. Learn how Chainlink Price Feeds are set to accelerate the adoption of RLUSD across the DeFi ecosystem: https://t.co/BKJIgG0mpS — Chainlink (@chainlink) January 7, 2025 Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, said, “The adoption of tokenized assets such as stablecoins will continue to accelerate in the coming years, and having access to critical on-chain data will accelerate the process.” “By leveraging the Chainlink standard, we bring trusted data on-chain, further strengthening RLUSD’s utility across both institutional and decentralized applications,” added Jack McDonald, SVP at Ripple. RLUSD is entering a crowded stablecoin market dominated by Tether, which has a 65% market share. The total stablecoin market capitalization is at a record high of around $212 billion, representing around 6% of the entire crypto asset market, according to CoinGecko, which lists 232 stablecoins or pegged token derivatives. XRP and LINK Slide The announcement did nothing for the pair’s respective tokens, which took a hit in the broader market slump on Tuesday. Ripple’s XRP has fallen 6.4% on the day, from $2.45 to $2.28 at the time of writing. However, the cross-border token still remains up 6.6% over the past week and has gained a whopping 340% over the past three months. XRP remains around 34% down from its peak price of $3.40, which came seven years ago this week. Chainlink’s LINK took a huge 11.7% hit, falling from $23.50 to $20.5 at the time of writing as altcoins got hammered in the market correction. LINK topped $30 in a three-year high in mid-December but hasn’t managed to return there and remains down 59% from its May 2021 all-time high of $52.70.

Very Few Bitcoin Addresses Are Sitting Underwater At Current Price In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the profit-loss distribution of the Bitcoin userbase after the recovery run that the cryptocurrency has seen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Took Price From $69,000 To $108,000 Appears Again BTC is now not too far from its all-time high, so there wouldn’t naturally be many investors left in loss. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the price ranges inside which these few addresses still underwater bought their coins. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the amount of BTC that the holders last purchased inside the corresponding price range. Evidently, there are only very small dots associated with the levels ahead of the current spot price. In total, these ranges contain the cost basis of approximately 380,000 addresses. This may sound like a lot, but given the sheer size of the BTC userbase, this number makes up for less than 1% of all holders of the asset. Address cost basis levels are considered important in on-chain analysis due to the fact that investors are more prone to making moves whenever their profit-loss status is about to flip. Holders who were in loss prior to the retest (that is, when the retest takes place from below) might respond by selling, as they could fear the price would go down again in the future, making this potentially their only opportunity in the near term to get their money back. This selling can visibly affect Bitcoin if the level being retested contains the acquisition level of a large amount of investors. At present, though, the ranges ahead of the asset are clearly quite thin with addresses, meaning they should likely offer little in the way of resistance from such panic sellers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Supply Breaks Equilibrium: Whales Scoop Up 240,000 BTC This doesn’t necessarily mean crossing these levels would be a walk in the park for the coin, however, as when the profit-loss balance in the market shifts overwhelmingly towards profits, something else starts posing a significant risk: selling with the motive of profit-taking. The more lopsided the market gets, the higher is the probability of a mass selloff happening. With almost all Bitcoin investors sitting in gains right now, some of them are bound to exit their positions. It only remains to be seen whether demand would be strong enough to offset this selling pressure or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $97,900, up 3% over the past week.

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, surged past $102,000 yesterday, sparking renewed optimism among investors anticipating a market rally ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration. However, the gains were short-lived as Bitcoin dropped by 5.7% within 24 hours, weighed down by rising U.S. bond yields and investor caution ahead of key economic updates, including the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes and nonfarm payroll data. The increase in bond yields has fueled expectations of a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. Officials have already signaled plans for only two interest rate cuts in 2025, fewer than previously anticipated. Investors are now awaiting the Fed’s meeting minutes, set to be released on Wednesday, Jan. 8, for more clarity on policymakers’ deliberations. Further pressure on Bitcoin came from a U.S. Labor Department report revealing job vacancies had climbed to a six-month high, driven by growing demand in the services sector. It precedes the crucial nonfarm payroll report scheduled for Friday. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could solidify expectations of prolonged Fed tightening, as a resilient labor market may continue to fuel inflationary pressures.

Notably, this figure represents a 94% drop compared to the $987 million inflows recorded the previous day. According to data from SoSoValue, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only BTC ETF to record an inflow on Tuesday. The asset manager’s spot Bitcoin ETF drew in $596.11 million of inflows managing to offset the collective outflows seen from the other BTC ETFs. ARK and 21Shares’s ARKB logged the highest outflows of the day with $212.55 million exiting the fund. Grayscale’s two Bitcoin ETFs tickered GBTC and BTC also contributed to the negative momentum with $125.45 million and $113.85 million outflows respectively. Fidelity’s FBTC reported an outflow of $86.29 million while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw a more modest outflow of $5.58 million. The remaining BTC ETF saw “0” flows on the day. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume for these investment products stood at $4.62 billion on Jan. 7 a jump from the $3.96 billion witnessed a day before. AT press time Bitcoin ( BTC ) was exchanging hands at $96,145 per coin.

Pro-Bitcoin Pierre Poilievre is favored to become the next prime minister. Poilievre proposes policies to make Canada a global blockchain hub. Justin Trudeau’s resignation as Canada’s Prime Minister marks a crucial political moment, potentially opening the way for a pro-crypto agenda under Pierre Poilievre. Trudeau announced his decision to step down after 11 years as Liberal Party leader and eight years as Prime Minister since 2015. His tenure, marked by controversies such as imposing sanctions on cryptocurrency wallets during the 2022 Freedom Convoy protests, has often been viewed as anti-crypto. Aaron Arnold, host of the popular YouTube channel Altcoin Daily, analyzed how Trudeau’s departure could herald a new era for blockchain innovation in Canada. With Poilievre now emerging as the frontrunner for the prime minister’s role, as predicted by Poly Market with an 87% probability, Canada could become a global leader in the digital asset space.

Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin dropped by nearly 7% after reaching a three-week high. Ethereum followed closely, experiencing a nearly 10% drop. Bitcoin Faces Strong Selling Pressure Binance, the largest crypto trading platform by volume, showed a sharp rise in Bitcoin selling. According to Cryptoquant on-chain analyst Darkfost Binance’s hourly Net Taker Volume , a key indicator of market sentiment, turned significantly negative, hitting $325 million, the highest recorded in 2025. This drop happened after disappointing U.S. economic reports, including weaker-than-expected PMI and job openings data. These reports made risky assets like Bitcoin less attractive, leading to higher sell-offs. While some fear this could signal a long-term bearish trend, others believe it might just be a short-term reaction. Ethereum Sees Its First Big Drop of the Year Meanwhile, Ethereum didn’t escape the pressure, recording its first major price dip in 2025. The price dip comes amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve might skip an anticipated rate cut in its upcoming January 29 meeting Even though there’s no panic among Ethereum investors, yet ETH ETF flow into the exchange has seen an outflow of 86 million . Despite this, some positive signs are emerging, like Coinbase, another leading exchange, has seen buying momentum, likely supported by strong ETF data earlier in the week. If this trend continues, Ethereum could bounce back. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? While Bitcoin and Ethereum are under pressure, there’s still hope for a potential recovery if ETF inflows and buying interest rise. For now, experts advise caution, especially with upcoming events like Trump’s inauguration adding uncertainty to the market. Currently, Bitcoin’s price has dropped by 6.5% , trading at $95,433, showing a 6.5% decrease over the last 24 hours. This has also caused its market cap to fall to $1.89 trillion.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL.

The mid-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.6 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $2 billion, dropped over 11 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $0.00001816 on Wednesday, during the early European session. As a result of the heightened volatility, more than $5.6 million was liquidated from the leveraged Pepe market, with over $4.9 million involving long traders. Moreover, the majority of the memecoin projects registered a double percentage digit loss in the last 24 hours. Major Factors that Attributed to Pepe Price Drop Today The notable decline of Pepe’s price in the recent past is majorly attributed to the whale shakeouts. For instance, a whale investor with 1 trillion Pepe units, worth over $18 million, deposited over 427 billion Pepe units, with around $8.45 million to Kraken in the last two days. Worth noting that the Pepe whale has accrued an estimated profit of about $13.45 million. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Dexscreener, Pepe traded in the past 24 hours majorly involved more sellers than buyers. Out of the $3.3 million Pepe traded on DeFi protocols, around $2 million involved sellers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Struggles: Bitcoin and Ethereum Face Selling Pressure , Midterm Targets After dropping below the 50-day Moving Average (MA), Pepe’s price has entered a slippery slope that could lead to further losses in the coming days. Although Pepe’s price is in a macro bull run in the weekly time frame, the memecoin faces a midterm drop of between 10-20 percent before rebounding towards a new all-time high (ATH). Furthermore, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) slipped below the 50 percent level, suggesting the sellers have overtaken the buyers in the midterm. However, Pepe and the rest of the crypto industry are highly anticipating the inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President to kickstart the next bullish trend phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 81,300 YouTube subscribers that based on historic precedence the TOTAL3 chart may soon have an astronomical breakout. The TOTAL3 chart tracks the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. “[In 2021] Bitcoin got to a really high price and just started chopping. And when it was chopping around, the TOTAL3 went to the moon.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Svenson predicts that the most explosive season for the alts will start around the 40th week after the halving event in April 2024, when miners’ rewards were cut in half, which would be around the end of January. “So in this cycle right now the altcoins are currently not even the 40th week post-halving. We haven’t even gotten the all-time high break. In the last cycle, when you broke that high, it was 170% for the TOTAL3 as a whole, 170% up. Maybe it won’t be as much a percent, but still, there’s a major move ahead of us… The most bullish part of the cycle has not even started yet, hasn’t even begun yet. So we have multiple more weeks to go where Bitcoin could get really, really bullish and continue to be bullish. And the altcoins also will look for a major pump over the next couple of months, in my opinion.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests the TOTAL3 market cap may reach around $2 trillion for the cycle peak, up from the current $982.2 billion. Svenson also believes that the flagship crypto’s dominance level (BTC.D) will soon start to decline. The BTC.D is the ratio between the market cap of BTC versus the market cap of all crypto assets combined. “What you’ll notice in previous cycles is that right after the 40th week – the halving takes place, 40 weeks later – that’s when [Bitcoin] dominance really starts to plummet… Once we get into this green zone past the 40th week that’s when I think Bitcoin dominance is going to start to take a big tumble, and altcoins are going to take over in dominance.” Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that BTC.D may dip to around 42% within six months. Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube At time of writing, BTC.D is at 58.01%. ?

However, the 200-day EMA is strong support, highlighting room for a potential bullish reversal in the upcoming time. Is Solana A Hold Or Sell?

The topics of major challenges including closed source code, centralized API dependence, and closed decentralization have generated discussions across crypto. As a result, HYPE token price suffered a sharp drop of 15% in the last 24 hours amid the broader market volatility. With increasing demands for transparency, the project’s future remains under a critical challenge . Hyperliquid Responds to Validator Decentralization Concerns Hyperliquid has come under fire following claims about decentralization flaws raised by Kam , a well-known figure in the crypto community. Kam, in a detailed post on X, highlighted concerns about the platform’s validator structure, accusing it of being overly centralized and closed to wider participation. He also alleged that the current system restricts competition and creates barriers for validators outside the initial testnet participants. In so doing, Hyperliquid released a press statement in response to the accusations. The platform emphasized that all validators earned their positions based solely on testnet performance, rejecting accusations that seats could be purchased. Hyperliquid noted that such allegations trivialize the effort taken, by validators who dedicated a lot of time to learning and aiding to evolve the system. In an effort to further decentralize the network, the exchange has announced plans to develop the validator set as the blockchain ages. The Foundation Delegation Program is introduced to back the high-level validator and build up a more decentralized ecosystem. The group also dispelled the misconception about API server availability, that it is possible to run any server pointing to any node. Hyperliquid addressed concerns about the closed-code status of its existing node. The platform assured users that open sourcing will happen once development stabilizes and becomes secure. Hyperliquid’s Stance on Testnet Tokens and Market Innovation Responding to calls about testnet tokens, Hyperliquid restaffed the company’s position against a black market for testnet HYPE. This also presented current work to better the participation onboarding of subjects. The platform reaffirmed its commitment to fast innovation. It aims to put all financial transactions on-chain in a transparent and inclusive way. At the same time, dYdX’s CEO, in another statement, commented on the current controversy in that the criticisms against Hyperliquid’s validator model. He added that it is common for early-stage projects to face scrutiny regarding centralization as they scale and mature. He acknowledged the criticisms but stressed the need for robust technical systems. HYPE Token Price Drops Amid Concerns HYPE token has dropped sharply by 15% over the 24 hours to date and was trading at $21.62. The 24-hour low and high were $21.25 and $26.29, respectively. The market cap of the token was $7.24 billion and the trading volume was $213 million. As per Coinglass data, Hyperliquid Futures’ trading volume reached $7.45 billion, with $3.47 billion in open interest. HYPE Price Meanwhile, this Hyperliquid concern also comes amid soaring interest in the HYPE token. Notably, despite the recent dip, the token has added about 64% over the last 30 days. Besides, a recent CoinGape report showed that Solana’s price fell after a whale dumped its Solana reserves and exchanged them for HYPE . On the other hand, Hyperliquid mainnet has recently revealed a major update, which has also fueled market optimism. In a recent announcement, the project introduced the HYPE token staking feature on its decentralized exchange.

Trump wasted no time hyping up the announcement. The project’s first phase targets eight states: Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. These AI-powered data hubs, according to Trump, will put America at the top of the global tech ladder. “This is how we stay on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and advanced technology,” Trump said, standing in front of cameras at his luxury resort. What $20 billion buys Sajwani said, “We’re planning to invest $20 billion, maybe even more if the market allows.” The hubs will handle everything from powering advanced machine learning systems to crunching massive datasets for industries ranging from healthcare to self-driving cars. But the deal wasn’t just about the cash. Trump promised to cut red tape, fast-tracking the permitting and environmental approvals to get these projects moving. He claimed his return to power has inspired foreign investors like Sajwani to pump money into the U.S. economy. Trump is already pointing to this deal as evidence of the “economic revolution” he promised during his campaign. This isn’t the first tech megadeal the president has closed since winning the election. In December, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, to announce a mind-blowing $100 billion investment plan over the next four years. Trump’s message was clear: under his leadership, America will become the ultimate destination for tech and innovation. His economic playbook is basically, slash corporate taxes, roll back regulations, and push foreign companies to build on American soil. Trump’s hardline approach—using tariffs to protect U.S. industries and threatening penalties on companies that manufacture overseas—is scaring some business leaders. But others, like Sajwani and Son, see it as a golden ticket to tap into the world’s largest consumer market. Trump has also pledged to unleash all forms of energy—fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables alike—to meet the surging demands of AI infrastructure. Nvidia’s CEO joins the party While Trump and Sajwani are pouring billions into infrastructure, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, is eyeing how these developments could affect his company’s monster growth. Nvidia is the world’s top AI chipmaker, and has been at the forefront of AI hardware innovation. In a recent Bloomberg interview , Huang said he’s eager to work with the new administration, which hasn’t reached out to him yet. “We’ll provide as much insight as we can,” he said. Trump’s trade policies could make or break Nvidia’s global ambitions. The company already faces tight restrictions on selling its high-powered chips to China. If Trump doubles down on tariffs, Nvidia may have to rethink its strategy. What Biden is leaving behind In its final weeks, the Biden administration is rushing to roll out new rules to make it easier for companies to get permits for geothermal energy projects. These rules are part of a bigger push to boost infrastructure for AI data centers, according to insiders. The plan, which could drop as early as next week, includes setting up a competitive system for building data centers on federal land and speeding up approvals for geothermal and nuclear energy projects. The details are still being finalized, and the timeline might shift, said sources who spoke anonymously. But Trump has hinted he may reverse these policies with the stroke of a pen. Biden’s executive orders on AI safety and security are also in Trump’s crosshairs. While Biden sought to regulate the industry, Trump’s approach focuses on growth, competition, and speed.

New Legal Framework for Digital Assets This decision comes just after the introduction of GMC Law No. 1 of 2024, known as the ‘ Application of Laws Act 2024’ . The law sets a clear legal and regulatory framework for businesses dealing with digital assets in GMC. This law, along with the decision to add Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB to the city’s reserves, strengthens the digital ecosystem in GMC.

He has repeatedly warned of the crash in several prior posts on social media, which has sparked discussions in the market, especially as the market awaits the upcoming Fed’s FOMC minutes . However, in his recent X post, he has shared the potential reasons behind the crash, but still maintained his bullish outlook on Bitcoin. So, let’s take a look at his recent comments and see his intake on the recent market fundamentals. Robert Kiyosaki Shares Insight On Market Crash Renowned Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reiterated his prediction of a massive market crash, confirming that it is now a reality. In a recent X post, Kiyosaki referenced his 2013 book “Rich Dad’s Prophecy,” which forecasted the impending stock market crash. This has fueled crypto market concerns, as stocks and crypto often move in tandem, with investors awaiting the Fed’s FOMC Minutes from December. Reasons Behind The Recent Crash The author attributes the crash to the actions of leaders in 2008, particularly former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , who prioritized banker bonuses over the welfare of ordinary citizens. Besides, he notes that various sectors, including the car market, housing market, and retail, are currently experiencing a downturn. However, despite the grim outlook, Kiyosaki sees opportunities for savvy investors. He predicts that valuable assets like houses, gold, silver, and Bitcoin will become more affordable, presenting a chance to accumulate wealth. He also emphasized capitalizing on this by investing in real assets, including gold and silver mines. Lastly, the author advises readers to remain calm and informed, highlighting that market crashes can be a catalyst for growth and wealth accumulation. Why Is Bitcoin Crash A ‘Great News’? In a separate post, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has maintained his bullish stance on Bitcoin. As BTC price today slipped nearly 6% to $95,845 while its trading volume soared 36% to $66 billion, Robert Kiyosaki urged investors to buy more. Robert Kiyosaki’s On BTC Accumulation Notably, the author has recently called the ongoing Bitcoin crash “Great news” , which has sparked market discussions. However, he confirmed accumulating more BTC, saying that “Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale.” Simultaneously, he has urged investors to keep accumulating BTC at lower price and hold. This also showcases his growing confidence in the flagship crypto and its long-term perspectives. Besides, he also highlighted the limited supply of BTC, saying that only “2 million more Bitcoins” are left to be mined. Crypto Market Crash Fuels Concern The recent crypto market crash has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, as evidenced by the liquidation of $712 million in the digital assets space. Simultaneously, despite Robert Kiyosaki’s bullish take, investors are looking for potential reasons behind the recent drop in BTC price . Notably, the investors appear to have maintained a cautious stance as BTC soared past the $100K mark yesterday. On the other hand, the experts also warned over potential volatility with a flurry of key economic events scheduled for this week. For context, the US Fed’s FOMC Minutes is scheduled to be released today. The market saw a major pullback after the US Fed announced the last rate cut of the year last month. Having said that, the December FOMC minutes might fuel the ongoing market volatility. Simultaneously, the traders will also keep close track of the upcoming US Job data to understand the health of the Labor Market.

The forecast stems from his analysis of a distinctive price pattern observed in XRP’s weekly market cap chart. Following Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November 2024, XRP experienced substantial market appreciation. The digital asset’s valuation rose dramatically from $28.13 billion, when it traded at $0.50, reaching an unprecedented seven-year high of $165.74 billion as the price almost touched $2.9 in early December 2024. Half mast flags should complete within six weeks, otherwise they should be viewed with great suspicion. This flag in $XRP needs to rock and roll soon, otherwise it will likely morph into something else TBD. But if it completes, then market cap of $500 B is possible pic.twitter.com/c7BHqnQFkP — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) January 6, 2025 Technical Pattern Suggests Further Growth According to Brandt’s analysis, XRP’s price action has entered a consolidation phase after achieving these significant milestones. The current market structure exhibits what he refers to as a half-mast flag pattern, characterized by a period of price compression between converging trendlines following a strong upward movement. Supporting technical indicators reinforce the pattern’s significance. The Average Directional Index (ADX) is at 39.95, indicating robust trend momentum. While trading volume has decreased during the consolidation period, this reduction aligns with typical flag pattern characteristics and often precedes significant price movements. Brandt emphasizes the time-sensitive nature of this technical formation. He believes the breakout will occur within approximately six weeks. If it exceeds this timeline, it could devolve into a different technical format, and Brandt noted that this development should be viewed with suspicion. However, if the pattern can complete its formation, Brandt says this could push XRP’s market cap to $502 billion, adding to the list of bullish predictions for a massive XRP market cap . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for XRP’s Market Position This projected market cap is almost four times XRP’s current market cap of $131.41 billion at its current price of $2.29. If its market cap climbs to $502 billion, XRP would have a price of approximately $8.74. Assuming Ethereum maintains its current market capitalization of $407.7 billion, this development could position XRP as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market. Despite his historical skepticism toward XRP, Brandt has recently adopted a more optimistic stance. In November, he identified $1.96 as a crucial resistance level , suggesting that surpassing this threshold could trigger substantial price appreciation. XRP subsequently broke through this level, which now functions as a support zone. Brandt further reinforced his bullish outlook in December 2024, when he identified an XRP chart he described as the most powerful in the crypto world. Other prominent crypto voices have shared their predictions that XRP can surpass Ethereum in the current cycle, and Brandt’s analysis has bolstered the bullish sentiment surrounding the asset.

The onshore renminbi fell 0.1% on Wednesday to Rmb 7.34 against the US dollar, its weakest since September 2023. According to a Financial Times report , the decline occurred despite the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) maintaining a steady daily fixing rate ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration. The renminbi’s exchange rate, which is allowed to trade within a 2% band of the PBoC’s daily rate, is now nearing the lower limit of that range. Analysts attribute the selling pressure to fears that proposed tariffs on Chinese goods could push Beijing to weaken its currency further, offsetting the impact on exports. International trades are an imperative component of China’s economic growth, because domestic demand is currently at a low. Market speculation and currency policy The drop in the onshore yuan, which sank below the 7.3 mark to a 14-month low earlier this week, has sparked speculation that the PBoC may adopt a more lenient approach to currency depreciation. Ju Wang, head of greater China foreign exchange and rates strategy at BNP Paribas, noted that the market has been pricing in these concerns since the US election. “ The market doesn’t want to give up, ” Wang said, adding that the central bank appears to be in “wait-and-see mode.” Wee Khoon Chong, a senior markets strategist at BNY Mellon, echoed these sentiments, citing market impatience for more significant movement in the renminbi. The currency’s slide coincides with strong US economic data, which has boosted the dollar and intensified selling pressure on the Chinese currency. Trade war 2.0 fears grow Concerns of a renewed “Trade War 2.0” under Trump have added to the yuan’s downward bias. The US President-elect’s campaign rhetoric echoed higher tariffs on Chinese imports. Markets fear that Beijing may strategically allow the renminbi to weaken to preserve its export competitiveness. These fears have reignited memories of past trade tensions, with both sides employing economic tools to gain leverage. While China’s currency faces pressure, a broader movement among BRICS nations seeks to reduce reliance on the US dollar in global trade. Currently, the dollar dominates approximately 90% of global transactions and accounts for half of all international trade. BRICS leaders argue that de-dollarization is not only a financial risk management strategy but also a way to mitigate exposure to US sanctions. Ray Dalio, CEO of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized the risks associated with holding US dollar-denominated assets. “ Sanctions mean freezing assets like US Treasury bonds. There’s concern among nations about being vulnerable to such measures ,” Dalio said. He added that direct transactions in local currencies could offer an alternative to using the dollar as an intermediary. Trump’s fiery stance on de-dollarization and BRICS When president-elect Donald Trump was campaigning for a return to the White House, has vowed to counter de-dollarization efforts. At a rally in Wisconsin, Trump pledged to maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. “ Many countries are leaving the dollar ,” he said. “ They’re not going to leave the dollar with me. ” Trump also warned that nations abandoning the dollar would face steep penalties , including 100% tariffs on their goods. Much like China, BRICS leading nation Russia is also facing a mountain of economic hurdles, although President Putin’s government is making bold moves to counter inflation. Russia’s central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 21% on Wednesday, defying widespread expectations of another increase to combat soaring inflation . Governor Elvira Nabiullina defended the decision, citing a need to pause after a series of aggressive rate hikes. The decision comes as Russia faces double-digit inflation and a sharp depreciation of the ruble, exacerbated by the economic pressures of its ongoing conflict in Ukraine. President Trump vowed to end the Ukraine-Russia war when he assumes office, much to the dismay of the latter nation. President Putin recently acknowledged the challenges of managing what he termed an “overheating” war economy. Critics within Kremlin-linked circles have expressed dissatisfaction with the central bank’s tight monetary policy, arguing it stifles the country’s economic growth.

Aside from BTC, Ethereum fell nearly 8%, Ripple dropped by 6%, and Solana slumped by nearly 10% in the 24-hour window. BTC Price Retraces Jan 6 Bump on New Congress Going into the work week, Bitcoin’s price picked up steam on Sunday after trading flat over Friday and Saturday around the $98,000 handle as it spiked to over $102,500 on Tuesday morning. That was most likely a result of the blockchain market’s enthusiasm for the incoming pro-cryptocurrency Republican Congress. US delegates for the 119th Congress took their oaths of office on Monday after convening in Washington, DC, on Jan. 3. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who oversees development for XRP—the third-most capitalized token without stablecoins (behind Bitcoin and Ethereum)— recently hailed the 119th as “the most pro-crypto Congress in history.” But on Tuesday, market euphoria over the new regime in Washington faded fast as a surge in US Treasury bond yields depressed prices for risk assets broadly. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin weren’t the only growth-oriented high-risk/reward assets to fall on Tuesday. Bitcoin’s Price Slumps on Treasury Yields The Nasdaq Composite focused heavily on the tech sector, fell by more than 2.5% before the close of Wall Street markets at 4 pm US Eastern Standard Time. By the end of the day, the Nasdaq had lost nearly 2% after recovering some in intraday trading. The Institute for Supply Management published new data on Tuesday indicating faster growth in December than analysts expected. Consequently, markets lost their nerve for US Treasury bonds on fears of more inflation in the US dollar. When the dollar weakens, and prices move up in a growing economy, bond coupons and their principal investment due back to the note’s owner on the maturity date lose value. So, markets sell them at a discount, causing bond yields to rise. Several analysts in retail and institutional finance have posted some exciting predictions for Bitcoin’s price in 2025. The sentiment overall for a continuing rally has been broadly bullish so far in January.

With its innovative capabilities in data processing and analysis, Lightchain AI is being hailed as the next big breakthrough in tech and finance. The excitement around this project has only grown with the launch of the Lightchain AI Presale, offering early investors an exclusive opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Lightchain AI’s AI-driven platform is already disrupting traditional models, and investors are recognizing its potential for significant growth. As momentum builds, Lightchain AI is carving out a prominent place in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and DeFi landscape. The Rise of Lightchain AI- A Revolutionary Blockchain-AI Integration Lightchain AI is revolutionizing the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence by introducing innovative solutions to longstanding challenges. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing valuable AI computations, enhancing network security and efficiency. At the core of its ecosystem is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which facilitates real-time AI tasks directly on the blockchain, ensuring scalability and privacy. By seamlessly integrating AI with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is poised to transform industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics, offering decentralized, transparent, and efficient solutions. Limitations of Toncoin and Solana- Why Investors Are Seeking Alternatives Investors are increasingly seeking alternatives to Toncoin and Solana due to several limitations. Toncoin’s growth is closely tied to Telegram’s ecosystem, which limits its broader appeal. Additionally, its utility remains largely confined to payments and basic decentralized applications, lacking groundbreaking features to distinguish itself in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. Solana, despite its high throughput and low transaction fees, faces challenges such as network outages and security vulnerabilities. Its reliance on a limited number of validators raises concerns about centralization, and the sophisticated technology can present a steep learning curve for developers. These issues have prompted investors to explore more robust and innovative platforms that offer better scalability, security, and decentralization. Why Lightchain AI is the Future of Decentralized Innovation Lightchain AI is poised to lead decentralized innovation by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its roadmap outlines a strategic progression: Prototype development is scheduled for November 2024, focusing on the introduction and testing of the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). By January 2025, the testnet rollout will enable real-world testing of AI workloads and validation mechanisms. Finally, the mainnet launch in March 2025 will mark the full deployment of PoI and AIVM, paving the way for industry-wide adoption. Security is a cornerstone of Lightchain AI’s design. The PoI consensus mechanism enhances network security by rewarding nodes for performing valuable AI computations, ensuring that network activity contributes to meaningful outcomes. Additionally, the AIVM provides a specialized execution environment for AI tasks, enabling seamless deployment of AI-powered applications on the blockchain. By addressing scalability, privacy, and efficiency challenges, Lightchain AI offers a robust and secure platform for decentralized applications, positioning it at the forefront of technological evolution. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 09:29:22

This potential 257% surge from its current trading price of $3,361, as per the data by CoinMarketCap, hinges on two pivotal factors: the successful deployment of Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and a supportive regulatory environment under Donald Trump’s presidency. Pectra Upgrade and Regulatory Optimism Dawson shared his insights in a recent interview , emphasizing that Ethereum’s success would require significant adoption of real-world assets (RWAs), robust inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and expanded utility in emerging tech sectors like decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and AI agents. He also highlighted Ethereum’s growing relevance in AI applications , with its layer-2 scaling network, Base, becoming a hub for AI agents. The Pectra upgrade, slated for the first quarter of 2025 , is expected to improve Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability, potentially attracting broader institutional and retail adoption. Dawson believes that enhanced interoperability driven by layer-2 solutions could further solidify Ethereum’s position in the crypto market. Bullish Options Market Suggests Ether Price Surge While Ether’s price has been relatively steady around $3,500 since December 20, the derivatives market suggests a bullish outlook. Dawson pointed out that on Derive.xyz, call options significantly outnumber puts, with 250% more open interest in calls. This reflects a strong appetite among traders for upward price movement. However, Dawson acknowledged potential risks to Ether’s bullish trajectory. A failure to attract institutional interest for a spot Ether ETF or losing ground to competitors like Solana could push ETH below $2,000 in a bearish scenario. He warned that other layer-1 blockchains offering higher risk-reward opportunities might challenge Ethereum’s dominance in a bull market. Long-term holder confidence in Ether has been rising , with the percentage of investors holding their tokens for over a year increasing from 59% in January 2024 to 75% by December, according to IntoTheBlock. This contrasts with Bitcoin, which saw a decline in long-term holders over the same period, reflecting growing optimism about Ethereum’s future prospects.

Posting on X (formerly Twitter) on January 8, Kiyosaki reframed the narrative around Bitcoin’s recent slide below $100,000—touching $95,000 before stabilizing at $96,000—as a rare buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern. Kiyosaki’s playbook: “Buy Low, HODL Hard” While most investors were biting their nails, Kiyosaki was already filling his shopping cart. With only 21 million coins ever to exist and fewer than 2 million left to be mined, every dip in price reinforces his belief that demand will one day collide with dwindling supply. The author’s reaction was as sharp as ever when he took to X to make his stance crystal clear: “Bitcoin crashing. Great news. I continue buying Bitcoin because Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale. Remember ‘Buy low… and HODL.’ Less than 2 million more Bitcoins to be mined.” BITCOIN crashing. Great news. I continue buying Bitcoin because Bitcoin crashing means Bitcoin is on sale. Remember “Buy low….and HODL.” Less than 2 million more Bitcoins to be mined. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 8, 2025 This approach isn’t new for Kiyosaki. He has consistently positioned Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a safeguard from economic instability—a sentiment that has only intensified with his broader economic outlook. Storm clouds and silver linings The financial guru didn’t stop at Bitcoin. He earlier delivered a grim forecast about the global economy, stating that the “biggest stock market crash in history” is already unfolding. His message was clear: be prepared for falling prices across the board. “Please be smart, keep your eyes and ears open. Many expensive assets such as houses, gold, silver, and Bitcoin will go on sale. I will be buying more real assets with fake US dollars.” I WARNED Y’all. 2013 Published Rich Dad’s PROPHECY.

I knew because in 2008 our leaders, led by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, paid himself and… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 8, 2025 ‘Rich Dad Radio Show’ host has long referred to printed money as “fake” due to the erosion of its value from inflation and excessive government spending. Instead, Kiyosaki advocates converting cash into “real” assets like gold , silver , and Bitcoin . His plan is straightforward: buy tangible, scarce assets when prices fall to build long-term wealth. It’s important to note that Kiyosaki doesn’t put all his faith in Bitcoin alone. Gold and silver have long been his go-to assets for wealth preservation, and he frequently encourages his audience to diversify into these metals alongside cryptocurrencies. While he has mentioned other digital assets like Solana in the past, his focus has shifted back to the fundamentals, investments that he believes can weather financial upheavals.

BTC was trading above $100,000 since January 6, when it reached an intraday high of $102,464. However, its decline saw the price plummet below $100,000 to its current $96,278. The price is down almost 6% over the past 24 hours, with sellers firmly in control. The rest of the crypto market fared no better, with Ethereum (ETH) plummeting over 9% to slip below $3,500. Solana (SOL) also dipped below $200 after shedding over 9% and is currently trading around $197. Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted almost 10% and slipped to $0.352. Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Chainlink (LINK), Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC) , Uniswap (UNI) and other altcoins also registered substantial losses. Bitcoin (BTC) Plummets Below $97,000 Bitcoin (BTC) registered a shard drop on Tuesday to slip below $100,000 after stronger-than-expected economic indicators put pressure on risk assets like crypto. According to data from Coin Metrics, the flagship currency fell to a low of $96,525, dropping over 5%. Crypto stocks, including MicroStrategy, Mara Holdings, Core Scientific, and Coinbase also registered substantial drops. The decline comes after a sudden increase in the 10-year US Treasury Yield following data released by the Institute for Supply Management showed faster-than-expected growth in the US service sector, adding to concerns about inflation. Market watchers expect BTC to reach $200,000 this year, with investors hopeful a clear regulatory framework will support digital asset prices and benefit crypto stocks. However, the uncertainty surrounding rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could adversely impact crypto prices. The Fed signaled it would make fewer rate cuts in 2025, a decision that rattled markets. A Surge In Liquidations The cryptocurrency market saw a surge in liquidations after Bitcoin (BTC)’s unexpected drop below $100,000. Data from Coinglass showed that over $200 million in long positions were liquidated in an hour. A total of $483 million in long positions was liquidated in 24 hours. Other altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), also registered substantial drops, with ETH slipping below the crucial $3,500 level and SOL dropping below $200. While lower than the single largest 24-hour or hourly liquidations seen in December/January, the numbers are still significant, with over 129,900 traders liquidated in the past 24 hours. The largest liquidation was seen on Binance, with nearly $12 million liquidated. US CFTC Chair To Step Down Rostin Behnam, the Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will step down on January 20, signaling the end of a four-year tenure that saw significant enforcement action in the crypto sector and calls for stronger regulations. Behnam oversaw several high-profile cases, including a $4.3 billion settlement with Binance. However, he expressed concern about the lack of oversight in the digital asset space, describing current regulations as insufficient. Under Behnam, the CFTC finalized Federal guidelines for carbon offset trading and expanded oversight into digital assets. He also ensured action against Binance for operating illegally in the US as an unlicensed crypto derivatives platform and failing to comply with regulations. He also flagged regulatory gaps in the crypto markets, arguing many tokens qualify as commodities and should come under the CFTC’s jurisdiction, calling upon his replacement to deliver “renewed focus” for more clarity. Meanwhile, Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and the current head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, has emerged as the top pick to replace Behnam. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted below $100,000 after dropping over 5% on Tuesday as markets turned bearish after stronger-than-expected economic indicators put significant pressure on risk assets. BTC slumped to a low of $96,202 on Tuesday, erasing a significant portion of the gains made the previous week before rising slightly to settle at $97,019. Meanwhile, Katie Stockton, a top technical analyst at Fairland Strategies, has warned investors to brace for a potential double-digit drop in BTC prices, suggesting the asset has been massively overbought in its latest bull run. The analyst believes BTC will find support around $84,000, implying a drop of 13%. A secondary support at around $73,800 will come into play in the event of a steeper selloff. Stockton said in a note to clients she foresaw near-term weakness despite BTC reclaiming the $100,000 level, adding that BTC could slip below $90,000 to find support around the $84,000 mark. Despite her prediction, Stockton remains bullish about BTC's long-term prospects, pointing to a strong long-term backdrop that could support the asset. “Bitcoin has a rebound underway, but we expect it to fade quickly, yielding a lower high relative to the December peak. The weekly stochastics have an active overbought downturn, and the daily stochastics are newly overbought, so we think further upside will be limited in the near term.” BTC had been quite bullish despite dropping to a low of $91,279 last Monday. It recovered from this level on Tuesday and surged to an intraday high of 496,159. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and BTC ultimately settled at $93,383, registering an increase of almost 1%. The price continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 1.06% to $94,373. Bullish sentiment intensified considerably on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of almost 3% to go above $95,000 and settle at 496,823. The price pushed above the 20 and 50-day SMAs on Friday after rising 1.09% and settling at $97,878. Source: TradingView The weekend saw buyers retain control as BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday and Sunday to settle at $98,312. Bullish sentiment intensified substantially on Monday as BTC surged past $100,000 and settled at $102,228. However, bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday following stronger-than-expected economic indicators putting pressure on risk assets. As a result, BTC plummeted over 5% to go below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA and settled at $97,019. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to drive BTC below the 20-day SMA. If sellers retain control and the bearish sentiment persists, BTC could drop to $90,000. If Stockton’s prediction holds, BTC could slip below $90,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to remain above $3,300 as bearish sentiment in the market drives prices lower. ETH lost the crucial $3,500 level on Tuesday after plummeting over 8%, slipping below key moving averages. ETH was quite bullish the previous week despite facing considerable volatility and registering only a marginal increase on Monday. Buyers attempted a move towards $3,500 on Tuesday as ETH reached an intraday high of $3,448. However, it could not go any further as sellers drove the price down almost 1% to $3,333.

Buyers retained control on Friday as WIF rose over 7% to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $2.16. However, sentiment waned on Saturday, with the 200-day SMA acting as a dynamic resistance level.

Schiff predicted that BTC’s crash will eventually cause MSTR shares to plummet. Bitcoin crashed by more than 6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $95K. American stockbroker and crypto critic Peter Schiff has predicted another bearish turn for Bitcoin (BTC) and its largest corporate holder, MicroStrategy. He also took aim at the leverage strategy employed by the business intelligence company to purchase more Bitcoin in recent months. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Schiff claimed the Trump administration would not adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. He suggested this confirmation would drive Bitcoin holders to sell, which could negatively affect MicroStrategy. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Under Fire Schiff believes MicroStrategy and its CEO, Michael Saylor, would accelerate leveraged Bitcoin purchases to prevent a crash. However, he predicts these moves will only delay Bitcoin’s collapse, eventually causing MicroStrategy’s shares to plummet. Notably, MicroStrategy’s stock price fell 9.94% on January 7, closing at $341.42.

The company’s president sees an XRP ETF likely in 2025, with pro-crypto SEC leadership potentially favoring the launch of such products. The Leaders to Embrace RLUSD ‘Imminently?’ Ripple revealed its intentions to launch a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in April last year . The product (called RLUSD) passed through a testing phase in the following months before being officially approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in mid-December. Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, Moonpay, CoinMENA, and others were the first cryptocurrency exchanges to embrace the stablecoin. Around Christmas, the Peter Thiel-backed Bullish also jumped on the bandwagon. However, behemoths like Coinbase and Binance have yet to join the list. In a recent interview for Bloomberg, Ripple’s president, Monica Long, said people should expect such a move “imminently.” The exec noted that the crypto market has been growing in the last quarters. She predicted that 2025 could also be successful for the industry, claiming that stablecoins might play a crucial role in the process. “We think that the market’s going to grow tremendously in the course of the next year. Our business doubled within payments last year, and we see a really strong growth trajectory for our payments solution, and with that, RLUSD will have a premium role,” Long added. What About an XRP ETF? Ripple’s president also assumed that US-based companies would introduce more crypto ETFs this year and that an XRP exchange-traded fund “is likely to be next in line.” “We think, especially with the administration change, the approvals of those filing will accelerate,” Long suggested. Recall that the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) will soon have a new leader – Donald Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins . He will replace Gary Gensler, who has been considered a huge enemy of the crypto industry. During his tenure, the securities regulator filed numerous lawsuits against cryptocurrency businesses, and perhaps the most popular is the one against Ripple . Gensler’s successor, Atkins, has shown a pro-crypto stance in the past, and the XRP army believes this could result in a favorable resolution of the legal battle that has been ongoing since December 2020.

The CEO discussed this initiative in an interview on Bloomberg and highlighted why the company made the strategic move. The move will ensure enhanced accessibility and liquidity of BUIDL tokens for institutions and venture-backed projects. Wintermute aims to bridge the liquidity gap and provide the crucial piece that completes the value chain by enabling BlackRock’s BUIDL to be traded more efficiently on secondary markets. BUIDL token is highly demanded in the OTC market During the interview, Wintermute CEO Gaevoy mentioned that the demand for the BUIDL token comes from institutional investors and crypto-native organizations like centralized exchanges that have leveraged cryptos for years and operate on blockchain. When institutions plan to acquire crypto, they require considerable liquidity and prefer tailored trading solutions that are lacking in most public exchanges. BUIDL tokens encourage building and participation in the blockchain ecosystem. They are not merely speculation tokens. As high-net-worth individuals and institutions feel like venturing into it, OTC trading makes it easy for them to enter and exit positions. Fully collateralized lending protocols can use the tokens to allow people to borrow against them. This clearly shows that traditional and crypto markets are converging. Traditional markets borrow a lot from the crypto market, such as general compatibility between different players. The availability of OTC trading for BUIDL tokens aligns with Wintermute’s mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) world. Wintermute is keen on shaping the future of cryptocurrency Wintermute’s quest to offer OTC for trading BUIDL shows the company’s intentions in shaping crypto markets. The firm has strategically offered its expertise in areas around exchange liquidity, DeFi, and institutional clients. It can support trading niche tokens that hold significant value for the crypto ecosystem. Offering OTC service for a growing token class like BUIDL is not a walk in the park. It requires deep market insights and the capacity to analyze the market and the infrastructure. BUIDL has low liquidity compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin and is mostly tied to specific projects.

Exploring the Economic Impact on the Crypto Market Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price took a significant hit and dived to the $96K level, marking its biggest selloff of 2025 so far, and altcoins followed suit. But amidst this downturn, major buyers are stepping in to scoop up the dip. If you’re wondering why this is happening, you’re not alone — many are confused by the market movement, but the Altcoin Daily analyst has analyzed the current market scenario. The market is in a state of panic with Trump’s inauguration and FOMC meeting the month of January will be a catastrophic month for altcoins. There is fear that Trump’s biggest plan to create the Bitcoin reserve plan and pass crypto regulations will be delayed is the reason behind the recent crashes. The Real Reason Behind the Selloff The crypto market is feeling the heat due to new U.S. economic data. While the economy shows strength, it’s not all rosy for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve is actively working to control inflation, and recent job openings data — the highest since June 2024 — has contributed to a spike in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. This suggests that the Fed might not be cutting rates as expected, which has caused the crypto market to dip. The Trump Effect? Not Quite Amid the selloff, some are blaming Donald Trump, citing concerns that he’s changing away from his pro-crypto stance. However, the analyst argues that this isn’t the case. Trump’s appointments are promising for the crypto space, with individuals who support digital assets and innovation. There’s optimism that Trump could make the U.S. a global leader in crypto regulation, even surpassing places like Dubai and Singapore. Big Predictions for Bitcoin’s Future Despite the current dip, the market is bullish about raising ETF inflow there is a bright future for Bitcoin. The channel believes Bitcoin could soar well beyond $100,000 in 2025, possibly even reaching $200,000. While some analysts predict a more conservative top of $125K to $150K, there’s a risk that many will sell too early, missing out on the long-term gains. Wall Street is also getting more involved in Bitcoin, and many altcoins are poised for big growth in the coming years. With the changing political scenario, the market is poised for significant growth in 2025. With major players buying the dip and a long-term bullish outlook, now might be the perfect time to hold onto your assets.

The decline broke crucial support levels following a market-wide correction that erased gains from the recent bullish trend. Despite the drop, whales accumulated 1.63 trillion SHIB tokens. Bitcoin also suffered a notable drop, breaking below $96k, impacting market sentiment. Investors now await signs of a potential price rebound amid market uncertainties. Shiba Inu Whales Buy 1.63T SHIB After 10% Price Crash The SHIB price has dropped by 10%, currently at $0.000021, as the broader crypto market faces liquidation pressures. The sudden downturn highlights ongoing volatility, with significant moves by large holders or “whales” contributing to the market dynamics. A notable transaction caught attention on January 7, 2025, as Whale Alert reported a massive transfer of 1.63 trillion SHIB tokens. Valued at $39 million, the SHIB tokens moved from Crypto.com to an unidentified wallet. This activity followed the recent price slump, raising speculation about whale strategies and their impact on SHIB’s price action. Despite the setback, some investors see these whale movements as a potential setup for a price rebound. With the market eyeing recovery, analysts are closely watching Shiba Inu’s performance for signs of stabilization. 1,636,940,000,000 #SHIB (39,038,563 USD) transferred from #CryptoCom to unknown wallet https://t.co/3J9xiNndj3 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 7, 2025 SHIB Technical Analysis Shiba Inu’s price chart reveals the formation of a textbook cup and handle pattern, sparking bullish sentiment among traders. The cup-shaped curve showcases a period of accumulation followed by a smaller consolidation phase, forming the handle Such technical setups often signal a strong bullish breakout, with the meme coin aiming for potential targets at $0.00003287 and $0.00005339. The anticipated breakout offers a substantial upside of 62.53%, based on historical data. The buying zone, ranging from $0.0000161 to $0.0000193, provides a strategic entry point for investors seeking to capitalize on the trend. The SHIB is currently consolidating near $0.00002151, just above this range, indicating a potential for accumulation before a breakout. If the pattern holds, Shiba Inu may experience a steady upward trajectory into mid-2025, supported by strong volume inflows. Shiba Inu Price Targets For January 2025 The Shiba Inu price prediction has sparked significant interest among investors aiming for potential gains in the crypto market. According to technical analysis, the projected movement suggests two critical targets for SHIB. The first target, referred to as the Neckline is set at $0.00003287, representing a potential 103% profit from the buy zone. Beyond that, the second target reaches $0.00005339, offering an impressive 230% gain for those holding through the projected rally. Investors should note the buy zone identified in the chart, marking an optimal entry point before the anticipated bullish breakout. Source- TradingView Shiba Inu price whales have accumulated 1.63 trillion SHIB after a 10% price crash, fueling speculation of a potential price rebound. The current technical setup suggests strong bullish potential, with SHIB targeting gains of up to 230% if the pattern holds.

Over 3,500 illegal crypto exchanges have been blocked, marking a major shift in the country’s approach to digital assets. This move came after years of growing concern over unregulated crypto platforms operating within the country. Kazakhstan Strict Action On Crypto Exchanges The crackdown was led by Kazakhstan’s Agency for Financial Monitoring (AFM RK), in collaboration with the National Security Committee and the Ministry of Culture and Information. Together, these institutions have launched a significant operation to rid the country of illegal crypto exchanges and the problems they cause. In 2023, Kazakhstan shocked the crypto world when it blocked access to Coinbase , one of the biggest crypto exchanges. Authorities said Coinbase violated Kazakhstan’s digital asset laws according to Coinpedia news. This action against a giant like Coinbase sent a clear message: Kazakhstan is serious about regulating the crypto space. Last year in 2024, Kazakhstan stepped up its efforts even more. It closed 36 illegal crypto exchanges that were dealing with over $113 million in transactions. The authorities also froze assets worth 4.8 million USDT, which is a popular stablecoin. During this operation, officials uncovered two crypto pyramid schemes and returned over 500,000 USDT to the victims. New Rules for Crypto Transactions Kazakhstan is not just targeting illegal platforms. The government is also working on new laws to make sure crypto transactions follow the rules. They are focusing on stopping money laundering and other crimes linked to digital assets. The government is also working with international partners to enhance the country’s ability to track and regulate digital asset transactions. Opening Doors to Legal Crypto Exchanges While the country is cracking down on illegal platforms, Kazakhstan is also welcoming regulated crypto exchanges. In 2023, Bybit and Binance both received full licenses from Kazakhstan’s Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA). This move shows Kazakhstan’s intention to create a safe and regulated space for crypto businesses. Kazakhstan’s Future Digital Currency Kazakhstan’s central bank is also exploring the possibility of creating a digital version of its national currency, called the digital tenge. This is part of the country’s push to stay ahead in the world of digital currencies. Kazakhstan’s actions show that it’s serious about regulating the crypto market while also embracing new technologies.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-08 09:54:50

The position may cause a further slide, as SUI goes down from its recent all-time peak. A whale’s leveraged position on SUI is threatened if the asset dips to $4.56. The whale has already received a warning for borrowing more than the limit, and for being close to the liquidation threshold . The whale deposited sSUI and SUI in two separate pools to borrow USDC and wUSDT. As of January 8, SUI hovered around $4.60, though with the occasional dip to a lower level. The crypto market moved sideways, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slid to a lower range, making other coins and tokens more volatile. SUI recently posted its all-time high at $5.33, leading whales to increase positions. The chain is one of the most active in the past year, attracting a new inflow of traders. SUI rallied along with the rest of the market in the last quarter of 2024. As a result of SUI’s expansion, the L1 chain acquired a thriving DeFi sector. The whale’s position relies on an ongoing positive price performance, as it was tied to a loan from SUI Lend. The whale deposited 4.1M SUI, or $19.3M, to borrow $14.4M in stablecoins. If the loan is liquidated, the whale will retain the stablecoins, while SUILend will become a custodian of the loan. The loan is not similar to a centralized long position, as the whale will not face a total loss. Additionally, the price pressure may be smaller, as the tokens are limited to the DeFi app. SUI has slowed down its rally, with open interest also going down from a recent peak above $800M, down to $676M. The asset is still expected to expand, as reflected by the 70% long positions. However, SUI may continue to contract as those long positions are attacked for liquidation. SUI received a boost from DeFi lending While the $20M position is at risk, SUILend is one of the key features of the ecosystem. The ability to absorb a loan of that size during liquidation shows the chain has built up its DeFi liquidity. SUI hosts more than $1.91B in total value locked, with SUILend arising in the past few months as the leading app. Previously, SUI relied on NAVI Protocol for most of its DeFi activity, but the positive SUI market performance allowed for the growth of lending. Briefly, the value locked on SUI rallied above $2B in the first days of the new year. SUI also carries more than $414M in stablecoins, taking a part of the newly minted liquidity in 2024. This has allowed DeFi users to expand loans and move into stablecoin positions through lending. Will SUI rally to a new peak? SUI was one of the most rapidly expanding L1 chains, setting up expectations of a path similar to Solana. For now, SUI trades at a much lower range, but the platform aims for a similar type of growth. The prediction of WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski for a bottom at $4.85 failed for now, as SUI may go through a deeper drawdown. I’m calling $SUI bottom pic.twitter.com/R1RvlCD1Jk — wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) January 7, 2025 SUI is a relatively new addition with claims to become a major token, and its goal for 2025 is to establish more reliable organic traffic. SUI is now seeking to launch its native AI agent platform, to tap the recent hot trend of AI tokens. In January, the SUI AI Agents token (SUIAI) is already completing its first month of trading. SUI Agents launched at the end of November 2024, allowing for one-click deployment of AI models. The SUIAI token also has DeFi elements, and has been locked for staking on Ethereum protocols. SUIAI lined up among the trending tokens of the ecosystem, despite its significant volatility. SUIAI traded at $0.04, still lagging behind the leading SUI ecosystem tokens. The chain mostly carries DeFi assets such as Cetus Protocol (CETUS) and DeepBook (DEEP).

As Scamsniffer has reported , the victim signed several phishing approvals that allowed the attackers to manage the accounts. The victim was convinced that they were interacting with a genuine website. This gave the attackers a false sense of security making them transfer funds without alerting the owner.. Phishing: A Growing Concern in Crypto Phishing scams, a type of social engineering attack, where the attacker manipulates the victim into divulging personal details or providing authorisations to the fraudster, are steadily on the rise in the cryptocurrency industry. These attacks most commonly entail the creation of a dummy site that looks like the original site. The gullible users thinking they are on the original site enter login details or click on a link approving transactions which gives the hackers full control over the wallets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : CoinSwitch Announces ₹600 Crore Recovery Plan for WazirX Hack Victims , Global Crypto Phishing Effect Out of the total percentage of attacks in 2024, the phishing percentage was high to 40% and it was estimated to be about $ 1.05 billion out of the global overall crypto scams and hacks. Modern complex scams using fake websites, social networking profiles, and deceitful agreements persist to take advantage of weak user consciousness and platform defence. Alas, with time, we have seen bad actors adapt to the changing crypto space and the strategies used by the criminals also change. It will not be easy for the victim to face the loss, but for the rest of the crypto world, it is a wake-up call to really think about safety first and spread the word. Be in the know and remember to think twice before signing any transaction since that is all you have at stake. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Presently, BTC is under correction, but an accurate indicator confirms it is near the top. Let’s discuss the findings of the indicators and when the BTC price will hit the top. Pi Cycle Indicators Predict the Bitcoin Price Top The Pi Cycle indicator is an accurate indicator that successfully forecasts the Bitcoin price at the top. It has accurately predicted the top in 2013, 2017, and 2021; the next might be 2025. Pi cycle analysis depends on the 111-day moving average (111DMA) and 350-day moving average multiples by 2, where the intersection of these two moving averages predicts the cycle tops. Now, after the ongoing BTC price struggle amid the crypto market crash , this tool hints at the top, keeping the investor’s confidence strong amid the crash. The crypto market signals that the BTC top will likely happen in the mid-to-end period of 2025. Although the timeline could vary, the historical result confirms the top formation within days of peak prediction. Cryptocurrency Peak Prediction: BTC Top To Form on September 17, 2025 The latest Pi cycle top prediction reveals that the next crossover will occur on September 17, 2025, resulting in the BTC market peak. This BTC prediction for 2025 is based on its exponential growth ever since its formation, where the Pi chart indicator has forecasted the peak with 111 DMA and 350 DMAx2 coinciding on the charts on this date. With high accuracy and historical proof, the next BTC top will form on September 17 , but the exact value of the top is unclear for now. Some suggest it could cross six figures based on historical growth patterns, global adoption, and Donald Trump’s presidency. What You Should Do? The pi cycle indicator is a famous BTC top indicator that has accurately predicted the peak multiple times. Now, recent reports show that the BTC top will form on September 17, 2025, potentially pushing this digital asset’s price to six figures for the first time in history. Although the BTC price formed massive peaks with Donald Trump’s win, the consolidation frequency increased as Trump’s inauguration approaches. The market crash has halted the Bitcoin price surge, currently trading at $95k. Arthur Hayes’s prediction hints at a market peak in March, but investors should stay cautious and conduct their own technical analysis before investing.

The altcoins have suffered even more, with massive price declines from the likes of ETH, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, HBAR, DOT, and many others. BTC Slumps Hard After a relatively quiet weekend, which BTC spent mostly at around $98,000, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive on Monday. Within just a few hours, its price skyrocketed from under $99,000 to a multi-week peak of $102,400. This was the first time the asset exceeded the $100,000 mark since the start of the year. It kept climbing during the Tuesday Asian trading session and peaked at $102,800 (on Bitstamp). However, it quickly started to lose value as the day progressed. Once the US trading hours kicked in and some controversial data came out , BTC started to freefall and dumped by five grand in about 60 minutes. It kept dropping in the following hours and plunged to $95,200 earlier this morning, leaving roughly $700 million in liquidations. Despite recovering slightly since then, bitcoin is still 6% down on the day. Its market cap has plummeted from over $2 trillion to under $1.9 trillion, and its dominance over the alts stands at 54.3%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 8.1.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Freefall State As it typically happens during such violent corrections, most altcoins have it worse. Ethereum is among the poorest performers, having dumped by 8% from over $3,600 to under $3,400. Even more painful declines come from SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, SUI, LINK, HBAR, DOT, and SHIB, as most of them have dumped by double digits. XRP and BNB have dropped by a more modest 4.5% and 3.2%, respectively, while LEO is the only larger-cap alt that is not deep in the red. The total crypto market cap went from $3.760 trillion yesterday to under $3.5 trillion today, losing roughly $300 billion in the process from top to bottom. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? The TIA price has faced resistance around $5, resulting in minor selling pressure. However, buyers are strongly defending further decline. Will TIA price reach $100?

If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment?

Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction January 2025 $4 $5.5 $7 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward.

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $17.84, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

In the last three months, it has outperformed certain top cryptos like BNB, as it has climbed by over 41.7%. In the last seven days alone, it has grown by at least 4.38%.
