According to Wedson, movement has begun in the altcoin market and this trend may accelerate further in the coming months. Wedson defined June and July as the starting point of the altcoin season, and evaluated this period as the process of “exit from the accumulation zone.” The CEO, who predicted that interest in altcoins would peak in August and September, described this period as a phase in which Memecoin, GameFi and DeFi projects would shine. Expecting the Bitcoin dominance to fall rapidly, Wedson claimed that the altcoin rally would continue.

Stating that Bitcoin is not preferred for daily transactions due to its technical limitations, the CEO used the following statements: “Today, the vast majority of crypto transactions occur over networks like Ethereum, Tron, and BSC. The Bitcoin blockchain is now used very little for direct transactions, and the rate has been declining since 2022.” *This is not investment advice.

This marks a 27.3% increase compared to the $72.6 million reported last year in the same month. Compared to previous months in 2025, the figure more than doubled from March’s total of $41.4 million. Losses Surpass 2024’s Full-Year Total According to the latest report from the blockchain security platform Immunefi, the year-to-date total stands at $1.74 billion. This is already higher than the full-year total of $1.49 billion in 2024, which was previously considered the worst hit year in crypto-related hacks. Further, the survey highlighted that the figure represents a fourfold increase from the $420 million recorded during the same period last year. Most of April’s setbacks came from just two incidents; blockchain payments platform UPCX suffered the largest single hit, losing $70.0 million, while decentralized exchange KiloEx followed with $7.5 million in losses. Other affected platforms included Loopscale ($5.8 million), ZKsync ($5.0 million), and Term Labs ($1.5 million). Additional cases were recorded across Bitcoin Mission ($1.3 million), The Roar ($790,000), Impermax ($152,200), Zora ($140,800), and ACB ($84,100). Hacks continue to be the predominant cause of losses as opposed to fraud, with 100% of the attacks being exploits. Notably, no incident recorded in April targeted centralized platforms. The affected players were exclusively from the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most targeted blockchain networks, together accounting for 60% of the total. The former recorded five incidents, representing 33.3% of the total, while the latter followed with four, or 26.7%. Base experienced three incidents (20%), while Arbitrum, Solana, Sonic, and ZKsync each recorded one. More 2025 Exploits Outside of April, the crypto industry has been heavily hit in the first quarter of 2025, with the Bybit hack standing out as the largest. In this incident, bad actors took advantage of a vulnerability in the exchange’s hot wallet infrastructure, executing multiple transactions to steal $1.46 billion. Infini was also targeted , with the attackers making away with $50 million after they manipulated vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The exploit caused major disruptions, leaving users unable to access their funds for several days. Meanwhile, DeFi lending platform zkLend fell victim to a $9.5 million flash loan attack that drained its liquidity pools. Ionic also experienced an $8.5 million loss after exploiters compromised a private key, gaining unauthorized access to wallets and transferring funds externally.

Maldives signs $9 billion deal to become international crypto hub The government of the Maldives signed a $9 billion deal with Dubai-based family office MBS Global Investments to develop a crypto hub in the island nation's capital of Malé and to attract foreign investment opportunities. Part of the development deal includes plans for an 830,000-square-meter facility used to house and host blockchain, crypto, and Web3 firms. Maldives sits between Africa, Asia, and Australia. Source: Worldometer According to the Financial Times, which first reported the story, the deal was signed in the hopes of diversifying the Maldives' economy away from tourism and low-margin exports like providing fishing stock. The project's total funding will exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Maldives, which is around $7 billion annually. Pro-crypto Democrats pull support for stablecoin bill in last minute A group of US Senate Democrats known for supporting the crypto industry have said they would oppose a Republican-led stablecoin bill if it moves forward in its current form. The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico. Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made. Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March. The bill, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty , is formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. A copy of the statement.

This surge in accumulation has caught the eye of many in the crypto community. Could this lead to a strong upward trend for these coins? Find out which cryptocurrencies might be on the brink of notable growth and what this could mean for the market. Cardano: Surge Over Six Months with Recent One-Month Correction Cardano experienced a decline of 0.71% in the past week but has grown by 7.67% in the last month and risen by 115.33% over the past six months. The price data reflects a trend of steady growth, with short-term fluctuations indicating that the coin has gained significant momentum. Despite this impressive performance, recent trends show a mild correction, creating a potential shift in market sentiment. Currently, the coin trades between $0.547 and $0.781, with resistance around $0.88 and a further level at $1.11. Support levels are identified at 0.41 dollars and a lower level near $0.18. The indicators suggest a lack of a clear trend, with bulls attempting to break above $0.88 while bears may look to test the $0.41 support for short-term opportunities. Polkadot Price Momentum Hits Key Levels Amid Market Adjustments DOT experienced a modest 1.23% decline over the past month with a sharper weekly dip near 5.87%. A 6.65% gain over the last six months signals underlying strength. Price action has ranged between $3.41 and $4.54, reflecting a mix of corrections and gradual build-up over time. Current levels place immediate support at $2.77 and resistance at $5.03, with further limits at $1.64 and $6.16. The coin shows neither a clear bullish nor bearish trend, as indicators signal a mix. Traders may find opportunities by watching these critical levels for a reversal or continuation pattern, especially with expectations for broader altcoin season enthusiasm. Conclusion Recent movements in the crypto market show increased accumulation of ADA and DOT by large holders. This often indicates strong confidence from major investors. Such behavior has historically preceded significant price rises for these coins. If past trends are any guide, ADA and DOT may be on the verge of entering a bullish phase. This could present a notable opportunity for those tracking market dynamics and looking for broader growth signals. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While giants like Cardano (ADA), Floki (FLOKI), and Toncoin (TON) have carved their niches, all eyes are on an underdog that’s performing well, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.025, MUTM is rapidly gaining traction, and experts predict a jaw-dropping 60x upside as it disrupts the DeFi market. Its decentralized lending platform is already turning heads, attracting over 9,400 investors and raising more than $7.5 million in its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token is set to climb to $0.03 in Phase 5, a 20% increase, before its projected launch at $0.06. For Phase 4 participants, that could mean a 140% return on investment. Cardano, Floki, and Toncoin: Strong Coins for Crypto Growth in 2025 Cardano (ADA), sitting at around $0.69, remains the long-term investor’s favorite as far as scalability and sustainability are concerned in blockchain technology. As a focus on smart contracts and decentralized applications, ADA has an incredibly solid groundwork that continues to make it center stage, especially with upcoming improvements. Floki (FLOKI), however, sitting at a paltry $0.000084, has been rapidly developing a passionate following, all due to its highly community-centric approach and ever-growing ecosystem. Its meme-based origins combined with novel utility projects cause it to possess vast growth potential. Lastly, Toncoin (TON) at $3.19 is also cementing itself as one of the leading decentralized networks with great speed and scalability. As all these projects toil towards milestone milestones, their growth trends in 2025 are optimistic. But of course, they all have great futures, and investors need to keep an eye out for future alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is going to cause a stir in the next couple of months. Presale Momentum Builds in Phase 4 The excitement around Mutuum Finance keeps building as its presale gains traction. Selling at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token has already attracted strong interest from more than 9,400 participants and continues to pull in capital, crossing the $7.5 million mark. With the next phase set to raise the token price by 20%, early investors are positioning themselves for significant gains. To further boost user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently rolled out a new dashboard that features a live leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those ranked in the top 50 will be eligible for bonus tokens, adding a gamified twist that not only incentivizes holding but also builds community loyalty and long-term participation. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is breaking new ground in decentralized lending by combining the benefits of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models into a single, powerful hybrid framework. In the P2C model, users can earn passive income by staking stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-managed liquidity pools, while also enabling fast, permissionless borrowing for others. On the other side, the P2P option eliminates intermediaries altogether, letting borrowers and lenders negotiate directly and privately. This dual-model setup brings a higher level of decentralization, flexibility, and efficiency. Whether you’re a cautious investor looking for predictable returns or someone seeking more control and yield, Mutuum Finance offers a tailored solution that meets both ends of the risk spectrum. It’s a DeFi platform built for inclusivity and autonomy, two pillars the current financial system often lacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set for 60x upside, currently priced at $0.025. With $7.5 million raised from 9,400+ investors, the token is set to rise to $0.03 in phase 5 and $0.06 at launch, offering 140% ROI for early investors. While ADA, FLOKI, and TON have growth potential, Mutuum’s unique hybrid lending model and gamified incentives make it a standout. Get in now before it’s too late.

However, the altcoin failed to end the month in profit, making April its fourth consecutive month with a negative performance. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum price seems to be sitting above a crucial support level, which could determine the altcoin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. ETH Price At Risk Of Falling To $1,772 In a May 3 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the price of Ethereum might be at a critical juncture that could decide its short-term future. Based on the latest on-chain data, the altcoin is at risk of falling to around $1,500 should it lose this support level in the coming days. This on-chain evaluation of the Ethereum price revolves around the average cost bases of several Ethereum investors. In crypto trading, cost-basis analysis determines a price level’s capacity to serve as support or resistance based on the volume of coins last acquired by investors in the region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally As shown in the above chart, the size of the dot (green and red) represents and directly corresponds to the number of Ether tokens bought within a price region. The larger the circle, the higher the amount of tokens bought in and around the price zone, and the stronger the resistance or support level. According to data from IntoTheBlock, more than 6.36 million ETH tokens were purchased by 4.5 million addresses within the price range of $1,772 and $1,824 (at an average price of $1,799). As explained earlier, the high buying activity within this price zone has led to the formation of a major support level just beneath the current price. The Ethereum price is expected to bounce back when it falls to this level. The rationale behind this expectation is that when the ETH price returns to around $1,772, investors with their cost bases in and around this level are likely to defend their positions by buying more tokens, helping the price to stay afloat the support region. However, the highlighted chart shows that the price levels beneath the $1,772 support level have significantly less investor activity. This suggests that the Ethereum price could fall to around $1,500 without catching a break if $1,772 is breached. On the flip side, the price of ETH could travel to as high as $2,100 if this support level remains unbreached, as no significant resistance lies ahead. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ETH token is valued at around $1,830, reflecting an almost 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

While the Pi price trend remains range-bound and the latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update shows a strong 100% rebound from April lows, a separate opportunity is quietly gaining traction. BlockDAG , through its 25% referral program, offers a practical route to crypto earnings without mining, staking, or direct buying, positioning itself as a candidate for the best long-term crypto opportunity. Even without purchasing BDAG, users can earn 25% of any referral-driven sale. There’s no need for technical setup or upfront capital. Sharing a referral link is all it takes. With over $225 million already raised and the coin currently priced at $0.0019, BlockDAG’s ecosystem, including the X1 mining app and its upcoming mainnet, offers more than just presale hype. This referral phase won’t last, and once BDAG launches on exchanges, these earnings vanish. How BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus Delivers Crypto Without Buying BlockDAG simplifies crypto earnings. No technical knowledge required, no purchases needed. Its 25% referral reward allows anyone to earn BDAG tokens by inviting others. Priced at $0.0019 and aiming for a $0.05 listing, the value of these referral bonuses could multiply significantly. With the presale entering its final phase, the offer is time-sensitive and potentially high-impact. A Telegram post outlines one user’s experience. After purchasing $1,000 in BDAG, the user shared a referral link across several groups. Within a week, referrals brought in $4,000 in purchases, earning the original user $1,000 in BDAG, over 526,000 coins, without further action. This kind of reward structure is usually reserved for early buyers or project insiders, yet BlockDAG has opened it to the public. In parallel, BlockDAG’s presale continues gaining momentum. Over $225 million has been secured and 19.6 billion coins have been sold. The $0.0019 price point presents a last-chance entry before the token’s exchange debut. With the X1 mining app active and the full mainnet scheduled for later in 2025, BlockDAG is emerging as a contender for the best long-term crypto , especially while this referral opportunity remains available. Pi Price Trend Signals Consolidation With a Potential Move Ahead The Pi price trend has remained between $0.58 and $0.66, following a sharp drop from March highs near $3.00. This flat trading range reflects indecision in the market, with no clear signals from either buyers or sellers. Support sits at $0.58 and $0.50, while resistance at $0.66 could lead to further upside if breached. With RSI currently at 53 and Bollinger Bands narrowing, a breakout could occur soon, but the direction remains uncertain. On the 4-hour timeframe, a descending triangle is forming. A drop below $0.58 may push the price down toward $0.48 or even $0.40. Conversely, early signs of bullish strength, like rising volume and a MACD crossover, are appearing. However, without major ecosystem developments or exchange activity, the Pi price trend could remain range-bound in the short term. The next few weeks will likely determine its near-term trajectory. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Update Shows Strong Recovery & Potential Upside The latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update reveals a sharp recovery, with HYPE climbing from below $10 to nearly $20. This rally followed a breakout above $13.55, ending a multi-week downtrend. The move above the Ichimoku Cloud and confirmation of a MACD bullish crossover both suggest that bullish momentum could continue. A break above the $21.07 resistance level could set up a short-term target of $23.84. Supporting metrics include Open Interest surpassing $600 million, signaling increased participation and market confidence. The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator remains in positive territory, reflecting ongoing buying strength. That said, the $14.37 support level, aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, remains a critical floor. Should that break, downside risks could increase. Still, current sentiment in the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update leans bullish, and market watchers are eyeing a clean break above $21 to confirm the next leg up. Key Insights! The Pi price trend remains stuck in consolidation, with $0.66 and $0.58 acting as critical levels. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update shows solid recovery momentum, pointing to a possible climb toward $23.84. Both assets are being watched closely, but neither offers the same accessible upside as BlockDAG’s referral campaign. With a 25% bonus structure that doesn’t require upfront spending, BlockDAG is providing one of the most effective passive crypto setups currently available. Just sharing a link can deliver sizable rewards, and with BDAG priced at $0.0019 and aiming for $0.05 on launch, those earnings could grow significantly. With over $225 million raised and a mainnet on the horizon, the current phase could close quickly. For anyone evaluating the best long-term crypto , BlockDAG’s referral bonus presents a low-risk, high-reward entry before listings begin.

The global crypto exchange recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Kyrgyzstan’s National Agency for Investments. This agreement opens the door to crypto payments, better financial education, and support for new Web3 projects in the region. Kyrgyzstan Taps Binance for Crypto Push The MoU was signed during the first meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets. Interestingly, President Sadyr Japarov attended the event. This high-profile presence shows that the government is committed to crypto and blockchain growth and innovation. As part of the signed agreement, the trading platform will help introduce its subsidiary BPay Global service in Kyrgyzstan. This payment platform enables fast and secure crypto payments, even across borders. Earlier in April, Binance BPay Global secured a payment license in Bahrain . The approval marks a big step for Binance’s push into regulated markets, allowing it to offer more fiat-related services. BPay Global’s debut in Kyrgyzstan is a big step for the country, which looks to become a major player in the digital world of Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union. In a recent statement, Farhat Iminov, Head of the National Agency for Investments, said the partnership will bring innovation and economic growth to Kyrgyzstan. Binance Regional Head Kyrylo Khomiakov added that the company is excited to work with the Kyrgyz government to unlock new opportunities through blockchain technology . Binance To Educate Kyrgyzstan on Digital Finance Binance’s educational arm, Binance Academy, will collaborate with local organizations to promote crypto literacy. The program will teach Kyrgyz citizens about digital currencies, Web3, and the risks and benefits of using crypto safely. The initiative aims to support local startups and encourage the development of new blockchain-powered businesses by improving financial education. A Growing Global Trend Kyrgyzstan’s deal with Binance is part of a growing global movement in the crypto industry. More countries are working closely with big crypto companies to build digital economies. This comes as governments are beginning to view crypto and blockchain technologies as a way to improve financial systems, support local businesses, and give people better access to digital tools. This is especially common in developing countries, where many people do not have access to traditional banking. By teaming up with crypto companies, these countries hope to bring more people into the financial system and create new job opportunities through blockchain and Web3 projects.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $850 to $880K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors a chance to position early—before the spotlight finds it.

XRP Surges & Solana Aims for $176,https://thecoinrise.com/early-entry-into-unstakeds-presale-could-deliver-27x-returns-xrp-surges-solana-aims-for-176/,"Crypto activity in May 2025 is not being driven by blind excitement, it’s backed by platforms showing real use and measurable progress. Ripple is expanding fast across Asia and the Middle East, placing XRP in a strong position to regain its role in international payments. At the same time, Solana’s growth in the DeFi and NFT space is reviving confidence after a long stretch of sideways action. Still, neither is shifting the crypto structure the way Unstaked is. With XRP entering the global remittance space and Solana regaining strength in DeFi, Unstaked is steadily building the first AI-driven crypto workforce where intelligent agents can post, respond, and scale engagement across social platforms. Its presale sits at just $0.006695, offering unmatched early access to a project built for the Web3 AI era. In a market that’s demanding real results, Unstaked isn’t chasing trends, it’s setting new ones. XRP Builds Momentum With Expanding Ecosystem and Global Reach Ripple continues gaining attention as it adds key partnerships across Asia and the Middle East, focusing on the massive cross-border transaction market. These efforts have led to a wave of strong on-chain activity for XRP, with more than 650 million tokens moved in just one day, pointing to rising network demand. XRP’s recent move beyond the $2.20 resistance has pushed it to around $2.27, where it remains strong above both the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Analysts think this movement may signal a lasting shift in trend rather than just a short-term rally. If positive momentum holds, XRP may be headed toward the $2.50 and $2.85 targets. With use cases growing and price trends supporting the move, XRP could become one of the key players in the upcoming crypto cycle. Solana Prepares for a Rally With Strong DeFi and Price Action Solana (SOL) is seeing steady growth in both its value and its ecosystem, supported by institutional backing and rising user activity. After briefly dipping to $148, the coin has remained stable following a 10% increase over the past week, boosted by the market’s optimistic mood. Its DeFi scene is expanding quickly, with platforms like Drift Protocol and MarginFi reporting all-time high engagement. Adding to this momentum, DeFi Dev Corp’s recent $9.8 million SOL acquisition shows serious capital confidence. From a technical view, Solana’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders formation could send it toward $176 if the $150 level is retaken. With solid backing from its 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, experts say Solana may soon outpace Ethereum in DeFi and NFTs. The upward trend is likely to continue as new partners and liquidity come in. Unstaked’s $0.006695 Presale Builds a Full AI Agent System Before Launch Unstaked is rising as one of the most compelling crypto projects going into 2025. The project is now in Stage 2 of its presale, with each unit priced at just $0.006695. Unlike others focused on hype, Unstaked brings practical AI use cases from the start. The platform will allow people to launch smart AI agents across social apps like X and Telegram after the project’s official launch. These are not ordinary bots, they react to real data, adapt to feedback, and actively grow social groups. Every step they take is recorded through Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, which only rewards agents who show strong results. With a planned launch value of $0.1819, current supporters are looking at around 2,700% potential gains based on real tools, not empty promises. Fair design is central to Unstaked. There are no private sales, no early deals for firms, and 60% of all supply is open to public buyers. The project also includes a $20 million liquidity pool, and agent tools will be available as soon as Unstaked goes live. Instead of waiting passively, users get to take part in a working system that ties AI with on-chain earning. In a market filled with hype, Unstaked stands out for offering something that performs and rewards based on action. Final Thoughts! XRP is showing strength with its global partnerships, and Solana’s ecosystem push is making real progress, but the greatest upside appears to be with Unstaked. While others refine old models, Unstaked is setting up a decentralized system where AI actions are rewarded, creating new ways for users to earn actively. With its presale still at $0.006695 and a future listing price near $0.1819, the chance to gain 2,700% puts Unstaked far ahead of many competing projects. As the crypto space moves into a phase where working products matter more than talk, Unstaked could take the lead as one of the top-performing crypto projects of 2025.

It’s gaining technical strength, crossing key moving averages and supported by a record 130,000+ smart contracts deployed across its ecosystem. Sei (SEI) , priced at $0.208 , is enjoying a 4.52% daily uptick, with 127% growth in trading volume. Its steady $415 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) signals consistent ecosystem participation and investor confidence. Optimism (OP) is navigating a scheduled token unlock of 31.34 million OP , valued above $24 million . Despite the short-term implications, the network’s core metrics show rising activity and recovery trends, positioning it well for future growth. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, Cardano, Sei, and Optimism showing solid performance, and MAGACOINFINANCE rapidly gaining attention, the market is offering diverse pathways for upside.

The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is setting sights on $2,100, if ETH can keep its footing above $1,800. At the same time, Ripple news about a major 1 billion XRP token unlock, valued at $2.2 billion, is creating concerns. Even though much of it may be relocked, the immediate impact has already pushed XRP lower. While these major names navigate their next moves, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention through a different channel. Its just-launched podcast series is giving the public a peek into its strategy, building serious trust, and powering a presale that has already crossed $225 million. It’s no wonder it’s being counted among the top-rated crypto currencies right now. Ethereum (ETH) Price Forecast Hints at Bullish Continuation The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast comes with growing confidence. ETH is holding above $1,800 after shaking off a tough Q1. Now, a bullish flag is forming, and analysts are eyeing a breakout toward $2,100 if ETH can clear the $1,850 level. Institutional interest is picking up too, with $183 million flowing into ETH-based ETFs just last week. If Ethereum maintains this momentum and crosses the $2,000 mark, the next resistance zones could be within striking distance soon. Ripple News: Token Unlock Sparks Uncertainty Fresh Ripple news is making waves as traders brace for a massive token unlock. On May 1, Ripple is set to release 1 billion XRP, worth over $2.2 billion. This move has already sparked a 2.78% drop in XRP’s price, bringing it to $2.23. Even though Ripple typically relocks most of the unlocked tokens, the short-term selling pressure is already showing. The focus is now on Ripple (26) and Ripple (27), two mostly dormant wallets scheduled to release large amounts of XRP. Even if the impact is short-lived, the event is raising market sensitivity. On top of that, the SEC’s delayed decision on a Ripple ETF is also adding to the uncertainty. BlockDAG’s New Podcast Series Gives Buyers a Backstage Pass BlockDAG (BDAG) is cranking up the volume with its newly launched official podcast series, adding a fresh layer of transparency and connection for its fast-growing community. Each episode pulls back the curtain, diving deep into the project’s roadmap, upcoming exchange listings, and its ambitious plans for long-term expansion. This podcast drop joins a powerful lineup of updates that continue to keep BlockDAG in the spotlight, from live AMAs and major keynote drops to a presale model built on credibility. Now in Batch 28, BDAG is up for grabs at a limited-time rate of just $0.0019 until May 13, a steep markdown from the usual $0.0262 batch price. With launch projections set at $0.05, this offer stands out as one of the best entry prices seen this year. The numbers speak for themselves: over $225 million raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and early holders enjoying a 2,520% gain, all before listings even go live. But this podcast isn’t just another update. It’s a key part of BlockDAG’s long-term strategy, offering a level of openness rarely seen in crypto. That’s exactly why BlockDAG is being counted among the top rated crypto currencies to watch in 2025. Final Thoughts The Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is sticking to the $2,100 mark, driven by strong ETF inflows and a bullish technical pattern. Holding above $1,800 remains key. Meanwhile, Ripple news is shaking things up. The 1 billion XRP unlock may be short-lived in impact, but it’s already unsettling the market. BlockDAG, though, is on its own track. Instead of waiting on market events, it’s building trust and talking directly to its users. That’s something even the biggest names haven’t nailed yet. With the presale still open at $0.0019 until May 13 and over $225 million raised already, the window to get in early is closing fast. For those looking beyond just charts and hype, BlockDAG is proving it has what it takes to be one of the top-rated crypto currencies for the years ahead.

Recent market trends suggest these digital currencies could be set for a significant rise. Investors might find intriguing opportunities as the bullish momentum gathers pace. This article delves into the factors driving this potential growth and what might be on the horizon for these promising assets. Sui Price Rally Amid Mixed Signals Past month data shows a 40.90% surge and a 72.47% rise over six months, while a weekly decline of 9.34% hints at short-term pullbacks. A notable upward trend has been building, reflecting strong market interest and consistent gains over the observed periods. SUI current prices range from $2.19 to $4.34 with immediate resistance at $5.18 and additional resistance at $7.34, while support is near $0.87. Indicators show a subtle mix, with the Awesome Oscillator at $0.81 and RSI at 58.88, while momentum slightly dips to -0.15. Bulls have influence as prices edge higher, but caution is warranted within these key levels for potential trading opportunities. Upgrading XRP for a Bullish Move XRP price action over the past month shows a modest gain of around 7.06%, building on a remarkable 338.86% surge over the last six months. Performance reflects steady investor interest and price recovery after past dips, with activity increasing as the coin consolidates gains. Recent movements indicate that XRP’s historical volatility has calmed, leading to tighter trading ranges and renewed market trust. Currently, XRP trades within a range of $1.75 to $2.50, with key resistance at $2.80 and a secondary barrier at $3.55 while finding primary support near $1.31 and lower support at $0.56. Bulls are edging in control within these levels, though no clear trend has fully emerged. Traders might explore entries at support zones and consider exits or buys near resistance if upward pressure holds. Conclusion The outlook for SUI and XRP appears promising. Both coins show potential for growth in the near term. SUI has been gaining attention due to recent developments. XRP is benefiting from positive market trends and increased adoption. Investors might consider these factors when evaluating their portfolios. The potential for upward movement makes these assets worth watching.

Projects that show real-world use, not just flashy whitepapers, are starting to separate themselves from the noise. And with digital tools becoming vital for creators, professionals, and businesses across Latin America and beyond, more community members are paying close attention to platforms that solve problems, not just promise moonshots. One name standing out is Qubetics . Even while still in presale, it’s generating buzz for its practical applications and layered tech architecture. At the same time, well-established contenders like Theta and Story(IP) are holding their ground as reliable alternatives to traditional investment tools—particularly in the content, streaming, and IP ownership sectors. Let’s break down why each is worth watching, and why these three are among the Top Cryptos to Join Now. Qubetics (TICS): Built for Cross-Border Simplicity, It’s One of the Top Cryptos to Join Now Forget the hassle of international wire transfers, foreign transaction fees, or days of delay just to move money between countries. Qubetics is changing that game with its seamless Cross-Border Transactions feature—built right into its blockchain architecture. Imagine a small digital agency in Medellín working with clients in Texas or Madrid. Instead of waiting days for traditional bank transfers or paying up to 10% in fees, they can receive funds instantly and securely using Qubetics’ multi-chain infrastructure. For freelancers, digital nomads, e-commerce vendors, and remote teams across Latin America, this isn’t just helpful—it’s revolutionary. The feature works by leveraging decentralized liquidity pools and smart routing to enable low-fee, real-time transactions across borders. No central authority. No risk of being blocked or delayed. Just peer-to-peer value movement—on-chain and on-demand. That utility alone puts Qubetics in a different bracket compared to most early-stage blockchain projects. That’s exactly why it’s being called one of the Top Cryptos to Join Now—because it’s already delivering something users want and need, not just building for potential down the road. Presale Performance and ROI Projections Let’s talk numbers. The crypto presale is in stage 32. More than 510 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 25,600 token holders, raising $16.6 million and counting. The current presale price sits at $0.2093 per token. Those who joined at stage 1? They got in at $0.01 and are already looking at a 1993% return. But here’s the kicker—there’s still room to run. Right now, buyers entering at $0.2093 could see: $TICS at $1 = 377% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2,288% ROI $TICS at $6 = 2,766% ROI $TICS at $10 = $,677% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet = 7,066% ROI This isn’t just a speculative jump. It’s backed by tech, traction, and timing. Qubetics is delivering a working product to a market that’s been underserved for too long. That’s what makes it one of the most credible early-stage projects on the radar right now. Theta: Reinventing Video Streaming with Decentralized Infrastructure When it comes to decentralized streaming, Theta Network is the name that keeps coming up—and for good reason. This project is laser-focused on changing the way video content is delivered, shifting the model away from costly, centralized servers and toward a peer-powered mesh of users who share bandwidth and storage in exchange for rewards. That’s not just some nerdy backend feature—it has real implications for creators and platforms. Think of an indie streamer in Buenos Aires or a small film studio in Mexico City. Instead of relying on YouTube’s algorithm or Twitch’s monetization policies, they can build directly on Theta’s infrastructure and reach their audience on their own terms. The protocol allows users to earn tokens by relaying video content to others, which reduces the load on content delivery networks (CDNs) and dramatically cuts costs. Big names have already bought into the ecosystem—Samsung, Sony, Google, and Lionsgate have explored or partnered with Theta in various capacities, showing it has institutional respect to go along with grassroots energy. Theta’s TFUEL and THETA tokens power this network, enabling everything from payments to governance. And the community continues to grow, with developers building decentralized video platforms, NFT tools for creators, and live events infrastructure—all fueled by Theta’s protocol. Theta is doing more than talking about decentralization—it’s actively reshaping how creators interact with their audiences. It’s one of the few projects that has consistently shipped, delivered, and partnered with major players. Story(IP): Where Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property For anyone who’s ever created a song, written a story, or filmed a short documentary, ownership is everything. That’s where Story(IP) comes in. This project is building a decentralized platform for managing, validating, and monetizing intellectual property in the digital age. Story(IP) turns content into verified on-chain assets. Whether it’s a script for a telenovela, a comic series, or an indie track from a DJ in Mexico City, creators can mint their work on Story(IP), timestamp it, and prove ownership without depending on centralised systems or expensive third-party registrars. This is especially relevant in regions where copyright enforcement can be slow, costly, or unreliable. For creators in Latin America, Story(IP) becomes a digital notary—a trustless proof of originality and origin. The platform also integrates token-based monetization options, allowing creators to fractionalize their content, license it to studios, or even crowdfund their next project—all on-chain. Its community-first model appeals to both indie creators and established producers, bridging a gap between creative freedom and blockchain verification. And as global interest in digital identity and intellectual property grows, Story(IP) is positioning itself as the go-to chain for protecting what people make. Intellectual property is a trillion-dollar industry—and Story(IP) is giving it a decentralized home. Its relevance is growing every week, and its tools are empowering creators globally to take back control of their work. Final Thoughts Theta and Story(IP) are both tackling billion-dollar industries—streaming and IP ownership—with tech that empowers users and decentralizes legacy systems. They’ve earned their places as top-tier alternatives to traditional digital infrastructure. But Qubetics? That’s where the doors are still open for early entry.

Bitcoin and XRP are already legends in their own right. Solana continues expanding across Web3. And Ethereum (ETH) remains central to everything from smart contracts to institutional adoption. But now, one name is quietly joining that elite conversation: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Momentum is rising, and the real question now is whether one of these five tokens could deliver that rare multi-million-dollar return for those positioned early enough. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Catching Fire—and the Early Signs Are Hard to Ignore It’s easy to miss the early signals—until it’s too late. But right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing every indicator of a breakout in motion. Wallet counts are ticking upward fast. Community growth is unfolding naturally, without gimmicks. And on-chain trackers are beginning to highlight MAGACOINFINANCE as one of the few early-stage plays with meaningful activity and traction. This isn’t temporary attention. It’s foundational progress—and those entering now may be catching the inflection point before the next phase begins. Rising Players to Watch: Kaspa, Polkadot, and Their Growing Ecosystems Kaspa is gaining ground with a high-speed, proof-of-work blockDAG model that’s built for real-time payments and scalable infrastructure.

Both names have real utility—but when it comes to asymmetric upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for its early strength and rising investor activity. Final Word Could $2.1 million truly be within reach? History suggests that those who moved early on Bitcoin , Solana , Ethereum , and XRP made that a reality.

Per the South Korean media outlet Digital Daily , officials think 16.3 million South Koreans have previously or currently own cryptoassets. Their data is based on the number of crypto wallets and linked bank accounts held on the nation’s five fiat-trading crypto exchanges at the end of February this year. South Korean Presidential Elections: Crypto a Key Battleground The media outlet noted that the South Korean political world is now “putting considerable effort” into making pledges about ways to boost crypto market growth. South Korean Presidential Candidate Kim Moon-soo (center) with senior People Power Party officials at an event on May 3. (Source: News1 TV/YouTube) In late April, Kim caused a storm in the crypto community. The candidate said he would “allow government agencies such as the National Pension Service (NPS) and the Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) to invest in virtual assets.” The NPS is the world’s third-largest pension fund. The KIC is the nation’s sovereign wealth fund. The media outlet noted that, should the NPS and the KIC start directly investing in BTC and other cryptoassets, the move would “further enhance the crypto market’s reputation.” On April 27, Kim said: “Considering the changes in the domestic and international economic environment, we can no longer deny the existence of virtual assets.” The former labor minister said that he would “foster” the “important” domestic crypto industry if he wins power on June 3. Democratic Party (DP) presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung appealed for support during a visit to Yeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Sunday, asking, “What did I do so wrong?” https://t.co/YF27ZsVGkG — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) May 4, 2025 Kim told attendees at the People Power Party convention in KINTEX in Goyang on May 3: “Many young people make money with virtual assets. But some young people lose money on their purchases. I will try to make the market more stable by institutionalizing it.” Rival Party Also ‘Crypto-keen’ The PPP and its biggest rival, the Democratic Party, have also talked up the possible approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs. Late last month, the PPP unveiled seven crypto-related policies ahead of June 3’s poll . The party says it will move to scrap restrictive banking rules for crypto exchanges. It has also promised to speed up the process of allowing corporations to buy BTC and other coins with their balance sheets. Kim Moon-soo, a former labor minister and a candidate for the presidential nomination of the People Power Party, promised to extend the Great Train eXpress (GTX) railway network to five metropolitan areas within his term as president, if elected. https://t.co/ZBWpUwkMqK — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) April 21, 2025 The DP has also unveiled its own set of crypto policies. Some senior party officials claim they want to establish a national strategic crypto reserve . Both parties have claimed that they will institutionalize crypto and security tokens if they are elected. DP candidate Lee Jae-myung has said relatively little on crypto-related matters in the run-up to the June poll. The Democratic Party Presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung. (Source: Lee Jae-myung/YouTube/Screenshot) But other DP officials, including many close to Lee, have spoken publicly about plans to launch a new crypto regulator. Some also want to let domestic firms issue stablecoins. Mixed Opinions on Manifesto Promises South Korean crypto insiders have reacted to the pledges with a mixture of caution and optimism. The same media outlet wrote that the industry was “greatly encouraged” by the parties’ “unanimous” support for market-friendly polices. South Korea's conservatives pick hardline Kim Moon-soo as presidential candidate https://t.co/AhdzBkNbbu https://t.co/AhdzBkNbbu — Reuters (@Reuters) May 3, 2025 However, some will recall that candidates made similar pledges in the lead-up to the 2022 and 2024 elections. Following the polls, however, only a small fraction of these manifesto promises were later turned into laws. An unnamed official from a major domestic crypto exchange was quoted as saying: “Institutionalization plans have been a major disappointment for the industry so far. So in that respect, the candidates’ pledges are a very positive sign. However, we will have to wait and see if these pledges are actually put into action after the election.” The post South Korean Presidential Hopeful Wants to Let State Pension Fund Buy BTC appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Politics|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-04 23:30:00

This move comes as President Donald Trump’s administration’s regulatory policies become less stringent and clearer. Deribit has built its reputation as a leading platform for crypto options. Last year, the company processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume. However, the exchange is now looking beyond its Dubai base to explore new opportunities in the United States. Why Deribit Is Looking to Enter the US Market Deribit’s CEO, Luuk Strijers, revealed why the exchange is considering entering the US market. Strijers believes that the US is becoming more supportive of the crypto industry, as there are recent changes in the country’s crypto regulations. These relaxed crypto rules come after crypto firms in the country have faced challenges over the past few years. Under Joe Biden’s administration, regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) cracked down on industry. However, with President Trump’s administration, the regulatory environment is changing. The president has promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Since his electoral victory in November 2024, the SEC has paused or dropped several enforcement actions against crypto companies. Additionally, the DOJ recently dissolved its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a more relaxed approach. Deribit’s Potential Deal with Coinbase The news of Deribit’s US expansion comes alongside reports that Coinbase, a leading US-based crypto exchange, is in talks to acquire Deribit. According to a recent report, both companies have notified Dubai’s regulators about the deal. Coinbase would need to transfer Deribit’s operating license to the US if the deal goes through. This move could strengthen Coinbase’s position in the global crypto market. This potential deal shows the growing interest in the crypto derivatives market, which is becoming more competitive. Kraken, a leading asset manager, is also making moves in this space. The company recently acquired NinjaTrader in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Growing Confidence in the US Market Deribit’s potential move into the US reflects the broader trend, as the regulatory shift is positively impacting the industry. Companies that once left the US due to regulatory uncertainty are rethinking their strategies. OKX, a major crypto exchange, has announced plans to set up a U.S. headquarters in California, just months after settling a significant legal case with the US authorities. Meanwhile, Nexo, which exited the US in 2022 , has announced its return to the market in response to the more favorable conditions. Other notable players, such as DWF Lab and Wintermute, are also eyeing US expansion , further demonstrating the growing confidence in the US market.

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,400 followers on the social media platform X that the native assets of Curve DAO ( CRV ) and Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) are among the few “solid” altcoins in crypto. Curve Finance is a stablecoin-focused ecosystem, specializing in the efficient and low-slippage trading of dollar-pegged crypto assets. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid is a layer-1 protocol serving a decentralized exchange (DEX). Says Altcoin Sherpa, “But if you’re an investor that relies on these types of fundamentals, there are a few good ones like CRV and HYPE, those charts look pretty solid overall .” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $20.55 Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, CRV is worth $0.697. Turning to the memecoin Bonk ( BONK ), the trader says he plans to accumulate the altcoin at current levels. “Staying patient for BONK and would love to buy in the green box if it gives.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.0000164. As for Bitcoin, the trader says BTC looks bullish on the high time frame after the crypto king retested the $74,000 level as support. “Higher time frame view of BTC: higher low formed in that chop period, it was similar to that May 2021 area where price formed a low. I think it’s a great low given the amount of time (two months) and volatility that we saw. While there are going to be some small pullbacks, I think we strongly break $100,000 in the next several weeks as long as equities don’t completely sh** the bed (sadly, I see a lot of lower high / it’s over type of posts).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,921.

But while ADA inches toward a bullish run, Ruvi, a revolutionary AI-driven blockchain project, is emerging as the next big opportunity for savvy investors. Forget what you think you know about cryptocurrency; Ruvi isn’t just riding the wave of innovation. It’s creating a new wave altogether. With a limited supply, AI integration, and an exclusive VIP presale structure, Ruvi offers early adopters the potential for extraordinary returns. Why Ruvi Is Poised to Lead the Next Crypto Boom While Cardano focuses on expanding its DeFi reach and making incremental upgrades, Ruvi introduces solutions that are truly groundbreaking. Here’s what sets Ruvi apart: Fixed Supply, Rising Value Unlike inflationary tokens, Ruvi caps its total supply at 1.5 billion tokens , ensuring scarcity will drive long-term value as demand grows. AI Meets Real-World Blockchain Applications Ruvi isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that uses artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems in logistics, predictive analytics, and even clean energy. While Cardano adds wallet features, Ruvi aims to redefine global industries. Early Investor Incentives You Won’t Find Elsewhere Ruvi’s presale includes jaw-dropping bonuses of up to 100% , giving early backers an unmatched edge before the token even hits major exchanges. The Ruvi Presale Advantage By joining Ruvi’s presale, you’ll gain access to tokens priced at a mere $0.01 apiece and receive significant bonuses based on your investment level. Here’s how quickly your investment can skyrocket: A Modest $500 Stake Investing $500 gives you 50,000 Ruvi tokens , priced at $0.01 each. Add the 40% bonus , and you walk away with 70,000 tokens . When Ruvi hits $1.25 , your holdings surge to $87,500 , marking a 17,500% ROI . A Strategic $7,000 Investment For $7,000, you’ll purchase 700,000 tokens . Ruvi’s 100% bonus boosts your total to 1,400,000 tokens . If Ruvi climbs to $2.00 , your initial commitment transforms into $2,800,000 . That’s a life-changing 40,000% return ! Go Big with $15,000 A high-stakes bet of $15,000 secures you 1.5 million tokens and, with the 100% VIP bonus , doubles your holdings to 3 million tokens . When Ruvi reaches $3.00 , your portfolio skyrockets to $9 million , securing your financial freedom. Why the Timing Is Critical Recent Cardano news highlights how early adopters can ride the wave of innovative blockchain projects. Cardano’s market activity and speculative $1 targets remind us of crypto’s wealth-building potential. However, Ruvi offers a fresh entry point with unparalleled upside. Cardano believers once paid cents for tokens that are now worth many multiples of their original investment. With Ruvi available at just $0.01 per token during presale, the potential to multiply your wealth is staggering. Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late The crypto space rewards those who act decisively. Waiting too long to get in on Ruvi could mean missing the kind of returns that early Cardano investors rave about today.

The most recent Cardano (ADA) price analysis shows $379 million in accumulation, yet the token is still struggling to hold above $1, while transaction fees have dropped 52%. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price outlook appears more optimistic, with the asset hovering near $15.30 as bullish chart signals build, but a breakout remains elusive. Waiting for momentum can mean missed chances. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. One wallet just earned 25.29 million extra BDAG coins through its Buyer Battle event, a windfall potentially worth $1.26 million at launch. With its presale already passing $225.5 million, a clearer picture is forming of where real opportunity might be found. Accumulation Grows for ADA, But Price Still Stalls The latest Cardano (ADA) price analysis indicates strong accumulation, with more than $379 million added over the past seven weeks. ADA recently cleared the $0.60 resistance, but the move hasn’t been sustained. Volume remains light and on-chain activity has slowed, making the upward momentum uncertain. Although past performance hints at upside potential, current conditions are not confirming a trend. Fees on the network have dropped 52% since earlier in the year, reflecting reduced usage. Without stronger fundamentals and increased demand, ADA may continue to struggle to reclaim $1 in the near term. LINK Price Setup Builds as Bulls Eye Key Resistance The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook has improved after a recovery of over 50% from April lows. LINK is now testing the $15.30 mark, where resistance has previously held. Indicators like the SuperTrend and a short-term inverse head-and-shoulders pattern support the possibility of a breakout. On-chain data also shows falling exchange reserves and rising wallet activity, both typically bullish signs. However, to confirm further upside, LINK must convincingly break through the $15.30 level. If that occurs, prices could rise toward $17, and in stronger market conditions, even approach $30. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Offer High Rewards for Daily Top Spenders One wallet recently received 25.29 million BDAG coins during a BlockDAG Buyer Battle, without paying anything beyond their own purchase. The event rewards the top buyer each day if the 24-hour sales goal of 50 million BDAG is not met. On this specific day, only 24.71 million BDAG were sold, leaving 25.29 million unsold. According to the rules, those extra coins went to the day’s highest buyer, wallet 0xbcdc…cfb. The value of this reward becomes more apparent when considered with BlockDAG’s pricing. The current special offer is $0.0019 per coin, even though Batch 28 is listed at $0.0262. The listing price is confirmed at $0.05. That means the 25.29 million bonus BDAG is worth around $1.26 million at launch. This happened as part of a presale that has already raised $225.5 million and sold 19.6 billion BDAG coins. Buyer Battles occur daily. If the 25 million target is not reached, the remaining coins go to that day’s biggest purchaser. The system refreshes every 24 hours, and someone new wins each time. Which Project Holds the Strongest Position for 2025? Based on the current Cardano (ADA) price analysis, strong accumulation hasn’t yet turned into a solid price move, with ADA unable to confidently hold above $0.60. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook is more promising after a 50% rebound, but it still depends on breaching the resistance near $15.30 to continue higher. Both remain contenders for the top crypto for 2025 , but require favorable technical follow-through to realize potential. BlockDAG, in contrast, is already delivering tangible value. Through its Buyer Battle program, a user gained 25.29 million BDAG coins for free. With the $0.0019 special price active until May 13 and a future listing at $0.05, the return potential is substantial. Combined with daily chances to earn additional BDAG without spending more, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious player for those seeking high ROI in 2025.

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

Canada and the EU are strengthening their economic cooperation and free trade through the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Carney stated, “When Canada and the European Union build together, our futures are stronger.” Canada and the EU investigate ways to strengthen their relationship for mutual benefits The cornerstone of the trade relationship between Canada and the EU is the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement which has been applied provisionally since September 2017. CETA has scrapped 98% of tariffs from Canada to the EU and vice versa, greatly facilitating trade. The trade agreement uses a phased strategy described in a tariff dismantling schedule to achieve this elimination. The tariff lines were removed initially, and the remaining ones, which include some grains, seafood products, and passenger cars, are being phased out gradually. This procedure seeks to lower business expenses while boosting Canadian exporters’ and producers’ competitiveness in the EU market. Still, the agreement has yet to be fully ratified in some EU countries, including Belgium and Bulgaria. Mary Ng, Canada’s Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, said on February 8 that Canada was looking to deepen economic ties with the EU while respecting world trade rules in the midst of US threats to impose tariffs . Additionally, since 2017, the EU and Canada have enjoyed the benefits of a free trade agreement that increased bilateral trade by 65% and established a partnership for raw materials in 2021. The recent election of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has added momentum to this transatlantic collaboration . Carney, a former central banker with leadership experience in both Canada and the UK, has pledged to reduce Canada’s economic dependence on the US, which currently accounts for over 75% of Canadian exports. In his victory speech, Carney emphasized the need to pursue closer ties with Europe and Asia, including potential security and trade alliances with the EU. Ng noted that trade agreements are one thing, and they had seen really great numbers, but emphasized the need to explore what more can be done to help Canadian businesses enter any of the 27 EU member states and reciprocate by supporting similar efforts within Canada. She also said the EU would focus on small businesses and strategic minerals. Moreover, to reduce its reliance on China, the EU, particularly, was keen to forge alliances to ensure that Europeans had access to the metals, including cobalt, lithium, and nickel, needed for the energy transition. Further evidence of Canada’s aggressive pursuit of trade agreements in the Indo-Pacific region can be found in the agreements it signed with Ecuador in February and Indonesia in December. The minister also made trips to Australia, Singapore, and Brunei. Ng mentioned, “We are at the table with Southeast Asian countries, so the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. I took a very large delegation of Canadian businesses to the Philippines in December, to Indonesia, to markets like Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, and Korea.” CETA promotes prosperity and economic growth in EU-Canada trade Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said in an X post that she had a conversation with Mark Carney and congratulated him on his election. The occasion, she argued, was a perfect opportunity to highlight the close ties between Canada and the EU and the opportunities that lie ahead. In addition, along with discussing ways to build on the achievements of CETA, she revealed that they had agreed to investigate deeper defense and economic security cooperation. CETA seeks to ensure growth and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, increase trade and investment, and generate jobs. It also contains resolute pledges to protect the environment, uphold labor rights, and promote sustainable development. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find.

Smart Money Is Heading To This Token With 65x Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-solana-sol-and-ethereum-eth-still-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-now-smart-money-is-heading-to-this-token-with-65x-potential/,"Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been the darlings of the crypto market, delivering impressive returns and revolutionizing blockchain technology. But as the market matures, smart money is starting to pivot towards a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM is catching the eye of savvy investors who are forecasting a staggering 65x potential in 2025. Currently in Phase 4, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.5 million from more than 9,400 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over half of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. As Ethereum and Solana fight to reclaim their highs, it might be time to shift focus and look at the rising star that promises to disrupt the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major innovator in the decentralized finance world, with a dual-lending model that’s turning heads across the crypto community. By combining both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks in a uniquely integrated system, the project is bringing something genuinely new to the table. With more than 9,300 investors already on board and over $7.5 million raised during the presale, there’s clearly a strong level of trust in the project’s vision. Tokens are still available at $0.025 during Phase 4, but that price is about to jump to $0.03 in the next phase, a 20% increase that reflects growing demand and limited time to get in early. To keep its momentum going and foster long-term loyalty, Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic new dashboard that features a real-time leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those at the top of the board are rewarded with bonus MUTM tokens, creating a fun, competitive edge that helps fuel continued investment and deeper community involvement. This gamified element adds another layer to what’s already proving to be a highly engaging ecosystem. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely, giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly, ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The $100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech—it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. Solana and Ethereum remain strong, but smart money is moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi gem with real utility and 65x potential. With $7.5M raised from 9,400+ investors, MUTM is still just $0.025, but set to rise 20% in Phase 5. Over 50% of Phase 4 is sold, and time is running out. Join now before prices climb and the opportunity slips away.

At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction leans positive, with DOGE pushing against a downward trendline near $0.175. While SHIB and DOGE try to overcome resistance, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already rewarding buyers. Through its daily Buyer Battles, the platform recently awarded 25.29 million BDAG to a single wallet after the day’s sales fell short of the target. With $225.5 million raised, 19.6 billion tokens sold, and a current price of $0.0019 valid through May 13, BlockDAG’s upward move looks increasingly likely. Those who accumulate now could gain significantly, especially if they top the leaderboard and win the next Buyer Battle. SHIB Breaks Out of April Range With New Bullish Momentum After moving between $0.000010 and $0.000014 for most of April, Shiba Inu is now showing signs of renewed interest. A breakout past the $0.000011 neckline has triggered a Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal, supported by increased money flow and a MACD crossover. The 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age has also declined, suggesting that previously inactive coins are now on the move. This shift often comes before upward price trends. However, for the bullish signal to remain intact, SHIB must hold above $0.000015. If successful, the next likely target is $0.000019. DOGE Eyes a Breakout if $0.18 Resistance Gives Way Dogecoin is trading close to $0.175, pressing against a key downward resistance trendline that has limited its progress since February. Based on the current Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction, the coming trading sessions will be critical. If DOGE closes above $0.19, the price structure may shift, allowing targets of $0.21 and $0.24 to come into view, assuming volume increases. However, there is still risk below. A move under $0.167 could push the price toward $0.13, which would undermine the current bullish outlook. Understanding BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles & Why Whales Are Watching Every day, BlockDAG sets a token sale goal. When that target is missed, something unique happens, the unsold tokens go to the top buyer of the day. In one recent round, BlockDAG aimed to sell 50 million BDAG but only moved 24.71 million. The remaining 25.29 million were awarded to the buyer who made the largest single purchase that day. This is the core mechanic of the Buyer Battles. Every 24 hours is another chance to gain much more than what was paid, simply by acting decisively while others hold back. Currently, BlockDAG is in Batch 28, which has a listed price of $0.0262 per coin. But until May 13, the special rate of $0.0019 remains available. The project has raised more than $225.5 million and distributed over 19.6 billion coins, reflecting solid early-stage demand. Participants from Batch 1 have already seen gains as high as 2,520% ROI. And with long-term price projections reaching $1 by 2025, early buyers may be in for significantly higher returns. The daily nature of Buyer Battles makes each day an opportunity to maximize profits. Even without winning the bonus pool, BlockDAG’s ROI and forecasts suggest the project holds serious value. Which Projects Are Worth Watching? Most signals suggest a potential breakout: the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal points toward $0.000019, and the Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction indicates higher levels if resistance near $0.18 breaks. These forecasts are valid, but there are no guarantees. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers measurable results. Its Buyer Battles reward fast movers daily. One wallet recently claimed 25.29 million BDAG in a single win, a direct result of action rather than speculation. Add to that a $0.0019 entry price, only available until May 13, and a projected listing at $1 in 2025, and the case for BlockDAG becomes clear. Among the top crypto coins to watch, this is one with both momentum and reward built in.

Ethereum continues to follow seasonal cycles, with predictable ups and downs that traders can analyze and act upon. Yet beneath the surface, a larger issue is becoming clear. Most of Web3 still overlooks privacy, and that is where Cold Wallet is quietly reshaping the narrative. Ethereum’s historical Easter patterns have sparked curiosity among analysts, especially as the asset dipped to $1,575 in 2025. While these seasonal shifts may guide short-term moves, they do little to address crypto’s growing need for secure, private transactions. Cold Wallet ($CWT), now available in Stage 2 presale at $0.00714 with a projected launch price of $0.35171, offers more than speculative upside. Built from the ground up to protect users, Cold Wallet is fast becoming the preferred choice for those seeking a combination of privacy, regulatory readiness, and genuine long-term utility. Ethereum’s Seasonal Patterns Offer Clues, But Not Solutions Ethereum (ETH) has a long history of shifting prices around Easter, providing useful and repeatable data points for traders. From $2,093 in 2021 to $3,648 in 2024, these Easter periods have marked significant gains as well as sharp losses. In 2025, however, ETH reversed course and dropped to $1,575, once again reminding market watchers that no trend or pattern lasts forever. While these patterns can be insightful, they reflect more about market psychology and timing than true fundamentals. Reduced trading volumes during holidays, speculative positioning, and shifting sentiment are often the real forces behind such movements. The rebound in 2024, for example, likely resulted from bullish sentiment rather than meaningful upgrades to the Ethereum network. Likewise, the 2025 decline suggests broader market uncertainty and growing hesitation among investors. Although spotting these seasonal behaviors can offer an edge to swing traders, they offer little comfort to those focused on projects with deeper staying power. In volatile markets, relying only on patterns is risky and can lead to missed opportunities elsewhere. Ethereum remains vital to the crypto ecosystem in many ways, but price cycles alone should not define a project’s long-term future. Cold Wallet ($CWT) Builds the Private Foundation Web3 Forgot Web3 has made impressive strides, yet privacy remains one of its weakest and most overlooked layers. While decentralized finance, tokenized assets, and dApps continue to evolve, the tools designed to shield users often lag behind. Wallets, which act as the gateways to this digital economy, tend to prioritize convenience and integrations while neglecting the essential need for privacy and control. Cold Wallet is stepping forward to address this gap head-on. Unlike standard hot wallets that quietly track IP addresses, monitor user behavior, and expose transaction histories, Cold Wallet integrates privacy at its core. Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to verify balances, execute stealth transactions, and authenticate without revealing sensitive or traceable data. Privacy is not an add-on here, it is a guiding design principle. At the heart of this privacy-first vision is the $CWT token. It unlocks advanced wallet features and empowers holders to participate in governance decisions. Cold Wallet’s roadmap is also clear and forward-looking. The project targets a Q3 2025 MVP launch, followed by multichain support and major exchange listings by year-end. This ensures $CWT will remain central to a growing privacy ecosystem. Currently in Stage 2 presale at $0.00714 and with a confirmed launch price of $0.35171, Cold Wallet offers early supporters the chance to access a projected 4,900% upside. Beyond potential returns, the project’s dedication to compliance, with full GDPR alignment and KYC/AML infrastructure, makes it appealing to serious long-term participants. Cold Wallet is not chasing headlines or market buzz. Instead, it is carefully building what Web3 has been missing: a secure, private infrastructure that is designed to protect users and thrive as the crypto space matures. Closing Summary Seasonal price trends and meme-driven rallies may generate headlines, but they rarely translate into lasting impact. Cold Wallet offers something fundamentally different. Its approach prioritizes security and privacy, serving users who want full control over their crypto presence without sacrificing usability. Ethereum’s Easter cycles offer short-term opportunities, and projects like it will continue to attract attention during market shifts. However, Cold Wallet focuses on what remains vital no matter the season, protecting user data and enabling safe, compliant crypto access. Priced at $0.00714 during presale and designed for both retail and institutional users, Cold Wallet stands out not because of hype, but because of vision. For those looking beyond price charts to real-world utility, $CWT may be the answer to what truly defines the best crypto right now.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact. Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met. Peterson believes a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index below 18 could trigger a “risk-on environment” favoring Bitcoin. The other crucial points needed for the Bitcoin rally are a fall in interest rates and a solid performance in the above-average performing months of June and July. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 The cryptocurrency markets may remain volatile in the near term as traders await the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision next week . Although the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool projects a low probability of a rate cut on May 7, markets may make a decisive move after the event. Could Bitcoin hold the retest of the $95,000 level? If it does, let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin broke above the $95,000 resistance on May 1, but the bulls failed to sustain the momentum. The price turned down from $97,895 on May 2 and has reached the breakout level of $95,000. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($92,106) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that buyers have the edge. If the price rebounds off the zone between $95,000 and the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the rally above $95,000 may have been a bull trap. That heightens the risk of a drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($86,682). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI has dropped near the midpoint on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a weakening momentum. If the price drops below $95,000, the pair could descend to $92,800 and then to $91,660. A break below $91,660 clears the path for a fall to $86,000. Buyers will have to drive and sustain the price above $97,895 to regain control. The pair could climb to $100,000 and later to $107,000. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is facing resistance at $21.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($18.48) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $21.50 could start the next leg of the up move to $25 and then to $27.50. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA, suggesting profit booking by the short-term bulls. The HYPE/USDT pair could then fall to $17.35, which is likely to act as solid support. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears are defending the $21.50 level, but the bulls have not allowed the price to slip below the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. A solid bounce off the 20-EMA could challenge the overhead hurdle. If the $21.50 level is scaled, the pair could soar toward $25. Instead, if the price breaks the 20-EMA, select short-term buyers may be tempted to book profits. That could sink the pair to the 50-SMA, which is a critical support to keep an eye on. If the level cracks, the pair may descend to $17.35. AAVE price prediction Aave ( AAVE ) turned up from the moving averages on April 30, indicating that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. AAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to push the price to the $196 level, where the bears are expected to sell aggressively. If the price turns down from $196 but finds support at the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break above the overhead resistance increases. The AAVE/USDT pair could then travel to $220 and later to $240. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly pull the price below the moving averages. If they can pull it off, the pair may collapse to $130. AAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is facing selling near $180, but a positive sign is that the bulls have maintained the price above the moving averages. If the price turns up from the moving averages and breaks above $180, the pair could accelerate toward $196. There is minor resistance at $190, but it is likely to be crossed. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the price down to $155 and subsequently to $150.

RNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($4.31), where the bulls are likely to mount a strong defense. If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, it increases the possibility of a break above $4.87. If that happens, the RNDR/USDT pair could pick up momentum and climb to $6.20. This positive view will be negated in the near term if the price continues to slide and breaks below the $4.22 support. That opens the doors for a fall to the 50-day SMA ($3.80) and, after that, to $3.55. RNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers have pulled the price to the $4.22 support, which is an important support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off $4.22 with strength, it signals a possible range formation in the near term. The pair may swing between $4.22 and $4.87 for some time. A break and close above $4.87 indicates the resumption of the up move toward $5.52. On the contrary, if the price continues lower and breaks below $4.22, it suggests that the bears are attempting a comeback. The pair may decline to $3.88. Fetch.ai price prediction Fetch.ai ( FET ) turned down from the $0.84 overhead resistance and has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.65). FET/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to arrest the pullback at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the FET/USDT pair could reach the $0.84 level. A break and close above $0.84 opens the doors for a possible rise to $1.09. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could fall to the 50-day SMA ($0.54), where the buyers are expected to step in. FET/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has reached the crucial support at $0.67. If the price rebounds off $0.67, the bears will try to halt the relief rally at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $0.67, it suggests that the bulls have given up. That could drag the pair down to $0.60. Alternatively, a break above the moving averages signals demand at lower levels. That suggests a possible range formation between $0.67 and $0.80. The uptrend could resume on a close above $0.80.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.5 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

Holders have since launched a lawsuit , alleging Nike has caused them financial harm by shuttering the marketplace.

FIFA, which launched its NFT collection ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup, announced on April 30 that it was creating a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain for its digital collectibles. The overall NFT market dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plunging 63% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024.

On one hand, meme tokens like PEPE are turning heads, pulling in $37 million despite technical warning signs. On the other, XRP is carving out bullish patterns, signaling that a potential breakout could be on the horizon. Traders are asking, “Is now the best time to buy crypto?” That depends on your strategy. Momentum plays like PEPE and XRP can reward quick movers. However, if you’re looking beyond today’s price charts and focusing on lasting impact, Cold Wallet ($CWT) brings a very different proposition to the table. With privacy at its core, Cold Wallet is reshaping how users interact with Web3, all while offering early access at $0.00714 during Stage 2 of its presale. Let’s break down what’s happening with each project and why Cold Wallet might just be the smartest choice for serious crypto holders. PEPE Defies Bearish Signals With $37 Million in New Capital In a surprising turn, PEPE has rallied strongly as $37 million in spot buys flowed in, defying a series of bearish indicators. Technical warning signs were clear. A death cross, where the 20-day simple moving average fell below the 200-day, typically signals downward pressure. Meanwhile, the Accumulation/Distribution indicator pointed to growing sell-side activity. Despite these headwinds, PEPE still managed modest price gains. However, trading volume fell sharply, down over 36%, creating a classic divergence. This suggests that while some traders see opportunity, others are exercising caution. Adding to the mixed picture, the funding rate flipped negative at -0.0097, showing that short sellers currently dominate the derivatives market. Yet, the substantial spot buying hints that retail traders are strategically positioning for a potential rebound, hoping lower prices create a buying window. For now, PEPE’s journey reflects classic market tension. It is a story of bullish belief running against technical caution, making it one of the market’s more unpredictable plays. XRP Breaks Trendline as Bulls Set Sights on $5.81 XRP has emerged as a talking point after pushing above a multi-month descending trendline. The breakout has traders excited, signaling that momentum could be shifting in favor of bulls. Crucially, XRP recently retested the $1.98 support level and held steady. This strengthens the breakout narrative, although staying above this zone will be key to sustaining upward movement. Technical indicators are also flashing green. The Relative Strength Index is nearing 66, a level that suggests strengthening buying pressure, and the MACD has formed a bullish crossover. Together, these indicators reinforce a positive outlook. Analysts believe that if institutional interest keeps building, XRP could test $5.81 by the end of the year. However, risks remain. Bearish forces could pull it back to $2.06, and if weakness persists, the critical $1.20 support will be tested. Kalshi markets currently estimate a 44% chance of XRP reclaiming its previous high of $3.40 during 2025. For now, XRP stays on the radar of traders looking for the next big move, though as always, market sentiment will play a deciding role. Cold Wallet ($CWT) Solves the Problem That Even Hardware Wallets Cannot While PEPE wrestles with technical signals and XRP tries to break higher, Cold Wallet is focusing on a completely different mission. It is tackling what many in crypto overlook: making privacy effortless while maintaining easy access to DeFi. Hardware wallets provide excellent security, but they are clunky when it comes to real-time blockchain interaction. Signing every transaction, bridging assets, and moving to hot wallets introduces complexity and exposure. Cold Wallet takes a smarter approach. It is designed as a live-chain wallet that blends cold storage privacy with online convenience. Users get full access to DeFi and Web3 without leaking IP addresses, transaction history, or behavior data. Everything is protected through zero-knowledge architecture, so every transaction is stealthy by default. Even better, there are no browser plugins or hidden trackers. Cold Wallet simply works, offering secure and seamless blockchain access. Powering this experience is $CWT. More than just a token, it unlocks platform features, powers governance, and acts as the key to advanced privacy tools. Currently available in Stage 2 presale at $0.00714 and with a launch price of about $0.35171, $CWT offers early buyers a potential 4,900% return window. Cold Wallet is not chasing hype. Instead, it is quietly delivering a solution to Web3’s biggest flaw: How to interact privately and securely without sacrificing usability. Final Reflections Short-term trades dominate crypto headlines. PEPE’s surge and XRP’s breakout have created buzz, and rightfully so. They present interesting setups for those watching the charts closely. Cold Wallet, however, belongs in a different conversation. It is not about chasing fleeting momentum or waiting on technical breakouts. It is about building the invisible infrastructure that keeps Web3 running securely in the background. At $0.00714 and backed by privacy, usability, and a roadmap built for compliance and growth, Cold Wallet offers something rare in crypto. It is not just another token play. It is a product that delivers what the market is starting to realize it needs the most. For anyone wondering when the best time to buy crypto with long-term value is, the answer might not lie in timing the next pump. Instead, it could be about securing a stake in the tools and infrastructure that will define the next era of digital ownership.

While most eyes stay glued to price charts, something far more transformative is quietly taking shape behind the scenes. XRP is holding firm at $2.08, with Ripple’s tracker fund hinting at a potential breakout. Meanwhile, Chainlink is hovering between $12 and $13, with whale activity building and resistance near $14.50 drawing attention. Both offer solid setups, but they still rely on market timing and sentiment shifts. Unstaked ($UNSD) is focused on infrastructure. With a projected $1.09 billion market cap, its $UNSD token powers AI agents built to automate DAO tasks, grow communities, and engage users without manual effort. It’s not just a new token, it’s a working system for scalable, on-chain productivity. XRP Holds Steady as Ripple Fund Sparks Breakout Speculation XRP is holding firm around $2.08, showing resilience even as the broader market shifts. The buzz now centers on Ripple’s newly launched tracker fund, which could pave the way for more institutional involvement. If the fund gains momentum, analysts believe it might help XRP push through key resistance levels. The fund adds a layer of structure to XRP’s appeal, especially for those looking beyond spot trades. While price action has remained stable, the setup suggests potential for steady, adoption-driven growth. For mid- to long-term traders, this range is quickly becoming one to watch. Chainlink (LINK) Consolidates, But Whale Activity Signals Possible Move Chainlink is hovering between $12 and $13, with consolidation keeping the LINK price potential in check. Analysts have marked support between $12.28 and $12.62, and resistance between $14.19 and $14.58, forming a clear trading range for now. Interestingly, whale activity has surged to its highest levels since 2023, a signal that volatility may be on the horizon. Whether that sparks a breakout or a pullback depends on volume and sentiment. LINK isn’t moving yet, but the pressure is building, and a strong push past resistance could set the tone for the next leg up. Unstaked ($UNSD): Where AI Becomes the Workforce of Web3 Unstaked is entering the market with a projected cap of $1.09 billion, and it’s not riding on hype alone. The $UNSD token powers AI agents built to handle real operational tasks in the Web3 world, everything from community management to DAO coordination. These agents are designed to offload the repetitive work that typically slows down decentralized platforms. What makes them different is autonomy. Once deployed after launch, Unstaked’s AI agents will monitor metrics, analyze sentiment, and act in real time. This isn’t basic automation, it’s tokenized digital labor that can cut down operational overhead by up to 100×. Instead of being just another tool, Unstaked aims to become the infrastructure layer behind decentralized ecosystems. The presale is currently live with 150 pricing stages. Stage 1 began at $0.0065, with a projected listing price of $0.1819, representing a potential return of over 2,700% for early participants. The structure rewards early adopters while reinforcing long-term utility. If you’re asking what the best crypto to buy right now is, Unstaked brings a compelling case. It’s not about chasing pumps. It’s about creating productivity at scale. $UNSD is shaping up to be a utility token with daily use cases—something rare in a market that still rewards speculation over function. The Bottom Line XRP is holding steady at $2.08, and Chainlink is setting up for a potential breakout, but both still depend on timing the market. While they offer strong narratives, they remain reactive to broader trends and external momentum. Unstaked is taking a different route. With a projected $1.09 billion market cap and AI agents built to automate community, DAO, and on-chain operations, $UNSD isn’t just another token, it’s building crypto’s operational core. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy right now , consider where long-term value will come from. Unstaked is laying the groundwork that others may soon rely on.

Ethereum (ETH) price action is trending upward with the Pectra upgrade approaching, showing bullish patterns that could drive stronger moves if resistance breaks. At the same time, XRP price prediction is improving, backed by utility developments and a rebound above important levels. While analysts watch both closely, BlockDAG (BDAG) is grabbing attention in another way. Its new referral system offers 25% more BDAG to referrers and 5% more to referees for every purchase using a shared link. With BDAG priced at just $0.0019 until May 13, buyers are rushing in to maximize both token value and referral rewards. XRP Price Prediction Targets $2.38 After Reclaiming Key Support XRP price prediction is looking stronger after rising from $2.24 to $2.30, bouncing back from ETF-related turbulence. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s plan to use the XRP Ledger for real-time salary payments has added fresh value to XRP’s practical use. Technically, XRP price prediction benefits from bullish signals, as the token stays above its 50-period EMA and approaches resistance at $2.2613. A close above this point could lead the price to $2.38. As long as $2.20 support holds, the outlook remains positive. Growing adoption and increasing use cases may continue to push the token higher in the near future. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action Builds Strength Before Pectra Launch Ethereum (ETH) price action has bounced back to $1,817 after briefly dipping to $1,737, showing renewed energy ahead of a major network update. The Pectra upgrade, scheduled for May 7, brings improvements in staking and scalability that could appeal to both everyday users and institutions. Current Ethereum price action shows strong indicators, including a MACD Golden Cross and a Dragonfly Doji on the monthly chart. Market analysts are eyeing the $1,812 resistance area closely. The token is still following its parabolic support curve, which has previously triggered major rallies. A breakout depends on sustained trading volume and continued market confidence. BlockDAG’s Referral Plan Pays Big for Sharing, 25% for You, 5% for Them BlockDAG’s referral offer is becoming one of the top passive earning opportunities in crypto. Many holders are already using it to build extra income simply by sharing a referral link. Here’s how it works: referrers earn 25% of the total BDAG bought by their referees, while each referee gets a 5% bonus. For example, if three friends each purchase $3,000 in BDAG using one link, that’s $9,000 in total, giving the referrer $2,250 in BDAG and each friend an extra $150. It’s a powerful reward system with no added cost. Long-time holders are already seeing big returns. And for newcomers, this might be the best time to buy. Batch 28 is now live. While the initial price for this batch was $0.0262, BlockDAG is still offering the special $0.0019 price until May 13. Based on its planned listing at $0.05, new buyers stand to gain a 2,531% return. With over $225.5 million raised and 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold, BlockDAG continues to grow rapidly. Among the top crypto coins right now , this project’s referral system is more than just a bonus; it’s a path to become part of a growing holder base of 170,000. Key Insights! With Ethereum price action heating up ahead of its major upgrade and XRP price prediction gaining strength from new applications, both tokens are under close watch. But while they build slowly, BlockDAG is delivering fast. Its referral system offers buyers up to 25% more coins, while referees gain an extra 5%. This has helped push demand even higher, with batch 28 moving fast. The $0.0019 price is still active until May 13, offering a 2,531% potential return at listing. Among all the top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG stands out by turning hype into tangible results, and that’s what makes it one to watch.

Meanwhile, Mantra (OM) price analysis reveals deep trouble. A drop of 88% followed liquidations tied to large holders and concerns over token control. As these shifts play out, Web3 ai is starting to stand out. This AI-based crypto project is not built on buzzwords. It is building real features: 12 tools that handle trading tasks like portfolio checks, risk scans, and automation. Everything runs in real time across different chains. The ai crypto presale has 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267. With a listing price of $0.005242, early buyers are looking at a 1747% ROI. If finding the best crypto to buy now matters, this one may be worth a closer look. Web3 ai Focuses on Real Tools, Not Just Tech In AI crypto, the problem isn’t a lack of infrastructure. It’s the lack of tools. Web3 ai shifts focus to what people can use. No hype, just 12 AI tools designed to solve trading problems.

On top of that, the token lets holders stake, vote, and earn part of platform revenue. For those scanning the space for the best crypto to buy now, Web3 ai looks built to handle real tasks. While many projects work on backend systems, this one puts utility first. That may be why it’s turning heads as traders rethink what they actually want to use. AVAX Price Moves Toward $30 as Interest Rises Around ETF and DeFi Avalanche (AVAX) recorded a 16% price rise over the last week, and the trend appears to be linked to stronger signals. VanEck’s recent ETF filing has drawn renewed attention from institutional players, and Avalanche’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) has climbed to $1.63 billion, marking its highest level in several months. This 14.4% monthly increase puts it ahead of bigger platforms like Ethereum and Solana. With more than 430 active protocols, developers seem to be returning in larger numbers. From a technical perspective, Avalanche (AVAX) is now testing major resistance zones. Analysts are focusing on the $24 to $26 range, and if bulls push through, the $30 level could be the next key target. Some traders see this period as one of accumulation, especially as Layer 1 networks gain traction again. With features like real-time transaction finality, scalable smart contracts, and EVM support, Avalanche is working toward practical use in finance. If the pace continues, AVAX may be setting up for a more extended move upward. OM Token Faces Challenges Following Major Sell-Off It’s been a tough week for Mantra (OM), with the token falling 88% after a sharp sell-off during low liquidity periods dropped the price from $6.30 to $0.38. Blockchain data shows large transactions by whales, including those tied to Laser Digital VC and team-associated wallets, which has sparked concerns about internal control. SpotOnChain also noted that $91 million worth of OM was sent to exchanges shortly before the drop. Now trading around $0.70, indicators suggest continued pressure. The RSI remains in oversold territory, and the MACD still reflects a downward trend. Still, there are early signs of a possible rebound. If the market regains trust, OM might revisit the $1 to $1.50 range, though reaching the $3.4 to $4.2 zone could be more difficult. Looking at the Mantra (OM) price today, it’s clear this situation goes beyond charts. The focus is now on clarity. With doubts about token distribution and shaken community confidence, OM needs more than price movement. It needs openness and accountability. Overall Insights Avalanche has shown new strength, with AVAX rising 16% over the week, supported by ETF-related news and growth in its DeFi space. In contrast, Mantra (OM) is still in recovery mode, working to rebuild trust after a large drop tied to whale actions and token transfers. While some crypto markets are facing uncertainty, there’s a shift toward building useful networks instead of chasing trends. This is where Web3 ai is beginning to stand out. The project is building 12 AI-powered modules aimed at crypto users, going beyond just developer tools. With a 50-step ai crypto presale priced from $0.0003 to $0.003267, a launch value of $0.005242, and an expected ROI at listing of 1747%, Web3 ai is focusing on technology that can actually be used. As the search continues for the best crypto to buy right now , Web3 ai could become the functional “AI internet” many are waiting for, serving traders, holders, and others in the space.

Right now, four assets are catching the attention of strategic investors: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE . While the larger caps hold steady, it’s early-phase entries like MAGACOINFINANCE that could define the next growth wave—and the window may still be open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off Spotting a strong project before the crowd is rare—but MAGACOINFINANCE is offering just that kind of window right now. Wallet growth is consistent. Community engagement is rising without artificial spikes. Developer updates are arriving on time, and early-stage capital is quietly moving in before mainstream exposure. There’s no shortcut being taken—just disciplined execution and strategic growth. For investors seeking uninflated value and authentic early-stage positioning, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the final high-upside opportunities in this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano continues to lead with its research-driven approach to secure smart contract deployment and sustainability.

Kaspa appeals to performance-focused users with its proof-of-work blockDAG model—offering speed, scalability, and security. Arbitrum is dominating the Ethereum Layer-2 space, delivering efficient scaling and lower gas costs for decentralized applications. While each of these platforms is building critical infrastructure, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early-stage, undervalued momentum that is increasingly rare. Final Word Can $750 really become $850K ? For those who’ve studied crypto cycles, it’s clear: timing and early conviction matter. XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum offer enduring strength.

According to Trump, American films that are produced in “foreign lands“ pose a national security threat”. He claimed it’s causing the movie industry to die “a very fast death” in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, adding that Hollywood and other areas of the country “are being devastated” over films produced in “foreign lands.” Trump argued that the President’s job was to defend the United States against foreign and domestic threats and that the issue involved messaging and propaganda, among other concerns. Trump said the tariff would take effect immediately and that the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative would soon start taking all necessary and appropriate action under Section 301, a trade sense law, to halt what he said were unfair trade practices. Yet he did not detail when or how the policy would take effect. The post was one in a series Trump has touched on tariffs since he began the tariff wars, indicating that no industry may remain untouched. He cast the move in patriotic terms to preserve American jobs and values. China plans to cut American movie quota China had already begun to act just weeks before Trump’s announcement. On April 10, China’s Film Administration announced it would cut the number of American movies permitted into the market. The action is believed to be in retaliation to previous U.S. talks of increasing tariffs on imported entertainment. The administration said in a public statement that the U.S. government’s abuse of tariffs to interfere with and suppress legitimate industries had reshaped domestic audiences’ attitudes toward American films. It added that China would follow market rules and respect audience preferences by reducing the number of U.S. films allowed into the country. China is the world’s second-largest film market, and Hollywood increasingly depends on it. But it has become more protective of its homegrown entertainment industry. For the last few years, Chinese films have been kicking the backsides of Hollywood imports at the local box office. In 2024, U.S. movies accounted for about 14% of China’s box office. This is a significant decrease from 36% in 2018. That partly has to do with the fact that Chinese audiences are increasingly weary of sequels and reboots and what they view as formulaic storytelling from Hollywood, experts say. The Chinese government is now backing more local productions and encouraging audiences to watch homegrown content. The most recent attempt to reduce the United States imports of films threatens to hit Hollywood where it hurts. Hollywood studios struggle under trade tensions Hollywood studios are growing increasingly concerned about these developments. The President’s new 100% tariff would significantly raise the cost for foreign films to enter the U.S. — the world’s largest movie market. This could depress competition for American films and ratchet up tensions between the country’s four biggest trade partners , China, France, South Korea, and India. Just recently, Voight’s manager, Steven Paul, confirmed that he and the actor had put a proposal together that they planned to present to Trump with a plan to reinvigorate American film and television production. However, it was unclear what ideas were in their plan or if they had a confirmed appointment with Trump. One potential suggestion Voight and Paul might be floating is a federal tax incentive, something the industry — which has suffered economically in recent years from Covid shutdowns, writers strikes, and the wildfires — would likely favor. Overseas tax incentives have helped studios reduce production costs due to economic challenges. Meanwhile, China’s reduction of U.S. film imports is already having an impact. For studios like Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, which use international markets to help cover production costs, the dependence is even greater for costly blockbusters. Companies that have long wielded great power are now on the brink of ruin because of the pandemic. Dwindling ticket sales in China — once a top early revenue market for Hollywood — has left major studios scrambling for new sources of revenue. Film critics also caution that moviegoers could be denied various stories worldwide. In his Sunday post, Trump did not mention the television or streaming industries, which have also depended on productions outside the U.S. If the move entails increased tariffs worldwide, international films could become a thing of the past in American theaters.

A May 3 post-mortem from the Solana Foundation said that the security vulnerability, first discovered on April 16, could have allowed an attacker to forge an invalid proof affecting Solana’s privacy-enabling “Token-22 confidential tokens.” There is no known exploit of the vulnerability, and Solana validators have since adopted the patched version, the foundation said. Solana zero-day security bug affected Token-22 confidential tokens The Solana Foundation said the security vulnerability concerned two programs: Token-2022 and ZK ElGamal Proof. Token-2022 handles the main application logic for token mints and accounts, while ZK ElGamal Proof verifies the correctness of zero-knowledge proofs to show accurate account balances. The foundation said certain algebraic components were omitted from the hash in the Fiat-Shamir Transformation's transcript generation, which specifies how provers create public randomness using a cryptographic hash function. The flaw could have enabled an attacker to exploit the unhashed components by crafting a forged proof that passes verification to mint and steal Token-22 confidential tokens. Token-22 confidential tokens, or “Extension Tokens,” leverage zero-knowledge proofs for private transfers and aim to enable advanced token functionality. The vulnerability was first identified on April 16, and two patches were deployed to resolve the issues. A super majority of Solana validators adopted the patches around two days later. Solana development firms Anza, Firedancer and Jito were the main parties behind the security patch, while Asymmetric Research, Neodyme and OtterSec also assisted. The foundation confirmed that all funds remain safe. Related: Bloomberg Intelligence boosts Solana ETF approval odds to 90% Despite the fix, the Solana Foundation's private handling of the issue with Solana validators raised centralization concerns from some in the crypto community. This included a Curve Finance contributor who raised concerns about the foundation’s close relationship with Solana validators. “Why does someone have a list of all validators and their contact details? What else are they talking about in those comms channels,” they asked, fearing that they could collude to potentially censor transactions or roll back the chain. Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko didn’t directly deny the claims but said members of the Ethereum community could also coordinate to resolve a similar security bug. Source: Clouted More than 70% of Ethereum network validators are also controlled by crypto exchanges or staking operators such as Lido, Yakovenko said in arguing his point. “It’s the same people to get to 70% on ethereum. All the lido validators (chorus one, p2p, etc..) binance, coinbase, and kraken. If geth needs to push a patch, I’ll be happy to coordinate for them.” In August, the Solana Foundation and network validators resolved another critical vulnerability behind the scenes. At the time, the foundation’s executive director, Dan Albert, said the ability to coordinate a patch doesn’t mean that Solana is centralized. Ethereum wouldn’t fall for the same issue, community member says Ethereum community member Ryan Berckmans slammed claims that Ethereum is subject to the same centralization issues as Solana, pointing out that Ethereum has sufficient client diversity. The most popular Ethereum client, geth, has at most 41% market share on Ethereum, Berckmans said, while noting that Solana has just one production-ready client, Agave. “This means zero day bugs in the single Sol client are de facto protocol bugs. Change the single client program, change the protocol itself. The client is the protocol.” Meanwhile, Solana is looking to roll out a new client, Firedancer, in the next few months, which is expected to improve the network’s resilience and uptime. However, Berckmans said that Solana would need three clients to be sufficiently decentralized at the client level.

Market giants like XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , TRON (TRX) , and Bitcoin (BTC) are showing strength, but a fast-moving altcoin, MAGACOINFINANCE , is becoming harder to ignore. With growing attention from early-stage investors, the question is now being asked: which asset will define 2025’s biggest breakout? MAGACOINFINANCE – The Breakout Project Gaining Real Momentum MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just appearing in headlines—it’s becoming the conversation. With soaring community numbers, and rising influencer support, this altcoin is evolving into one of 2025’s top discovery-phase plays. While others have peaked, MAGACOINFINANCE is still early. It’s backed by a high-engagement user base, clear branding, and a smart rollout strategy. Analysts and traders alike are watching closely, noting its high upside positioning as the listing price of $0.007 looms.

XRP: Positioned for an Institutional Breakout Current Price: $2.24 2025 Forecast: $3.10 – $5.81 XRP’s institutional interest is climbing rapidly, driven by the possibility of U.S. ETF approvals and expanding use in cross-border transactions. Legal clarity and strategic partnerships position XRP as a frontrunner in regulated digital finance. Ethereum (ETH): Scaling with Network Upgrades Current Price: $1,729 2025 Forecast: $3,174 average, up to $10,000 Ethereum continues to dominate as the foundation of decentralized applications. Its ongoing network upgrades and staking model have brought new scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for institutional inflows via potential spot ETH ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC): Leading the Market with Renewed Strength Current Price: ~$95,000 2025 Forecast: Targets suggest a move to $132,000 by mid-year Bitcoin remains the macro anchor of the crypto market. Following a 14.5% rise in April , analysts project continued momentum as ETF inflows, institutional demand, and increasing scarcity drive long-term value. TRON (TRX): Advancing Utility in DeFi Current Price: $0.2457 2025 Forecast: $0.259 by mid-year TRON is steadily advancing with gas-free transactions, making it a reliable player in decentralized finance and payments—particularly in emerging markets. Its consistent transaction volume keeps it relevant in a rapidly evolving space. Final Thoughts XRP, Ethereum, TRON, and Bitcoin represent strong foundations and long-term utility. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers something different—early-stage momentum, structured execution, and untapped potential. For those looking to diversify into the next big altcoin, the window may not stay open long.

According to Coinglass data , the long/short ratio for Ripple ( XRP ) is 0.9205, meaning that more traders are betting on a decline than a rally. For almost two weeks, this ratio has remained below 1, indicating that bearish sentiment has taken over. Even though open interest has dropped by 1.92%, derivatives volume jumped 35% to $3.28 billion. This tells us traders are still active, but mostly on the short side, expecting a move down. On the technical front, XRP is trading at $2.14, just above a crucial support level of $2.05. If that level is broken, there may be more severe short-term declines. The relative strength index is neutral at 47 but is progressively declining. Since it is not yet oversold, there is still room for a further decline. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The moving average convergence divergence recently turned negative, suggesting that their downside momentum may be building. At 11, the average directional index, which gauges trend strength, is extremely low, indicating that there is currently only choppy sideways action rather than a strong trend. The majority of short- and medium-term moving averages are also flashing sell signals. You might also like: XRP unlikely to hit $3 in May, but analysts still see it and this new rival at $10 by 2026 A big move might be on the horizon, as shown by the narrowing of the Bollinger Bands. The squeeze, however, occurs at the same time that XRP is testing support, which might suggest that a decline rather than a bounce is more likely. While short-term setup is bearish, XRP’s fundamentals are still solid. A major regulatory burden was recently lifted as Ripple resolved its legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, there is increasing interest in a possible spot XRP exchange-traded fund, which Bloomberg analysts predict will be approved by the end of 2025 with an 85% chance. ETF approvals could increase institutional demand and drive up prices considerably. Meanwhile, Ripple’s $4-5 billion offer to purchase stablecoin issuer Circle, although unsuccessful, shows the company’s ambitious growth goals. Macroeconomic challenges still exist though. Risk sentiment is being distorted by President Trump’s tariff policies and sticky inflation. The Federal Reserve’s May 7 interest rate decision and May 13 CPI data are also drawing attention the focus of attention because they have the potential to impact the movements of cryptocurrency assets, including XRP. If XRP loses $2.05, it could fall toward $1.98–$2.00, where the 200-day support sits. Still, the bulls aren’t out. If XRP can bounce from this range and break back above $2.20, it might flip momentum back in its favor. But right now, the odds don’t support that move.

Some X users from the crypto community have recently reported having received a private message from the New York Post’s X account inviting them to feature in a podcast and to contact them via Telegram. The spurious messages were first discovered on May 3 by Kerberus founder and CEO Alex Katz, who shared a screenshot of a message made out to be from author and journalist Paul Sperry via the official nypost account. “What’s interesting about this case is that the scammer gained unauthorized access but didn’t post a Pump.fun address or wallet drainer. Instead, they’re messaging users and then directing them to Telegram,” observed cybersecurity engineer and NFT collector “Drew”. Related: ‘I’m sick’ — Scammers use AI, fake ID of crypto influencer to steal $4M After sending the message, the scammer blocks users from replying to prevent the actual New York Post team from being alerted to the compromise, he added. Donny Clutterbuck from NFT Bitcoin’s ordinals platform Fomojis also reported having been contacted by the hacker, suggesting that it could be a potential Zoom exploit from enabling audio. When you click to enable audio, a pop-up gives the option to either cancel or enable WiFi, he said before adding, “I guess WiFi gives network access to the scammer.” Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT said this compromise was similar to one from a few weeks ago when direct messages were sent from The Defiant’s X account. Private message from New York Post’s X account. Source: Alex Katz Cointelegraph contacted the New York Post for more information but did not receive an immediate response. There was nothing regarding the social media compromise on the NYP or Sperry’s X feeds. Scammers seeking victims on Zoom Scammers have increasingly shifted their social engineering techniques to messaging users directly after having established trust from previous conversations, and video conference platform Zoom has become a hotbed of crypto scams recently. In April, Emblem Vault CEO Jake Gallen warned users to be wary of malicious actors using Zoom after losing $100,000 in crypto assets. Gallen was also contacted via X to arrange a Zoom interview during which the scammer installed malware that drained his wallets. It is not the first time the New York Post’s verified Twitter account has been hijacked. In 2022, an employee hacked the account to post a series of obscene messages designed to look like real headlines.

The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post. The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks , and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests. During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.” “Unfortunately, this was the wrong call,” the company admitted. “The qualitative assessments were hinting at something important, and we should’ve paid closer attention. They were picking up on a blind spot in our other evals and metrics.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on April 27 that it was working to roll back changes making ChatGPT too agreeable. Source: Sam Altman Broadly, text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weighting, impacting how the model responds. OpenAI said introducing a user feedback reward signal weakened the model’s “primary reward signal, which had been holding sycophancy in check,” which tipped it toward being more obliging. “User feedback in particular can sometimes favor more agreeable responses, likely amplifying the shift we saw,” it added. OpenAI is now checking for suck up answers After the updated AI model rolled out, ChatGPT users had complained online about its tendency to shower praise on any idea it was presented, no matter how bad, which led OpenAI to concede in an April 29 blog post that it “was overly flattering or agreeable.” For example, one user told ChatGPT it wanted to start a business selling ice over the internet, which involved selling plain old water for customers to refreeze. Source: Tim Leckemby In its latest postmortem, it said such behavior from its AI could pose a risk, especially concerning issues such as mental health. “People have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn’t see as much even a year ago,” OpenAI said. “As AI and society have co-evolved, it’s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.” Related: Crypto users cool with AI dabbling with their portfolios: Survey The company said it had discussed sycophancy risks “for a while,” but it hadn’t been explicitly flagged for internal testing, and it didn’t have specific ways to track sycophancy. Now, it will look to add “sycophancy evaluations” by adjusting its safety review process to “formally consider behavior issues” and will block launching a model if it presents issues. OpenAI also admitted that it didn’t announce the latest model as it expected it “to be a fairly subtle update,” which it has vowed to change. “There’s no such thing as a ‘small’ launch,” the company wrote. “We’ll try to communicate even subtle changes that can meaningfully change how people interact with ChatGPT.” AI Eye: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-05 03:30:34

MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP are climbing the ranks quickly, with a clear uptick in engagement and positioning. Meanwhile, names like Solana (SOL) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Injective (INJ) are gaining quiet traction, especially among technical analysts and long-horizon investors looking for sustained momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE – Smart Positioning in a Crowded Market MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t aiming to compete through hype—it’s aiming to win through precision. With over $7.8 million raised , rising pre-sale demand, and a $0.007 listing price in view, the fundamentals are aligning fast. Its message, branding, and consistency in execution make MAGACOINFINANCE stand out among early-stage contenders. Investor communities across X, Telegram, and YouTube are increasingly focused on this project—not as a trend, but as a calculated long-term position. Use code MAGA50X at checkout to unlock a 50% bonus and secure early access before the broader listing surge begins. XRP – Strong Foundation and Institutional Appeal Current Price: $2.15, XRP continues to show impressive resilience, supported by rising ETF volume and on-chain strength. Analysts are closely monitoring the $2.45 breakout level, which could trigger renewed upward movement as institutional investors deepen their positions. Solana (SOL) – Strengthening as a Scalable Leader Current Price: ~$148, Solana has regained momentum after a robust 41% surge in April , positioning itself as a core platform for high-performance decentralized apps and real-world tokenization. If buying pressure holds, SOL is likely to test resistance around the $180 mark—opening the door to new upside in Q2. Kaspa and Injective – Quiet Builders with Real Fundamentals Kaspa (KAS) continues to gain ground among proof-of-work advocates. Trading around $0.10, the project is benefiting from rising interest in blockDAG tech and scalable architecture. If demand continues, a breakout above $0.30 remains a plausible scenario. Injective (INJ) remains anchored near $35. While not making headlines daily, its developer adoption and cross-chain ecosystem give it solid long-term fundamentals. Smart money continues to accumulate INJ quietly, anticipating future infrastructure relevance. Final Thoughts In a market where timing and traction are everything, XRP and Solana offer strength backed by structure, while Kaspa and Injective quietly build. But for those looking at pure early-stage upside, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to shine through with increasing conviction.

He blamed other countries for offering financial incentives to attract U.S. filmmakers and studios overseas, leaving Hollywood and other parts of the country struggling. Concerns Over Foreign Control of the Movie Industry In his message, Trump described this situation as a national security threat, claiming it’s not just about business — but also about messaging and propaganda. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump said. “Other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away. Hollywood and other areas within the U.S.A. are being devastated.” https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114452117143235155 Trump believes this is a coordinated effort by other nations to weaken the U.S. film industry. In response, he announced that he’s authorizing the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to start the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the United States. “We want movies made in America again,” Trump declared. This proposed move is aimed at protecting American jobs, preserving the country’s cultural influence, and keeping U.S. film production within its borders. Trump has made it clear he wants to rebuild the nation’s entertainment industry and stop relying on foreign-made films. This latest move has left social media users confused.

Right now, four names are aligning as early movers: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the breakout contender MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As dominant players consolidate, new opportunities are taking form—and for investors seeking aggressive upside, this may be the time to pay close attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Foundation for Breakout Growth Momentum in crypto is earned—not manufactured—and MAGACOINFINANCE is earning it in all the right ways. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is showing real strength: wallet activity is up, the community is expanding organically, and development milestones are being met with precision. Rather than chasing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is focusing on structure and sustainability. It’s laying a true foundation for breakout growth—something few early-stage projects achieve. Those entering now aren’t late—they’re early, and they may be entering just as the wider market starts to notice. Other Assets on the Move: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism remains a leader in Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, drawing demand for fast, cost-effective smart contracts. Arbitrum is thriving on strong developer activity and a vibrant dApp ecosystem, pushing Ethereum usability to new levels. Sei is gaining attention with its trading-focused architecture, built for speed and reduced congestion. Litecoin continues to hold its place as a reliable peer-to-peer transfer coin, especially where simplicity and speed are essential. Each of these assets has a clear use case—but none offer the raw early-stage momentum of MAGACOINFINANCE at this moment. Conclusion The next wave of crypto wealth won’t be built by those holding yesterday’s champions—it will come from those spotting what’s quietly emerging today. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP continue to command relevance. But MAGACOINFINANCE is the rising player offering one of the rarest setups in the space: early access to a project that’s already raised $7.8 million and is just getting started.

With a sharp 1 million BDAG purchase, the wallet not only won the daily round but also sent a clear message, this presale is heating up fast.

Buyer Battles Bring Daily Action & Competitive Rewards BlockDAG’s presale has captured attention for months, but its upgraded Buyer Battles format has taken the excitement to another level.

The battles are working, buyers want in, and they’re moving fast to secure their place before it’s too late. Presale Numbers Reveal Strength & Urgency Since launching, BlockDAG’s presale has crossed major milestones, raising $225.5 million and selling more than 19.6 billion BDAG coins across 28 batches. While the current batch price sits at $0.0262, a limited-time offer gives buyers access to BDAG at just $0.0019. This special rate lasts only until May 13, the same day BlockDAG plans to reveal its initial exchange listings. Early buyers from batch one have already seen an impressive ROI of 2,520%. And for those jumping in now, the gap between the discounted price and the batch price offers serious upside potential. With limited time left, the opportunity to lock in a low entry is narrowing fast, and interest continues to grow. Why Now Might Be the Best Entry Point for BlockDAG The countdown is on, but there’s still time to be part of BlockDAG’s presale. Whether you’re interested in scoring discounted tokens or chasing daily Buyer Battles rewards, this project offers something few others do. With the presale already raising $225.5 million and momentum building ahead of exchange listings, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities of the year. For anyone searching for the best presale crypto in 2025, BlockDAG is hard to ignore. The $0.0019 offer won’t last, and exchange trading will soon bring a new phase of growth. This is one of the last chances to buy in before that transition happens. With rewards, rising demand, and a deadline closing in, the timing couldn’t be better. Closing Thoughts BlockDAG’s latest update to its Buyer Battles format has sparked a wave of fresh participation, adding excitement to every day of the presale. The 1 million BDAG win by wallet 0x4e06…9e5 on April 26 proves how strategic moves can unlock big advantages. And the project’s numbers speak for themselves, $225.5 million raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since launch. As May 13 approaches, and with the $0.0019 offer still available, BlockDAG is entering its final presale stage. Exchange listings are coming, but right now, buyers still have a shot to enter early, earn rewards, and potentially ride the next wave of gains. For those serious about getting into the best presale crypto , BlockDAG is delivering both action and opportunity, right up to the finish line.

Elizabeth Warren has called on the Senate to delay the passage of a controversial digital asset bill, warning of potential corruption linked to the Trump family’s stablecoin project. Over the weekend, Warren urged lawmakers to reconsider rushing through the bill. She pointed to the involvement of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial in a high-stakes deal with the United Arab Emirates, which could have significant financial implications. “The Trump family stablecoin surged to 7th largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates—a foreign government that will give them a crazy amount of money,” Warren wrote on Sunday.

The Trump family’s stablecoin, pegged to the dollar, is linked to a $2b deal with the Emirati investment firm MGX . The firm, backed by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and AI firm G42, announced its use of the stablecoin to facilitate its investment in Binance . GENIUS Act Faces Senate Gridlock as Democrats Push Back Against GOP Revisions The situation has become even more complex with the ongoing debate over the GENIUS Act , a landmark piece of legislation aimed at establishing federal regulations for stablecoins. This bill has become a flashpoint in the Senate, with bipartisan talks encountering significant hurdles. Politico reported that nine key Senate Democrats voiced opposition to revisions unveiled by GOP lawmakers, creating a roadblock in the negotiations. The bill seeks to create the first-ever regulatory framework for stablecoins, and its passage is a key priority of Trump’s financial policy agenda. However, Democrats have shown concerns that the revised proposal fails to adequately address issues such as money laundering and the broader risks to the financial system. GENIUS Act Hits a Snag as Both Parties Remain Far From Agreement These concerns have led to growing friction behind the scenes, with some Democrats backing away from their earlier support for the bill. Republicans, meanwhile, remain hopeful that they can win over enough Democratic support to move the bill forward. GOP aides are optimistic that further revisions could address some of the concerns raised by Democrats, though the clock is ticking with hopes of a floor vote by the end of the month. Despite this, the ongoing negotiations signal that reaching a consensus on this issue may take more time than initially anticipated. The post Sen.

While the broader crypto market is experiencing some selling pressure, XRP has managed to hold its key support levels — but its future direction remains uncertain. Short-term Price Analysis On the short-term chart, XRP appears to have formed a low around April 7th. However, all subsequent rallies from that point have been corrective, featuring messy, overlapping, three-wave moves rather than clean impulse waves. Support at $2.11 has held so far, with additional support at $2.08 and $2.14. Price briefly broke a minor Fibonacci support recently but recovered quickly without sustaining losses. The market continues to form higher highs and higher lows — a positive sign amid uncertainty. There’s a tentative Elliott Wave scenario where XRP might be forming a diagonal pattern to the upside, although it’s not a particularly reliable setup given the overlapping, jagged structure. A decisive breakout above the descending trendline from the April 30th low (around $2.12) could signal the start of an internal third wave higher. Key resistance levels to watch include $2.33 and $2.46. A clean break of these could spark fresh bullish momentum. Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP: What Does It Mean?

Advertisements for “place‑of‑origin washing” have started appearing on popular Chinese social media sites, according to Financial Times . The posts promise to lower tariffs by sending the goods to another Asian country from where they’ll leave again carrying a fresh certificate of origin, allowing them to clear U.S. customs at the lower duty rate. The surge in such offers shows how worried exporters are about losing the American market. “The tariff is too high,” said Sarah Ou, who sells for Baitai Lighting in Zhongshan, Guangdong. “We can sell the goods to neighboring countries, and then the neighboring countries sell them on to the United States, and it will reduce.” Under U.S. trade rules, a shipment must undergo “substantial transformation” — processing that adds real value — before it can legally claim a new national origin. Yet one post on lifestyle app Xiaohongshu this week urged shippers to “Transit through Malaysia to ‘transform’ into Southeast Asian goods.” Another highlighted U.S. tariffs on Chinese wooden flooring and tableware, adding, “Wash the origin in Malaysia for smooth customs clearance.” Officials across Asia say more companies are bypassing tariffs South Korea’s customs service last month reported finding 29.5 billion won (about $21 million) worth of imports with false origin labels in the first quarter, mostly Chinese goods bound for the United States. “We are seeing a sharp increase in recent cases where our country is used as a bypass,” the agency said, noting many cartons were restamped “Made in Korea.” Vietnam’s industry and trade ministry has urged local manufacturers and export groups to tighten checks on raw‑material origins and stop fake certificates. Thailand’s foreign trade department rolled out extra inspections in April aimed at U.S.‑destined shipments. Two freight forwarders told the Financial Times they can move containers to Port Klang, Malaysia, unload them, retag the cartons and reload them with Malaysian paperwork. They rely on partner plants in Malaysia that help secure the new certificates. “The U.S. must know of it,” one agent said. “It cannot get too crazy so we are controlling the amount.” The other added, “Malaysian customs are not very strict.” Some exporters are mixing expensive items with cheaper ones in a single consignment A consultant who advises exporters said origin‑washing is one of two main tactics now used to blunt Trump’s tariffs . The second involves mixing expensive items with cheaper goods in one consignment, then declaring the average price so the duty bill is lower. The work‑arounds also unsettle American retailers. A senior executive at one of Amazon’s ten largest independent sellers said they had already seen shipments arrive with altered origin papers, risking confiscation. The executive turns down suppliers’ offers to handle U.S. import paperwork and pay duty based on factory cost, not retail value. “You’re putting a lot of trust in a Chinese supplier,” the executive said.

Credit: crypto.news The relative strength index, which is currently hovering around 40, shows that bulls are lacking enough pressure, but it does not validate oversold conditions. The moving average convergence divergence is weak and does not exhibit any bullish crossover, despite being marginally positive. There is no strong volume and the average directional index is below 10, which suggests a very weak trend at the moment. This hesitancy implies that the market is awaiting a distinct catalyst before deciding on a course. The bias will probably continue to be downward as long as Pi remains below its 20-day average. Still, if the $0.58 support holds and sentiment around Pi’s compliance push continues to build, a relief bounce is possible. But for a real reversal to gain traction, Pi would need to reclaim the $0.60–$0.62 area with strong volume. Until then, traders may remain cautious.

Let’s take a closer look at what’s happening and why XRP’s price is falling. What’s Happening with XRP’s Price? Over the last few months, the price of XRP has been on a downward trend. There’s a concept known as bearish divergence, meaning that even though the price increased for some time, there wasn’t enough buying support behind that rise. This weak trend is still affecting the price. Currently, XRP is moving within a downward channel, meaning the price is consistently falling. While there have been occasional small price increases, the overall trend remains negative. The key price levels to watch are the resistance levels, where the price might struggle to move higher, and the support levels, where the price might stop falling or bounce back up. To reverse the downward trend, XRP would need to break above these resistance levels and show stronger signs of upward movement. Resistance : $2.33 – $2.35, $2.45 – $2.50, and $2.60. Support : $2.16, $2.05, and $1.80. What Happened with Ripple Unlocking XRP? On May 3, 2025, Whale Alert, a tool that tracks large blockchain transactions, spotted a big move: Ripple unlocked a massive 1 billion XRP, which is worth about $2.2 billion. This was unusual because Ripple usually releases 1 billion XRP on the 1st of every month, but this time, the release happened two days late. The unlocked XRP was broken down into three large amounts: 500 million XRP worth $1.1 billion, 300 million XRP worth $660 million, and 200 million XRP worth $440 million. While Ripple has unlocked XRP before, the delay caused concern. When large amounts of XRP are released into the market, it increases the total supply, which can sometimes cause the price to fall.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 04:41:01

But as it inches its way toward the long-anticipated $5 mark, a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is emerging from the shadows. Still priced at just $0.025, this low-cap DeFi challenger is drawing serious attention for its blazing momentum and real-world utility. With faster adoption, leaner tokenomics, and growing investor hype, MUTM isn’t just trying to catch XRP, it may outpace it entirely. The presale has surpassed $7.5 million and attracted more than 9400 holders. Investors are currently buying MUTM tokens at $0.025 knowing well that the price will be at $0.03 when phase 5 begins. The current investors are set to get a 140% return on investment when the project launches at $0.06. If history loves an underdog, 2025 might just crown a new champion before XRP even gets its shot. Mutuum Finance Presale Rises as Investor Demand Increases Mutuum Finance is emerging as a quick favorite among the decentralized lending community because of its innovative dual-lending model. Its successful presale is currently in phase 4 with more than 9400 holders onboard and more than $7.5 million raised. As the presale continues, investors will see an increase in Mutuum Finance token price from $0.025 to $0.03 in Phase 5. Industry experts have labeled Mutuum Finance as one of the most undervalued DeFi startups that could breach an over a $5 worth after public launch. In a recent announcement, Mutuum Finance introduced a new dashboard with a real-time leaderboard featuring the top 50 token holders. Not only will the top investors be identified, but they will also receive bonus tokens for maintaining their position. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach The innovative hybrid lending solution at Mutuum Finance integrates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer protocols to provide its users with dual powerful investing models. The P2C model enables users to put money in pools for passive USDT smart contract lending income while the P2P model lets users connect directly for borrowing and lending without an intermediary. The innovative combination of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models enables Mutuum Finance to grant investors secure high-yield services through an efficient and decentralized platform. Creating a Stable and Secure DeFi Environment To ensure long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a completely collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins that have frequently failed, the stablecoin will be over-collateralized, with reduced risk and utmost trust. The platform also features open-source code and audited smart contracts to address flaws that have crippled other DeFi projects. Rewarding Early Adopters and Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance also focuses on increasing its user base through incentivizing schemes. The project’s ongoing $100,000 giveaway will give out 10 rewards of $10,000 in MUTM tokens while the referral scheme will give rewards for referrals made at an individual and organizational level. Mutuum Finance is stepping into the spotlight as a serious XRP rival raising over $7.5 million from more than 9,400 investors and offering up to 140% ROI before even hitting public launch. Now in Phase 4 of its presale the price is still just $0.025 but with Phase 5 approaching fast and the price set to rise to $0.03 time is running out. Combining real-world utility, a powerful hybrid DeFi model, and a fully collateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance is built for longevity, not hype. Opportunities like this don’t stay under the radar for long. Get in now, before the price climbs and the window closes, by the time the crowd catches on, the biggest gains will already be gone.

In Arizona, Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin in its reserves, calling the plan financially risky. Meanwhile, in Washington, a group of Senate Democrats who once supported a federal stablecoin framework have now withdrawn their backing, saying the proposed bill lacks sufficient safeguards. Democratic Dissent Threatens Progress on Landmark US Stablecoin Bill A coalition of Senate Democrats with a history of supporting the crypto industry has signaled their opposition to the current form of a Republican-led bill aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. Their resistance, disclosed in a joint statement on May 3, threatens to derail a rare bipartisan effort to bring much-needed clarity to the US digital asset landscape. Democrats Raise Red Flags Over GENIUS Act The legislation in question, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, was introduced by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty and is poised for floor consideration in the Senate this week. If passed, the GENIUS Act would mark the first comprehensive US law focused on stablecoin oversight—an area many analysts view as crucial to safeguarding financial stability and boosting investor confidence in crypto markets. However, despite initial bipartisan backing when the bill advanced through the Senate Banking Committee in March, nine Senate Democrats now say the bill contains “numerous issues that must be addressed.” Among the lawmakers voicing their concerns are Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester, and Andy Kim—all of whom had previously voted in favor of the bill at the committee level. Their new position represents a significant shift in momentum. The dissenting Democrats emphasized in their statement that they would oppose a procedural vote to move the bill forward unless it undergoes further revisions. Their primary concerns revolve around the bill’s treatment of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) provisions, national security implications, oversight of foreign stablecoin issuers, and accountability for noncompliant actors. Other signatories include Senators Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez Masto, Ben Ray Luján, John Hickenlooper, and Adam Schiff. Notably absent from the list were Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks, who co-sponsored the bill alongside Hagerty. Their continued silence has sparked speculation about possible behind-the-scenes negotiations to salvage bipartisan consensus. Industry and Political Stakes Are High For the crypto industry, the GENIUS Act is viewed as a potential breakthrough in resolving the current patchwork of state-by-state regulations. Industry leaders have long advocated for a federal framework that would define stablecoin standards, reduce legal uncertainty, and level the playing field for US-based issuers. The latest resistance from Senate Democrats, however, could delay that progress. Floor consideration for the bill is expected to begin imminently, with a vote possibly occurring within the week. If the opposition holds firm, the legislation may be sent back to committee, further prolonging the policy vacuum that has left both investors and developers in limbo. The legislative gridlock comes as tensions continue to mount between the crypto sector and US banking regulators. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, recently criticized the Federal Reserve for maintaining a policy that restricts banks from issuing stablecoins on public blockchains—despite the Fed’s recent rollback of several crypto-related supervisory guidelines. Long pointed to a January 2023 directive—still in effect—that prohibits US banks from engaging with stablecoins on permissionless networks. She argued that only a federal law could override that position and urged Congress to act swiftly. “Congress should hurry up,” Long said. “The Fed is protecting big-bank stablecoins while locking out innovation.” A Fragile Bipartisan Balancing Act The internal divide among Democrats exposes the fragile nature of bipartisan crypto policymaking in Washington. While both parties agree on the urgency of establishing a regulatory foundation for digital assets, sharp disagreements remain over how to balance innovation with systemic risk and national security concerns. Despite their objections, the Democratic senators who signed the statement maintained they are “eager to continue working with our colleagues to address these issues.” This leaves the door open for possible compromises—but time is running short as the bill approaches a Senate floor vote. As the GENIUS Act hangs in the balance, the future of U.S. stablecoin regulation—and potentially the broader crypto market—remains uncertain. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs Vetoes Bill to Add Bitcoin to State Reserves, Halting Bold Crypto Experiment Meanwhile, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has officially vetoed legislation that would have allowed the Grand Canyon State to become the first in the nation to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves. The decision strikes a major blow to local crypto advocates and signals continued skepticism from state leaders about the role of digital assets in public finance. The bill, known as Senate Bill 1025 or the Digital Assets Strategic Reserve proposal, sought to authorize Arizona officials to convert seized funds into Bitcoin (BTC) and establish a reserve overseen by the state government. It passed through the Arizona House with a 31–25 vote on April 28, riding a wave of Republican support and optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. However, Governor Hobbs made good on her prior warnings and vetoed the bill on Friday, citing concerns over the volatility and lack of proven stability in cryptocurrency markets. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs wrote in a statement addressed to Senate President Warren Petersen. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currency.” Her decision was posted on the Arizona State Legislature’s website , drawing immediate responses from both crypto industry advocates and political critics who had hoped to use Arizona as a model for public Bitcoin adoption. Broader Crypto Push Faces Headwinds The veto sheds light on the growing tension between pro-crypto lawmakers and more cautious government leaders who remain wary of integrating digital assets into taxpayer-backed programs. Notably, the bill would not have impacted traditional retirement accounts directly, but Governor Hobbs drew a parallel between conservative investment policies and her broader fiscal philosophy. The legislation was one of two related Bitcoin bills under consideration. A companion bill, SB1373, which would authorize the Arizona state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of the state’s rainy-day fund to Bitcoin and other digital assets, is still awaiting a final vote. That bill may now face similar resistance from the Governor’s office. Arizona’s efforts mirror failed attempts in other states such as Oklahoma, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, where similar digital asset reserve proposals have either been vetoed, stalled, or withdrawn due to political friction or fiscal concerns. In contrast, North Carolina has taken a notably different path. On April 30, the state’s House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act, allowing the treasurer to invest up to 5% of specified funds into approved cryptocurrencies. The bill has since advanced to the state Senate and has been viewed as one of the most significant state-level pushes for digital asset adoption in public finance. Crypto proponents view these measures as essential steps toward financial modernization and hedge strategies in an era of growing distrust in fiat monetary policy. They also argue that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer long-term protection against inflation and geopolitical risk. Federal Momentum and the Trump Factor While state-level crypto bills face mixed outcomes, momentum is building at the federal level, largely driven by President Donald Trump and his Republican allies. In March, Trump signed an executive order proposing the creation of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a broader “Digital Asset Stockpile,” signaling a more bullish federal stance on integrating crypto into national economic strategy. Trump’s initiative, along with GOP-backed legislative proposals, marks a sharp contrast with the Biden administration’s more cautious tone toward cryptocurrencies during its term. His administration aims to challenge what many on the political right see as overreach by banking regulators and the Federal Reserve, especially concerning private crypto use and stablecoin issuance. Reactions to Hobbs' veto have been swift. Pro-crypto lawmakers in Arizona argue that the state is missing an opportunity to diversify its financial holdings and build a forward-looking investment strategy. Others accused the Governor of aligning too closely with traditional banking interests, at the expense of innovation. What’s Next for Arizona? Despite the setback, the fight is not necessarily over. Proponents of Bitcoin reserves could reintroduce revised versions of the bill in future legislative sessions. The survival of SB1373 may also hinge on whether lawmakers are willing to amend its provisions to gain the Governor’s support. For now, Arizona joins a growing list of states struggling to define the role of digital assets in government operations. With national crypto policy still in flux and states experimenting with their own approaches, the road to mainstream adoption remains anything but smooth.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-05 05:00:00

ETH Still Dominates,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-trx-and-btc-match-the-momentum-of-magacoinfinance-and-xrp-eth-still-dominates/,"As crypto markets deepen into Q2 2025, the spotlight is turning toward assets showing not just price action, but structural strength. TRON (TRX) , Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Ethereum (ETH) remain among the most closely tracked coins. But in the background, MAGACOINFINANCE is building serious momentum—quietly becoming a top candidate for early-stage upside this year. MAGACOINFINANCE – Strategic Growth With Sustained Momentum While leading coins grab the spotlight, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction for its calculated rise. With a strong branding, and increasing investor engagement, this project isn’t reacting to trends—it’s establishing one. Community traction is growing across channels, and top analysts are beginning to recognize MAGACOINFINANCE as more than a passing opportunity. The 50% bonus offer (code: MAGA50X) is still live—providing an edge to those who act before listings go public. TRX and Bitcoin Are Holding Strong in the 2025 Rotation TRX is trading near $0.245 , maintaining long-term network reliability and steady ecosystem usage. While not always in headlines, TRON’s user base and DeFi integrations continue to expand, making it a stable presence among Layer-1s. Bitcoin (BTC) , currently hovering around $95,000 , remains the macro pillar of the crypto market. Following April’s ETF-driven growth and institutional accumulation, BTC continues to show strength. Analysts still maintain targets ranging between $120,000–$132,000 by mid-year, with many viewing it as both a hedge and a leader in capital inflows. XRP and Ethereum Continue to Anchor Market Confidence XRP , priced around $2.15 , is gaining new institutional credibility through futures ETFs and expanding real-world payment solutions. Traders are watching for a breakout above the $2.45 resistance mark, which could open the door to significant rallies through Q2. Ethereum (ETH) trades near $1,830 , sustaining strong fundamentals thanks to growing Layer-2 adoption, AI integration, and whale interest. It remains the core foundation for decentralized innovation, with analysts forecasting a potential climb above $2,700 in coming weeks. Final Thoughts Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , and TRX each present compelling stories backed by fundamentals and ecosystem leadership. But MAGACOINFINANCE is shaping a new narrative—one defined by timing, community strength, and early-stage positioning.

He indicated that he sees crypto as a critical area to maintain American dominance and prevent China from gaining control. “I’m a big fan of crypto because I want to keep it away from China,” Trump said on Sunday evening , addressing the issue while returning to the White House from Palm Beach, Florida. His comments come amid a rising tide of competition between the US and China, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence, blockchain and other technological advancements. JUST IN: President Trump says, ""I want crypto. Crypto is important because if we don't do it, China will."" pic.twitter.com/oO2kPjjicy — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 4, 2025 Trump Speaks Out Against China’s Potential Control of Crypto Trump added that crypto is “a whole new thing that started, you know not so long ago,” further showing the sector’s rapid rise. He expressed concern that China’s growing influence in technology could extend into cryptocurrency unless the US actively counters this trend. “I’m very much in favor of crypto because otherwise China is going to take it over,” he warned. Trump’s SEC Task Force Aims to Ease Crypto Regulations In January, under Trump’s leadership, the SEC created a crypto task force aimed at reducing regulatory barriers for the industry. This move was part of a broader effort to foster growth and innovation within the sector. Additionally, Trump appointed former PayPal COO David Sacks as the AI & Crypto Czar, a key role focused on developing a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework, something that the crypto industry has long been advocating for. China’s interest in cryptocurrency, particularly its state-backed digital yuan, has spurred concern in Washington. Experts argue that Beijing’s growing efforts in digital currency could potentially give China unprecedented control over global financial systems. As such, Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency has become a symbol of resistance against China’s ambitions. Trump’s remarks also reflect a broader concern about Chinese dominance in industries critical to global economies. He has often criticized China for its aggressive strategies in fields like artificial intelligence, 5G, and now, cryptocurrency.

The US-based Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds bought a whopping 18,644 Bitcoin over the past week when only 3,150 BTC were mined for the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4. This accumulation by institutions and ETF issuers represents almost six times the amount of the asset being produced since miners only generate 450 coins per day. The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery. Last week’s accumulation followed an increase in BTC spot prices in early May when the asset gained 4% to reach a six-week high of $97,700 on May 2. However, the asset has since retreated to the $94,000 level, which is the same price it traded at this time seven days ago. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows.

He said while public attention often centers around more prominent digital assets like XRP, Stellar’s quiet but strategic integrations are already shaping real-world infrastructure, particularly in financial aid, remittances, and cross-border payments. They don’t want you to know about Stellar. While everyone screams about $XRP , $XLM is quietly wiring the global financial grid. It’s not loud. It’s not trending. It’s not hyped. But it’s already embedded in the system. This thread will blow your mind. [THREAD] #XLM #Stellar pic.twitter.com/1tL3Y4wgJf — Stellar Expert (@StellarExpert) May 3, 2025 Real-World Implementation Through Partnerships The thread begins by pointing to Stellar’s ongoing collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This initiative uses blockchain to deliver cash aid in refugee zones, eliminating the need for traditional banks and ID verification systems. By enabling direct distribution of stablecoins, Stellar provides practical financial access to the unbanked. This demonstrates blockchain’s humanitarian potential and XLM’s role in replacing outdated systems with more efficient solutions. A major focus point is Stellar’s partnership with MoneyGram , which enables instant crypto-to-cash and cash-to-crypto conversions in over 180 countries. This infrastructure leverages USDC for settlement and does not depend on banks or intermediaries. According to Stellar Expert, “This is the Trojan Horse,” highlighting that decentralized financial rails are being used globally with minimal public recognition. Strategic Expansion Across Continents Stellar’s influence isn’t confined to aid and remittances. Stellar Expert revealed that the protocol has created access corridors that enable control over how funds move between regions in Africa, Asia, and South America. These corridors go beyond charity. They represent long-term positioning in the cross-border finance space. With control over remittance channels and off-ramp systems, XLM is embedding itself within core financial infrastructure across emerging markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ties to Institutions and Digital Asset Frameworks The thread also references institutional alignment. BlackRock, Circle, Stripe, and IMF-linked NGOs interact directly or indirectly with XLM’s ecosystem. Circle’s USDC, in particular, is expanding rapidly on the Stellar network. The post further notes that BlackRock’s digital asset initiatives are structurally compatible with XLM’s design. While none of these institutions publicly champion the asset, their quiet integration shows confidence in its utility and design, making it a competitive investment . Growth Metrics and Development Milestones Despite the lack of mainstream coverage, the crypto expert revealed that the ecosystem is far from dormant. It supports over 1.4 million trustlines and holds more than $300 million in USDC. The Soroban smart contract platform was a game-changer at launch, opening the door for more complex decentralized applications. XLM is being used in intergovernmental programs, further embedding it within global systems. Stellar Expert stated , “XLM isn’t designed for hype. It’s designed for quiet integration.” While the spotlight remains elsewhere, those paying attention are accumulating XLM as the network becomes increasingly foundational to real-world financial processes.

The rise to the local high of $97,895 attracted significant bearish attention, but the volume remains restricted within a range. This suggests the bulls remain passive but are offering enough support at $94,000 that may uplift the tokens within the bullish range in a short while from now. Breaking the $95,000 support range was assumed to drag the BTC price to $92,000, but the ongoing price action suggests massive strength of the bulls. Hence, a rebound seems inevitable! The Bitcoin price is known to fill the CME gaps, which have been formed around the current price levels. The lower gaps usually trigger a strong pullback, while the gaps at the upper levels push the token higher. However, the price faces a reversal after filling the gaps. The current trade set-up shows a gap on either side of the price, keeping the upcoming price action in an ambiguous state. Source: X Currently, two gaps have been formed close to the current price, one between $96,400 & $97,600 and the other between $92,500 & $91,700. If the bullish trend is in place, the BTC price may focus on filling in the lower gap first, which may be accompanied by a massive bullish rebound. This suggests the price could be primed to drop below $92,000, which could be the local bottom of the persisting pullback. Meanwhile, a volatile week ahead with FOMC and Coinbase earnings scheduled later this week. Therefore, if the price triggers a long trade, it may reach the local highs at $98,000, where we can see some LTF liquidations after a reclaim of the previous range highs. However, the BTC OBV daily trend remains bullish. Therefore, as long as this remains the case, the pullback may not be too deep. Hence, it would be interesting to watch which CME gap the Bitcoin price chooses to close first, as the price action that follows may be dependent on this.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 05:20:20

Right now, smart investors are circling four assets: Bitcoin , Solana , XRP , and the under-the-radar contender MAGACOINFINANCE . With early momentum building and the broader market gearing up for the next run, even a $480 placement today could be the key to something much larger tomorrow. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Strength Beneath the Surface Not every project needs a spotlight to grow. MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining traction where it matters most—on-chain activity, steady development, and meaningful community interaction. Wallet numbers are climbing. Updates are rolling out on time. And the buzz isn’t artificial—it’s real believers showing up early. The project’s disciplined rollout is a familiar pattern to those who’ve seen how the biggest crypto success stories often start. This is still the early window—and those catching it now are the ones history tends to remember. Key Players Supporting the Ecosystem: Ethereum, Chainlink, and Sei Ethereum remains the foundation of decentralized applications, and with continued scaling, its lead looks even more secure heading into 2025. Chainlink powers essential infrastructure for price feeds, data access, and cross-chain connectivity—positioning itself at the core of real-world blockchain utility. Sei is gaining developer traction fast, thanks to its trading-first architecture and ultra-fast execution layer built for performance-focused DeFi. Each of these is shaping the crypto landscape—but none are still in the early price discovery phase like MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Take In the crypto space, $480 has changed lives—if placed early in the right project. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP have already proven themselves. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare opportunity to act before full-scale recognition hits. The groundwork is being laid. The traction is measurable. And the potential? It’s still unfolding.

In an X post , the CEO of OKX Star Xu, also known as Mingxing Xu, said: “OKX DEX will restart today with a real-time abuse detecting and blocking system.” He went on to describe OKX Web3 as “the Chrome and search engine of the blockchain,” emphasizing that their deep understanding of on-chain data enables users to access real-time information across hundreds of blockchains, manage assets across multiple networks, and interact with millions of decentralized applications (dApps). OKX DEX reboots after Lazarus Group scandal The relaunch follows months of heightened scrutiny after the platform was linked to a $100 million laundering operation allegedly tied to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Now, the OKX DEX has real-time tools for identifying and blocking suspicious activity. The abuse detection system actively monitors on-chain behaviors across hundreds of supported blockchains, offering dynamic protection against laundering attempts and malicious smart contracts. OKX’s DEX facilitated one of the biggest money laundering cases in crypto history in March 2025. Hackers associated with the North Korean Lazarus Group used the DEX to launder about $100 million worth of ether. It was one of a spate of $1.5 billion thefts intended to target Bybit, a rival crypto exchange. Roughly 8% of the lifted crypto was transferred on OKX’s decentralized exchange, said Bybit’s chief executive officer Ben Zhou. The laundering process was played out using OKX’s Web3 proxy contracts, which can do transactions with blockchain services anonymously. As regulators around Europe began to investigate, the exchange halted its DEX services overnight on March 18, 2025. It then teamed with compliance professionals to comb through its vulnerabilities and update its systems. Now, the company claims its upgraded DEX aggregator has added online abuse protection, immediate IP banning, and real-time blacklist checking. Suspicious activity is monitored and closes in seconds, while the wallet addresses connected with hacks will automatically be blacklisted. The platform has been integrated with AML software outside of Japan as well. Authorities target OKX for a range of compliance failures The Lazarus Group incident is not the only thing that has bedeviled OKX this year. In April 2025, Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) imposed a fine of €1.1 million on OKX’s European branch , OKCoin Europe. The fine followed a quarterly audit from 2013 that found inadequate checks on privacy coins, stablecoins, and transactions with foreign virtual asset service providers. The regulators said that OKX had failed to identify and mitigate the risks of funds outside the European Union. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) commenced action in February 2025. OKX agreed to pay $505 million to resolve accusations that it ran an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Billions of dollars flowed through without sufficient checks, U.S. officials have said. These successive in-breaches would put more heat on OKX to overhaul its systems and rethink its global AML process. Amid the debate came word that the company would follow the EU’s MiCA regulations more closely. The exchange secured a regulatory license in Malta, where it planned to register, a key stop on the road to being able to operate lawfully in Europe. Experts laud OKX’s real-time detection system as a huge progress The relaunch of OKX is under scrutiny in the crypto industry. However, many experts believe the introduction of the real-time detection system marks significant progress. They note that the move sets a new bar for decentralized exchange platforms, proving that exchanges can continue to offer Web3 services while keeping criminals out. Yet some experts caution that there’s more work to be done. Lazarus and other hacking groups are still focused on decentralized tools, which avoid the ease of surveillance that comes with centralized exchanges. Others fear that even the best detection systems will not be enough to prevent future abuse. OKX, meanwhile, is moving forward. The exchange recently rolled out new U.S. services, such as a unified trading platform and a Web3 wallet.

""XRP and Bitcoin bounced back from the tariff shocks in April, but have yet to make a significant movement upwards,"" Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Investors may be overly cautious about risk assets such as crypto due to the current US macroeconomic climate, despite Bitcoin's trend breaking away from its correlation with US equities."" Major markets in Asia were closed on Monday, with Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan, and Korea closed, leading to thin liquidity and trading volumes. A potential thaw in U.S.–China trade relations dominated macro headlines. Over the weekend, China’s Commerce Ministry said it was reviewing a U.S. proposal to resume negotiations, while President Trump hinted Beijing “wanted to do a deal.” ""We remain optimistic that crypto prices will surge to new highs in the long term as institutional adoption continues to deepen with Real World Asset (RWA) launches and integrations with crypto-native platforms,"" Ruck added. Polymarket bettors are skeptical, however, with prediction markets giving a 21% chance that a trade deal will be reached by June, and a 47% chance the White House will lower tariffs by the end of May. Although details were vague on this potential trade deal, markets took notice. The Chinese yuan strengthened to a six-month high near ¥7.19, while regional currencies rallied. The standout mover was the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD), which surged to a two-year high around NT$29.6 per U.S. dollar as last week ended. The spike was driven by $1.4 billion (NT$42.9 billion) in foreign equity inflows and surging confidence in Taiwan’s tech sector after TSMC reported a 60% jump in quarterly profits. Taiwan’s central bank intervened to curb volatility but denied political pressure, calling the move market-driven. BTC range bound? Further compounding BTC's relative stagnation is that its encountering significant resistance as it tests key technical and on-chain levels, according to a recent report by Glassnode. Bitcoin is struggling to break through the $93,000–$95,000 range, an area aligned with both the short-term holder cost basis and the 111-day moving average, marking a crucial battleground for market momentum, the report argues. ""These levels represent a critical inflection point that must be upheld. Failure to stabilize above these levels would push the price back into the consolidation range, and return many investors to a state of meaningful unrealized loss,"" the report reads. However, above $100,000, there is less sell-side pressure due to a smaller volume of coins in that range. If bitcoin can overcome the resistance around $95,000-$98,000 it could enter a relatively clear path toward new price discovery and possibly a new all-time high, the report added.",Markets|btc|Bitcoin|BTC China|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-05 05:26:14

The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days . Joy Lam, Binance’s head of global regulatory and APAC legal, said the exchange has been consulting with Treasury officials since late 2023 about its proposed legislation, and it was now time for action. “Timing is really quite critical now because obviously it's something that has been discussed and kicked around for quite a few years,” she told Cointelegraph. Coinbase managing director for APAC John O’Loghlen said the reelected Albanese Government has the “opportunity and the responsibility to move quickly on this issue” and called for a Crypto-Asset Taskforce to be established within its first 100 days “with the aim of bringing forward legislation that protects consumers, promotes innovation, and stops the exodus of talent and capital to other markets.” Reelected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Source: Anthony Albanese BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler said that “beyond the political implications, this result sets the stage for meaningful progress in Australia’s approach to digital asset regulation.” Lam noted that the UK released its draft regulations last week , stablecoin bills are moving forward in the US, and the EU has already implemented its MiCA legislation. “So there's a very clear shift. Everyone's moving towards providing the regulatory framework that is needed for the industry to develop in a sustainable way. So time is really of the essence now.” Draft crypto legislation within months Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ office told Cointelegraph that exposure draft legislation would be released sometime this year for consultation, and any legislated reforms would be “phased in over time to minimize disruptions to existing businesses.” Although the Treasury has draft legislation on “regulating digital asset platforms” and “payments system modernization” scheduled for release by the end of June, Lam isn’t confident. ""I don't know whether this quarter specifically is still sort of the timeline,” she said. Related: Australian election will bring pro-crypto laws either way While the ALP has been attacked by some over not taking any action in its first term in government, that may actually have resulted in a better outcome than legislation that took its cues from the approach of Joe Biden’s administration, which took a hard line on banks dealing with cryptocurrency and viewed most coins as securities. Industry figures report a noticeable evolution in the government’s approach to crypto between when proposals were first put out for consultation at the end of 2023 and when the Treasury released its much more positive “ Statement on Developing an innovative Australian digital asset industry ” in March this year. Australia Votes running tally on the Australian election. Source: ABC The statement sets out key priorities, such as using the existing Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) regime to underpin the regulation of Digital Asset Platforms and payment stablecoins. It’s focused on the safe custody of client assets by centralized providers and sidesteps issues around decentralized finance platforms . Lam welcomed the use of the AFSL regime. “Obviously, we don't need to reinvent the wheel,” she said. “It’s something that people know and understand. It's a pretty sensible move, and it’s also going to be much easier for regulators.” Tokenization and sandbox The government will also review the Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox, which aims to provide space for innovative digital asset startups to grow free of red tape. The statement also highlights opportunities with tokenization. Lam said the change in emphasis showed the government has been listening to the industry. “It reflects the industry feedback that they would have received in 2023 as a result of the consultation, as well as the changing landscape because obviously it’s been evolving pretty quickly internationally,” Lam said. “They do have the benefit now of looking at what has worked and hasn’t worked in other jurisdictions, and really building on those lessons.” Dea Markovy, policy director at Fireblocks, told Cointelegraph that “a lot of the groundwork and research is done” and it was looking broadly positive. “Of course, a lot of details are still to come around Australia’s Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs) regime. What is significant here is the willingness of the Government to cut through the complexity and uncertainty on crypto intermediaries licensing.” The securities regulator ASIC released its own crypto regulations proposals ( INFO 225 ) in December, and feedback from those consultations will help inform the government's new legislation. “In essence, it details how different token issuances and crypto intermediation will fit into Australia’s existing securities legislation, providing for a transition period,"" explained Markovy. The draft guidance suggests NFTs, in-game assets and memecoins are not financial products — the local equivalent of a “security” — while a yield-bearing stablecoin or a gold-backed token probably are. The Treasury statement also highlighted issues with debanking. Lam said that simply regulating the industry would go a long way toward solving the issue. “What we really want from governments and regulators is that clean licensing framework, because that goes a long way to mitigating the risk and giving the banks the comfort that they need,” she said. “And then, there’s probably going to need to be some additional guidance given to banks.” Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-05 05:32:12

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin ( BTC ) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010. The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim. Like Andresen’s old website, Shrem’s page explains what Bitcoin is and how to receive Bitcoin.

It’s a lot of fun.” Vibe coding relies on artificial intelligence and prompting to write code. Source: Charlie Shrem Bitcoin faucets assisted Bitcoin adoption in the early days Bitcoin faucets were key in spreading awareness about the cryptocurrency and facilitating its adoption in the early 2010s. Andresen’s Bitcoin Faucet page handed out 19,700 Bitcoin — now worth $1.86 billion — for solving CAPTCHAs. Users could earn up to 5 Bitcoin per day from Andresen’s page. The Bitcoin faucets encouraged wallet creation and transactions, which assisted with the expansion of Bitcoin’s user base and network activity. Other websites such as FreeBitco.in started offering similar services between 2011 and 2013. But as Bitcoin’s price increased and transaction fees rose, rewards shrank, and the model eventually became unsustainable. Shrem’s crypto journey has been a rollercoaster Shrem co-founded one of the first Bitcoin exchanges, BitInstant, with Gareth Nelson in 2011. At its peak, the exchange facilitated around 30% of all Bitcoin transactions, according to Shrem’s personal page. In order to offer the instant Bitcoin purchases that Bitcoin’s first dominant exchange, Mt. Gox, lacked, BitInstant purchased Bitcoin from Mt. Gox in large batches before reselling it to customers nearly instantly. However, BitInstant’s business model faced scaling issues as its transaction volume grew. To support its expansion, the company received $100,000 from early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, with additional backing later coming from Erik Voorhees and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. BitInstant co-founders Gareth Nelson (left) and Charlie Shrem (right) pictured together at an industry event. Source: Charlieshrem.com Shrem also co-founded the Bitcoin Foundation in 2012, serving as vice chairman to encourage the adoption of Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional banking. However, on Jan. 26, 2014, Shrem was arrested while attempting to disembark from a plane in New York and later charged with money laundering related to his role with BitInstant. Authorities claimed that some BitInstant customers used the Bitcoin purchased from BitInstant for illicit purposes, including criminal transactions on the Silk Road dark web marketplace. Shrem pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served one year before being released in 2016. Related: Bitcoin eyes $95K retest as traders brace for Fed rate cut volatility After prison, Shrem returned to the crypto space, founding crypto advisory firm CryptoIQ and Druid Ventures, a $13 million crypto-focused venture capital fund. He also launched The Charlie Shrem Show, a podcast with over 400 episodes featuring some of the industry's most notable crypto figures. Shrem was then sued by the Winklevoss twins in 2018, claiming Shrem stole 5,000 Bitcoin from them in 2012. A court overturned an asset freeze against Shrem and ordered the brothers to cover Shrem’s legal fees in November 2018. The case was settled confidentially in 2019.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but saw sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|VET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-05 05:40:00

Analysts see potential for a rally toward $205–$250 , especially if resistance at $150 is broken. With high NFT activity, strong validator growth, and speculation around ETF approval building again, Solana remains a formidable contender. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP Are Reinforcing Market Confidence Ethereum , trading near $1,736 , is leading in both utility and ecosystem growth. With whale accumulation rising and more AI and data protocols deploying on its base layer, ETH could test $2,500–$2,700 in Q2. XRP , priced around $2.15 , is holding strong as futures ETFs drive institutional flows. A move above the $2.45 resistance could trigger a sharp rally. With CME Group’s futures listing imminent, XRP’s momentum remains one of the most compelling narratives this quarter. Aptos (APT): A Quiet Technological Climber APT has remained steady near $4.71 , backed by higher TVL and institutional partnerships. As a secure Layer-1 with enterprise appeal, Aptos is starting to stand out for its technical consistency. Analysts see an opportunity if APT closes above $5.10 with volume. Final Thoughts Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Aptos are clearly leading in terms of structure and ecosystem power. But MAGACOINFINANCE is bringing something different to the table—early momentum, viral narrative strength, and community expansion that could set the stage for a major breakout in 2025.

OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said in a May 4 statement to X that the DEX aggregator, OKX Web3, will resume with several new features, including a “real-time abuse detecting and blocking system.” A DEX aggregator is a service that pulls data from multiple decentralized exchanges and market makers and then presents it to users to assist with trading. Xu says, “OKX Web3 is a browser and search engine for blockchain.” Source: Star Xu At the same time, OKX said in a May 4 statement that the latest upgrade includes other new security measures to identify suspicious or fraudulent onchain activity from hackers and other bad actors. “Our dynamic database of suspect addresses blocks hackers and bad actors real-time, while proactive alerts warn you about risky transactions,” the exchange said. “We’re audited and verified by leading blockchain security firms like CertiK, Hacken and SlowMist, and infrastructure tested through our bug bounty program.” Another feature added to the onchain analysis tool categorizes wallet holders by identifying them as possible whales or snipers. OKX paused DEX aggregator after hackers misused DeFi services OKX said on March 17 that it temporarily paused its DEX aggregator to prevent “further misuse” by North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group, promising upgrades to stave off a repeat of the incident. The exchange also said at the time it was developing a hacker address system that would track bad actors’ latest addresses and block them. Bloomberg alleged in a March 11 report that European Union financial watchdogs were investigating the firm’s DEX aggregator and its wallet services for an alleged role in laundering funds from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack in February. Related: OKX reenters US market following $505M DOJ settlement OKX responded the same day, arguing that Bloomberg was mistaken because the self-custody wallet service swap feature serves as an aggregator and is not a custodian of customer assets. Other crypto services have also been caught up in the Lazarus Group’s hack. Crypto exchange eXch announced it ceased operations on May 1 after reports alleged the firm was used to launder funds from the hack. The exchange initially denied reports from crypto sleuths suggesting that it had laundered digital assets for the Lazarus Group. However, it later admitted to processing some funds from the February hack.

Optimism picked up a little last week as stock and crypto markets made gains as tariff concerns eased slightly. However, the unexpected Q1 GDP contraction shook market sentiment. This appears to be the result of companies front-loading orders ahead of anticipated tariffs. It was also reported that President Trump has no plans to speak with China’s President Xi this week. In a potential escalation of trade tensions, Trump said that Beijing is “ripping us off” and Chinese and US officials are talking about “different things.” Economic Events May 5 to 9 Consumer sentiment also fell in April for the fourth month in a row.

As of May 5, the SEC’s designated deadline for a decision, Canary’s Capital application has not been delayed. Unlike other crypto-related filings which have seen multiple delays, this raises speculation about a potential early response. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted the unusual timing in a May 5 post on X, highlighting that the SEC has already moved to delay several filings but not this one. “If any asset has a chance of early approval, it’s Litecoin,” he said, though he still considers a delay more likely.

The SEC, under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda officially acknowledged the filing on Jan. 29, starting the formal review process. This step was a key turning point, as past attempts to launch ETFs tied to smaller cryptocurrencies had been discouraged under previous SEC leadership. As of May 5, Litecoin is trading at about $87, with slight increases of 0.9% over the previous day and almost 10% over the previous two weeks. The daily chart shows a steady recovery from April lows, with the price holding above the 50-day moving average at $82.87.

The post called out some online community members for clinging to speculative narratives, unrealistic price targets, and what he described as immature expectations around XRP market movements. Van Code criticized some holders who expect announcements or external triggers to drive immediate and significant price increases. He emphasized that XRP’s long-term value will be driven by demand and utility rather than sudden market events or speculative hype. The engineer dismissed the recurring discourse among certain users about XRP reaching prices as high as $1,000 , characterizing such discussions as detached from economic reality. He encouraged a disciplined approach centered on gradual progress and the broader goal of systemic integration over time. Users Highlight Global Transition Narratives and Delays Reactions to Van Code’s post highlighted a wide range of perspectives from the community. Some users agreed on the need for patience, while others brought forward more complex interpretations of the current state of the XRP ecosystem. One notable response came from a user identifying as AION, who provided a detailed viewpoint aligning XRP’s delayed price movement with what they described as a global systemic transition. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This perspective framed Ripple and XRP as part of a coordinated effort to replace entrenched legacy systems across various industries. AION argued that progress has been methodical and constrained by the need for synchronization among multiple facets of a larger operation. According to their view, XRP has not surged in value not due to internal issues but because it has been awaiting alignment with other parts of a multi-layered process. AION expressed confidence that Ripple’s legal clarity, achieved through the ruling that XRP is not a security in the U.S., was a key milestone indicating readiness. However, they also suggested that external delays tied to global financial restructuring were the true cause of stagnation. They predicted that once these constraints are resolved, the price would rise sharply, potentially leading to temporary exchange closures. AION also reiterated a belief that a broader event, possibly framed as a crisis, could catalyze a full-scale transition into a new financial framework. Community Pushes Back Against Monetized Misinformation Other users responded with concern over the role of misinformation in shaping community expectations. One such comment came from a user known as ClubXbox, who pointed out the monetization of misleading content across video and social media platforms. They attributed the endurance of speculative narratives to platforms that reward engagement regardless of accuracy, leading to a persistent cycle of unrealistic projections. The exchange reflected a broader divide in sentiment. Some community members remain deeply committed to believing in XRP’s role in a much larger financial transformation. However, others echoed Van Code’s call for realism, caution, and a more measured approach based on long-term development. While debates over price potential and timelines continue, Van Code’s message reinforces a consistent theme within the infrastructure-focused segment of the community: that lasting success will be earned through integration, adoption, and sustained progress, not through short-term excitement or internet-driven speculation.

The Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act would have used seized assets for crypto investments, but Hobbs rejected it. Critics like Jameson Lopp, Anthony Pompliano, and Senator Wendy Rogers slammed the move. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes doubts the US will expand its Bitcoin reserves due to fiscal constraints and political optics. In contrast, Strategy continues its aggressive accumulation, and recently bought over 15,000 BTC. Founder Michael Saylor signaled even more purchases despite mixed quarterly results. Arizona Shuts Down Bitcoin Reserve Plan Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs attracted some criticism from Bitcoin advocates and government officials after vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to invest in Bitcoin as part of its official reserves. The vetoed legislation, which is known as the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, would have permitted state officials to manage a Bitcoin reserve funded by seized assets. The decision caused a lot of backlash on social media. Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp predicted that the move “will age poorly,” and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano accused Hobbs of lacking the foresight to invest in Bitcoin, calling the veto “ignorant.” Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon and Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers , who co-sponsored the bill with State Representative Jeff Weninger, also expressed their disappointment. Rogers argued that Arizona needs Bitcoin more than Bitcoin needs Arizona and pointed out the irony that the state retirement system already holds shares in Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR), which she called “basically a leveraged Bitcoin ETF.” Despite the setback, Rogers pledged to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session. Governor Hobbs defended her decision by citing the sound and informed investment strategies of the Arizona State Retirement System, which she praised as one of the strongest in the country. On the opposing end, long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff supported Hobbs, and stated that government entities should not use public funds to speculate on cryptocurrencies. Had it passed, Arizona would have been the first US state to officially create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. So far, similar proposals were also shut down in states like Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Arthur Hayes Doubts US Bitcoin Expansion While some US states are moving away from Bitcoin, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also believes the United States is unlikely to expand its Bitcoin reserves beyond the roughly 200,000 BTC it already seized, due to the country’s ballooning deficit and the perception of Bitcoin culture. In a May 1 interview , Hayes dismissed the idea of a formal US strategic Bitcoin reserve, and argued that no “properly elected” official would openly endorse printing money to buy Bitcoin, especially given the association with “Bitcoin bros going to the club.” His comments were made despite President Donald Trump’s executive order on March 6 to establish a strategic Bitcoin and digital asset reserve, Current US government holdings are valued at over $18 billion, primarily sourced from assets confiscated in criminal cases like the Silk Road and Bitfinex hacks. Hayes’ skepticism is very different from the views of other crypto industry leaders who believe a US move to buy Bitcoin could trigger a global scramble for the digital asset. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch, suggested that if the US begins buying Bitcoin aggressively, it could cause a ripple effect where other nations rush to secure their own reserves. This could potentially make Bitcoin even harder to acquire. Beyond geopolitics, Hayes also shared his market outlook, and predicted that Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market will climb back to 70%. This is a level it reached before the 2021 altcoin season. Bitcoin dominance chart (Source: CoinMarketCap ) He argued that the traditional cycle of capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins will continue, although he acknowledged that outperformance will depend heavily on the specific assets investors choose. Currently, Bitcoin dominance stands at 63%, which is up from just under 60% at the start of the year. This is a major shift despite doubts from analysts like Benjamin Cowen and Ki Young Ju. Cowen has said he doesn’t expect Bitcoin dominance to return to 70%, while Ju believes the old model of altcoin season driven by BTC-to-altcoin rotation is outdated, with trading volume now favoring stablecoin and fiat pairs. Strategy Eyes More Bitcoin Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has no plans of stepping away from Bitcoin, and once again signaled another potential Bitcoin purchase. This will be the company’s fourth consecutive week of accumulation. This sustained buying spree proves why Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and one of the most influential institutions driving adoption of the digital asset at a treasury level. The company’s most recent acquisition took place on April 28, when it purchased 15,355 BTC for over $1.4 billion. This transaction brought its total holdings to a staggering 553,555 BTC. According to SaylorTracker , the company is currently up approximately 39% on its total Bitcoin investment, with over $15 billion in unrealized gains. These figures kept Strategy at the center of institutional Bitcoin adoption conversations, not just for holding Bitcoin directly but also for influencing exposure through institutional investors who hold shares in Strategy’s publicly traded stock. Despite its impressive Bitcoin performance, Strategy reported mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Revenue came in at around $111 million, which is a 3.6% year-over-year decline and fell short of analyst expectations by 5%. However, the company's aggressive Bitcoin strategy stayed unaffected. In total, Strategy acquired 61,497 BTC in 2025 alone and unveiled plans to raise an additional $21 billion via an equity offering to fund more purchases. Some industry analysts believe the company’s next move could be even more ambitious. Asset manager Richard Byworth proposed that Strategy should consider acquiring companies with large cash reserves and then converting those reserves into Bitcoin. He also explained that Strategy could choose to purchase Bitcoin directly on exchanges rather than through over-the-counter (OTC) deals. This approach will reduce available liquidity on the open market, which could potentially drive up prices and further increase the value of Strategy’s holdings. As a result, this could trigger additional institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin analyst and author Adam Livingston agreed with these sentiments, and said that Strategy’s accumulation pace is dramatically outpacing Bitcoin’s daily supply. According to Livingston, Strategy is buying an average of 2,087 BTC per day. This is over four times the approximate 450 BTC that miners collectively produce daily. He argued that this buying pressure is effectively creating a synthetic halving, tightening supply and increasing scarcity far beyond the built-in halving schedule. This dynamic could fuel long-term price appreciation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-05 05:53:42

The planned investment would exceed the Maldives’ annual GDP of around $7 billion , the Financial Times reported. The deal, which was signed on May 4 , comes from MBS Global Investments, that manages assets worth approximately $14bn. The investment firm aims to finance the Maldives investment by tapping high-net-worth individuals and its family office network to form a consortium. The project is due to be completed by 2030, an official release noted. Further, the blockchain hub aims to attract global financial institutions, fintech pioneers, and global digital Nomads. Financial Freezone Aims to Triple Maldives’ GDP in 4 Years Per the masterplan, the planned financial hub aims to triple the Maldives’ GDP within four years. It is also projected to generate over $1 billion in revenue by the fifth year, the FT report read. Maldives Finance Minister Moosa Zameer said that the nation needs to “take the leap” to expand from tourism and fisheries. The country’s debt in the next two years is “the biggest challenge that we have,” he told the publication. “[The investment] is something we see as a potential contributor to bring us out of certain difficulties that we are in.” What Does MIFC Offer? Dubbed the Maldives International Financial Centre (MIFC), the financial freezone in the capital city will provide a corporate tax-free zone. Additionally, there are no residency requirements for entrepreneurs, making it an attractive destination for global digital nomads. The MIFC would have a state-of-the-art conference premise with a capacity for 3,500 people, the website noted. “The multi-purpose convention venue will host leading global conferences, cultural events and innovation-driven hackathons, establishing Male as a leading assembly hub,” the release added. “The financial centre will be a symbol of economic resilience and will set a new global benchmark that will massively benefit the people of the Maldives for generations to come,” President Dr Mohamed Muizzu said. Besides, the plan would have residential and office towers and offer a fully climate-resilient infrastructure. These will be “powered exclusively by renewable energy,” Nadeem Hussain, CEO of MBS Global Investments noted. Also, the phased project would be funded through equity and debt, and commitments worth between $4 billion and $5 billion have already been secured, Hussain added.

The denial came two days after Kato appeared on national television suggesting the holdings could be used as a negotiation card. He clarified the remarks after reporters pressed him for a clearer stance on the government’s position. Speaking at a press conference, Kato explained that his earlier comments were in response to a question asking whether Japan could offer reassurance to Washington by promising not to offload its Treasury holdings easily. “My comments were made in response to a question whether Japan could, as a bargaining tool in trade negotiations, explicitly reassure Washington it wouldn’t sell its Treasury holdings easily,” Kato said . “The comments weren’t meant to suggest selling Treasury holdings.” In Friday’s interview, Kato had said that Japan’s US Treasury holdings, which is the largest in the world, could be used as a “card” in trade negotiations, as Cryptopolitan reported . That was the first time any official from Japan openly acknowledged the country’s massive debt position as a potential form of leverage against the US However, when questioned again on Sunday, Kato stressed, “Whether Japan actually uses that card is a different question.” BOJ delays rate hikes as Trump tariffs pressure Japan’s fragile recovery Kato also repeated that the primary role of those US Treasury holdings is to give the government enough foreign currency to stabilize the yen when needed. “This has been our stance,” he said, “and we don’t plan to use sale of US Treasury holdings as a bargaining tool in the negotiations.” The comment sought to reverse speculation triggered by the interview, which briefly raised alarms across global bond markets. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is facing its biggest test since Governor Kazuo Ueda took charge two years ago. On Thursday, the BOJ left short-term interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, despite earlier plans to tighten policy. The decision followed renewed trade pressure from US President Donald Trump, whose fresh tariffs have complicated Japan’s already-fragile economic outlook. During the post-meeting briefing, Ueda said the timeline for underlying inflation to reach the central bank’s 2% target has been “pushed back somewhat.” That line signaled that the BOJ would delay further rate increases, at least until it assesses the full impact of the new tariffs. Still, inflation risks remain. Food prices continue to rise, wage hikes are expected to persist, and the yen remains under threat of further weakening. All three factors are giving the BOJ little room to fully walk away from its plan to raise rates. Akira Otani, former senior economist at the BOJ and now managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan, said raising interest rates under current conditions would be a major risk. “The worst scenario for the BOJ is to end up further delaying achievement of 2% inflation by proceeding with rate hikes amid high uncertainty,” he said. Otani has moved his forecast for the next rate increase back by six months, expecting the BOJ to act only in January. Goldman Sachs still expects the BOJ to reach a 1.5% policy rate during the current cycle. On Thursday, the BOJ also released its new economic outlook. The central bank expects Japan’s economy to grow just barely above potential this year. It also revised its inflation forecast downward and described the risk to the economy as “skewed to the downside.” That phrasing shows the BOJ is less confident that price growth will continue. Still, Ueda told reporters the bank remains committed to raising rates once conditions improve. He admitted, though, that there’s “extremely high uncertainty” around the path ahead. For the past thirty years, Japan has failed to lift short-term interest rates above 0.5%. Every time the central bank tried to move toward policy normalization, it ran into problems—whether from weak wage growth or global economic shocks. The repeated failures have kept the country stuck in a cycle of ultra-loose policy. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday that China was interested in a deal, though he offered no details or timeline.

Meanwhile, trading activity is expected to remain subdued on Monday due to a public holiday in Japan. China ( SHCOMP ) market closed, the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.20 per dollar, extending gains to a six-month high despite the holiday in the mainland, lifted by a weaker greenback.

Bitcoin price slashed below $94,000 and seems to be ready for a quick bounce , which may shake up the markets. As Bitcoin consolidated, the top 10 tokens like Ethereum, XRP, BinanceCoin, Cardano, etc., also followed a similar trend and remained glued below their respective resistance levels. Meanwhile, some altcoins display strength, indicating a notable shift in the market sentiment. Top Gainers for the Day As Bitcoin began to consolidate, the top altcoins also followed the same trend; meanwhile, some of them worked hard to maintain a strong ascending trend. Core (CORE) price remained the top gainer with nearly 13% profits. With over 133 integrations, the CORE platform is swelling every day. The next is Walrus (WAL), which has surged by over 10% gains after being the top loser during the past weekend. Meanwhile, Flare (FLR), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), & Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) attracted decent gains, followed by Bonk (BONK) & Sui (SUI). Top Loser for the Day The markets are experiencing a corrective phase, where the bears have begun to extract profits from the token that remained bullish in the past few days. With an over 8% plunge, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) price leads, followed by Sonic (prev. FTM S) and BitTorrent (BTT) with a 3% to 4% pullback. However, the loss remained restrictive between 2% and 3% with the other altcoins like Stacks (STX), Render (RNDR), Near Protocol (NEAR), Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). This suggests the overall market sentiment remains bullish, and hence, a strong rebound could be imminent. Regardless of the profit and losses, the community sentiments are extremely bullish on Kaspa (KAS), Cardano (ADA), Pi (PI) and XRP (XRP). The investors foresee a strong ascending trend for these altcoins, probably when Bitcoin’s price displays some strength and revives a rise back above $96,000. Therefore, the crypto market prediction for today remains neutral, with the top token maintaining a range-bound consolidation, compelling the top altcoins to follow the trend, while some may thrive with decent gains.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|XRP|CORE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 06:01:30

This time, four names are rising to the top of investor radars: MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP . With sentiment shifting and the market heating up, early entries into these assets could deliver transformational upside. But windows like this rarely stay open for long. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Accelerating With Real-World Traction Momentum doesn’t start with hype—it starts with proof. And MAGACOINFINANCE is stacking real progress fast: rising wallet activity, consistent roadmap progress, and community growth that’s authentic and investor-driven. There’s no flash, no gimmicks—just measured growth and recognition from those who’ve seen breakout cycles before. If early signs hold, MAGACOINFINANCE may soon move from quietly building to dominating headlines. Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP Continue to Lead the Charge Bitcoin (BTC) still serves as crypto’s core anchor, and ETF tailwinds are giving it new exposure. Solana (SOL) is pushing deeper into real-world applications—from tokenization to NFTs—with growing developer support and high-speed architecture. XRP is finally operating without legal overhang, expanding into financial markets with renewed energy and momentum. These giants offer proven resilience—but for investors seeking asymmetrical opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE remains at the center of the early-stage conversation. More Movers to Watch: Polygon, Kaspa, and Others Polygon continues to lead Ethereum’s scaling frontier, onboarding major brands and scaling dApps with ease. Kaspa is gaining a loyal following for its efficient proof-of-work design and unique DAG structure—solving speed and scale simultaneously. These are meaningful ecosystem players—but they’ve largely passed their early discovery windows. MAGACOINFINANCE , in contrast, is still in its prime entry phase. Summary The next wave of crypto wealth will come from those who are positioned ahead of the headlines. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP remain pillars—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be the overlooked asset setting up for the kind of 60,000+% run that changes everything. If you’re watching the market, don’t wait for confirmation. Look for momentum. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing all the right signals.

The U.S. SEC is set to review over 70 crypto ETF applications this year. This comes after the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, which made way for altcoin ETFs. Analysts believe the SEC may approve spot ETFs for altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin in the coming months, with decisions starting as early as July 2, 2025. Decisions for ETFs like SOL, DOGE, XRP, and ADA are expected around October, with other ETF rulings to follow in November and December. Litecoin ETF Decision By May 5? The SEC is set to rule on the Canary Funds’ Litecoin ETF by May 5. Unlike other crypto ETF filings, this one has not been delayed yet. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, believes that Litecoin may have a better chance of early approval than other assets, although he still thinks a delay is more likely. The @CanaryFunds Litecoin ETF filing is due for a decision (possibly a delay) by Monday 5/5. SEC went early & delayed a bunch of filings but not this. If any asset has a chance of early approval it's Litecoin IMO. Personally think a delay is more likely but def something to watch pic.twitter.com/FilnUcMtUH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 4, 2025 Analysts pointed out that Litecoin ETF’s approval could be the easiest since its S-1 and 19b-4 forms have already been filed and accepted. Additionally, the SEC likely sees Litecoin as a commodity. Other Litecoin ETFs currently under review are from Grayscale and CoinShares. The SEC has until October to decide on them. According to Bloomberg analysts, Litecoin has the highest chance of approval, with a 90% likelihood. 75% Chances of Altcoin ETFs Approval Bloomberg analysts believe there’s a 75% or higher chance that the SEC will approve several spot altcoin ETFs before the end of 2025. Seyffart had previously said that more crypto ETFs will be proposed as the issuers will try to see what works out. However, the ones that fail to attract interest or investment will be liquidated. The outlook for altcoin ETFs has changed after Paul Atkins became SEC Chair. He stated the crypto industry has been “stifled” and the regulatory framework “badly needs attention.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 06:07:30

Billionaire Crypto Bull Arthur Hayes Answers,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-us-buy-bitcoin-is-the-altcoin-season-coming-billionaire-crypto-bull-arthur-hayes-answers/,"BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that the United States is unlikely to significantly increase its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves due to its rising national debt and cultural perceptions towards Bitcoin investors. Speaking in an interview, Hayes expressed skepticism about the idea of the US creating a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” beyond its current holdings of around 200,000 BTC, which are largely comprised of seized cryptocurrencies from cases like Silk Road and Bitfinex. “The United States is a deficit country,” said Hayes, adding, “The only way to establish a Strategic Reserve is to not sell the Bitcoins they seized. Okay, that makes 200 thousand BTC.” Related News: Bad News for Bitcoin (BTC) from Arizona: It Would Have Been a First in History Reminding that the US government officially owns more than 198 thousand BTC and the value of these assets exceeds $ 18 billion, Hayes argued that increasing the reserve through direct Bitcoin purchases is politically unrealistic. Hayes said it was difficult for any “decent elected official” to advocate for printing money and buying BTC, which he noted contradicted the public perception of Bitcoin. On the market side, Hayes reiterated that he expects Bitcoin’s market dominance to return to pre-2021 levels, around 70%, which he said points to altcoin rallies following classic Bitcoin bull markets. “Bitcoin is back at all-time highs; the bull market is back and altcoins should outperform,” Hayes said, adding, “The word should is important here.

In a wide-ranging interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News’ Meet the Press released on May 4, Trump said he was “not profiting from anything” when asked to respond to critics who said he’s profiting from the presidency through the memecoin. “So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump. “I haven’t even looked,” Trump admitted. “But I’ll tell you what. Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.” Trump launched his memecoin , Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 17, which hit a peak of $73.43 two days later, just a day before he was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, according to CoinGecko. The token has been in a steady decline since launch, but it surged late last month after its website offered top holders a chance to dine with Trump on May 22. It's currently trading at $11.35, down nearly 85% from its peak. Trump was apparently unaware of his token’s recent surge, repeatedly asking how much it was now worth. Two companies, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of Trump’s sprawling Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is co-owned by CIC Digital, together own 80% of the token’s total 1 billion supply. Most of those tokens are locked up and will be released over the next three years. The first unlock on April 18 saw 40 million tokens, worth $454 million, go to CIC Digital. Trump-controlled entities own 80% of the TRUMP token supply, which will be released periodically until 2028. Source: Trump Meme Trump’s memecoin project has made at least $350 million so far, according to a March analysis from the Financial Times, which found those behind the token made $314 million from selling them and $36 million from fees. Trump has been criticized over his many crypto dealings , which his opponents say are a conflict of interest as he looks to unburden the sector from regulators. Even those in his own party, Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Lisa Murkowski, have criticized Trump’s dinner offer to his top tokenholders. Trump said during the interview that he would contribute his presidential salary “back to the government,” prompting Welker to ask if he would also contribute any potential crypto earnings. “I never thought of that,” Trump answered. “I mean, should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so.” Trump reiterates crypto commitment In a part of the interview, Trump made a meandering statement that reiterated his campaign promise to support crypto. “I want crypto. I think crypto’s important because if we don’t do it, China’s going to. And it’s new, it’s very popular, it’s very hot,” he said. Trump claimed former President Joe Biden “went after it violently, and then, before the election, he changed his tune entirely” to garner the crypto vote. Biden did not run against Trump in the last election, instead handing the baton to then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Related: Trump’s first 100 days ‘worst in history’ despite crypto promises The president again made his point when speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn on May 4. CBS News’ Jennifer Jacobs reported on X that Trump said “crypto is very important,"" and wanted “to keep it away from China.” He claimed China “will take it over, just like AI, just like so many other industries, or whatever you want to call them.” Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-05 06:11:28

The relaunch includes a suite of enhanced security upgrades designed to prevent further exploitation by malicious actors. In a May 4 post on X (formerly Twitter), OKX founder and CEO Star Xu announced the return of the service with “a real-time abuse detecting and blocking system.” OKX CEO Calls Web3 Platform a ‘Blockchain Search Engine’ for Smarter DEX Trading Xu described OKX Web3 as a “browser and search engine for blockchain,” offering users aggregated data from multiple decentralized exchanges and market makers to facilitate more efficient trading. The newly deployed upgrades go beyond simple detection tools. OKX stated that it now operates a “dynamic database of suspect addresses” that actively blocks known hacker activity in real time. The platform also issues proactive warnings to users when a potentially risky transaction is identified. To bolster its credibility, OKX emphasized that its systems have been audited by leading blockchain security firms including CertiK, Hacken, and SlowMist. The platform has also undergone stress testing through an ongoing bug bounty program. Among the new features is an improved on-chain analysis tool that categorizes wallet holders, identifying patterns that may suggest whale activity or sniper trading strategies. This intelligence layer is part of a broader effort to enhance transparency and security within its decentralized ecosystem. OKX DEX will restart today with realtime abuse detecting and blocking system. OKX Web3 is Chrome and search engine to blockchain. Base on our understanding of onchain data, we help customers access to hundreds chains realtime data, manage multiple chains’ asset and engage with… — Star (@star_okx) May 5, 2025 Back on March 17, OKX announced it had paused its DEX aggregator amid concerns that the Lazarus Group had been exploiting it to move illicit funds. The company promised to roll out upgrades to prevent further misuse, including a system to track and block addresses associated with hackers. The incident drew increased scrutiny, especially after a March 11 Bloomberg report suggested European Union regulators were investigating OKX’s DEX aggregator for its potential involvement in laundering funds from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack in February. OKX denied those claims, clarifying that its wallet service is non-custodial and functions solely as a swap aggregator. Other crypto platforms have also been impacted by the Lazarus Group. On May 1, crypto exchange eXch shut down operations after acknowledging it had processed some funds linked to the February hack—despite earlier denials. OKX CEO Defends Exchange Amid Justin Sun Freeze Dispute Over the weekend, OKX CEO Star Xu responded to accusations from Tron founder Justin Sun, who claimed the exchange failed to act on a law enforcement request to freeze stolen funds linked to a hack of Tron’s official X account. Sun alleged that OKX ignored a “freeze notice” from law enforcement following the May 3 breach, during which Tron’s X account was compromised. The attacker reportedly posted a malicious smart contract address, sent direct messages, and engaged with unfamiliar accounts. Star Xu dismissed the allegations. “OKX has a consumer protection policy governed by law.” The post OKX to Relaunch DEX Aggregator After Lazarus Group Attack, Adds Security Upgrades appeared first on Cryptonews .",DeFi News|DEX|OKX|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-05 07:15:11

According to the tweet, Australians can purchase XRP directly from an ATM. The message was delivered in an emphatic tone: “JUST IN. Australians can now buy #XRP straight from an ATM. We need this worldwide.” The post included a video of a CoinFlip-branded cryptocurrency ATM situated in a retail setting. These ATMs are known for enabling crypto transactions with physical cash, and this specific unit offers support for purchasing digital assets such as XRP . JUST IN AUSTRALIANS CAN NOW BUY #XRP STRAIGHT FROM AN ATM WE NEED THIS WORLDWIDE #XRPHolders pic.twitter.com/GYNenMn3H6 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) May 1, 2025 BULLRUNNERS’ call for global adoption reflects a broader sentiment in the crypto community for improved and more direct access to digital assets. CoinFlip’s Expansion and Support for XRP CoinFlip, the company referenced in the tweet, is a U.S.-based provider of cryptocurrency ATMs that began operating in Australia in 2022. Originally focused on Bitcoin, the company has expanded its list of supported assets to include other major cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The ATM model shown in the image appears to support this expanded functionality, enabling users to buy XRP with physical cash. These developments aim to bridge the gap between traditional fiat infrastructure and the digital asset ecosystem. For many users, such physical access points provide a practical alternative, especially those without easy access to online exchanges or digital banking services. Mixed Reactions from the Online Community Despite the excitement in BULLRUNNERS’ post, some users responded by clarifying that CoinFlip ATMs have been in Australia for some time. A user known as Crypto Coaster commented , “Lol. They are called; Coinflip BTC ATM’s. BTC ATM in Aus since 2014! Coinflip ATM since Aug 2024. This is not new news. Neither is this video!” This suggests that while the ability to buy XRP may be relatively recent, the ATMs themselves and the service infrastructure have been in place for years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, White Rabbit, questioned the relevance of physical ATMs in today’s digital environment. “Why when you can buy crypto using your phone. $129 billion market cap producing absolutely nothing,” the comment read. White Rabbit’s critique points to a broader debate over the necessity of ATM-based crypto access in a world increasingly dominated by mobile applications. Accessibility vs. Digital Efficiency While mobile-based crypto purchases are the norm for many users, physical ATMs still serve a unique demographic. For individuals who prefer or require the anonymity of cash transactions or may be excluded from traditional banking systems, these machines offer a viable entry point into the digital asset world. Questions remain about their cost efficiency, convenience, and relevance in high-speed digital economies. Fees at crypto ATMs are often higher than those charged by online exchanges, and the machines may not offer the same range of services. A Push for Global Access to XRP Though the capability to buy XRP from CoinFlip ATMs in Australia may not be brand new, BULLRUNNERS’ tweet brings renewed attention to the importance of widening access to crypto assets. For some users, the physical presence of such machines is essential. For others, the focus remains on improving digital solutions. As the crypto sector continues to expand, the ongoing debate over how best to enable secure, accessible, and convenient access to assets like XRP is unlikely to fade.

This simplicity has lots of benefits, and they should be brought to Ethereum, he added. Simplifying Ethereum Key benefits of simplifying Ethereum include making the protocol easier to understand, increasing participation in development, and reducing the costs of creating new infrastructure and tools. It also lowers long-term maintenance requirements, minimizes the risk of catastrophic bugs, and reduces the potential for social attacks and special interests. There are three major areas of simplification: Consensus Layer, Execution Layer, and sharing components across protocol layers, he said. “The effort to revamp Ethereum’s consensus includes many opportunities to simplify consensus, while also increasing efficiency and security.” Simplification could include implementing a ‘three-slot finality’ design to remove complex concepts like slots and epochs, reducing active validators to enable simpler fork choice rules, and using STARK-based aggregation to eliminate trust concerns. “The EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] is increasingly growing in complexity, and much of that complexity has proven unnecessary,” Buterin said regarding the Execution Layer. He suggested replacing the complex EVM with RISC-V, an open standard instruction set architecture, or another simpler virtual machine. This could provide 100x performance improvements, much simpler specifications, better developer options, and increased code size limits. “The third and most easily underrated way to reduce total protocol complexity is to share one standard across different parts of the stack as much as possible,” he said, before adding, “There should ideally only be one way we do [something], across the consensus, execution, and other layers.” Buterin concluded that simplifying the protocol would be worthwhile in the long run. “Caring about simplicity is, like decentralization, a short-term cost for the sake of benefits that do not appear immediately.” ETH Price Outlook Ethereum has fallen out of favor among crypto investors this year, with its market share collapsing to an all-time low of 7% in April. Spot prices have been hovering just above $1,800 so far this month, but dipped below it in early trading in Asia on Monday morning. The asset remains at bear market levels, down 63% from its 2021 all-time high, whereas Bitcoin is 13% down from its peak price earlier this year. Nevertheless, analysts remain confident that ETH can recover this year with a new roadmap and approaching upgrades.

44180931,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157137,1746429644,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase Unveils Powerful New Bitcoin Ad: Is This The Future Of Money?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-new-bitcoin-ad/,"Major movements in the cryptocurrency space often start with key players making bold statements. Leading crypto exchange , Coinbase , is doing just that with the release of a striking new Bitcoin commercial. This latest crypto ad is more than just a marketing piece; it’s a visual declaration about the asset they believe is leading the charge towards the future of money . The commercial, which quickly circulated online after being shared by Watcher Guru on X, is visually simple yet conceptually powerful. It begins with a single, transparent cube seemingly filled with digital representations of Bitcoin . As the camera zooms out, more of these identical, green-tinted containers are revealed, stacked neatly to form a much larger cube. The message is clear: individual units of Bitcoin combine to build something substantial, representing growth, structure, and perhaps, mainstream adoption. Why is Coinbase Highlighting Bitcoin Now? Coinbase’s decision to focus a significant marketing effort on Bitcoin at this particular time is strategic. While the crypto market is diverse, Bitcoin remains the most recognized and dominant cryptocurrency globally. Highlighting Bitcoin allows Coinbase to connect with both existing crypto enthusiasts and potential newcomers who are most likely to have heard of Bitcoin first. Several factors could be influencing this focus: Market Positioning: Amidst fluctuating market conditions, reaffirming commitment to the flagship cryptocurrency can instill confidence. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): With some regulatory developments, particularly in the US regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs, focusing on Bitcoin leverages increasing institutional and public interest. Simple Messaging: Bitcoin is often easier to explain conceptually than many other complex blockchain projects, making it ideal for a broad audience commercial. Brand Association: By strongly associating itself with Bitcoin , Coinbase reinforces its position as a premier platform for accessing the most established digital asset. What Does ‘The Future of Money is Here’ Really Mean? The commercial’s concluding tagline, “The future of money is here,” is a bold assertion. It directly positions Bitcoin , and by extension, the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem accessible via platforms like Coinbase , as the inevitable evolution of financial systems. This isn’t just about digital currency; it’s about challenging traditional notions of value, ownership, and transaction. This phrase encapsulates several key ideas: Decentralization: Money that isn’t controlled by a single entity (like a central bank). Accessibility: Potential for financial services to be available to anyone with an internet connection. Efficiency: Faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional methods. Programmability: The ability to build complex financial applications on top of digital currencies. By stating ‘is here,’ Coinbase suggests that this future isn’t a distant dream but a present reality accessible through their crypto exchange platform. Is This Crypto Ad Effective for Adoption? Marketing plays a crucial role in the adoption of any new technology, and cryptocurrency is no exception. A well-placed and visually compelling crypto ad like this one from Coinbase can have several positive impacts: Raises Awareness: Puts cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin , in front of a mainstream audience. Builds Trust: A reputable company like Coinbase advertising can lend legitimacy to the asset class. Simplifies Concepts: Visuals like the stacking cubes can make abstract ideas like digital assets feel more tangible. Drives Action: Encourages potential users to learn more or sign up for the crypto exchange . However, challenges remain. Public perception of crypto can still be mixed, influenced by volatility and past controversies. Regulatory uncertainty in various jurisdictions also poses a challenge. Despite this, consistent, clear messaging from established platforms like Coinbase is vital for gradual, widespread understanding and adoption. Exploring the Benefits and Challenges Promoted by Coinbase’s Message The ad implicitly highlights potential benefits while navigating underlying challenges associated with the ‘ future of money ‘ concept: Benefits: Empowerment: Control over one’s own money. Innovation: Driving forward financial technology. Potential Growth: The opportunity presented by a nascent asset class like Bitcoin . Challenges: Volatility: The inherent price swings of Bitcoin . Understanding: The complexity of the technology for newcomers. Security: The responsibility of securing one’s own digital assets. Coinbase , as a crypto exchange , aims to provide solutions to some of these challenges by offering a user-friendly platform, security measures, and educational resources, making the step into the future of money less daunting. Actionable Insights from the Ad’s Message For individuals seeing this ad and feeling intrigued by the prospect of the future of money powered by Bitcoin and accessible via a crypto exchange like Coinbase , what are the next steps? Research: Don’t jump in blindly. Learn about what Bitcoin is, how it works, and the risks involved. Choose a Reputable Platform: If considering investment, select a well-established crypto exchange like Coinbase that complies with regulations and offers security features. Start Small: It’s often wise to begin with a small amount you are comfortable potentially losing. Understand Security: Learn about wallet security, two-factor authentication, and protecting your account. The ad serves as a potential starting point, a visual cue that something significant is happening in the world of finance. It encourages curiosity about Bitcoin and the role platforms like Coinbase play. Summary: A Powerful Statement from a Leading Crypto Exchange Coinbase’s new Bitcoin ad is a concise yet impactful piece of marketing that leverages simple visuals to convey a grand vision. By focusing on Bitcoin and declaring ‘ The future of money is here ,’ the crypto exchange is making a strong statement about its confidence in digital assets and their role in evolving global finance. While challenges exist, ads like this are crucial for bringing cryptocurrency into the mainstream consciousness, encouraging dialogue, and potentially driving the next wave of adoption for Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem facilitated by platforms like Coinbase .

Will He Donate His Crypto Profits?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-president-donald-trump-made-very-special-statements-about-memeconi-trump-and-cryptocurrencies-will-he-donate-his-crypto-profits/,"US President Donald Trump, whose every move creates controversy, made very special statements about the cryptocurrency industry. Donald Trump spoke about the memecoin TRUMP, which has been at the center of the controversy, for the first time in an exclusive interview with NBC News. Trump, who denied making any profit from his eponymous token TRUMP in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News' Meet the Press, claimed he had never looked into crypto. Trump has denied profiting from the TRUMP token, despite blockchain data showing he earned around $900,000 in transaction fees following the news of a dinner for top token holders. But Trump also admitted that he did not check to see if he was making a profit. Program host Welker asked Trump, “So you don't make any profit from cryptocurrency?” Trump responded by saying, “I haven't even looked at it,” and continued: “But I'll tell you this. Look, if I own something and I do well and the stock market goes up, I guess I'm making a profit.” Trump said during the interview that he would donate his presidential salary back to the government, and Welker asked if he would also donate any potential cryptocurrency earnings. “I've never thought about it,” Trump said. “I mean, if I'm president and I'm doing a good job and my profits go up a little bit, should I give away all the real estate that I've owned over the years? I don't think so.” We Must Stay Ahead of China on Cryptocurrencies! Reiterating his support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, Trump underlined that his goal is to be a leader in crypto and warned that China could lead the way in crypto if the US falls behind. “I want crypto. I think crypto is important because if we don't do it, China will. And they will be ahead. Crypto is new and very popular,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The current selling status of Phase 4 amounts to 57% with $7.6 million collected from more than 9,400 holders purchasing over 440 million tokens. The defined tokenomics of this project currently predicts a 140% investment profit at its $0.06 listing stage while driving numerous investors towards it. The upcoming phase of the presale will push MUTM token values upward to a price level of $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts strong market attention because investors who buy now expect their tokens to increase in value by 11,050% during 2025. Phase 4 completion approaches while time continues to run down. Presale Frenzy Underway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its rapid advance through the fourth stage of its 11-stage presale while offering tokens at the attractive price of $0.025. The crypto market sees investors obtaining tokens at a fast pace since the purchase opportunity expires soon. Demand strength appears strong through the 57% occupancy level of the current funding phase. The cryptocurrency market has purchased more than 440 million tokens resulting in $7.6 million worth of value accumulation. The market value will surge to $0.03 during Phase 5 allowing current investors to achieve a fast 20% profit increase. The structured price increase demonstrates the immediate need for investors because projections show a 140% return at the $0.06 future listing. The quick selling trend in phase 4 prompts investors to obtain their tokens swiftly as the phase is nearing its end. Strategic Tokenomics Driving Value The well-calculated approach of MUTM tokenomics serves to strengthen investor confidence. The ongoing Certik audit of the smart contract proceeds toward completion before the team reveals its findings on social media platforms for greater transparency. The system now includes a leaderboard that gives bonus tokens to holders at positions 1-50 who maintain their standing. The initial purchasers seize a 140% return on investment when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) listed at $0.06. Analysts predict MUTM will reach $2.80 after launch and that would generate an unparalleled return of 11,050 percent from its current price of $0.025. The combination of short-term profit and long-term prospects has attracted large investors who want to participate in Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) future growth during 2025. Comparison to Dogecoin’s ETF Hype The cryptocurrency market anticipates Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF approval will occur with a 57% probability during 2025. The price range of $0.1757 stands at its current position before an approval would push it to $0.4336 for a 145% rise. The outcome of DOGE becomes uncertain because it depends on Bitcoin price movements together with ETF development dynamics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) produces return potential through its presale operations along with tokenomics that operate independently of outside market factors. MUTM stands out as a more targeted investment over DOGE because it is projected to deliver a 140% listing return and 11,050% ROI in 2025. The cryptocurrency market attracts clear-minded investors who have chosen to invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Window of Opportunity Narrows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out during Phase 4 completion due to its increased popularity. The $0.025 entry phase will disappear soon because phase 5 introduces a 20% price rise. From its 140% initial listing gains along with expected 2025 changes to 11,050% investors find the project increasingly compelling. Whales hurry to participate in the presale because they understand its limited duration. Users who want to become part of the 9,400 invested holders should examine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently. Investors cash in when they act decisively in the crypto market so do not allow this limited opportunity to fade away.

While the SEC has already issued early delays for multiple cryptocurrency-related exchange-traded funds (ETF) filings, notably those involving Ethereum and other digital assets, the Litecoin ETF has so far escaped early commentary. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted the unique status of the filing in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “The @CanaryFunds Litecoin ETF filing is due for a decision (possibly a delay) by Monday 5/5. SEC went early & delayed a bunch of filings, but not this.” He added that the only asset the commission will likely approve this early is a Litecoin ETF. He noted that a delay is more likely, but it is something to watch. Litecoin (LTC), often dubbed the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” has long been one of the most established and widely traded cryptocurrencies. Its longevity and relatively stable reputation compared to other altcoins make it a more “digestible” candidate for an ETF in the eyes of regulators, particularly as the SEC continues to grapple with broader crypto market oversight. SEC delayed its decision on Canary’s ETF filing on March 11 alongside Grayscale Dogecoin and Litecoin filings On March 11, the US SEC delayed the approval of several altcoin ETFs, including Grayscale’s filings for Dogecoin, Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano. The commission also postponed its decision on XRP and Solana ETFs of Canary Capital and 21 shares. Not to mention Canary’s filing on its Litecoin ETF. The regulator also put off its decision on in-kind creation and redemptions for BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC and FETH . Moreover, 21 shares also saw a delay in the proposal to include staking in its Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Even with the SEC delays, James Seyffart said he believed all of these ETFs had high approval odds. He noted that further delays were inevitable, a standard process for the commission. Additionally, Paul Atkins had yet to be confirmed as the agency’s new chairman at the time, which could have contributed to the delays. In February, Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, predicted Litecoin had a 90% chance for approval this year; Dogecoin, 75%; Solana (SOL), 70%; and XRP, 65%. They said that Trump’s re-election increases the likelihood for all of these ETFs to get approved in 2025.” Prior to Trump taking office, their probability projections were 5% lower. Some crypto community members are hopeful that a Litecoin ETF could be approved The approval of the Litecoin ETF would be a huge step in developing such crypto investment offerings, particularly for altcoins. It would add to the precedent of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), whose spot ETF markets are already established. However, most analysts remain cautious. The SEC has historically preferred to delay decisions as long as legally permissible, citing the need for more market surveillance agreements and robust investor protections. In the May 5 X post, Seyffart asserted that the commission could decide today on Canary’s Litecoin ETF. His post invited multiple commentaries; some seemed to dismiss his projections, while others remained hopeful, agreeing that the Litecoin ETF could soon receive approval. However, one X user with the pseudonym Panda was not very excited about the news, claiming there’s no use for a Litecoin ETF, especially since it still has a lower marker cap than other cryptocurrencies. He argued that he would be more excited if the asset was worth more than $100 billion. So far, Litecoin only has a market capitalization of $6.25 billion. Another user stated , “5 years of hope, NO THANKS”, hinting that he does not entirely believe the projection is true after past delays and predictions’ failure to materialize. Other users, however, have interpreted Seyffart’s projections as positive news for the entire crypto industry. If the SEC issues a delay today, it would not be surprising — but it would be another missed opportunity, critics argue, for the agency to signal progress in modernizing crypto regulation. Litecoin gears up for breakout rally as ETF hopes and bullish momentum align According to analyst Crypto Patel, Litecoin is on the verge of a massive rally after ripping through a multi-year resistance line. After months of consolidation in a set range, the altcoin is beginning to exhibit a fresh bullish impulse and is trading at $88.23 at the time of writing. Patel notes that LTC has already exited its previous accumulation range between $65 and $85. Short-term price targets are $255 and $ 500. Long targets range from $1k to over $1,458. While LTC has tested investors’ patience, Patel thinks it is all set to make a big move higher in this bullish cycle, possibly reaching $500 soon. This upward momentum may be further reinforced by the possibility of a Litecoin ETF being approved.

In a recent video on YouTube, analyst Dan Gambardello explained that ADA is very close to an important resistance level. It could either drop soon or break out sharply. A Bigger Rally For Cardano? The analyst, using technical analysis and a risk model, showed that ADA’s current risk level is low, around 31, just like it was before the last bull run. Right now, he sees strong support around $0.50 – $0.60 and resistance up to $0.80. If ADA manages to break through, its price could reach $1.25, which would start an even bigger rally.

He also analysed macro factors like changes in monetary policy and market trends while evaluating ADA’s price trends. Any positive news could lead to higher highs; however, a negative sentiment could lead to a short-term dip. By comparing ADA’s current price movement to its previous cycle, he expects that ADA could set the stage for a similar parabolic move if it breaks through $1.25. ADA Needs to Hold Crucial Levels Furthermore, he pointed out that the 20-day moving average is about to cross above the 50-day, which is a good sign. However, it remains to be seen if ADA holds support at this level or pulls back. The M2 money supply and the end of quantitative tightening could also impact ADA’s price movement. ADA needs to break through resistance around 77 to 80 cents to confirm a breakout. A battle between bulls and bears is going on, and to keep pushing forward, ADA needs to stay above certain price levels.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 07:34:02
44181356,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66150,1746430610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Sets Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for May 31, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-sets-shiba-inu-shib-price-for-may-31-2025/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has attracted fresh attention following a new price forecast by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot projects a modest rise for the digital asset by the end of May 2025. According to the AI model, SHIB could climb by approximately 6.7% over the coming weeks, reaching a price of $0.000014 by May 31, 2025. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001311, reflecting a 1.51% decline in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT based its prediction on recent market behavior and trading dynamics, noting, “Given the strength of April’s recovery and increasing trader interest, it is reasonable to project a near-term upside for SHIB. Our model anticipates a price of $0.000014 by the end of May, representing a roughly 6.7% increase from current levels.” SHIB Sees Positive Momentum Amid Broader Market Recovery This forecast comes amid renewed optimism across the broader cryptocurrency market. According to a recent report by Times Tabloid , Shiba Inu recorded a 7% price gain in April 2025, despite facing stiff competition from larger-cap assets that benefited more from Bitcoin’s sharp rally. Bitcoin’s price climbed toward $95,000 in April, catalyzing a broader market surge that added approximately $270 billion to the total crypto market capitalization — a 10.31% monthly increase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although SHIB’s April gains were more modest compared to top-tier tokens, analysts note that its ability to remain in positive territory highlights resilience and steady investor interest. “Shiba Inu’s recovery, even if less pronounced, contributed meaningfully to portfolio valuations in April,” the Times Tabloid report stated. Futures Market Signals Growing Confidence in SHIB Adding to the bullish sentiment is data from CoinGlass, which shows that SHIB’s futures open interest nearly doubled in April, rising from under $97 million to nearly $190 million by April 27. This sharp increase in open interest is often interpreted as a sign of growing speculative activity and bullish positioning in the market. Rising open interest typically indicates that capital is flowing into new long positions, a trend that aligns with ChatGPT’s forecast. “Open interest trends suggest that traders are increasingly positioning themselves for a positive move in SHIB. When combined with broader market momentum, this supports our short-term price outlook,” ChatGPT stated. Ecosystem Developments Support Longer-Term Outlook Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to develop, with ongoing efforts to strengthen its Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. The Shiba Inu development team has been rolling out updates to improve transaction throughput and scalability. This includes enhancements to the validator onboarding and increased burn activity , both seen as longer-term bullish factors for SHIB’s valuation. While Shiba Inu’s near-term performance may not rival Bitcoin or Ethereum, AI-powered predictions and market data suggest a favorable outlook for the meme token heading into the end of May. Traders and investors will be watching closely to see if SHIB can meet or exceed ChatGPT’s forecast of $0.000014, as confidence in the token appears to be building once again.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XYZVerse is the first memecoin built for sports fans and crypto degens alike, blending decentralized betting perks with viral, community-driven hype. Table of Contents Step-by-step guide to buying XYZ What draws investors to XYZVerse ICO? How other memecoins performed after launch Price targets for XYZVerse Final thoughts XYZVerse (XYZ) is the first all-sports memecoin designed to capture the momentum of crypto hype while tapping into the massive appeal of global sports fandom. Backed by a partnership with BookMaker, XYZ is a fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook with no bans or limits. XYZVerse gives holders access to exclusive perks like betting bonuses, weekly competitions, and ecosystem giveaways. But since XYZ isn’t available on major centralized exchanges yet, newcomers are left wondering: how do you actually get it? Whether people are drawn by the meme-driven buzz or intrigued by its ties to decentralized betting, this guide breaks down how to buy XYZVerse and offers a price prediction based on its early-stage traction and community hype. Step-by-step guide to buying XYZ Step 1: Set up wallet First, users will need a web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. If users don’t have a wallet yet, they can download the app and create a new wallet. After setup, they’ll need to add a supported network like Polygon or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Users can do this by going to their wallet settings and selecting “Add Network.” Step 2: Connect to a supported blockchain Once the wallet is ready, users must make sure they’re connected to one of the supported networks: Ethereum, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain. Step 3: Select the payment token When users access the XYZVerse presale page, they’ll see an option to select the payment token. Users must click on the token icon to choose whether they want to pay with ETH, USDT, BNB, MATIC, or other supported tokens. Step 4: Enter the purchase amount Next, users must input the amount of crypto they want to spend. The system will automatically calculate how many XYZ tokens they’ll receive based on the current presale price. Step 5: Finalize purchase Once everything looks good: Click on the “Buy XYZ” button. Approve the transaction through the wallet pop-up (users may need to confirm twice: once for approval, once for finalizing). Following the purchase, users can monitor their balance directly on the presale dashboard under the “XYZ Balance” section. Reminder: Tokens will become fully claimable after the presale concludes, depending on the project’s distribution schedule. What draws investors to XYZVerse ICO? Given the current presale dynamics, it makes sense for interested buyers to act sooner rather than later. The price of XYZ is currently $0.003333, but it’s set to rise to $0.005 in the upcoming presale stage. According to the project’s roadmap, the planned listing price is $0.10 which would already represent a 30-times increase from today’s presale levels if achieved. But what could happen after listing? To answer this, it’s helpful to look at similar memecoin projects that started small and grew rapidly once they hit the open market. How other memecoins performed after launch Shiba Inu ( SHIB ): Originally launched as a fun meme token, SHIB exploded in value by over 1,000,000% within its first major growth cycle in 2021, turning tiny investments into life-changing fortunes. Dogecoin ( DOGE ): Once a joke project, DOGE rose to mainstream fame and surged by over 12,000% during the 2021 bull run, helped by strong community support and celebrity attention. Pepe ( PEPE ): In 2024, PEPE experienced a 1,900,000% increase from early listings to peak prices, driven purely by viral momentum and meme culture appeal. Each of these examples shows how meme coins with strong narratives, community engagement, and timing during favorable market conditions can see extraordinary gains. Price targets for XYZVerse Due to the volatile nature of the crypto market, it is difficult to predict exact prices, a few scenarios for XYZVerse future price action could be outlined: Moderate growth scenario: Reaching $0.15–$0.20 within the first few months post-listing if community traction continues. Strong adoption scenario: If the project captures major memecoin hype and achieves strong exchange listings, prices could aim for $0.30–$0.50 within a year — similar to early stages seen with SHIB or PEPE. Of course, these projections depend heavily on broader market conditions and the project team’s ability to execute its plans effectively. Final thoughts XYZVerse offers a unique blend of meme culture and sports enthusiasm, supported by a clear roadmap and growing community interest. With the presale still underway and a planned listing price significantly higher than today’s rate, early access may present an attractive opportunity for those willing to explore emerging projects.

This isn’t just another AI chatbot or cloud-based tool, it’s a vision of a decentralized, open-source future for AI, and it’s built with crypto ( Bitcoin and USDT ) in mind. No Central Control, No Gatekeepers At the heart of the project is something called “Personal Infinite Intelligence” , a fully open-source AI runtime that can run on any device or hardware — no cloud dependency, no API keys, and most importantly, no single point of control. That means anyone, anywhere, can deploy and run their own AI system, without needing permission or paying ongoing fees to centralized providers. This model challenges the growing trend of corporate-controlled AI services. While most AI tools today rely heavily on large cloud systems from big tech companies, Tether’s version aims to put the power back into the hands of individuals and developers. Fully Modular and Composable The project is also designed to be modular and composable means that developers can build, customize, and connect different parts of the system easily, creating AI tools that work exactly how they want, whether for personal use, business, or something entirely new. Strong Support for USDT and Bitcoin One of the most exciting features is that Tether’s new AI runtime will have the ability to work seamlessly with their WDK (likely a developer kit). This integration means developers can create smart applications that handle cryptocurrency transactions directly. The key here is that users will be able to send and receive cryptocurrencies like USDT (Tether) and Bitcoin without relying on any third parties or intermediaries. Future Full of AI Agents Looking ahead, Ardoino revealed a larger goal, to build a peer-to-peer network of billions of AI agents, each one interacting freely across devices and systems. It’s a vision that mirrors how Bitcoin changed finance , and now, Tether hopes to do something similar for AI. Tether AI could mark a new era where intelligence is not just artificial, but also accessible, open, and free from control.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 07:39:14

With an extraordinary growth of 1,375.86% last year, MetaPlanet stock has rapidly evolved from a hotel operator to one of Asia’s boldest corporate Bitcoin holders. Over the past year, MetaPlanet acquired 5,000 BTC, valued at approximately $472,613,900 , and has set its sights on 21,000 BTC by 2026. MetaPlanet Stock: Leading the Bitcoin Accumulation Race MetaPlanet is the tenth-largest public company in BTC holdings, trailing behind major players like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Tesla. By the end of 2026, MetaPlanet aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings significantly, highlighting its aggressive acquisition strategy. Unlike other Bitcoin-heavy companies that rely on debt or discounted stock deals to raise funds, MetaPlanet has adopted a ‘No Discount and No Debt’ approach. The company has raised capital by issuing new shares at full market price, preserving shareholder value and avoiding the risks typically associated with loans. MetaPlanet has also implemented an innovative strategy from the options market known as cash-secured puts. By committing to buy BTC at lower future prices, the company earned $5.4 million in premiums during Q1 2024. These funds allowed MetaPlanet to purchase an additional 645 BTC, further expanding its portfolio when the price dropped. Global Expansion and BTC Acquisition Plans MetaPlanet is not only focusing on Bitcoin but also expanding its global presence. Recently, it opened a branch in Florida and is rumored to be raising over $250 million from the US market to fuel its BTC acquisition program. The company’s remarkable growth can be attributed to its leadership, which has placed unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s future. This forward-thinking approach has driven MetaPlanet’s explosive growth and positions it as a potential powerhouse in the Bitcoin treasury space. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Live Today: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, Contract, While CORE, WAL, FLR Surge , Metaplant Stock Performance: A Steady Rise MetaPlanet offers investors significant exposure to Bitcoin without the complexity of unrelated business operations.

According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs brought in $1.81 billion over the past week, which was a little over 40% less than the $3.06 billion they recorded the week before. Net inflows into BTC ETFs observed over the last week | Source: SoSoValue Most of last week’s inflows went into BlackRock’s IBIT , which attracted a massive $2.48 billion. Meanwhile, funds like Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, and Invesco’s BTCO saw smaller inflows. However, not all funds had a good week. ARK’s ARKB recorded outflows of $457.6 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC lost $201.1 million. Even Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB recorded net redemptions. The other ETFs stayed mostly flat. Despite the slower pace last week, April was still a strong month overall, with nearly $3 billion flowing into Bitcoin ETFs. This was a sharp turnaround after two back-to-back months of outflows that had drained over $4.3 billion, signaling renewed demand from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs exhibited a similar trend, with net inflows dropping to $106.75 million last week from $157 million the week before. You might also like: BlackRock sees $700,000 Bitcoin — are we about to test that thesis in real time? What really shook markets was the disappointing U.S. economic data. The April ADP jobs report came in far below expectations, marking the weakest result since July 2024. On top of that, the first estimate for Q1 GDP turned negative, despite earlier positive forecasts. A big factor was the surge in imports as businesses rushed to stock up before President Donald Trump’s fresh round of tariffs fully kicked in, adding more pressure on the economy. These tariff worries have added to growing fears of stagflation, a mix of weak growth and stubborn inflation, making investors unsure about when or how much the Federal Reserve might cut rates. Earlier, Trump’s claims that trade talks with countries including China were underway briefly lifted market sentiment, helping Bitcoin touch a weekly high of $97,800. The rally offered momentary relief amid tariff uncertainty, but gains quickly faded as inflation data reignited stagflation fears. As of Monday, Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price recovery had stalled, trading between $93,500 and $96,000, with the market’s focus now shifting to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision. Economists widely expect the Fed to keep rates steady at 4.5% and maintain a cautious stance since inflation is still running hot.

From NFT communities and trading groups to project updates and DAO coordination, countless crypto-related discussions happen on Telegram every day. But creating a Telegram account requires a phone number and that’s exactly where privacy concerns begin. Not everyone wants to use their personal number, especially when dealing with multiple projects or trying to maintain anonymity. That’s where virtual phone numbers come in. And when you can buy one with crypto and no personal data , it becomes the fastest, safest, and most private way to access Telegram. Why a Virtual Number for Telegram Matters Protect your privacy and keep your real identity separate from your crypto presence Create multiple Telegram accounts for business, testing, or community management Bypass regional restrictions or mobile SIM limitations Useful for bot creation, DAO operations, or anonymous participation in groups Benefits of Buying a Virtual Number with Crypto Feature Traditional Payment Crypto Payment Requires bank account Privacy-friendly Global access Limited Full Aligned with Web3 values Speed of delivery Average Instant Crypto payments such as USDT or BTC allow you to bypass intermediaries, stay anonymous, and enjoy global access, a perfect fit for decentralized digital identity. Key Things to Know Before Buying 1. VOIP vs Non-VOIP To successfully receive a verification code from Telegram, you need Non-VOIP numbers. Many VOIP numbers are rejected by Telegram or already blacklisted. 2. Success Rate Choose a platform with a high delivery success rate . A cheap number is useless if the verification code doesn’t arrive. 3. Registered Platform with Support Look for services that offer login access, a user dashboard, and live chat or ticket-based support . You’ll need it if something goes wrong. 4. Short-term or Long-term Rental Some services offer single-use numbers only. If you plan to keep your Telegram account long-term, make sure the number is renewable. How to Buy a Telegram Virtual Number with Crypto Register on a trusted platform (e.g., BuyNumber.io ) Log in to the user dashboard Choose a country and select the “Telegram” service Pay with crypto (BTC, USDT, LTC, etc.) Receive the number and enter it in Telegram Wait for the verification code to appear in the dashboard Complete registration and access your Telegram account The whole process typically takes less than 5 minutes. A Reliable Service to Consider BuyNumber.io offer: High success rate with Non-VOIP numbers Crypto payments without KYC Temporary or long-term rental options 24/7 customer support Developer dashboard and API access FAQ Is using a virtual number for Telegram legal? Yes, but always check local regulations in your country. Are these numbers permanent? No. Unless you specifically rent a long-term number, most are for temporary use. Can I reuse a number? Most numbers are single-use and tied to one-time verification. Conclusion Buying a Telegram virtual number with crypto is one of the most efficient and secure ways for crypto users to create accounts, manage projects, or join communities without exposing their personal identity. It offers a fast, borderless, and privacy-first experience and when paired with Non-VOIP infrastructure and a reliable provider, it’s a powerful tool for anyone navigating the decentralized web. If you’re looking for speed, privacy, and flexibility, this method is a smart choice for your Web3 communication toolkit.

Binance Alpha, a dedicated feature nestled within the comprehensive Binance Wallet ecosystem, has made a notable addition to its curated list: the BOOP token . This move, reported by BWEnews on X, shines a spotlight on yet another potential contender in the dynamic world of early stage crypto . What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Projects? Binance Alpha isn’t just another list; it’s a strategic tool designed to identify and showcase promising crypto projects long before they might reach the main stage of a major exchange listing. Operating within the familiar interface of the Binance Wallet , it provides users with early visibility into tokens that are generating buzz and demonstrating potential. The core purpose of Binance Alpha is to act as an incubator or a discovery platform. It allows Binance users who are already engaged with the ecosystem to get acquainted with newer tokens, potentially participating in their growth from an earlier phase. For project developers, getting featured on Binance Alpha offers significant exposure to a massive, crypto-savvy user base. How Does Binance Alpha Select Tokens Like the BOOP Token? The selection process for Binance Alpha is distinct from the rigorous requirements for a full Binance exchange listing. According to the announcement, Binance Alpha focuses heavily on community sentiment and prevailing market trends among early stage crypto projects. This means tokens that have built strong, engaged communities, show organic growth, and are capturing market attention are more likely candidates. Key factors influencing a Binance Alpha listing often include: Community Strength: Active participation, positive sentiment, and growth across social media and community channels. Market Momentum: Evidence of organic trading activity, increasing interest, and positive price action on smaller platforms. Project Fundamentals (Early View): While not as deep a dive as a full exchange review, basic viability and interest in the project’s concept are considered. The addition of the BOOP token suggests it has met these early-stage criteria, indicating a level of community traction and market interest that caught the attention of the Binance Alpha team. What Does a Binance Alpha Listing Mean for the BOOP Token and Early Stage Crypto? For the BOOP token itself, the primary benefit is vastly increased visibility. Being featured on Binance Alpha exposes it to millions of Binance users globally. This can lead to: Increased awareness and potential adoption. Higher trading volume on platforms where it is already listed. Attraction of new investors and community members. Enhanced credibility simply by being recognized by a platform associated with Binance. For the broader early stage crypto market, Binance Alpha acts as a signal booster. It highlights the potential for smaller projects to gain significant traction if they focus on building a strong community and demonstrating early market fit. Is a Binance Alpha Listing a Guarantee of Future Binance Exchange Listing? This is a critical point that cannot be overstated, and it’s explicitly mentioned in the announcement: a listing on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance exchange. The criteria for a full exchange listing are far more stringent, involving deep dives into technology, legal compliance, tokenomics, team, and long-term viability. Think of Binance Alpha as a scouting report, not a draft pick confirmation. While being scouted is a positive sign, many projects highlighted here may never make it to the major league exchange. This is an important caveat for anyone looking at tokens featured on Binance Alpha. Navigating Early Stage Crypto Projects Featured on Binance Alpha: Actionable Insights The inclusion of the BOOP token on Binance Alpha serves as a reminder for investors interested in high-growth potential but also high risk. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): A Binance Alpha listing is a starting point for investigation, not an endpoint. Research the BOOP token’s fundamentals, team, technology, and community beyond its appearance on the list. Understand the Risk: Early stage crypto projects are inherently volatile and carry significant risk of failure. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Monitor Community & Development: Since community and trends are key to Alpha listing, continue monitoring these aspects for BOOP and other featured tokens. Don’t Assume Exchange Listing: Base your investment decisions on the project’s current merit and potential, not on the speculation of a future major exchange listing. Binance Alpha provides a valuable window into the burgeoning world of new crypto projects , and the addition of the BOOP token is the latest example of this. It offers opportunity alongside significant risk, underscoring the need for diligent research and a cautious approach. Summary: The BOOP Token Joins Binance Alpha’s Ranks In conclusion, Binance Alpha, a feature within the Binance Wallet focused on showcasing promising early stage crypto projects, has added the BOOP token to its list. This decision was driven by an assessment of community interest and market trends surrounding the token. While this provides significant visibility for BOOP and highlights the potential within crypto projects gaining early traction, it is crucial for potential investors to remember that a Binance Alpha listing is not a guarantee of future listing on the main Binance exchange. It serves as an exciting early signal, but thorough personal research remains paramount.

At current prices, these tokens are valued at about $8.46 million. As of May 5, 7.55 billion MOVE tokens, or 75.5% of the total supply, are locked. The remaining 24.5%, or 2.45 billion MOVE, is already in circulation. The unlock comes at a time when the token is already under intense scrutiny and negative market sentiment.

As of press time, MOVE is trading at approximately $0.169, down 0.54% on the day. The token’s steep fall can be traced back to a market-making scandal that resurfaced in early May. Movement Labs confirmed on May 2 that Manche, a third-party market maker, has been suspended while inquiries into a possible manipulation scheme proceed. You might also like: https://crypto.news/movement-launches-public-mainnet-beta-with-a-250m-starting-tvl/ The incident began in December, when 66 million MOVE tokens were purportedly dumped by a shell company called Rentech, reportedly making $38 million. Even though Rentech was initially presented as being affiliated with another popular market marker, Web3Port, investigations revealed it had no digital footprint or clear backing. In March, Binance notified the Movement Foundation and Movement Labs and froze the related funds. To lessen the harm, the foundation announced a $38 million token buyback and ended its partnership with the market maker. However, there are still questions about the extent of Movement’s core team’s involvement. MOVE’s technical outlook remains poor. The token’s current price is below all of the major moving averages, and momentum indicators such as the moving average convergence divergence suggest that bearish pressure is still present. The relative strength index is below 30, indicating oversold conditions, even though there isn’t yet a clear reversal pattern. MOVE price analysis | Source: crypto.news With Coinbase set to delist MOVE pairs on May 15, the upcoming token unlock may fuel further volatility. In the short term, MOVE might continue to be under pressure unless there is a noticeable change in sentiment or a strong recovery above key support levels.

Chainalysis recently reported that the TRUMP token earned $900,000 in fees in a two day span for its backers. The wallets of the largest holders of the token are controlled by CIC Digital LLC, an entity also used for his NFT collection , and Fight Fight Fight LLC , which is co-owned by CIC Digital. Collectively, they own 80% of the TRUMP tokens. “I’m not profiting from anything,” Trump said during an interview with NBC News, adding that he hadn’t looked at the token’s performance and that any financial benefits would be incidental. “If I own stock in something, and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting,” he said. The TRUMP token has seen strong market activity in recent weeks. It’s currently trading around $11.20, a significant drop from its all-time high of $44.19, but still up 20% over the past month.

On May 4, the Maldivian government and MBS Global Investments inked a joint venture agreement to develop a $8.8 billion crypto-focused financial centre in the capital city of Malé, according to a Financial Times report . The project, titled the Maldives International Financial Centre, will span 830,000 square meters, and initial estimates suggest it could eventually employ up to 16,000 people and host over 6,000 residents. Development would be rolled out in phases over the next five years and is expected to generate more than $1 billion in revenue annually by year five. According to officials, the financial center would aim to triple the country’s GDP. MBS Global, headed by Qatari royal Sheikh Nayef bin Eid Al Thani, plans to finance the development through a mix of equity and debt. According to the firm, it has already secured firm commitments “north of” $4–$5 billion, raised through its network of family offices and high-net-worth individuals.

The country is under financial pressure, with over $1.6 billion in external debt repayments due by 2026. Just a few months ago, India stepped in with a $760 million bailout to help the island nation avoid default. Finance Minister Moosa Zameer believes the financial center could be a possible way out of its current fiscal crunch. Still, turning Malé into a global fintech hub won’t be easy. One senior Indian businessperson told the Financial Times that the Maldives is likely to face stiff competition from well-established heavyweights such as Dubai, Hong Kong, and Singapore. As previously reported by crypto.news, Dubai has already made major strides in establishing itself as a crypto-friendly destination, with supportive regulations and government-backed blockchain initiatives . Similarly, Singapore has continued to draw global investment with its open approach to digital assets and a thriving tech ecosystem . Meanwhile, Hong Kong, too, has attracted hundreds of Web3 and fintech firms by positioning itself as a gateway between China and the West. Hong Kong, Dubai, and Singapore all ranked among the top five in Multipolitan’s 2025 Crypto Cities Index , which evaluated global hubs based on adoption, regulation, and infrastructure.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is required to submit a comprehensive assessment regarding the establishment and management of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This evaluation stems from President Trump's executive order issued on March 6, 2025, which mandates the creation of a reserve funded by Bitcoin assets seized through legal proceedings . The executive order outlines that the reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin already held by the Department of the Treasury, acquired through forfeitures. These assets are to be maintained as reserve assets and are not to be sold, ensuring they serve as a stable financial resource for the nation . In addition to the Bitcoin reserve, the order also establishes a United States Digital Asset Stockpile, comprising other digital assets obtained through similar means. The Treasury is tasked with developing strategies for the responsible stewardship of these assets, including considerations for acquiring additional Bitcoin, provided such strategies are budget-neutral and impose no additional costs on taxpayers . Secretary Bessent's report is expected to address the legal and investment considerations for these initiatives, including the accounts in which the assets should be held and any legislative requirements necessary for their proper management. This assessment is crucial for determining the feasibility and implications of increasing the U.S. government's Bitcoin holdings . The outcome of this report could significantly influence the United States' position in the global digital asset landscape, potentially setting a precedent for how governments manage and utilize cryptocurrencies as part of their financial strategies.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-05 07:55:32

Over on the frog side, PEPE rests just below $0.058106 with a $3.41 billion market capitalization and $377 million in twenty-four-hour turnover. Both tokens continue to ride dominant web cultures, but a new challenger in the name of Remittix (RTX) still under ten cents has already seen thousands of holders looking for more than GIF-driven hype. Why Shiba Inu Still Matters Shibarium, the project’s layer-2 network, continues burning SHIB in every transaction. It has a new NFT launchpad and a “Treat” developer reward token, showing us the team is development-first past the meme. However, SHIB’s supply is ginormous and with each extra zero it sheds large capital flows required. If Bitcoin cools this summer, history tells us that retail interest falters first with meme assets, leaving holders waiting months for the next flame. PEPE’s Overnight Popularity PEPE’s overnight popularity proved that traders continue to hunger for immediate 10x movements. On-chain metrics, though, are clear that numerous whale wallets are controlling substantial percentages of coins. As soon as the whales need to sell and generate cash for the next big trend, the daily candles record double-digit red. The platform is also still solely on Ethereum, so gas fees can discourage small investors from jumping in and out quickly. Without an explicit product roadmap, such as Shiba Inu’s continuous builds, PEPE can only rely on social hype alone to keep up. Say Hello To Remittix: Utility Above Hype As PEPE and SHIB struggle to dominate the memes, Remittix is building real payments. For $0.0757, early adopters have already shelled out $14.7 million for 531 million tokens. The twist is that users can swap Bitcoin, Ether or stablecoins on Remittix’s platform and settle into a bank account in minutes. Every swap burns some RTX and shares fee revenue with stakers, linking adoption to scarcity and cash flow. Developers indicate that a Solana Pay hook drops later this year, allowing physical-world merchants to accept crypto with the merchant receiving local currency immediately. They’re also waiting for an EU e-money licence; if granted, the bridge could open up dozens of regulated corridors. In simple terms, RTX provides a mainstream adoption pathway that meme tokens hardly ever access. Risk-Reward for 2025 Meme veterans know that explosive gains demand perfect timing. For SHIB to make new millionaires at the present scale, its market cap must rocket into the tens of billions again, a possible feat, but more and more trying with each cycle. PEPE needs to oust SHIB or BONK from the meme pecking order to reassert story leadership and this jockeying can fray nerves. Remittix is on the opposite side of the curve. A shift from pennies to eighty cents would put it at $600 million, substantial but characteristic of bull markets. Because holders get a portion of bridge fees, they have less “dead money” risk; the token can pay them even in sideways months. That model has already drawn some Shiba and Pepe whales, tracking on-chain platforms’ reports. Liquidity Outlook Depth in PEPE Uniswap pools is solid but still loses large orders. SHIB’s CEX coverage is superior, however, the spreads erupt with market shock. Remittix begins life on the DEXs with comparatively smaller liquidity, but the team has promised to list tier-one based on corridor go-live. Early investors must weigh that diminished liquidity against the advantage of getting in prior to larger venues. The ShibArmy has remained steadfast, organizing charity initiatives and brand partnerships. PEPE’s group is more relaxed, party-and-movement focused, enhancing rallies as much as correction. Remittix’s group backed by freelancers in the Philippines and Nigeria who indeed use the swap-in feature seems more utilitarian. That utilitarianism might assist sticky holders interested in fee returns over daily charts. Which Millionaire-Maker Narrative Will Win? Burn for share or supply of revenue? PEPE and SHIB burn tokens, but RTX burns as well as rewards holders. Visible road map? Shibarium updates are set out; PEPEs are less clear; Remittix releases licensing milestones and corridor targets. Adoption outside crypto Twitter? Remittix by itself, deposits funds into true bank accounts, offering non-traders an incentive to participate. Investors seeking the next 1,000 percent move will likely trade between all three at some point. If Ethereum gas falls and retail sentiment spikes, SHIB and PEPE can quickly shoot up. Yet even in a stagnant market, Remittix has an actual service that can keep drip-feeding returns. Shiba Inu and PEPE remain meme culture symbols and will surely dominate crypto TikTok whenever dog or frog emojis are trending. But to earn life-changing money from a small investment, many analysts argue that you need something other than memes because you need genuine utility behind normal demand. By merging a deflationary model with actual payments, Remittix may check that box. If RTX captures just a fraction of the attention previously directed into SHIB and PEPE, then the token may write one of the next bull wave’s unheralded success stories. Upstart “millionaire-makers” of the future will have their chance soon enough about which tale takes hold: dancing dogs, snarky frogs or an entrance that, at last, gets crypto paying the rent.

Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , and the increasingly followed MAGACOINFINANCE.COM are capturing serious interest from both institutional and retail investors across continents. With momentum expanding and adoption growing, early engagement in these assets may offer significant strategic advantages in 2025 and beyond. MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Global Recognition with Over $7.8 Million Raised In early-stage investing, fundamentals are more valuable than headlines. MAGACOINFINANCE is demonstrating all the signals of a well-structured, globally relevant project: strong wallet growth, expanding community support, and a clear execution track record. MAGACOINFINANCE is scaling across major markets including North America, Europe, and Asia. This is not a speculative phase—it’s a calculated growth trajectory grounded in transparency and performance. Those entering now are doing so before full-scale global awareness is reached. Leading the Market: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Maintain Strong Positions Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the primary store of value within digital assets, now further supported by institutional investment vehicles and ETF integration. Ethereum (ETH) remains foundational to decentralized technology, with robust developer activity and enterprise adoption across smart contracts, applications, and tokenized systems. XRP has regained momentum following regulatory clarity, positioning itself as a serious contender for cross-border settlement infrastructure. While these assets reflect maturity and stability, MAGACOINFINANCE offers an early-stage opportunity that is still unfolding. Other Projects to Watch: Optimism, Kaspa, and Emerging Infrastructure Optimism is making Ethereum more scalable by lowering costs and increasing speed through Layer-2 integration—vital for onboarding the next wave of users. Kaspa is innovating with its blockDAG approach, focusing on rapid confirmation times and high-throughput decentralization. These platforms contribute meaningfully to blockchain infrastructure—but few currently offer the same early growth curve that MAGACOINFINANCE presents. Conclusion The global crypto market is evolving rapidly. While Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP remain strong pillars, MAGACOINFINANCE is building a credible case as the next high-potential entry point. With a growing visibility, the project is transitioning from early discovery into broader adoption. The opportunity remains, but timing is critical.

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market. Here are five major stablecoin initiatives projected to grow crypto adoption. Tether to relaunch in the US Stablecoin giant Tether is eyeing a relaunch in the US with a dollar-based stablecoin. Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) is already known worldwide as the largest stablecoin on the market, providing liquidity to crypto trading pairs on numerous exchanges. However, Tether has found itself in hot water with regulators over proof of its reserves, other financial transparency and Anti-Money Laundering concerns. In an April 30 interview with CNBC, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the firm wants to launch a rebranded coin in the US, separate from its ubiquitous international stablecoin. “A domestic stablecoin would be different from the international stablecoin,” he said. Tether holds the lion’s share of the stablecoin market. Source: Nansen The move would give Tether access to US financial markets as the latter’s exposure to crypto widens under the pro-crypto administration of US President Donald Trump. Trump dabbles in the dollar with USD1 At the beginning of March, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the cryptocurrency project tied to the Trump family, launched its dollar-backed stablecoin , USD1, on the BNB Chain and Ethereum. According to CoinMarketCap, the coin has over $2 billion in market capitalization at publishing time. The stablecoins follow other high-profile crypto projects that use the president’s personal brand as a marketing tool, namely the TRUMP and WLFI memecoins that launched ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards? Trump’s ability to influence stablecoin policy has led a group of US senators to call for an inquiry into his personal interests in the project, calling it a clear conflict of interest.

Source: Senator Schiff Custodia and Vantage Bank launch bank-issued coin on Ethereum Two US banks, the crypto-friendly Custodia Bank and the Texas-based Vantage Bank, have entered a partnership to issue the supposed first bank-issued stablecoin in the US, UK and Europe. On March 25, Custodia stated that it tokenized US dollar demand deposits on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 standard token called Avit. Custodia CEO and crypto advocate Caitlin Long said that Avit is a “real dollar” in that it tokenizes funds that customers can withdraw on demand, like checking account deposits. Stripe is testing a stablecoin product On April 28, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison announced that his global payments platform was working on a US-dollar-based stablecoin product for use outside the US. Source: Patrick Collison The move comes after it received approval to acquire stablecoin payments network Bridge in a $1-billion deal in October 2024, a deal which it completed in February 2025. Bridge was founded by two former Coinbase executives, Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, in 2022 and competes with firms using the ubiquitous SWIFT global payments system. The stablecoin initiative is the latest development in the firm’s expanding crypto plans. After a false start on Bitcoin support in 2014, the firm began rebuilding its crypto team in earnest in 2021. On Oct. 9, 2024, the firm opened USDC support for users in 70 countries. UAE’s largest bank to issue stablecoin Abu Dhabi’s International Holding Company, Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) partnered to launch a dirham-backed stablecoin on April 28. According to The National, FAB — the largest bank in the UAE — will issue the stablecoin on the ADI network pending approval from the central bank. The ADI network is a project of the ADI Foundation in Abu Dhabi, which itself is a nonprofit organization founded by Sirius International Holding, a local holding firm with a $243 billion market capitalization. The firms claim that the stablecoin will “have a significant impact on various industries, including finance, commerce, and trade.” Related: Stablecoin adoption grows with new US bills, Japan’s open approach Visa, SBI and Mastercard add more stablecoin support New stablecoin issuances are picking up the pace, and payments firms, banks and financial institutions are adding support for them as well. On April 28, international payments giant Mastercard partnered with OKX to expand its stablecoin card options, which allow cardholders to spend stablecoins through their Mastercard linked with prominent crypto firms. Two days later, Visa announced that it partnered with Stripe and Bridge on April 30 to offer stablecoin payments on its network in Latin America, starting with Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Chile. SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency subsidiary of the Japanese financial conglomerate SBI, said it was preparing to add support for USDC after local regulators softened their approach to foreign stablecoins. Pending formal approval, the trading platform will be one of the first in Japan to offer cryptocurrency trading in USDC ( USDC ).

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities. In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In essence, they help prevent costly mistakes by modeling complex systems in the virtual world before implementing them in the real world. Digital twins have taken on a darker role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Cybercriminals use digital twin technology rather than simulating physical objects to create synthetic identities, replicas of real individuals, often derived from stolen data. These digital copies are then used to infiltrate online communities, impersonate influencers or executives, or manipulate systems for financial gain. How cybercriminals weaponize digital twins to scam crypto users In the crypto world, where anonymity and trustless transactions reign supreme, digital twins have emerged as a potent tool for cybercriminals to exploit. Scammers can take advantage of the decentralized , unregulated nature of crypto platforms to perpetrate these frauds. Here’s a deeper look at how scammers weaponize digital twins: Identity cloning: Cybercriminals gather personal data from social media, data breaches and other online sources to create a highly accurate digital twin of a real person. This might include images, voice recordings, writing style and even behavioral patterns. Once the digital twin is created, it can be used to impersonate individuals and gain trust from others in the crypto community. Fake influencers or advisers: Crypto influencers, who often command significant trust and attention, are prime targets for digital twin scams. By replicating their speech patterns, mannerisms and even generating deepfake videos, scammers can pose as trusted personalities in the space. These fake versions may promote fraudulent investment schemes, fake tokens or manipulate users into sending crypto to scam wallets. Synthetic KYC (Know Your Customer) scams: Some digital twins are created to bypass KYC processes on exchanges or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms . Attackers can generate fake identities and provide forged documents or images to appear legitimate, gaining access to accounts or executing unauthorized transactions. This can enable criminals to launder stolen funds or impersonate legitimate traders. Phishing with personalization: Phishing scams in the crypto space often target individuals with highly personalized messages. When a scammer creates a digital twin of a known figure, they can tailor their communications to appear more convincing. By using these personalized messages, they trick victims into clicking on malicious links, giving away private keys or downloading harmful software. Did you know? In 2023, a Hong Kong finance employee was tricked into transferring $25 million after joining a video call with what turned out to be deepfake versions of their colleagues, generated using publicly available footage. Examples of digital twin-related scams in crypto While digital twin scams in crypto might sound futuristic, they’re already happening, and AI is a big part of the problem. These scams don’t always rely on evil digital twins alone; many use deepfake videos, AI-generated profiles and hallucinated interfaces to deceive users. Here are some real-world examples: Deepfake CEO scam defrauds chief financial officer via video call: In a sophisticated attack, scammers created digital avatars of a company’s CEO and executives using publicly available video materials. They conducted a video call with the company’s chief financial officer, convincing him to transfer funds under false pretenses. The digital twins were so convincing that the executive did not suspect foul play during the call. UI spoofing mimics trusted crypto platforms : Cybercriminals have employed UI spoofing to create near-perfect replicas of legitimate cryptocurrency platforms. These counterfeit interfaces trick users into entering sensitive information or making transactions, believing they are interacting with the real platform. The high fidelity of these digital twins makes them particularly dangerous, as they can bypass traditional security measures. AdmiralsFX scam uses deepfakes to lure investors: A large-scale scam operated by a call center in Tbilisi, Georgia, used deepfake videos of celebrities to promote a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platform called AdmiralsFX. Victims were shown AI-generated videos of public figures endorsing the platform, leading them to invest substantial amounts of money. The operation defrauded over 6,000 individuals, highlighting the potent combination of deepfake technology and social engineering. How to spot interactions with evil digital twins: 6 Red flags Digital twin scams rely on sophisticated impersonation techniques, and scammers often use synthetic identities to build trust and manipulate their targets. To help you stay alert, here are six red flags that can help you identify interactions with synthetic identities. Watch for these warning signs to protect yourself from falling victim to fraud. Digital twin scams in crypto often hide behind polished, AI-generated responses that sound perfect but lack authenticity. If someone avoids live video calls and instead offers pre-recorded clips or deepfakes, be skeptical. Real people show up. Scammers frequently use urgency, pushing you to act fast with phrases like “limited offer” to bypass your judgment. One major red flag is receiving unverified crypto requests via DMs — legit professionals don’t do that. Always check profiles for inconsistencies like low follower counts or recent creation dates. Finally, be wary if someone insists on sticking to one platform and refuses to switch to secure or verified channels. These tactics combined often signal a coordinated scam using digital twin or AI deception. Did you know? Unlike traditional simulations, digital twins are dynamic virtual environments powered by real-time data. While a simulation models one process, a digital twin can run multiple simulations at once, constantly learning and adapting through a live feedback loop. Can blockchain help prevent digital twin-powered crypto scams? While blockchain technology is often targeted by cybercriminals due to its decentralized and pseudonymous nature, it also holds the potential to offer powerful solutions for combating digital twin-based scams. Blockchain, with its transparent and immutable features, provides unique tools that can help verify identities and secure transactions, making it harder for scammers to manipulate the system. Leveraging blockchain’s capabilities introduces robust security layers that verify the legitimacy of interactions, helping reduce fraud, identity theft and digital impersonation. Onchain identity verification: One of the most important developments in blockchain technology is the concept of decentralized identity (DID) . With DID, individuals can verify their identity on the blockchain without relying on centralized authorities. This ensures that scammers cannot create synthetic identities without being detected. Blockchain provides a transparent, secure and verifiable system for managing identities, reducing the risk of impersonation. NFT identity markers: Some platforms use non-fungible tokens (NFT) as a form of digital identity. NFTs are unique and traceable on the blockchain, which makes it much harder to clone someone’s identity. If you’re engaging with a person who has a verified NFT identity, you can be more confident that they are who they claim to be. Immutable audit trails: Every transaction on the blockchain is permanently recorded and timestamped. This means that if someone tries to impersonate another person or create a fraudulent identity, their actions leave a trace. If a synthetic identity is used to scam individuals, the blockchain’s audit trail can help authorities track the perpetrator. Smart contract protections: Smart contracts on blockchain can be used to implement certain safeguards. For instance, smart contracts can include identity verification processes, ensuring that transactions aren’t processed unless the user’s identity is verified. This can help prevent users from sending crypto to scammers using fake identities. While not a silver bullet, blockchain can significantly strengthen trust and security in increasingly AI-powered digital environments.",cybercriminals|digital twins|scam|crypto user,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-05 08:05:00

""SEC Decision Awaited!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bloomberg-analyst-announces-today-will-be-critical-in-deep-rooted-altcoin-sec-decision-awaited/,"Following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from the SEC in 2024, ETF applications have come for many altcoins such as XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL). While the chances of these altcoin ETFs being approved in 2025 are seen as quite high, Bloomberg ETF analysts determined the chances of approval as 90 percent for LTC and SOL; 85 percent for XRP; 80 percent for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR) ETF; 75 percent for Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX). Related News: Bloomberg Shares Latest Forecasts on Altcoin ETFs: Chances of Approval Have Changed! - Solana and This Altcoin Are Ahead! What's the Latest on XRP, DOGE and AVAX? As expectations remain high, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the SEC is expected to make a decision on Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF application by May 5. While the SEC has previously postponed several filings, Canary Capital’s LTC filing was not included in the postponement decisions. At this point, Seyffart predicts that there may be a chance for the Litecoin spot ETF to receive early approval, but it is likely that the SEC will choose to delay the final decision rather than approve or deny it outright. So Seyffart said he personally expects a delay. “The Canary Funds Litecoin ETF application is expected to be decided by Monday, May 5th. The SEC has been early in other ETF filings, delaying a handful of others. But it did not delay it. This increases the chances of the LTC ETF getting approval at an early date. Because if any asset has a chance of getting approval early, it is Litecoin. Personally, I think a postponement is more likely, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on.” Litecoin (LTC) continues to trade at $87.9 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto mixing service eXch, which gained a reputation for its involvement in laundering millions in stolen funds from Bybit, seems to remain active behind the scenes despite its public shutdown in late April. Analysts at a blockchain forensic firm TRM Labs explained in a recent report that eXch continues to provide application programming interface access to its business partners, including mixers and privacy services. TRM has observed on-chain activity that suggests ongoing laundering behaviors, especially tied to its mixed-pool infrastructure. Example flow of Bybit exploit funds moving through eXch and bridging back and forth between ETH and BTC | Source: TRM Labs The analysts have linked eXch to significant criminal activity, including a long-term association with child abuse material threat actors. “We have identified that eXch has been directly exposed to more than $300,000 in CSAM-related funds. However, we expect this figure to increase as we continue our attribution on eXch.” TRM Labs The exchange’s mixed-pool mechanism, designed to fragment transactions, has raised red flags for investigators. TRM Labs explained that in a mixed pool “all received and sent transactions are mixed together and there is no way to discover how many people are behind certain addresses and traceability is extremely difficult.” This lack of transparency complicates risk assessments, as illicit deposits may be linked to legitimate withdrawals, the analysts added.

However, the protocol removed the message a few hours later — leaving “no public record of its communication on this topic,” and on April 28, the platform resumed operations, TRM Labs says. As eXch’s team earlier said , the project had become the target of a “transatlantic operation” aiming to shut it down and potentially prosecute key figures for money laundering and terrorism. Blockchain analytics firms like Elliptic and others flagged eXch as a key hub in the laundering process. Following the Feb. 21 theft that drained over 400,000 Ethereum ( ETH ) from Bybit’s cold wallet, the Lazarus Group used a web of decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and privacy tools, including eXch, to hide the stolen assets’ origin.

According to a May 5 X post from founder and CEO Star Xu, the relaunch of OKX Web3, the exchange’s self-custody wallet and DEX aggregator, comes with a real-time abuse detection system and upgraded onchain security tools designed to flag and block suspicious activity automatically. Xu described the service as a “browser and search engine for blockchain,” with the goal of enabling safer access to DeFi protocols. The restart follows a March 17 suspension of the aggregator after OKX identified attempts by the Lazarus Group to exploit its DeFi services. At the time, the exchange said it had detected “unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus Group” to “misuse” their DeFi services, prompting a temporary pause to roll out new security features. You might also like: OKX publishes proof of reserves with over 100% assets held for 22 cryptocurrencies The suspension also came amid increased regulatory scrutiny. In March, Bloomberg reported that EU financial watchdogs were investigating OKX’s DEX aggregator and wallet services for a potential role in laundering funds tied to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. OKX responded by clarifying that its Web3 wallet acts solely as a DEX aggregator and does not have custody of user assets. The firm said the concerns were based on a misunderstanding of how aggregator swaps function. Per a May 4 announcement , OKX Web3 now includes a dynamic database to detect and block wallet addresses linked to hackers and other bad actors in real time, while issuing proactive alerts to warn users about risky transactions. Additionally, it will feature wallet profiling tools that identify users as possible whales or snipers based on their activity. The company further noted that OKX Web3 had been audited by CertiK, Hacken, and SlowMist, and its infrastructure has undergone extensive testing through a bug bounty program. OKX Web3’s relaunch comes just days after OKX introduced a new self-custodial payments feature called OKX Pay. The new offering streamlines crypto transfers and allows users to send USDT and USDC stablecoins with zero fees, while retaining full custody over their assets.

The latest news on the topic informed that the central bank has picked COTI as a Pioneer Partner in its Digital Euro project. The press release shared with CryptoPotato indicated that both parties will collaborate with other organizations to develop a solution for a euro-wide central bank digital currency. The idea behind Europe’s CBDC is to complement cash and facilitate secure, fast, and even private payments across the region’s economy. “Being invited to work with the ECB on such a consequential project is humbling and a testament to the expertise and hard work of the COTI team. Privacy is a vital component for the future of Web3, ensuring user security and organizational compliance, and the same benefits apply to CBDCs. It’s critical that confidentiality is built into the core of these new systems, rather than merely being added as an afterthought,” commented COTI CEO and co-founder, Shahaf Bar-Geffen. The role of a Pioneer Partner will allow COTI to use and improve existing ECB infrastructure to “test its privacy solution for conditional payments.” According to the PR, this will help ensure that “asset provenance can be verified without exposing sensitive user information,” which is a key requirement for a CBDC system. COTI, which introduced its V2 developer network last year, has already worked on similar projects with the Bank of Israel’s Digital Shekel. It developed a proof-of-concept for “confidential, trustless cross-border transactions using garbled circuits.” The post ECB’s Digital Euro Project Taps COTI as Pioneer Partner appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|COTI|ECB|European Union,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-05 09:08:31

On May 4, Binance signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the country’s National Agency for Investments during the first meeting of Kyrgyzstan’s Council for the Development of Digital Assets, attended by President Sadyr Japarov. “Together, we aim to create a robust framework that supports the development of crypto-assets, enhances financial literacy, and opens new avenues for cross-border payments, ultimately benefiting our citizens and the broader region,” Farhat Iminov, Head of National Agency for Investments of the Kyrgyz Republic, said in an accompanying statement. As part of the MoU, Binance Pay will be introduced in the country to support crypto-based transactions for residents and visitors, and simplify cross-border payments across Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union. According to Binance, this move could “revolutionize cross-border payment solutions” and open up new opportunities for financial inclusion in Kyrgyzstan. Binance will also promote blockchain and crypto adoption via education initiatives supported by Binance Academy. The exchange will collaborate with government agencies and financial institutions to launch blockchain-focused training programs. Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance’s regional head, described the MoU as a step toward “sustainable economic opportunities,” noting that the company will continue working closely with Kyrgyz officials to deliver “innovative solutions” and empower locals. Former Binance CEO as an advisor Just a month earlier, the government signed a separate MoU with Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. Under that agreement, CZ is advising the National Investment Agency on developing a crypto regulatory framework, improving digital infrastructure, and launching educational programs in areas like cybersecurity and crypto management. According to President Sadyr Japarov, CZ’s input is seen as a key part of the country’s digital transformation strategy, with the ultimate goal of attracting foreign investment and creating new economic opportunities. Since stepping down as CEO, CZ has taken on a more behind-the-scenes role, advising multiple governments such as Pakistan, Malaysia, the UAE, and Bhutan on crypto regulation and blockchain adoption. Kyrgyzstan and cryptocurrencies Kyrgyzstan has been proactive when it comes to embracing digital finance, and this latest move builds on a series of recent efforts to position the country as a regional hub for crypto and blockchain innovation. With abundant hydroelectric resources and untapped energy potential, Kyrgyzstan has already drawn attention as a crypto mining haven. It was also one of the first countries in Central Asia to begin developing crypto-specific regulations, with the central bank starting work on draft legislation as early as 2020. Kyrgyzstan is also making progress on its own central bank digital currency . On April 18, President Japarov signed a constitutional law giving legal tender status to the digital som and authorising a pilot phase. A nationwide rollout decision is expected by late 2026.

At Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting – where Buffett announced his retirement – the Oracle of Omaha warned that the US government’s fiscal deficit can spiral out of control if policymakers fail to close the gap between revenue and expenditures. Data from the Treasury Department shows that the US has spent $1.31 trillion more than it collected so far this fiscal year, which runs from October 1st, 2024, to September 30th, 2025. The figure marks a $242 billion increase compared to the deficit recorded during the same period last fiscal year. According to Buffett, the US government cannot continue running large fiscal deficits indefinitely, warning that the country’s fiscal situation could become unsustainable and dire as early as 2027. “We’re operating at a fiscal deficit now that is unsustainable over a very long period of time. We don’t know if that means two years or 20 years because there’s never been a country like the United States… And it has the aspect to it that it gets uncontrollable to a certain point that essentially you just give up on it. Paul Volcker kept that from happening in the United States, but we came close. We’ve come close multiple times, and we still have very substantial inflation in the United States, but it has never been runaway yet. And that’s not something we want to try and experiment with because it feeds on itself. I wouldn’t want the job of trying to correct what’s going on in revenue and the expenditures of the United States with roughly a 7% gap, when probably a 3% gap is sustainable, and then the further away you get from that, the more you get to where the uncontrollable begins. I think that it’s a job I don’t want, but it’s a job I think should be done, and Congress does not seem good at doing it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The comment came during an interview aired Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press , where Trump admitted he isn’t sure if due process matters when it comes to carrying out his massive immigration crackdown. He told moderator Kristen Welker, “I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.” According to NBC, the interview focused heavily on Trump’s push for what he’s repeatedly described as the largest deportation operation in American history, a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. The administration is pressuring courts to let them kick out immigrants accused of ties to Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang—without letting them speak to a judge first. Trump says courts slow him down When asked whether he agrees with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said every person in the country is entitled to due process, Trump gave no clear answer. Kristen tried again and pointed to the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees no person—not just citizens—can be deprived of life or freedom without due process. Trump shrugged that off too. “It might say that, but if you’re talking about that, then we’d have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials,” he said. “We have thousands of people that are—some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst people on Earth.” He added, “I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it.” When Kristen asked if that means the president doesn’t have to uphold the Constitution, he answered again, “I don’t know,” then pointed to his legal team. “I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.” But the Supreme Court has already ruled three separate times that the administration must provide basic due process, including the right to appear before an immigration judge. These judges work for the Justice Department, not the courts, but still count as a legal safeguard. Even so, the administration has gone after an old wartime law to sidestep those protections. Using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, Trump’s team tried to fast-track deportations for alleged members of Tren de Aragua. That law had only been used during declared wars, but the administration now argues that the gang is basically an invading foreign force tied to the Venezuelan government. That argument didn’t hold up in court. On April 19, just hours after buses were spotted heading toward a Texas airport, the Supreme Court stepped in to stop those deportations. Men on those buses said they never got to explain or deny gang involvement before being detained. One of the biggest cases involved Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who lived in Maryland with his wife and kids. He was accused of being in MS-13, even though his wife and lawyer deny that claim. Worse, a 2019 ruling had already banned his deportation to El Salvador. Still, Trump’s administration put him on a plane and sent him back. Officials later said it was an “administrative error.” The Supreme Court ordered the government to “facilitate” Kilmar’s return so he could present his case. When Kristen asked if the U.S. is working with El Salvador to bring him back, Trump said, “I don’t know. You’d have to ask the attorney general that question.” Trump denied any violation of the court’s order. “I’m relying on the attorney general of the United States, Pam Bondi, who’s very capable, doing a great job,” he said. “I’m not involved in the legality or the illegality. I have lawyers to do that, and that’s why I have a great DOJ.” He added that they might return to the Supreme Court for more answers. “We may do that. I was asking about that. We may do that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

If so, you might have noticed a slight shift in the air. The widely followed Crypto Fear Greed Index , a popular tool for gauging crypto market sentiment , recently made a significant move, dropping out of the ‘Greed’ zone and landing squarely in ‘Neutral’. This change, recorded on May 5th, isn’t just a number – it offers valuable insights into the current mood of crypto investors. What is the Crypto Fear Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear Greed Index, developed by Alternative, is designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a thermometer for market mood. In volatile markets like crypto, emotions can play a huge role in investment decisions. Fear can lead people to sell impulsively during dips, while greed can push them to buy during bubbles, often at the wrong time. The index attempts to quantify these emotions on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are highly worried. This can signal a potential buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is cautious or negative. 50-59: Neutral – The market is balanced, neither overly fearful nor overly greedy. This is where the index currently sits at 52. 60-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or perhaps a bit too confident. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Suggests the market is overheating and a correction might be due. This can signal a potential selling opportunity. Understanding where the index stands can help investors get a broader perspective beyond just price charts. It’s a snapshot of the collective psychological state driving market movements. Understanding Crypto Market Sentiment: Fear vs. Greed At its core, the index taps into the fundamental human emotions that drive financial markets: fear and greed. When fear dominates, people tend to panic sell, pushing prices down. When greed takes over, people rush to buy, often ignoring risks, driving prices up rapidly. The shift from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ is particularly interesting. Being in the ‘Greed’ zone suggests strong positive momentum and confidence. A move back to ‘Neutral’ implies that some of that bullish energy has subsided, and the market is perhaps pausing to consolidate or is facing mixed signals. It suggests investors are no longer overwhelmingly optimistic but are taking a more balanced, wait-and-see approach. How the Index is Calculated: The Factors Behind the Number It’s important to know that the Crypto Fear Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s a composite index, meaning it pulls data from various sources to get a holistic view of the market. Alternative uses six different factors, each with a specific weighting: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility in a downward trend indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes in a bullish market indicate greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking at specific hashtags related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A high number of posts with certain keywords and rapid interaction rates can indicate growing interest and potentially greed. Surveys (15%): Polls are conducted weekly (though currently paused) to gather direct sentiment from crypto investors. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. An increasing dominance can signal fear (as people move from altcoins to the relative safety of Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can indicate greed (as people take on more risk in altcoins). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin. A sudden rise in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” suggests fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” increasing rapidly might indicate greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more objective measure of market sentiment than relying on any single factor alone. The Recent Drop: What Does the Move to Neutral (52) Signify? The index stood at 64 on May 4th, firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. Just one day later, on May 5th, it had fallen 12 points to 52, crossing the threshold into the ‘Neutral’ zone. This relatively sharp drop suggests a quick shift in collective sentiment. What might have caused this? While the index itself doesn’t provide the ‘why’, the period around May 5th, 2024, saw some fluctuations in the market. Bitcoin price , the primary driver for much of the market, experienced some minor pullbacks or sideways movement after previous gains. News events, regulatory discussions, or even macroeconomic factors could have contributed to investors becoming slightly more cautious, leading to decreased buying momentum or increased volatility signals. A move to ‘Neutral’ means the market is no longer leaning strongly in either direction. It’s a state of balance where both bulls and bears are perhaps regrouping or awaiting clearer signals. For some, this might represent a healthy consolidation period after a phase of greed; for others, it might signal a potential loss of upward momentum. Using the Index for Your Crypto Trading Strategy So, how can you use this information? The Fear & Greed Index is often cited alongside the famous quote attributed to Warren Buffett: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Applied to the index: Extreme Fear (0-24): Could be seen as a potential buying opportunity, as assets might be undervalued due to panic selling. Extreme Greed (75-100): Could be seen as a potential selling or profit-taking opportunity, as the market might be overheated. A move into the ‘Neutral’ zone is less about an extreme signal and more about understanding the current equilibrium. It suggests that now might be a time for careful observation rather than impulsive decisions driven by strong emotions. For a crypto trading strategy , Neutral could mean: Consolidating existing positions. Waiting for a clearer trend to emerge (either a push back towards greed or a fall into fear). Focusing on individual asset analysis rather than broad market sentiment. Exercising caution with new large positions. It’s a reminder that the market isn’t currently being driven by overwhelming emotion, which can sometimes lead to more rational price discovery, but also potentially slower movement. Beyond the Number: Considering Market Psychology and Other Factors While the Crypto Fear Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s crucial to remember it’s just one indicator. It provides insight into market psychology but doesn’t tell the whole story. Relying solely on the index for your investment decisions would be risky. Factors like fundamental analysis (the technology and use case of a crypto project), technical analysis (chart patterns and price trends), regulatory news, macroeconomic conditions, and overall market news are equally, if not more, important. The index is best used as a supplementary tool to gauge the emotional backdrop against which these other factors are playing out. Furthermore, the index can change rapidly. A move to Neutral today doesn’t guarantee it stays there tomorrow. Keep an eye on its daily updates. Conclusion: Navigating the Neutral Zone The drop in the Crypto Fear Greed Index from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ on May 5th reflects a cooling off in market optimism. It signals that investors are no longer exhibiting overwhelming confidence but are instead adopting a more balanced or cautious stance. While ‘Neutral’ doesn’t offer the strong contrarian signals of ‘Extreme Fear’ or ‘Extreme Greed’, it’s a significant shift that suggests the market might be entering a period of consolidation or uncertainty. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding this index and its movements is beneficial. However, always remember to combine this emotional indicator with thorough research, technical analysis, and a well-defined crypto trading strategy . The ‘Neutral’ zone is perhaps an invitation to trade with a neutral, objective mindset, free from the extremes of fear and greed.

The post , which examines both the implications of the potential deal and Ripple’s larger ambitions, frames the possible acquisition not as a simple expansion but as a structural pivot for the entire digital payments ecosystem, with XRP playing a central role. The central premise of the tweet is that if Ripple successfully acquires Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, XRP will not simply respond in price. According to All Things XRP, “XRP’s price won’t just react—it could evolve.” The tweet highlights that most market watchers are focused on whether or not the deal will happen. It stresses the importance of analyzing what such a deal could mean specifically for XRP holders. RippleNet Plus USDC: Consolidating Liquidity and Network Reach RippleNet currently uses XRP as a bridge asset for facilitating fast and low-cost cross-border payments. The tweet argues that integrating USDC’s liquidity, reported at $61 billion, into RippleNet would create a payment infrastructure too efficient for traditional banks to ignore. With both XRP and USDC operating under a single framework, Ripple could unify two of the most important components of blockchain-based payments: a native digital asset and a highly liquid stablecoin. According to the tweet, this convergence represents a consolidation strategy rather than a pivot. Ripple has already launched its stablecoin, RLUSD, which the tweet notes as a signal of its growing involvement in the stablecoin market. Acquiring Circle would bring both major stablecoin offerings—RLUSD and USDC—under Ripple’s umbrella, reducing fragmentation across its payment ecosystem. According to All Things XRP, this consolidation could strengthen XRP’s role as the connective medium, enabling more seamless interactions between assets and platforms. Institutional Trust and Market Legitimacy The tweet further notes that Circle brings with it not just a widely adopted stablecoin, but a level of regulatory trust and institutional credibility that few crypto firms possess. If Ripple were to acquire Circle, it would inherit these banking relationships and regulatory alignments. The argument is that such a development would significantly elevate XRP’s status in the eyes of Wall Street, providing the type of legitimacy that could drive institutional adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Stablecoins like USDC are already used in many financial applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to international payroll. The tweet contends that if Ripple integrates USDC into its network, it could enhance the utility and relevance of XRP by improving liquidity, reducing operational costs, and streamlining value movement across jurisdictions and sectors. The Road Ahead: Negotiations, Intent, and Strategy Ripple reportedly offered $4 billion to $5 billion for Circle, which was declined. While Ripple’s next steps are unclear, the tweet emphasizes that the intent is unmistakable. Ripple is positioning itself to gain control over stablecoin liquidity, and the tweet asserts that this strategy holds significant consequences for XRP’s future utility. All Things XRP sees this as consistent with Ripple’s recent acquisitions , including purchasing a crypto brokerage firm. The tweet calls it a consolidation pattern designed to position Ripple at the center of the global payments infrastructure, with XRP functioning as the underlying engine. Should the Circle deal materialize, XRP would transition from a bridge asset to financial infrastructure, as cross-border and cross-industry demand is redefined. Even if the acquisition does not occur, the tweet concludes that Ripple’s strategic intent remains evident. Circle may continue toward an IPO, but any renewed offer from Ripple could increase pressure to reconsider. Regardless of the outcome, Ripple’s blueprint—dominate payments, control stablecoin infrastructure, and elevate XRP as the primary bridging mechanism—is underway.

Speaking on NBC News’ Meet the Press, Trump indicated his support for digital assets, framing it as a critical issue for the United States’ global standing. This statement marks a notable shift in tone from previous skepticism expressed by figures within his political circle and highlights the growing mainstream relevance of the asset class, even within high-level political discourse. His comments immediately resonated across the digital asset community, sparking discussions about the potential implications for future US crypto policy . Trump Crypto Stance: A Geopolitical Race Against China? At the heart of Trump’s argument is a geopolitical concern. He stated, “I want crypto. I think crypto’s important because if we don’t do it, China’s going to. And it’s new, it’s very popular, it’s very hot.” This perspective frames the adoption and development of cryptocurrency not just as a financial or technological issue, but as a matter of international competition. The fear is that if the United States lags in embracing this technology, a rival nation, specifically China, could seize the lead, potentially gaining significant economic and technological advantages on the global stage. This viewpoint taps into existing anxieties about technological dominance and economic power shifts between the world’s largest economies. While China has taken a strict regulatory approach towards decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it has simultaneously been a frontrunner in developing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Trump’s comment suggests a recognition that regardless of the specific form, digital assets represent a future frontier that the US cannot afford to concede. The implication is clear: a proactive US crypto policy is essential to maintain competitive edge against the potential rise of China cryptocurrency influence. Beyond the Hype: What About Political Memecoins Like TRUMP? Trump’s comments were prompted by a question regarding whether he was personally profiting from the memecoin associated with his name, commonly known as TRUMP or MAGA (TRUMP). This particular digital asset has seen significant price volatility, often influenced by political events or statements related to the former president. The question arose in the context of a planned gala dinner for top holders of the TRUMP token, which had reportedly boosted its value. Trump directly addressed this, denying any personal financial gain from such assets. “I’m not profiting from anything,” he stated. This response attempts to distance himself from the speculative nature and direct financial ties to specific political memecoins that trade heavily on political affiliation and hype. The existence and trading of tokens like TRUMP highlight a unique intersection of internet culture, political fandom, and the speculative world of digital assets, creating a new category of assets driven primarily by community sentiment and political narratives rather than underlying technology or utility. Understanding US Crypto Policy: What Could Trump’s View Mean? A presidential candidate or former president voicing support for cryptocurrency is a significant development for the future of US crypto policy . Historically, regulatory approaches in the US have been fragmented, with different agencies asserting jurisdiction and varying levels of caution or skepticism from policymakers. Trump’s ‘I want crypto’ declaration could signal a potential shift towards a more favorable or at least more engaged regulatory environment should he return to office. A policy driven by the need to compete with China could prioritize innovation and development within the US, potentially leading to clearer guidelines, reduced regulatory hurdles for crypto businesses, and initiatives aimed at fostering technological advancement in blockchain and digital assets. This contrasts with approaches focused primarily on consumer protection or financial stability risks, which often lead to more restrictive regulations. The push for US crypto adoption might accelerate if seen as a strategic imperative. The Future of Crypto Regulation: Navigating Uncertainty While Trump’s comments are positive for the industry sentiment, the path forward for crypto regulation in the US remains uncertain. Regulatory frameworks are complex and involve multiple government bodies. Any significant shift would require coordination and potentially new legislation. Potential outcomes under a more crypto-friendly administration focused on competition might include: Streamlined licensing processes for crypto businesses. Clearer tax guidelines for digital asset transactions. Increased government support for blockchain research and development. A focus on ensuring the US remains a hub for crypto innovation, potentially attracting businesses from jurisdictions with less favorable environments. However, even with a supportive stance, concerns around market manipulation, consumer protection, and illicit finance would likely remain, necessitating a balanced approach to crypto regulation . Key Takeaways: Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights Donald Trump’s recent comments offer valuable insights into the evolving political perspective on cryptocurrency. Here’s a breakdown: Potential Benefits Highlighted: Maintaining US technological and economic competitiveness against nations like China. Fostering innovation and growth within the US digital asset sector. Potentially clearer and more favorable regulatory environment. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating complex regulatory landscapes across multiple agencies. Addressing ongoing concerns about market volatility and investor protection. Distinguishing between legitimate technological innovation and speculative assets like memecoins. Ensuring national security and financial stability while promoting adoption. Actionable Insights: Stay informed about political developments and their potential impact on regulatory policy. Understand that political rhetoric can influence market sentiment, particularly for assets like political memecoins . Recognize the increasing importance of cryptocurrency in global economic and technological competition. Advocate for clear, balanced crypto regulation that fosters innovation while protecting consumers. Conclusion: The Evolving Landscape of Politics and Crypto Donald Trump’s endorsement of cryptocurrency, driven by concerns over potential dominance by China cryptocurrency initiatives, marks a pivotal moment. It elevates the discussion around digital assets to the highest levels of political discourse and underscores the growing recognition of crypto’s strategic importance. While his denial of profiting from political memecoins addresses specific controversies, his broader stance signals a potential future direction for US crypto policy focused on competition and innovation. The path to clear and effective crypto regulation is still being forged, but statements like Trump’s indicate that the future of digital assets is increasingly intertwined with global political and economic strategies, emphasizing the need for continued attention to US crypto adoption efforts.

The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bulls gained control and rebounded the price strongly above $93K. The overall market sentiment turned bullish, creating a recovery rally for Bitcoin due to the weakening US-China tariff war.

Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future.

Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $102,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $102,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October.

More than 440 million tokens have been sold during the presale to raise $7.6 million and attracted 9,400 owners to hold MUTM. The fourth stage of MUTM’s 11-phase presale is currently taking place at $0.025 token value where traders have bought 57% of the available tokens. The market interest surge represents trader belief in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a platform which delivers impressive returns. The crypto market has identified Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a paramount project because of its practical value which is attracting investors who seek capital gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attracted many investors through its organized presale approach.

The approaching end phase creates heightened pressure for investors to buy tokens at the present rate. The project has gained popularity among Dogecoin (DOGE) holders as they establish migration toward this initiative.

The market now demands financial projects with fundamental strength after investors left their meme coin rallies behind. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents investors with a structured investment pathway while Dogecoin depends on price fluctuations controlled by market feelings. The Mutuum Finance presales enable investors to predict future earnings against Dogecoin’s price fluctuations which remain unpredictable. Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its standing in the market but its investors choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its capability to generate predictable profits.

The Dogecoin Bottom Is In The updated chart shows price printing successive wicks into a lavender demand band that begins at $0.12and tops out just below $0.15000. So far every test of that floor has been absorbed, leaving a series of higher two-day closes. “Alright, DOGE only moved slightly off the low,” Astronomer wrote, “so there still is a 6R+ trade to be scored if it were to go to the highs.” The black horizontal at $0.18210 marks the first decisive reclaim. Sunday’s session opened at $0.18141, punched to $0.18210, and settled at $0.17548—fractionally under the trigger but well clear of the grey value area that defines the analyst’s risk box. For traders running tight stops, the invalidation sits just under $0.12982, limiting downside to roughly twelve-and-a-half cents while keeping the full upside open to a $0.40000–0.48527 liquidity void shaded in emerald green. “If you want a defined risk for a defined reward,” Astronomer added, “a long as presented also makes sense.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes $1.80 In Summer Rally As Analyst Flags Breakout Structure Technically the structure mimics October 2024, when DOGE carved a rounded base at $0.10, ignited on rising volume, and topped out at $0.48527 eight weeks later. “Last time we left the range mindset was October ‘24 and we bought DOGE at 10 c,” the analyst reminded readers. “It pulled a 5x before retracing for what IMO now has become a higher low.” The projection sketched on the chart anticipates a one to two months sideways chop inside the grey band that caps at roughly $0.175, followed by a staircase advance into the low-$0.30s and an autumn test of the December pivot. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Hit $1.42 This Cycle In Bull Case, Says 21Shares None of the hand-drawn arrows pierce the old high, underscoring that the thesis is not predicated on price discovery—only on a mean-reversion to the last heavy supply node. “Given this is an altcoin and expectations are likely beyond $0.5, having heavy spot bags already pays for little risk,” he wrote. “They still may take time and take off slower than BTC, but the RR IMO will be higher.” As ever, confirmation will come—or fail—on the tape. A two-day close above $0.20000 would establish a higher-time-frame reversal and expose $0.30 liquidity, whereas a settlement beneath $0.12982 would invalidate the setup and reopen the 10-cent handle. Until then, Astronomer’s call rests on the premise that Bitcoin bottoms first, Ethereum follows, and “one by one, alts bottom out through cyclical timing, sentiment, and their respective POIs.” Dogecoin, he contends, just ticked every box. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.173.

Unlike other cryptocurrency ETF filings, Canary’s proposal has avoided early delays, sparking cautious optimism. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart has highlighted the filing’s unique status, noting that Litecoin is the most likely candidate for early approval. However, Seyffart’s temper expectations, suggesting a delay, remain the more probable outcome. James Seyffart @JSeyff · Follow The @CanaryFunds Litecoin ETF filing is due for a decision (possibly a delay) by Monday 5/5. SEC went early & delayed a bunch of filings but not this. If any asset has a chance of early approval it’s Litecoin IMO. Personally think a delay is more likely but def something to watch 1:39 AM · May 5, 2025 291 Reply Copy link Read 32 replies On March 11, the SEC postponed decisions on multiple altcoin ETFs, including Canary’s Litecoin, XRP, and Solana filings, as well as Grayscale’s Dogecoin and Litecoin proposals. This history of delays has fueled scepticism among some investors, with one X user, Panda, dismissing the ETF’s relevance due to Litecoin’s relatively modest $6.25 billion market cap. Others, however, see approval as a transformative step for altcoin investment products. The precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs lends credence to these hopes. Approval could open the floodgates for institutional investment, boosting Litecoin’s liquidity and price stability. What are the chances of approval? The crypto community is divided on the ETF’s prospects, reflecting broader uncertainty about regulatory progress. Some enthusiasts view approval as a landmark for altcoin legitimacy, drawing parallels with Bitcoin’s ETF success. Others, jaded by years of delays, express frustration, with one X user lamenting “five years of hope” without results. Seyffart’s February analysis, alongside colleague Eric Balchunas, had pegged Litecoin’s ETF approval odds at 90% for 2025 before today’s Seyffart tempered expectations. This probability, up from 85% pre-Trump re-election, reflects a shifting regulatory landscape. Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP trailed with 75%, 70%, and 65% chances, respectively. The SEC’s cautious approach stems from concerns over market surveillance and investor protections. However, Litecoin’s longevity and established infrastructure make it a “digestible” candidate for regulators. A delay today would disappoint, but align with the SEC’s conservative track record. LTC price movement flashing bullish signals Technical indicators are flashing bullish signals for Litecoin’s price as the ETF decision approaches. The altcoin recently broke through a multi-year resistance line, exiting its accumulation range of $65–$85, fueling optimism of more upside movement. This optimism is bolstered by Litecoin’s 24-hour price increase of 3.0% and a 7-day gain of 1.5%. Over the past year, Litecoin has climbed 9.2%, a steady performance for an altcoin in a volatile market. Its daily trading volume-to-market cap ratio of 5.61% reflects strong market activity. With 98.65K holders and a stable reputation, Litecoin is well-positioned for a potential surge. The Litecoin ETF approval could act as a catalyst, amplifying this upward momentum. Litecoin price prediction If the SEC approves the Litecoin ETF, the price could soar drastically. Analyst Crypto Patel predicts a breakout rally, with short-term price targets of $255–$500, with ambitious Long-term projections ranging from $1,000 to $1,458. Crypto Patel @CryptoPatel · Follow $LTC MACRO BREAKOUT – NEXT LEG INCOMING? #LITECOIN confirmed a breakout above its multi-year resistance line after holding the Best Accumulation Zone for months!🔸 Support Held: ~$65🔸 Accumulation Zone: ~$85-$65🔸 Short-Term Target: $255/$500🔸 Long-Term Target: 10:46 PM · May 4, 2025 208 Reply Copy link Read 30 replies Institutional inflows would likely drive demand, tighten supply and push prices higher. Even a delay could sustain bullish sentiment, given Litecoin’s recent technical breakout. However, a prolonged delay might dampen enthusiasm, leading to short-term price consolidation. Litecoin’s historical performance offers context: its all-time high was $410.26 in May 2021, a 78.6% drop from today’s price. Conversely, its all-time low of $1.15 in January 2015 reflects a staggering 7,551.1% growth since. These extremes highlight Litecoin’s resilience and potential for explosive rallies. With daily volumes jumping and ETF hopes fueling speculation, Litecoin is poised for volatility. A Litecoin ETF approval could propel it toward $500, while a delay might see it hover near $100.

During a May 3 livestream , Bybit CEO Ben Zhou announced that the exchange plans to roll out trading for U.S. stocks, commodities like gold and oil, and stock indices by the end of the second quarter of 2025. Soon, Bybit users will be able to trade popular U.S. stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and MicroStrategy, alongside commodities and indices, all within Bybit’s existing system. These new products will connect with the platform’s current infrastructure, including the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform, which already offers leveraged gold trading. Industry watchers see Bybit’s expansion as part of a broader trend where crypto exchanges and traditional finance are starting to blend. While Bybit brings stocks and commodities into its lineup, some traditional trading platforms are moving in the other direction, looking to offer crypto products .

The latest rollout builds on Bybit’s efforts to enhance the customer experience. Bybit is also reportedly leveraging artificial intelligence through tools like CryptoLens and TradeGPT to deliver real-time market insights, project analysis, and token-specific data. However, not everything has been smooth sailing for the Dubai-based exchange. In February, Bybit faced a massive security breach that led to the theft of 500,000 ETH, worth about $1.5 billion , marking the biggest crypto theft to date. While Zhou initially reassured users that their funds were safe and that the platform could cover the losses, he later admitted in an April 21 update that roughly 27.6% of the stolen assets have gone completely dark and are no longer traceable.

Tether Unveils New Open Source AI Project “Tether AI” with Built-in Crypto Payments At the heart of the project is a fully modular, composable, and open-source AI runtime product called “Personal Infinite Intelligence” that can run on virtually any hardware and device. According to Ardoino, the platform is designed to eliminate centralized control and dependency on API keys and create a decentralized, hardware-independent AI infrastructure. “Tether ai aims to remove the barriers to AI development. It is completely open source and designed to run anywhere with no central point of failure,” Ardoino said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). In a key innovation, the AI runtime will also support native crypto payments via an integrated WDK (likely a “Wallet Developer Kit”), allowing users to transact using USDT and Bitcoin. This is a significant step in merging the fields of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), potentially creating intelligent agents that can autonomously initiate payments on-chain. Tether AI aligns with the company’s recent diversification efforts, which include its forays into renewable energy, education, and now AI infrastructure. The project also builds on the growing interest in the decentralized AI space, where systems are not dependent on cloud providers or closed-source models. While technical details and a launch date have not yet been announced, Tether’s entry into the AI space is expected to spark discussions about AI in the context of open access, privacy, and decentralized economies. This launch comes amid a general surge in AI development in the crypto sector, with companies racing to combine machine learning with blockchain-based applications. *This is not investment advice.

Authorities in Indonesia have taken a significant step, ordering the immediate suspension of services related to Worldcoin and its digital identity platform, WorldID. Why Did Indonesia Freeze Worldcoin and WorldID? Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Komdigi) announced on its official website the decision to halt local services offered by World (formerly known as Worldcoin). This move follows a preliminary investigation into the company’s operations within the country. The core reason cited for the suspension is alleged violation of local regulations. Specifically, the investigation found that Worldcoin and WorldID were operating without the necessary registration and certification required by Indonesian law for such services. World had reportedly just begun its push into the Indonesian market in February of this year. Operating within any country’s legal framework is paramount for global projects, and the lack of proper registration appears to be the primary trigger for this WorldID suspension by Indonesian authorities. Understanding Worldcoin and WorldID in the Indonesian Context For those unfamiliar, Worldcoin is a project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Its ambitious goal is to create a global identity and financial network. At its core is WorldID, a digital identity designed to prove ‘personhood’ online, verified through a biometric scan of a user’s iris using a device called ‘the Orb’. Users who verify their identity often receive a grant of Worldcoin tokens (WLD). The project’s entry into various markets has been met with both excitement and significant scrutiny, particularly regarding data privacy and security. While Worldcoin emphasizes user control and data minimization, the collection of biometric data on a large scale raises red flags for regulators worldwide. In Indonesia, a nation with a rapidly growing digital economy and increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, the arrival of a project involving biometric scanning and digital currency naturally attracts regulatory attention. The Worldcoin Indonesia launch was relatively recent, and it seems it quickly landed on the radar of Komdigi. The Broader Picture: Crypto Regulation Indonesia Indonesia has been actively working on establishing a clear framework for cryptocurrencies and related digital assets. The country views crypto assets as commodities traded on futures exchanges, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti). However, services related to digital identity, data collection, and potentially financial services fall under the purview of different ministries and agencies, including Komdigi and potentially the Financial Services Authority (OJK). This layered regulatory environment means that projects like Worldcoin, which touch upon multiple domains (crypto, identity, data), need to navigate a complex web of requirements. The action taken against Worldcoin freeze highlights the importance Indonesian authorities place on compliance, particularly for foreign entities operating within their borders. Key aspects of crypto regulation Indonesia often focus on consumer protection, data security, and preventing illicit activities. The biometric nature of WorldID likely amplified the need for strict adherence to data protection and operational licensing rules. Implications of the Worldcoin Freeze The suspension has several immediate implications: For Worldcoin: It effectively halts their expansion and operations in Indonesia. The company will need to engage with Indonesian authorities to understand the specific requirements for registration and certification and potentially adjust their operational model to comply. For Indonesian Users: Individuals who have already verified their WorldID or received Worldcoin tokens in Indonesia may face uncertainty regarding access to services or future interactions with the platform within the country. For the Market: This serves as a strong signal to other global crypto and Web3 projects looking to enter the Indonesian market: regulatory compliance is non-negotiable and will be actively enforced. This isn’t the first time Worldcoin has faced regulatory hurdles. Countries like Kenya, Spain, and Portugal have also issued temporary suspensions or investigations into the project due to data privacy concerns. This suggests a global pattern of regulators scrutinizing the unique model Worldcoin employs. Challenges and Actionable Insights The primary challenge for Worldcoin is navigating the diverse and evolving global regulatory landscape, especially concerning biometric data. Each country has its own set of rules, and what is permissible in one jurisdiction may not be in another. For other crypto projects aiming for global adoption, the key actionable insight from the Indonesia Worldcoin situation is the critical necessity of understanding and complying with local laws from the outset. This includes: Thoroughly researching registration and licensing requirements in target markets. Engaging with local legal counsel and regulatory bodies early in the expansion process. Ensuring data handling practices align with local privacy laws, which can be stringent regarding biometric information. Being prepared for scrutiny, especially if the project involves novel technologies or data collection methods. Ignoring local regulations, even unintentionally, can lead to significant setbacks, including service suspensions and reputational damage. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Global Crypto Expansion Indonesia’s decision to freeze Worldcoin and WorldID services underscores the growing assertiveness of national regulators in overseeing global tech and crypto projects. While the specific violations relate to registration and certification, the underlying context of a project dealing with sensitive biometric data in a developing regulatory environment is undeniable. The WorldID suspension in Indonesia is a clear reminder that successful global expansion in the crypto space requires more than just innovative technology; it demands meticulous attention to legal and regulatory compliance in every jurisdiction. As the crypto landscape matures, we can expect regulators worldwide to continue tightening their oversight, making proactive compliance a critical factor for any project’s long-term viability.

Most altcoins followed suit with similar price moves, while SUI has emerged as today’s top performer. BTC Recovers From Dip to Multi-Day Lows The primary cryptocurrency had a strong week last time around as its price finally managed to break out of its prolonged trading range, in which it stood mostly between $93,000 and $95,000. The surge past the latter came on Thursday after another successful retest of the lower boundary. The bulls drove bitcoin to a new local peak of over $97,000 on Thursday and $98,000 on Friday morning. Naturally, all eyes turned to the coveted $100,000 milestone. However, there was no such challenge as the bears stepped up. Instead of heading toward a six-digit territory, the cryptocurrency reversed course and started losing value gradually. It slipped back to $96,000 on Saturday and Sunday but the Monday morning Asian trading session brought some more pain as BTC dropped to a May low of $93,600.

The police freed the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur on Sunday after the kidnappers held him hostage in an Airbnb for two days, according to Le Parisien , CNN , The Independent , and The Economic Times . French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the police did “an exceptional job” freeing the man and capturing the kidnappers.

Merci à @NunezLaurent et à la @prefpolice pour leur engagement décisif. https://t.co/e7PUr2OxzV — Bruno Retailleau (@BrunoRetailleau) May 3, 2025 Four men in ski masks forced the victim into a van on Thursday morning in Paris, the prosecutor’s office said on Sunday. “The victim turned out to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, and the incident was accompanied by a ransom demand,” the statement read. The police didn’t identify the victim or the entrepreneur. Per Le Parisien, the kidnappers demanded a ransom of between €5 million and €7 million ($5.67 million and $7.9 million). There was no payment made. Furthermore, the kidnappers allegedly severed one of the victim’s fingers. They sent a video of the injured man to his son, asking for money. “There were fears of other mutilations” if police had not raided the house, The Economic Times said, citing a source. The police have arrested five people between the ages of 23 and 27 in relation to this crime. Four of these were inside or near the Airbnb. The fifth was driving the van, which the police believe the attackers used for the crime. They’ve also opened an investigation and are exploring a number of criminal charges, including extortion by an organized gang, criminal conspiracy, and kidnapping “with torture or a barbaric act,” per The Independent.

The victim’s wife told investigators that her husband and son owned a crypto marketing firm in Malta. They’ve both allegedly received threats in the past. This highlights the growing threat wealthy crypto owners are facing, as related kidnappings have been on the rise. However, it is currently unclear whether the recent series of crypto kidnappings is linked. Yet, “obviously there’s at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it’s the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” internal security expert Guillaume Farde said on French television Sunday, as reported by CNN. It is undeniable that the latest kidnapping is quite similar to other cases in France and elsewhere. In particular, a group of people abducted David Balland , co-founder of crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger , along with his wife, from their home in central France on the morning of 21 January, 2025. The attackers cut off Balland’s finger and sent a video to the co-founder Eric Larchevêque, demanding ransom money. Meanwhile, in November 2024, kidnappers took Dean Skurka , CEO of Toronto-based WonderFi Technologies , in downtown Toronto, Canada, during rush hour and was freed after paying a $1 million ransom. In December 2024, a similar situation happened to the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stéphane Winkel. She disappeared from their home in Belgium. Luckily, she escaped after the kidnapper crashed his car during a police chase. In January this year, seven UK gang members received a lengthy prison sentence for kidnapping, torturing, and extorting a cryptocurrency investor. In February, US authorities charged six men in connection with the October 2024 kidnapping of four people from Chicago, forcing them to transfer approximately $15 million in crypto. These are just some of the many reported crypto kidnappings over the past few months alone. Be safe .

The flaw was disclosed on April 16 via a GitHub advisory posted by Anza, a Solana development team, along with a working proof-of-concept. Engineers from Anza, Firedancer, and Jito promptly confirmed the issue and began remediation efforts, according to a post-mortem published Saturday . Solana Bug Traced to ZK ElGamal Proof System At the core of the vulnerability was the ZK ElGamal Proof program, which validates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) used in Solana’s Token-22 confidential transfers. These token extensions are designed to enable privacy-preserving transactions by encrypting token balances and using cryptographic proofs to validate transfers. Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove the validity of a transaction without revealing sensitive information, such as the amount or recipient address. However, in this instance, a key algebraic component was missing from the hashing process used in the Fiat-Shamir transformation—a common technique that converts interactive proofs into non-interactive ones suitable for blockchain verification. The oversight created a potential backdoor where sophisticated attackers could craft fake proofs that would be mistakenly accepted by the on-chain verifier. Such an exploit could have enabled unauthorized minting of tokens or withdrawals from wallets without permission. Fortunately, the vulnerability did not affect standard SPL tokens or the main Token-2022 logic.

External security firms Asymmetric Research, Neodyme, and OtterSec reviewed the fixes. By April 18, the majority of validators had implemented the patch. According to Solana’s post-mortem, there is no evidence the flaw was ever exploited, and all user funds remain safe. Solana Leads Blockchain Revenue Race in Q1 2025 Solana has taken the lead among blockchain networks in Q1 2025, outpacing competitors like Ethereum and BNB Chain in total revenue. This marks a major milestone for the high-speed blockchain, driven by a surge in user engagement and an expanding ecosystem. The network’s revenue boost was powered by increased decentralized app (dApp) usage, NFT transactions, and overall on-chain activity. Solana’s scalable architecture and low fees continue to attract developers and users alike, making it a preferred platform for high-volume applications. Its growth was further supported by upgrades, strategic partnerships, and momentum in sectors like DeFi, gaming, and mobile crypto apps.

The controversial crypto identity project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has officially been suspended by Indonesian authorities following mounting concerns over user data collection. If you’ve been following Worldcoin’s rollercoaster ride across global regulators, this latest development might not surprise you but it definitely raises fresh questions. What triggered the move? And what does this mean for Worldcoin’s future, especially as it tries to gain traction in the U.S.? Let’s break it down. Suspended Over “Suspicious Activity” Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics announced the move on May 4, citing public complaints and suspicious behavior linked to the platform. Alexander Sabar, director general for digital space supervision, called the freeze a “preventive measure” aimed at protecting citizens from potential harm. The ministry is now summoning Worldcoin’s local partners – PT Terang Bulan Abadi and PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara – for further questioning. “The freezing is a preventive measure to prevent potential risk to the public,” said Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general for digital space supervision. The suspension adds Indonesia to a growing list of countries pushing back against Worldcoin’s eyeball-scanning tech. Since its 2023 launch, the project has stirred privacy debates from Kenya to Hong Kong, and more recently in Portugal and Spain, all of which have blocked or suspended its operations over biometric data concerns. It really does make you think: how safe is this? What Has Altman Set Out to Do? Worldcoin’s big pitch? Prove you’re human in an internet full of bots – by scanning your eyeball. The idea sounds straight out of a sci-fi novel, but co-founder Sam Altman sees it as the key to surviving the AI era. Every scan generates a unique “World ID,” letting users tap into the project’s crypto ecosystem. Worldcoin swears the biometric data is encrypted and fully anonymized but not everyone’s convinced. From Europe to Asia, regulators are raising eyebrows (and legal flags), questioning how much privacy users are really giving up in exchange for a digital identity. Still, Altman’s not backing down. Full Steam Ahead in America – Thanks to Trump! Under the Trump administration’s friendlier crypto stance, Worldcoin has finally entered the U.S. market. Altman, now positioning America as World’s main focus, plans to deploy 10,000 orbs nationwide. A new Texas factory is already in the works to support the rollout. Worldcoin is placing a big bet on a future where proving you’re human is the new login.

While navigating the complexities of public office and personal finances, former President Trump has faced questions regarding his involvement with digital assets, specifically a token bearing his name. His recent statements on the matter, however, appear to be at odds with publicly available blockchain records, sparking debate and highlighting the inherent transparency of decentralized ledgers. What Did Donald Trump Say About Crypto Profits? In a candid interview with NBC News, Donald Trump addressed claims that he has profited from his time in office or from the surge in value of the TRUMP crypto token. His response was direct and dismissive. Trump explicitly denied making money from the presidency and also distanced himself from the TRUMP token, stating he hasn’t “even looked” at the cryptocurrency. He downplayed any significant involvement, suggesting a lack of awareness or interest in the specifics of the digital asset tied to his name. This denial comes at a time when political figures’ interactions with the crypto space are under increasing scrutiny. The rise of politically themed tokens has added another layer of complexity to campaign finance and ethics discussions. Does On-Chain Data Tell a Different Story? Contrary to Trump’s assertion that he hasn’t profited or even looked at the token, publicly accessible on-chain data presents a different narrative. Blockchain analysis firms have tracked transactions associated with wallets believed to be linked to Donald Trump and his associates. These analyses suggest that substantial amounts of the TRUMP token were received by these wallets. More importantly, the data indicates activity that goes beyond mere passive holding. Reports detail instances where these associated wallets appear to have earned significant sums, reportedly close to $900,000, through activities such as providing liquidity for trading pairs involving the TRUMP token. Earnings derived from trading fees in this manner can be considered a form of profit, directly linked to the token’s trading volume and value. This activity reportedly occurred after tokens were offered in connection with events, such as a dinner for top token holders, further linking the asset to Trump’s orbit. Here’s a quick comparison: Trump’s Claim: Hasn’t profited, hasn’t looked at the crypto. On-Chain Data Suggestion: Wallets linked to Trump/associates received tokens and earned nearly $900,000 in trading fees. This discrepancy underscores a key aspect of the crypto world: while claims can be made verbally, the blockchain provides an immutable, transparent ledger of transactions that can often be independently verified. Understanding Political Tokens Like the TRUMP Token The TRUMP token price and its existence are part of a growing phenomenon: political meme coins or fan tokens. These tokens are typically created on blockchain networks and are designed to build a community around a political figure or movement. Their value is often driven purely by speculation, community sentiment, and association with the figurehead rather than any underlying utility or asset. The TRUMP token, specifically, gained significant traction and saw its price surge dramatically at various points, often correlated with political events or statements related to Donald Trump. While not officially launched or endorsed by Donald Trump himself in a formal capacity (like a campaign donation method), the tokens capitalize directly on his brand and public image. The line between organic fan-created projects and those with potential tacit or indirect involvement from the figure’s circle can be blurry, leading to situations like the one currently being discussed. The Power of Crypto Transparency and On-Chain Analysis This situation is a prime example of the power and potential of crypto transparency . Every transaction on a public blockchain like Ethereum (where many such tokens reside) is recorded permanently and is viewable by anyone. While wallet addresses themselves are pseudonymous (not directly tied to a real-world identity unless revealed), sophisticated blockchain analysis can often link addresses to entities or individuals based on transaction patterns, timing, and known associations. On-chain data analysis allows researchers and journalists to trace the movement of assets, identify large holders, track transactions to exchanges or other known services, and even estimate earnings from activities like providing liquidity or selling tokens. This level of auditable data stands in stark contrast to traditional financial systems, where such detailed information is often private and requires legal processes to access. The ability to analyze on-chain data is a double-edged sword for public figures interacting with crypto. It offers unparalleled transparency but also means that actions, even those managed by others on their behalf, can potentially be scrutinized and linked back to them. Challenges and Controversies Surrounding Political Tokens The emergence of political tokens like the one linked to Donald Trump crypto interests isn’t without its challenges and controversies: Speculative Nature: Their value is highly volatile and driven by hype, making them risky investments susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Association Risks: For the political figure, these tokens can create ethical dilemmas, questions about endorsement, and potential conflicts of interest, especially if they or their associates hold significant amounts. Transparency vs. Denials: As seen in this case, the transparency of the blockchain can directly contradict public statements, leading to distrust. Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal and regulatory status of such tokens is often unclear, posing risks for creators, holders, and the associated political figures. Distraction: They can distract from substantive political discourse, focusing attention instead on financial speculation tied to a candidate’s popularity. Actionable Insights for Readers For anyone interested in the intersection of politics and crypto, or simply navigating the crypto market, this situation offers valuable lessons: Verify Claims: Don’t take statements at face value, especially when significant money is involved. Use available tools to verify information. Explore On-Chain Data: Learn the basics of using blockchain explorers (like Etherscan) to view transactions. While complex analysis requires expertise, basic checks are possible. Understand Risk: Political tokens and meme coins are extremely high-risk. Their value can plummet as quickly as it rises. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Consider the Source: Understand who created the token and their motivations. Is it officially endorsed? Is it purely a fan project? Follow the Money (On-Chain): The transparent nature of blockchain means that, often, the true picture of who holds and moves assets is publicly visible, offering insights beyond public relations. The conflict between Donald Trump’s denial and the recorded on-chain data serves as a stark reminder that in the age of blockchain, financial activities related to digital assets are often far more transparent than traditional finance, making it difficult to completely distance oneself from associated profits or activities, regardless of public statements. Conclusion: The Unavoidable Transparency of Crypto The episode involving Donald Trump crypto and the TRUMP token highlights a fundamental tension: the desire of public figures to control their narrative versus the uncontrollable transparency of the blockchain. While Donald Trump denies profiting or even engaging with the token, on-chain data provides compelling evidence of associated wallets earning significant amounts. This case underscores the power of crypto transparency and on-chain data analysis as tools for accountability, offering a verifiable record that exists independently of verbal claims. As politics and cryptocurrency continue to converge, the ability to analyze public blockchain data will remain a critical factor in understanding the true nature of involvement and potential financial interests.

It was also audited by a number of well known security firms. Meanwhile, Binance is deepening its global outreach through a partnership with Kyrgyzstan’s government. The deal brings Binance Pay to the country and its main goal is to boost blockchain education, building on Kyrgyzstan’s interest in crypto mining and a national CBDC initiative. Former CEO CZ is also advising the country on crypto regulation. KuCoin is eyeing a return to South Korea after being blocked for non-compliance. The exchange’s leadership shared that it is fully committed to regulatory alignment in major markets. They also raised some concerns about inconsistent licensing standards across the EU despite the MiCA framework. Overall, crypto exchanges are making major strategic moves. OKX Revives DEX Aggregator OKX relaunched its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, OKX Web3, with a series of new security upgrades after temporarily suspending the service in March due to misuse by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. According to a May 4 statement by OKX founder and CEO Star Xu, the revamped aggregator now features a real-time abuse detection and blocking system that is specifically aimed at identifying and stopping suspicious on-chain activity. OKX Web3 operates as a browser and search engine for blockchain. It aggregates trading data from various decentralized exchanges and market makers to assist users in executing trades more efficiently. The upgraded platform also includes a dynamic database that automatically blocks suspect wallet addresses and issues proactive warnings for risky transactions. To enhance trust, OKX explained that its infrastructure was vetted by prominent blockchain security firms including CertiK, Hacken, and SlowMist, and was further stress-tested through a bug bounty program. Among the newly introduced features is a wallet analysis tool that can classify wallet holders as potential whales or snipers, providing users with much deeper on-chain insights. (Source: OKX ) OKX initially paused the DEX aggregator on March 17 to prevent further exploitation after the Lazarus Group’s misuse of DeFi services. At the time, the company promised to implement systems that could track and block hacker-linked wallet addresses. This move came shortly after Bloomberg reported that EU regulators were investigating the role of OKX’s DEX aggregator and wallet services in the laundering of funds from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack in February. OKX refuted the report, and clarified that its self-custody wallet swap feature merely acts as an aggregator and does not control user assets. The Lazarus Group’s hacking campaign also affected other platforms. Crypto exchange eXch shut down its operations on May 1 after initially denying , then later admitting, that it processed funds from the Bybit hack. Kyrgyzstan Taps Binance for Blockchain Push Other crypto exchanges are also taking steps to expand their services. Binance recently entered into a formal agreement with Kyrgyzstan’s National Agency for Investments to roll out crypto payment infrastructure and support blockchain education initiatives in the country. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed during the first meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets, which was attended by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov. As part of the initiative, Binance will launch Binance Pay in Kyrgyzstan, which will make it possible for both residents and visitors to conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies. The collaboration also places a lot of emphasis on education, and the Binance Academy is set to partner with government agencies and financial institutions to create blockchain-focused training and development programs. Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, is very excited about the partnership, and believes in its potential to foster digital asset development in the region. This move was made after former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s announcement in early April that he would advise Kyrgyzstan on crypto regulation. Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan also made progress on its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) ambitions. On April 18, President Japarov signed a law granting legal tender status to a pilot project for a CBDC known as the “digital som.” Kyrgyzstan’s increasing interest in digital assets is supported by its history in cryptocurrency mining, largely due to its rich hydroelectric power resources. The International Energy Agency shared that while more than 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s current energy supply comes from hydroelectric plants, only a fraction of the country’s potential hydropower has actually been utilized, making it a very attractive location for crypto mining operations. Binance’s agreement with Kyrgyzstan adds to a growing list of government collaborations. The exchange has been increasingly working with international regulators and policymakers to help shape crypto frameworks. In an April interview, Binance CEO Richard Teng revealed that multiple governments and sovereign wealth funds approached the exchange for assistance in building strategic crypto reserves and regulatory guidance. Earlier in the month, former CEO CZ was also appointed as an adviser to Pakistan’s newly formed Crypto Council. KuCoin Plans South Korea Comeback KuCoin is considering a return to the South Korean market after being blocked by the country’s regulators earlier this year. On March 21, South Korean authorities directed Google Play to restrict access to crypto exchanges not registered under local compliance requirements. This was followed by a similar order from the Financial Services Commission on April 11 targeting the Apple Store. KuCoin was among the exchanges affected, which rendered its platform inaccessible to South Korean users. However, the exchange has not fully withdrawn from the jurisdiction and is exploring options for reentry. In a recent interview , newly appointed KuCoin CEO BC Wong explained that the exchange is prioritizing compliance with major global markets before attempting to resume operations in South Korea. He stated that the company is engaging with regulators and that its strategy places jurisdictions like the United States, the European Union, China, and India at the forefront, followed potentially by Australia. Wong also explained that the regulatory landscape has grown significantly stricter over the past few years, speculating that local authorities might be attempting to clear the field for domestic exchanges by tightening requirements for foreign players. Meanwhile, KuCoin’s EU CEO Oliver Stauber shared some of his concerns about regulatory inconsistencies across Europe despite the introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). While MiCA includes a passporting provision that is designed to allow crypto companies to operate across the EU with a single license, Stauber said that inconsistent interpretations among member states are creating operational hurdles. He said that some regulators claim licenses were incorrectly assessed, which completely undermines the uniformity MiCA was supposed to deliver. Stauber concluded that while MiCA aimed to level the playing field, the presence of non-compliant actors still complicates efforts for fully regulated companies to operate smoothly across the region.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-05 09:54:33

Solana ( SOL ) has emerged from one of its most turbulent periods to date. Stress-tested in Q1 2025 by an unprecedented wave of memecoin launches on platforms like Pump.fun, the network faced both extraordinary transaction volume and congestion. It saw tens of thousands of new token launches in just a few months, bringing billions of dollars on-chain through millions of transactions. You might also like: Only Solana could handle a memecoin supercycle | Opinion It was a real test of how Solana would perform under pressure. Yet, rather than faltering, the network adapted and improved. From this intense period of on-chain activity, a more resilient blockchain has emerged—one that’s increasingly being seen as not just a “memechain” but as a foundational layer for stablecoins and real-world payments. The memecoin stress test Memecoins, despite their speculative nature, served a valuable purpose: they pushed Solana’s infrastructure to the limit. During the January peak, tokens like Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and MELANIA ( MELANIA ) helped drive Solana’s decentralized exchanges to a near-record $40 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Together, these two meme tokens reached a combined fully diluted valuation (FDV) of nearly $70 billion—larger than many publicly listed companies. This sent the daily trading volume on Pump.fun past the $5 billion mark, higher than Coinbase. This onslaught did expose certain issues: validators hit compute limits, RPCs throttled, and trading bots struggled to keep pace. But, in response, Solana’s core developers shipped staking-weighted Quality-of-Service to prioritize honest traffic, QUIC networking fixes to reduce packet loss, and advanced priority fees so users could cut the line transparently. In short, the network’s foundational thesis—that better hardware leads to better scalability—held up well under pressure. Stability over speculation Now that the memecoin tide has ebbed, the real opportunity is clear. Stablecoins—reliable, dollar-pegged digital cash—are seeing rapid growth on Solana. The network’s outstanding stablecoin float sits at an all-time high of around $12.7 billion , more than double the figure from a year ago and within striking distance of Ethereum’s all-time peak. Why the influx? Solana is the first L1 that combines sub-second finality, fractions-of-a-cent fees, and battle-tested throughput. Put simply, there are no roll-ups, there’s no waiting around, micro-payments are finally economical, and throughput has been thoroughly proven during the memecoin frenzy of Q1. The chain is finally ready for money markets and payment rails—exactly what mainstream users and regulators require. Real-world rails are already here Take USDG, for example. This stablecoin, issued by Paxos Digital Singapore and designed to be compliant with the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework, is now live on Solana, giving fintech firms a way to transfer US dollars worldwide in seconds for a fraction of a cent. Cheap, final settlement at internet speed is no longer just a theory, but a reality. And then there’s Franklin Templeton’s OnChain US Government Money Fund. One of the world’s largest asset managers is tokenizing money-market shares on Solana because the chain’s throughput and custody tooling already feel familiar to traditional finance ops teams. Collectively, these heavy hitters aren’t chasing memes; they’re chasing the $20 trillion global payments market that Statista pegs for 2025. If even 1% of that flow lands on Solana, it would eclipse today’s entire crypto market cap—and it’s the stability of these new rail-builders that will make it happen. Firedancer: The next upgrade There’s more good news in the pipeline, too. Later this year, Jump Crypto’s independent validator client, Firedancer , lands on mainnet, which promises 50x faster block propagation and a design ceiling of 1 million transactions per second. For stablecoin issuers and payment providers, Firedancer could be a game-changer: it offers deterministic finality, even during Black Friday-level transaction spikes. For Solana builders, meanwhile, the upgrade is the green light to aggregate liquidity across a wide range of automated market makers, order-book DEX, and RFQ venues without worrying about network stability. A call to builders Memecoins were a stress test. Stablecoins are the real opportunity. For developers working on wallets, payment apps, remittance tools, or trading infrastructure, Solana is optimized and ready, and now the next phase begins. In fact, it wouldn’t be too far-fetched to say that this is what the blockchain has been preparing for all along. Where memecoins generated attention, stablecoins promise adoption. Solana has shown it can handle volume, and with Firedancer on the horizon, it will only improve from here. For builders seeking deep liquidity, reliable performance, and low fees, Solana is an increasingly compelling choice. In fact, it is rapidly turning into the Nasdaq-grade settlement layer Anatoly Yakovenko envisioned back in 2020.

While no funds were lost and the issue was resolved without incident, the way it was handled has reignited long-standing concerns over SOL’s decentralization model. The vulnerability, quietly discovered on April 16 and addressed within two days, stemmed from flaws in the Token-2022 and ZK ElGamal Proof programs—specifically in the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs via the Fiat-Shamir Transformation. Developers say certain algebraic components were mistakenly left out of the hash function that governs proof randomness, opening a door for potential abuse. If left unpatched, an attacker could have forged a fake proof to siphon off Token-22 confidential tokens—Solana’s new privacy-enabled assets. The Centralization Question Won’t Go Away The security fix was swiftly developed by teams from Anza, Firedancer, and Jito, with independent auditing help from Asymmetric Research, Neodyme, and OtterSec. Solana validators adopted the new version in near-lockstep, helping neutralize the risk before it became public knowledge. The Foundation maintains that no malicious exploitation took place. Although the technical response was largely praised for its speed and efficiency, critics argue the closed-door approach only highlights Solana’s opaque governance. A contributor to Curve Finance questioned the Solana Foundation’s ability to coordinate with validators so seamlessly, warning that such control could, in extreme cases, lead to transaction censorship or even chain rollbacks. These comments found traction among Ethereum community members, who drew sharp contrasts between Ethereum’s multi-client ecosystem and Solana’s single-client dependence. “In Solana, the client is the protocol,” said Ethereum advocate Ryan Berckmans, warning that a bug in Solana’s lone production-ready client, Agave, effectively becomes a bug in the protocol itself. Solana Firedancer and the Road Ahead Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko pushed back , arguing that Ethereum validators are also highly coordinated and concentrated among a few players—such as Lido, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. He emphasized that coordination doesn’t necessarily equal centralization, pointing to past examples where Ethereum’s own client teams quietly pushed patches for similar issues. As a potential answer to these criticisms, Solana is preparing to deploy Firedancer , a new validator client developed by Jump Crypto. The client promises greater performance and redundancy—an important step toward reducing single points of failure. Still, experts argue that true client-level decentralization will require at least two more clients beyond Firedancer.

In a recent interview, Trump emphasized crypto’s growing popularity and resilience amid market challenges. “I Want Crypto,” Trump Declares Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump underlined the urgency for American leadership in the crypto space. When asked about concerns over profiting from his presidential role, Trump steered the conversation toward the strategic importance of digital currencies. “I want crypto,” he said. “I think crypto is important because if we don’t do it, China is going to. It’s new. It’s very popular. It’s very hot.” Trump noted that even during periods of market turbulence, cryptocurrencies held up better than many traditional financial assets. Highlighting Adoption and Attacking Biden According to Trump, the sheer level of adoption and interest in crypto makes it impossible to ignore. He criticized the Biden administration for what he described as inconsistent and politically motivated regulation of the crypto industry. He accused the current administration of initially cracking down on crypto, only to later relax its stance when it became politically convenient. Trump positioned himself as a consistent supporter of the digital asset space. Addressing Allegations of Personal Gain With questions swirling around the Official Trump Token (TRUMP), the former president sought to downplay any suggestion that he is financially benefitting from its existence. He insisted that his interest in crypto predates his latest presidential campaign. “I’m not profiting from anything,” Trump said. “I haven’t even looked.” He added, “If I own stock in something, and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.” Trump reiterated that he donated his entire presidential salary during his time in office and intends to continue that practice. When pressed on whether he would contribute any potential crypto earnings, he responded candidly: “Should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so.” Market Decline and Token Performance Despite Trump’s endorsement, the TRUMP token has seen a significant drop in value since his inauguration. Once boasting a market cap nearing $15 billion, it has since plummeted to around $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. However, the token experienced a brief resurgence last week, surging over 70% on the news that Trump would host an exclusive event for top token holders. Exclusive Dinner Sparks Controversy Scheduled for May 22 at Trump National Golf Club, the invitation-only dinner will include the top 220 wallets holding TRUMP tokens. This high-profile gathering has prompted concern across the political spectrum. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff have called for an ethics investigation, alleging that the event might be an example of “pay to play” and could signal the monetization of presidential access. Even some Republicans have voiced discomfort. Senator Cynthia Lummis, known both for her support of Trump and her advocacy for Bitcoin, openly expressed her concerns. “This is my president that we’re talking about, but I am willing to say that this gives me pause,” Lummis told CNBC. Balancing Influence and Ethics As Trump continues to lean into crypto as part of his political messaging, the intersection of personal branding, digital assets, and presidential influence is drawing scrutiny. His outspoken support for crypto may resonate with younger and tech-savvy voters, but it also raises fresh questions about transparency, conflicts of interest, and ethics in governance. With a high-stakes election looming and digital assets becoming a key part of political and economic discourse, Trump’s crypto push could shape not only campaign rhetoric but also the regulatory landscape ahead.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-05 09:59:50
44185486,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157143,1746439201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Litecoin ETF: SEC Likely to Delay Crucial Decision, Analyst Warns",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/litecoin-etf-sec-delay/,"The world of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues its complex dance with regulators, and the latest focus is shifting beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Attention is now turning to altcoins, specifically the prospect of a Litecoin ETF . Recent analysis suggests a key decision point for one such application is approaching, though a delay is anticipated. What’s Happening with the Litecoin ETF Application? According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to postpone its decision on Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin ETF application. This decision was initially anticipated around May 5th. Seyffart shared his insights on X, indicating that while a delay is probable, he still views Litecoin as having one of the strongest cases among current altcoin spot ETF hopefuls for eventual approval. This perspective highlights the nuanced view experts hold regarding the regulatory path for cryptocurrencies beyond the top two. Why is a Spot Crypto ETF Significant? A Spot Crypto ETF , like the one proposed for Litecoin, would hold the actual underlying cryptocurrency (Litecoin, in this case) as its asset. This differs from futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts. Spot ETFs are generally preferred by investors as they offer more direct exposure to the asset’s current market price. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a landmark moment for the crypto industry, bringing significant institutional interest and making investment more accessible to traditional finance participants. Spot Ethereum ETFs are currently under review, facing their own set of regulatory hurdles. The push for a Litecoin ETF signals the market’s desire for similar regulated investment products for other established cryptocurrencies. Such products could: Increase accessibility for retail and institutional investors. Potentially boost liquidity and market stability for Litecoin. Provide regulatory clarity and legitimacy to the asset class. The SEC Delay: What Does it Mean? A potential SEC delay on the Canary Capital application is not entirely unexpected. The SEC has a history of extending review periods for complex or novel financial products, especially those involving cryptocurrencies. This allows the commission more time to: Gather public comments and feedback. Evaluate market surveillance sharing agreements. Address potential concerns around market manipulation and investor protection. While delays can sometimes signal caution or uncertainty from the regulator, they don’t necessarily mean an application will be rejected. They are often part of the standard review process for novel applications like a Spot Crypto ETF for an altcoin. Litecoin’s Position in the Altcoin ETF Race James Seyffart’s comment about Litecoin having the ‘strongest likelihood of early approval’ among altcoins is noteworthy. Several factors might contribute to this view: Longevity and History: Litecoin is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, often referred to as the ‘silver to Bitcoin’s gold.’ Its long operational history provides a substantial dataset for regulators to analyze. Technical Similarities to Bitcoin: Litecoin shares many technical characteristics with Bitcoin, including a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which regulators have become more familiar with through the Bitcoin ETF approval process. Market Cap and Liquidity: While smaller than Bitcoin or Ethereum, Litecoin has a significant market capitalization and reasonable liquidity, making it potentially more viable for an ETF structure than smaller, less established altcoins. However, challenges remain. The SEC’s stance on whether certain altcoins are securities is still a point of contention and a major hurdle for any Altcoin ETF application. Understanding Crypto Regulation Challenges The path to mainstream adoption for cryptocurrencies is heavily influenced by Crypto Regulation . Regulators globally are grappling with how to classify and oversee digital assets. The SEC’s approach, particularly under Chair Gary Gensler, has often emphasized applying existing securities laws to the crypto space. Key regulatory challenges for altcoin ETFs include: Security vs. Commodity Classification: Is Litecoin a security or a commodity? The SEC’s view on this significantly impacts how it would be regulated. Market Surveillance: Ensuring that the underlying spot market is not susceptible to manipulation is a critical concern for the SEC. Investor Protection: Regulators want to ensure that retail investors are adequately protected when investing in potentially volatile assets via regulated products. The outcome of the Litecoin ETF application, whether it’s eventually approved or rejected, will set a precedent for other altcoins seeking similar investment vehicles. What’s Next for the Litecoin ETF? Given the analyst’s prediction of an SEC delay , the focus shifts to the new deadline the commission will set. Typically, these delays push the decision date back by several months, sometimes leading to multiple extensions before a final ruling. Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring official SEC filings for the updated timeline. While the delay might be frustrating for those hoping for a swift approval, it provides more time for the market to mature and for issuers to address any potential concerns raised by the regulator. It also allows other potential altcoin ETF applicants to observe the process and refine their own strategies. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors interested in the prospect of a Litecoin ETF or altcoin ETFs in general, here are a few points to consider: Stay Informed: Follow official SEC announcements and reputable financial news sources for updates on the application status. Understand the Asset: Before investing in any crypto asset or related product, thoroughly research the underlying technology, use case, and market dynamics of Litecoin. Regulatory Risk: Be aware that regulatory decisions can significantly impact crypto prices. The path to approval for altcoin ETFs is less clear than it was for Bitcoin. Diversification: As with any investment, consider diversification and align potential investments with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Summary: Waiting Game for Litecoin ETF Hopefuls The anticipated SEC delay on Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF application underscores the cautious approach regulators are taking with Altcoin ETF products. While an analyst believes Litecoin has a relatively strong case among its peers, the complexities of Crypto Regulation mean that approvals are far from guaranteed and often involve lengthy review periods. The market will now wait for the SEC to announce a new deadline, continuing the patient watch for the next step in the evolution of regulated spot crypto products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A Huge Move Worth $9 Billion Has Arrived!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/maldives-turns-to-cryptocurrencies-in-cash-struggle-a-huge-move-worth-9-billion-has-arrived/,"The Maldives is set to boost its local economy with a $9 billion move. The Maldives is looking to diversify its local economy by embracing blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported. Accordingly, the Maldives has announced plans to build a $9 billion blockchain center with the aim of attracting global investors by tapping into the potential of the cryptocurrency market. At this point, the Maldives government signed a deal with Dubai-based MBA Global Services to build a $9 billion blockchain center to attract crypto investors. Dubai-based MBA Global Services is providing up to $8.8 billion for the blockchain hub, leveraging its network of high-net-worth individuals and asset management firms to fund the project. The plan is expected to help cash-strapped Maldives weather its impending debt crisis. Maldives Finance Minister Moosa Zameer said this plan is a big step towards diversifying the country's economy away from tourism and fishing. “The debt that is due to be paid in the next two years remains our biggest challenge. At this point, the agreement we have made with MBA Global Services will relieve us of some of the difficulties we are in and provide a potential boost to our economy,” Zaamer said. The $9 billion blockchain hub project, dubbed a “global financial free zone for blockchain and digital assets,” is expected to triple the Maldives' GDP in four years and generate well over $1 billion in revenue in the fifth year. *This is not investment advice.

According to data from Tokenomist, the upcoming unlocks include both cliff-style events. LAYER will lead the cliff-style unlocks with 27.02 million tokens worth $86.73 million entering circulation, while Solana tops the linear unlocks with 465,770 SOL valued at $67.27 million. LAYER unlocks $86.73 million worth of tokens LAYER sets the pace for the list of future cliff-style token launches with 27.02 million tokens valued at $86.73 million to be unlocked. This unlock represents 12.87% of the total unlock supply for LAYER. It is the largest by value of all token releases during this period. Following LAYER is ENA, which has 171.88 million tokens worth $49.52 million in wait to be released. ENA’s release will boost its available supply by 3.10% and is the second largest in value in this form. SPEC will have 10 million tokens worth $21.30 million up for unlocking. That is a huge 48.51% of its unlock supply. The percentage is high, meaning a lot more tokens will be unlocked, possibly changing the token’s market condition. Source: Wu Blockchain KAS holds 144.64 million tokens worth $13.39 million to be unlocked. This is just 0.55% of unlock tokens. Other large unlocks include MOVE with 50 million tokens worth $8.45 million (2.00% of unlock supply) and NEON with 53.91 million tokens worth $6.10 million (6.93% of unlock supply). Together, the six cliff-style unlocks will introduce approximately $185.49 million of tokens to circulation. That is virtually half of all the tokens in total value which will be released between May 5 and May 12. Solana leads linear unlocks Solana (SOL) continues to always lead the linear token unlock category with 465,770 SOL tokens valued at $67.27 million scheduled for gradual release. Despite this substantial dollar value, the unlock is only 0.09% of Solana’s circulating supply. Worldcoin (WLD) follows as the second-largest linear unlock, with 37.23 million tokens worth $34.60 million set to be released. This is 2.84% of WLD’s circulating supply and is a more substantial portion than Solana’s unlock. TAO ranks third with just 50,400 tokens valued at $17.38 million scheduled for unlock. TIA follows closely with 6.96 million tokens worth $16.63 million (1.13% of supply), and Dogecoin (DOGE) will see 96.52 million tokens worth $16.53 million (0.06% of supply) unlocked. Other notable linear unlocks include Avalanche (AVAX) with 700,000 tokens valued at $13.92 million (0.17% of supply), SUI with 3.35 million tokens worth $10.85 million (0.12% of supply), MORPHO with 6.80 million tokens valued at $9.32 million (2.85% of supply), and Polkadot (DOT) with 2.30 million tokens worth $9.09 million (0.15% of supply). IP rounds out the major linear unlocks with 2.32 million tokens valued at $8.74 million. Combined, these linear unlocks account for approximately $203.7 million of the total $389 million in token unlocks scheduled for the week. Less popular unlocks Aside from the significant token unlocks, there are also some smaller projects that anticipate unlocking tokens between May 5-12. The smaller unlocks might not create a lot of hype in the market but might also affect their respective token prices. Statistics from CoinMarketCap show that SIPHER (SIPHER) has unlocked 16.07% of its tokens. The second unlock coming up will give 13.25 million SIPHER tokens which are roughly valued at $587,241. That is 1.32% of the tokens that are locked. Berachain (BERA) has 21.42% of their tokens released and will be sharing 10 million BERA tokens soon. That is approximately $29.53 million. This is 1.99% of all of the locked BERA tokens. Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) has unlocked 17.66% of its unlocks with 10.77 million MAVIA tokens set to be released. This amounts to approximately $2.38 million. This is 4.19% of the locked supply. ZeroLend (ZERO) has released 59.72% of its tokens. Then, it will release 3.49 billion ZERO tokens valued at $338,111, which represents 3.49% of the locked tokens. Animalia (ANIM) has released 69.77% of its tokens. It will release 2.83 million ANIM tokens valued at $2,648, which represents 2.60% of the locked tokens.

In a May 5 X post , Buterin explained that there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization. Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security: “Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“ Rollup development is classified into stages: stage zero, stage one and stage two. Each stage is increasingly decentralized, with stage two being fully decentralized and trustless. Related: Vitalik Buterin’s vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyond Code that experienced war Cryptocurrency systems that manage significant assets are exposed to profit-motivated bad actors worldwide. Even if a project does not feature a bug bounty program promising payments to people who find vulnerabilities, it is still taken apart under a microscope — it may just pay more for found faults. This threat is growing as nation-state-backed bad actors increase their crypto activity level. One such example is the Lazarus hacking group , responsible for many high-profile hacks in the crypto space, including the $1.4 billion ByBit hack . Wang suggested introducing a new metric for veteran code that survived the pressure of being exposed to highly motivated advanced hackers and hacker groups: “BattleTested.” The BattleTested badge would be awarded to a rollup that consistently secured at least $100 million of assets for at least six months, with at least $50 million being in Ether ( ETH ) and a major stablecoin. Also, this badge would be lost at every update, as the new code needs to survive the onslaught of attackers to earn it as well. Buterin commented on the analysis: “A good reminder that stage 2 is not the only thing that matters for security: the quality of the underlying proof system matters too.“ Analyst at Kronos Research Dominick John told Cointelegraph that “to responsibly transition from stage 1 to stage 2, rollup teams must take a hard look at correlated risks like shared custody weaknesses or geopolitical chokepoints that can compromise the reliability of multisig security councils.” He said that such risks often go unnoticed until the locked value crosses $100 million. He added: “The real green light for decentralization comes not when the proof system looks good on paper, but when it proves under real economic pressure that it’s more reliable than the potential for coordinated failures among council members.“ Related: Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 years When to go decentralized? Buterin explained that the best time for a protocol to go decentralized is when its onchain proof system is safe enough for the centralized components serving as a centralized point of failure or collusion risk to be the bigger threat. This is because until a system is proven to be secure enough, decentralization, which increases the reliance on this system, may end up making the system less secure. Chart showing example rollup risk analysis per stage. Source: Vitalik Buterin Mike Tiutin, chief technology officer at decentralized compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “going decentralized too early […] can leave users vulnerable.” John explained that “decentralization isn’t a race, it’s a long-term responsibility shared by the entire ecosystem.” He explained that rushing to stage two puts ideology before safety and increases risks: “In stage one, councils can step in if something breaks. In Stage 2, a single bug could wipe out billions with no rollback.” While going decentralized right away is recognized as problematic, many experts highlight the issue of not going decentralized at all. Arthur Breitman, co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told Cointelegraph that “prominent Ethereum L2s” are “fundamentally custodial”: “Privileged entities control core logic, jeopardizing asset integrity; banking on their immunity to collusion is fragile, and failure is likely to be correlated.“ Magazine: What are native rollups?

A market cap of $76.18 billion still keeps SOL firmly within the large-cap space, though traders wonder whether another five-times rally is in the cards following the recent upgrades on the chain. Below, we analyze the catalysts, on-chain metrics and one surprise partner Remittix that could carry this rally much further. Solana Price Prediction and the Firedancer Effect Jump Crypto’s Firedancer validator client is due for a public testnet this quarter. Developers characterize it as lifting throughput into hundreds of thousands of transactions per second without sacrificing composability. Every time Solana boosts raw speed, fee markets tighten and memes balloon as seen when BONK and PENGU skyrocketed this spring. Messari analysts believe that a stable block time of 1 ms can justify a Solana Price Prediction of more than $600 during the next bull cycle. Worldpay is already committing to that scale. Worldpay chose Solana for new USDG stable-coin rails with an option for near-instant merchant settlement and teaser fees virtually zero. Even if only a small percentage of Worldpay’s seven million daily transactions switch over, fee-burn pressure alone would cut SOL inflation in half, rendering the token effectively deflationary. That choice feeds directly into the forever bullish Solana Price Prediction models shared on Crypto Twitter. On-Chain Statistics Indicate Sneaky Accumulation Beneath the red candles lies the truth: whale wallets are piling up. The addresses in the top 100 picked up 1.9 million SOL last month, equivalent to approximately $280 million at current rates. Meanwhile, exchange reserves fell to an 18-month low, per data observers at CoinGlass. That supply constraint is reflected in increasing staking: 72% of coins in circulation are now locked up, the highest since mid-2023. Derivatives support the bid. Binance funding rates went positive again and open interest rose by 12% while price traded sideways. If funding is bullish during consolidations, past cycles suggest that a breakout will arrive in weeks. Perpetual traders are thus writing in $180 as initial resistance and $220 as the breakout point that validates each aggressive Solana Price Prediction being thrown around Telegram groups today. Remittix Partnership Could Reveal a New Channel of Demand Why mention Remittix from a SOL angle? Because the pay-up start just made an announcement of a Solana Pay hook to go live before Q4. Remittix already lets users send Bitcoin, Ethereum or XRP and get local cash in a bank account within minutes. When that hook comes online, SOL holders will be integrated into that pipeline, burning a fraction of RTX per conversion along with enticing a micro-fee in SOL. The tie-in is important for two reasons. First, Solana gets another real-world use case beyond DeFi speculation that drives up daily active wallets. Second, customers of Remittix, many of whom are in high-remittance countries, will be holding small balances of SOL to pay for network fees, building a long-tail demand curve that increases slowly with every corridor that the bridge facilitates. Delphi Digital, a research company, projects that if Remittix is able to catch even 1% of the $830 billion sent in remittances every year, the network has the potential to see an extra 18 million new transactions per day, fueling new fire for any medium-term Solana Price Prediction. Can SOL 5× Realistically From Here? A leap to $735 implies a $380 billion valuation, high, but not impossible if a new alt-season replicates 2021’s multiples. Solana would likely need three things: Firedancer’s live launch, a name-brand ETF approval for a smart-contract index (where SOL would carry heavy weight) and ongoing meme-coin mania that fuels blowout volume. History is in its favor. During the 2020-2021 cycle, ETH rose 40× from pandemic lows, driven by DeFi Summer and NFTs real usage and storytelling. It is the same cocktail here: high-speed rails, real merchant adoption via Worldpay and Remittix and a culture that produces tokens that become viral overnight. When all those factors are in place, a 5× Solana Price Prediction no longer becomes crazy and starts to appear just aggressive. Remittix: The Small-Cap Giant in the Giants’ Shadow While SOL competes for hundreds of billions, Remittix (RTX) targets the same payments market but with a $60 million cap. Early investors have bought 531 million tokens at $0.0757 a piece and the project has raised over $14.7 million so far. Each crypto-to-cash exchange incinerates some RTX, locking adoption into scarcity, a playbook that turned BNB and LEO into multi-billion-dollar assets. Staking is live, issuing bridge fees to holders themselves. That makes RTX a machine generating yield while investors patiently wait for price appreciation. If RTX captures just 10% of XRP’s $130 billion cap over the next several cycles, the token would be 170× from here. Even a more modest spike to a $600 million mid-cap would still trounce a successful 5× Solana Price Prediction by a large margin. For parity-risk portfolios, the majority of analysts today suggest a blend: 50% SOL for blue-chip exposure, 50% RTX for asymmetric upside. The two complement each other Remittix rewards more on-chain turnover, while Solana velocity keeps bridge fees infinitesimal, creating a feedback loop that might reward holders of both in the long term. Don’t Snooze on Cross-Border Rails Crypto history favors networks that solve genuine problems. Solana halves settlement times for high-frequency apps; Remittix halves settlement times for humans moving money across borders. Both combined provide a payments stack that the old providers can’t compete with. Bottom line: if Firedancer settles in smoothly and Remittix turns on those extra fiat rails, the next five-times move could be here sooner than most models predict. Keep the charts open, but observe the real-world rails because that is where tomorrow’s size-defying gains will be made.

XRP, BTC, SOL, and MAGACOINFINANCE Look Strong for May",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/momentum-rising-xrp-btc-sol-and-magacoinfinance-look-strong-for-may/,"As May continues, momentum is returning across the digital asset market. Leading this potential shift are Ethereum , Bitcoin , Solana , and the emerging early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE . While top-tier assets strengthen their positions, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly building traction and may be one of the few projects still offering early-phase entry for serious long-term upside. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Transitioning Into Visible Growth Mode Every successful crypto project moves from early groundwork to mainstream traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is now entering that crucial phase. Wallet adoption is rising. Community engagement is growing organically. Development milestones are being met consistently. These are the clear indicators of a project moving from silent build-up to broad investor recognition. Those entering now are acting on real-time progress, not speculation. Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana Maintain Market Leadership Bitcoin (BTC) remains the central asset in digital finance. With increasing institutional access via ETFs and global adoption trends, its role as a macro safe-haven is secure. Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate smart contract deployment, scaling innovation, and enterprise blockchain activity, with strong momentum from Layer-2 adoption and tokenization use cases. Solana (SOL) is gaining traction with developers and users for its low fees, fast transaction speed, and increasing relevance in decentralized applications and digital marketplaces. These projects are well-established. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, offers an opportunity to enter during the growth phase—before broad market saturation. Additional Movers Supporting Market Expansion Uniswap leads the decentralized exchange space with high liquidity and a wide user base. Polkadot continues to develop scalable, interoperable blockchain environments through its parachain architecture. Litecoin remains a trusted peer-to-peer transaction asset with consistent speed and low transaction fees. These projects contribute to a strong market foundation—but MAGACOINFINANCE remains in an early discovery window where exponential returns are still possible. Final Insight May may mark a turning point in momentum. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are reinforcing their dominance—while MAGACOINFINANCE signals that it’s preparing for a significant move upward. With verifiable fundamentals and growing attention, the chance to get in early is narrowing.

Market Outlook,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/bitcoin-btc-next-upside-surge-or-continued-rollover-market-outlook,"From just shy of $98,000 last Friday, the Bitcoin (BTC) price rolled over to hit support at $94,000 on Sunday. Will the price continue to fall, or, with a higher low in place, is a new upside wave taking place that could breach $100,000? Aside from the ever-present market nervousness over the Trump tariffs, and the potential for market skittishness when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell makes his speech after the FOMC meeting this Wednesday, things are relatively calm. 90 days to complete trade talks unrealistic? Many talks aimed at new trade agreements are currently taking place between US officials and their counterparts. While the Trump administration has stated its goal of “90 deals in 90 days”, this does appear to be unrealistic based on an average of 1.5 years from launch to signing of previous Free Trade Agreements, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). That said, if President Trump’s teams are able to pull off some quick deals within this time frame, these would then probably be announced towards the end of this Summer, possibly leading to a surge in the stock market, assuming that an economic crash does not occur in the intervening period. Markets for stocks and equities are generally believed to have a price horizon from 6 months to 18 months into the future, with 12 months being a general average. With the stock market currently rallying, it will be interesting to see if this continues, giving a signal that the market believes the deals will be done. $BTC fake-out rally Source: TradingView As can be seen in the 4-hour chart above, the rally up to nearly $98,000 eventually resulted in a fake-out. Once the rally ran out of steam, the price rolled over and the top of the ascending triangle was not able to hold it. The price fell through and hit the redrawn bottom trend line of the triangle. The good news is that it has bounced from there, and should it hold the current resistance/support level, it is likely to break out again. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is signalling a cross back up, and this is the case for the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs as well. Upside price momentum is arriving again. $BTC price returns to confirm support Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that this latest correction was probably needed. It wasn’t healthy for the price to continue straight up, and so this return to confirm the $94,000 horizontal support level (orange line) is absolutely fine. As long as the bounce does take place from here, a higher low will have been made and the uptrend can continue. The next target would be the higher high at $99,500 (blue line). If this level can be taken out, and $BTC can confirm above, there won’t be too much in the form of resistance before the all-important $106,000 level. $94,000 must be held as support Source: TradingView In the weekly time frame it’s quite straightforward. Bitcoin needs to hold the $94,000 horizontal support level. In favour of the bears, the last weekly candle did close beneath, and a reasonably sized wick was left behind. The current price action needs to see a confirmation above this level in order to help cancel this last bearish candle out. The Stochastic RSI has the indicators still rising nicely. This price momentum has to push $BTC up above the all-time high before the indicators hit the top and come back down again. Otherwise this would be a failed rally. Things do look good for the bulls up to now, but if the price does start to falter, perhaps for more than a week or two, predictions would have to be revisited.

His message? Ignore the fear, follow the money, and get ready for a historic bull run—especially in crypto. In his speech, Raoul Pal revealed that despite the current bearish market sentiment , cryptocurrency is gearing up for a bullish surge. He calls this phase “the Banana Zone,” where the market will experience explosive growth. Liquidity: The Key Driver Behind Bitcoin and the Nasdaq Pal emphasizes the connection between liquidity and asset prices, highlighting that as liquidity increases, so do asset prices. He pointed out that 90% of Bitcoin’s movements and 97% of Nasdaq’s movements are tied to liquidity levels. Every year, inflation and currency debasement erode wealth by at least 11%—8% from currency debasement and 3% from global inflation. This underscores the need to grow wealth faster than these rates to avoid falling behind. Why Millennials Are Turning to Crypto With housing markets becoming unaffordable, especially for millennials, Pal argues that this generation is turning to crypto to escape the traditional investment traps, accepting the volatility for the opportunity to grow wealth. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin has delivered an average yearly return of 130% since 2012, with the market growing by 48.4% in the last year alone. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin has surged 13.3%, reaching a price of $94,600.66, with an 8.2% rise in the past 14 days. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : After a Slight Pullback, Bitcoin Price is Ready for a Bounce-Here’s Where it May Lead! , Pal draws parallels between today’s market and the scenarios of 2020 and 2009. While retail investors are already buying, institutions have yet to enter the market. According to Pal, the Bitcoin market is currently in the third phase of his Banana Zone framework—the Mania Phase. During this phase, Bitcoin and altcoins could experience massive growth. Pal predicts Bitcoin could reach between $250K and $450K in this cycle, with altcoins possibly seeing 20x gains, similar to the 2017 bull run. Pal offers advice for investors to succeed in this bullish phase: stay calm, avoid leverage and scams, protect crypto wisely , and follow liquidity trends. He stresses using macro tools to stay ahead in this evolving market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44185839,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157144,1746439815,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hot Wheels NFTs: Mattel’s Shocking Pause on Future Digital Collectibles,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mattel-pauses-hot-wheels-nfts/,"In a move that has caught many in the Web3 and collectibles space by surprise, American toy and entertainment giant Mattel has announced a significant shift in its approach to Hot Wheels NFTs. The company is officially halting all future releases of its Hot Wheels Virtual Garage digital collectibles. This decision marks a pause on new series and feature drops within the platform, signaling a re-evaluation of their strategy in the current NFT Market . For collectors and enthusiasts who have already dipped their toes into the world of Mattel NFTs , there’s a crucial detail to note: the existing NFTs, the marketplace where they are traded, and the associated community channels are not being shut down immediately. Mattel has stated that these operations will remain live and functional through at least 2025. This provides a degree of continuity for current holders, allowing them time to manage their existing digital collectibles . What Exactly Was the Hot Wheels Virtual Garage? Before diving into the reasons behind the halt, let’s quickly recap what the Hot Wheels Virtual Garage platform offered. Launched as Mattel’s foray into the Web3 space, it aimed to merge the nostalgia and collectibility of physical Hot Wheels cars with the innovative technology of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform allowed users to purchase digital packs containing Hot Wheels car NFTs. These weren’t just static images; some offered 3D models, unique animations, and varying levels of rarity, mirroring the thrill of collecting physical Hot Wheels. A key feature was often the ability to redeem certain rare NFTs for physical, limited-edition die-cast cars, creating a bridge between the digital and physical worlds that Mattel is famous for. The Virtual Garage represented Mattel’s ambition to engage a new generation of collectors, explore new revenue streams, and position itself within the evolving landscape of Web3 and blockchain technology. It joined a growing list of major corporations experimenting with Brand NFTs to connect with audiences in novel ways. Why Did Mattel Initially Enter the NFT Space? Entering the NFT space wasn’t a random decision for a company like Mattel. It was a strategic move likely driven by several potential benefits: New Revenue Streams: Selling digital collectibles offers a direct new income source, potentially with lower production and distribution costs compared to physical goods. Enhanced Fan Engagement: NFTs can create exclusive communities, offer unique digital experiences, and provide new ways for fans to interact with beloved brands like Hot Wheels. Embracing Innovation: Exploring Web3 technologies positions Mattel as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing digital landscape. Digital Ownership: NFTs provide verifiable proof of ownership for digital assets, a concept appealing to collectors. Bridging Physical and Digital: The redemption feature for physical cars leveraged the unique capabilities of NFTs to link digital assets to tangible rewards. These were compelling reasons for many brands, including Mattel, to experiment with digital collectibles. What Factors Might Have Led to the Halt in Future Hot Wheels NFT Releases? While Mattel hasn’t released an extensive explanation for pausing future Hot Wheels NFTs, several factors within the broader NFT Market and the specific challenges of launching Brand NFTs could be at play: NFT Market Downturn: The peak of the NFT craze was in 2021 and early 2022. Since then, the market has experienced a significant downturn, with trading volumes and floor prices for many collections plummeting. This ‘crypto winter’ has undoubtedly impacted demand and profitability for new NFT projects. Lower-Than-Expected Adoption/Sales: While initial drops might have seen interest, sustained engagement and sales for subsequent series might not have met Mattel’s internal targets, making continued investment in new releases less attractive. Complexity and User Experience: For mainstream consumers, interacting with NFTs often involves navigating crypto wallets, blockchain networks, and marketplaces, which can be complex and a barrier to entry compared to traditional online purchases. High Costs: Developing, marketing, and maintaining an NFT platform and releasing new collections involves significant costs. Brand Perception & Criticism: NFTs have faced criticism regarding their environmental impact and association with speculation, which could be a concern for a family-friendly brand like Mattel. Strategic Shift: Mattel might be re-evaluating its overall digital strategy, deciding to focus resources elsewhere or explore different Web3 applications beyond direct digital collectibles sales. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for NFTs and cryptocurrencies remains uncertain in many regions, which can pose risks for large corporations. It’s likely a combination of these factors contributed to the decision to pause new Mattel NFTs. What Does This Mean for Existing Hot Wheels Digital Collectibles Holders? The key takeaway for current owners of Hot Wheels NFTs is that their assets are not immediately becoming worthless or inaccessible. Mattel’s commitment to keeping the platform, marketplace, and community channels operational through at least 2025 is significant. This provides a window for holders to: View and showcase their collection. Trade their NFTs on the official marketplace. Potentially redeem eligible NFTs for physical items if that feature remains active. Engage with the community. However, the halt on future releases means there won’t be new content added, which could impact long-term engagement and the perceived value of the collection over time, especially as the 2025 deadline approaches. The future of the platform beyond 2025 remains uncertain, which is a risk inherent in holding Brand NFTs tied to a specific corporate platform. Lessons from Mattel NFTs and the Brand NFT Space Mattel’s experience with Hot Wheels NFTs offers valuable lessons for other companies considering or currently involved in the Brand NFTs space and for consumers interested in digital collectibles: Market Volatility is Real: The success of brand NFT projects is heavily influenced by the broader NFT Market sentiment, which is highly volatile. Mainstream Adoption is Challenging: Getting non-crypto native consumers to engage with complex Web3 platforms requires significant education and a seamless user experience. Utility Matters: Projects that offer tangible utility (like physical redemption) or ongoing digital experiences may fare better than those relying solely on speculative value. Long-Term Strategy is Crucial: Brands need a sustainable, long-term vision for their Web3 initiatives, not just one-off drops. Platform Risk: NFTs hosted on proprietary brand platforms (like Mattel’s Virtual Garage) carry the risk of the platform being discontinued or changed, unlike NFTs on decentralized public blockchains. Mattel is not alone; several other brands have scaled back or shuttered their initial NFT efforts as the market cooled and the complexities became apparent. However, many continue to explore Web3 in different forms, suggesting that while the initial gold rush for simple digital collectibles may be over, the underlying technology for fan engagement and ownership isn’t being abandoned entirely. Is This the End for Mattel in Web3? The halt of future Hot Wheels NFTs releases doesn’t necessarily mean Mattel is exiting the Web3 space entirely. It’s more likely a strategic pivot or a temporary pause to re-evaluate their approach. They might explore other blockchain applications, partnerships, or wait for market conditions to improve before launching new Mattel NFTs or Web3 projects. The commitment to keeping the existing platform running until at least 2025 suggests they are managing the transition responsibly for their current users. Conclusion: A Reflective Moment for Brand NFTs Mattel’s decision to halt future Hot Wheels NFTs releases is a significant development in the Brand NFTs space. It underscores the challenges companies face in navigating the volatile NFT Market and integrating complex digital collectibles into their core business and customer experience.

In a new video update to YouTube, Wood says markets are in the process of shifting away from fears about interest rates, concentration of capital, and high valuations. “We’re really excited about how the market is beginning to shake off three headwinds: interest rates, narrowness of the market and valuation. And we think that we’re being set up here for some important surprises to the upside. As many strategists and economists worry that we’re heading into a recession, we’ll be talking more and more about the productivity-driven recovery that will spell the end of the rolling recession. We’ll know a lot more by this time next month.” Looking at Bitcoin, Wood shares a chart of BTC priced in gold that appears to show a major uptrend over the last decade. According to the investor, Bitcoin is ready to resume its uptrend versus gold after a correction during the precious metal’s recent rally to new highs. “Gold going parabolic did take this ratio down, but you’ll notice that it did not break the uptrend that is in place and that we think will remain in place. Bitcoin did act more as a risk-on asset in the market’s recent correction. It behaved like the Nasdaq, unlike gold, but we believe it was just correcting to this trend line because the Bitcoin price went up so much more than the gold price last year.” Source: Cathie Wood/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,661.

44188722,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157230,1746445848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Bitcoin Dominance Analysis: Altcoin Season Hopes Fade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-dominance-altcoin-season-2/,"Are you waiting for the explosive returns that an altcoin season can bring? Many cryptocurrency investors are, but recent crypto market analysis suggests those expectations might be premature. A key indicator, Bitcoin dominance , is on the rise, historically a sign that the broader altcoin market is not yet ready for a widespread rally. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Why it Matters Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Think of it as Bitcoin’s share of the entire crypto pie. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it means a larger portion of the money flowing into crypto is going into BTC compared to altcoins. Conversely, when dominance is low, altcoins are attracting relatively more capital. Why is this metric so important for understanding the potential for an altcoin season ? Historically, major altcoin rallies tend to occur when two conditions are met: Declining Bitcoin Dominance: As investors take profits from BTC gains or rotate into riskier assets, capital flows out of Bitcoin and into various altcoins. Rising Total Crypto Market Cap: This indicates new money is entering the overall crypto ecosystem, providing fuel for altcoins to grow even as Bitcoin’s relative share decreases. The combination of these factors creates an environment where altcoins can not only gain value but also gain value *faster* than Bitcoin, leading to the often-hoped-for ‘altcoin season’ where many altcoins experience significant percentage gains. What the Current Crypto Market Analysis Reveals According to a recent Chart of the Day shared by Matrixport on May 5th, the current market conditions paint a different picture than what’s typically seen before an altcoin season. Their crypto market analysis highlights two primary concerns: Increasing Bitcoin Dominance: Instead of declining, Bitcoin’s share of the market is growing. This suggests that capital is consolidating in BTC rather than dispersing into altcoins. Factors contributing to this could include Bitcoin’s status as a primary gateway for institutional investment, its perceived ‘safe haven’ narrative during uncertain times, and the recent attention surrounding the Bitcoin halving and spot ETF performance. Lackluster Altcoin Performance: Beyond the rising dominance, the performance of leading altcoins has been underwhelming. Even major players like Ethereum are not showing the strong momentum typically needed to kickstart a broader alt rally. There’s a notable absence of compelling new narratives or breakthrough technologies driving significant excitement and investment into a wide range of altcoins this cycle, unlike previous bull runs fueled by DeFi, NFTs, or specific Layer 1 innovations. This combination of rising Bitcoin dominance and weak altcoin performance significantly reduces the probability of an imminent, widespread altcoin season . Why Aren’t Altcoins Keeping Pace with BTC Price? While the BTC price has seen significant movements, many altcoins have failed to keep pace. Several factors could be contributing to this: Capital Concentration: Institutional money and even retail focus remains heavily concentrated on Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, Ethereum, particularly through accessible investment vehicles like ETFs. Risk Aversion: In a volatile market, investors might prefer the relative liquidity and perceived safety of Bitcoin over smaller, less established altcoins. Lack of Fresh Catalysts: Unlike previous cycles, there isn’t a dominant, sector-wide narrative (like the ICO boom, DeFi summer, or NFT craze) driving speculative capital into a broad range of altcoins. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing regulatory discussions in various jurisdictions can create hesitancy around investing in certain altcoin categories. The current Ethereum performance, often seen as a bellwether for the altcoin market due to its size and ecosystem, also reflects this trend. While ETH has seen gains, it hasn’t consistently outperformed BTC in a way that signals a major shift towards altcoins. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The analysis pointing away from an immediate altcoin season doesn’t mean altcoins won’t perform at all, but it suggests managing expectations and adjusting strategies. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Expectations: Don’t rely solely on a broad altcoin season lifting all boats. Be selective. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of speculative plays, look for altcoins with strong technology, active development, real-world use cases, and solid community support. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on the Bitcoin dominance chart. A sustained downtrend, coupled with increasing total market cap, would be a stronger signal for altcoin opportunities. Risk Management: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. Position sizing and stop-loss orders are crucial. Diversification: While a broad alt season might be unlikely, individual altcoins can still perform well based on project-specific news or developments. A diversified portfolio across different sectors (Layer 1s, DeFi, GameFi, etc.) can help capture potential gains. Understanding the macro market conditions, like rising Bitcoin dominance , is vital for making informed investment decisions in the dynamic cryptocurrency space. Compelling Summary: Navigating the Current Crypto Landscape In conclusion, while the allure of an altcoin season remains strong for many, the current crypto market analysis, particularly the trend of increasing Bitcoin dominance highlighted by firms like Matrixport, suggests that widespread altcoin rallies are unlikely in the immediate future. The combination of capital concentration in BTC, lackluster Ethereum performance, and the absence of strong, new altcoin narratives creates a challenging environment for broad altcoin gains. Investors should temper expectations, focus on fundamental analysis, manage risk, and closely monitor key metrics like Bitcoin dominance for signs of a potential shift in market dynamics. The current landscape demands a more selective and cautious approach to altcoin investments.

This comes after his Labor Party’s decisive election win over the weekend. Within hours of his election victory becoming apparent, Albanese had a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump. Albanese said: “I have had three conversations with the president. I won’t go into all his comments, but he was very generous in his personal warmth and praise toward me. He was fully aware of the outcome and expressed the desire to continue working with me in the future.” Albanese talks tariffs and AUKUS with Trump after election victory Albanese made the remarks after clinching a decisive victory in Saturday’s federal election, where cost-of-living pressures and the looming threat of a renewed Trump-era trade war took center stage. The Prime Minister told reporters in Canberra on Monday that he had thanked President Trump for his warm message of congratulations. He said they had discussed how AUKUS and tariffs would continue to be part of their engagement and added that he looked forward to meeting him in person. The pair spoke about the AUKUS defense pact, a tripartite security pact between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Under AUKUS, Australia is receiving American and British assistance to build nuclear-powered submarines, its biggest single defense bet, totaling $368 billion over 30 years. Trump, who has made a dramatic political comeback in the U.S., offered a characteristically blunt response when asked about the Australian election. He said he knew little about Peter Dutton, the defeated opposition leader , but described Albanese as “nice and respectful” and noted a friendly rapport between the two. The tone between the two leaders marks a sharp contrast to recent hostilities. In April, the Trump administration surprised Canberra by imposing a last-minute 10% tariff on Australian steel and aluminum exports. Albanese had condemned the move as “not the act of a friend,” sparking widespread fears of a breakdown in the close partnership between the two countries. Albanese secures historic victory as Labor overcomes challenges Albanese’s center-left Labor Party exceeded expectations, overcoming a significant lead held by the Liberal-National Party Coalition, led by former police officer Peter Dutton, for much of the year. Labor secured at least 85 seats in the 151-member House of Representatives. Albanese has become the first Australian prime minister to win a second consecutive term in two decades, struggling to lift ratings through 2024 as households grapple with high costs. The victory ensures a parliamentary majority and mandates Albanese to govern without relying on minor parties or independents. It’s also the end of the road for opposition leader Peter Dutton’s political career, at least for now. He lost his Queensland seat of Dickson and became the first opposition leader in modern Australian history to lose their seat in an election. His loss underscores a dramatic turnaround in the mood of the voters, particularly in suburban and outer metropolitan districts. Labor’s strong performance comes after a year of economic challenges, with rising living costs, housing affordability concerns, and growing public unease over global instability shaping the campaign. Many voters expressed skepticism about U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies and their potential impact on the Australian economy. Political analysts said Trump had overshadowed the conservative campaign. Efforts by Dutton’s Liberal-National Coalition to mimic Trump-style policies — such as slashing the public service and banning federal employees from working from home — may have misfired. Albanese responds to Trump’s tariff threat with strategic economic plan Australia, one of the closest U.S. allies, has been slapped with a 10% tariff as part of Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” duties on dozens of trade partners. The tariffs were a central issue in the last week of the Australian election campaign. Almost half of the voters surveyed rated Trump’s trade agenda as one of their top five concerns. The tariff announcement had roiled the stock market and caused concern about retirement savings losses for global investment funds. Economists cautioned that export-oriented industries, like mining, agriculture, and advanced manufacturing, risked job losses. In response, Albanese unveiled a five-point plan to shield Australia’s economy from global shocks. The plan includes a $50 million relief fund for affected industries, a $1 billion “economic resilience program” to strengthen domestic capacity, and the creation of a critical minerals reserve to support future industries. Despite his firm stance, Albanese ruled out the use of punitive tariffs. He said Australia would not provoke a trade war with the U.S. but would defend its interests through proper dialogue and diplomacy. His low-key approach seems to work for voters. Labor picked up several historically conservative seats in Queensland and New South Wales — places likely to feel the brunt of U.S. tariff effects.

The XRP ( XRP ) price flashes warning signs as a bearish technical pattern emerges on its daily chart, coinciding with declining network activity. XRP descending triangle hints at 45% price drop The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart since its late 2024 rally , characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line. A descending triangle chart pattern that forms after a strong uptrend is seen as a bearish reversal indicator. As a rule, the setup resolves when the price breaks below the flat support level and falls by as much as the triangle’s maximum height. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The bulls are struggling to keep XRP above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $2.18, signaling a lack of strength. If this trend continues, a close below the moving averages , namely the 50-day SMA and the 100-day SMA at $2.06, could sink the XRP/USDT pair to the psychological support level at $2.00. Related: Is XRP price going to crash again? If this support fails, XRP price could tumble toward the downside target at around $1.20 by the end of May, down 45% from current price levels. XRP’s descending triangle target echoes an earlier analysis that warned of a possible decline to as low as $1.61 if key support levels don’t hold. Conversely, a clear breakout above the triangle’s resistance line at $2.18 will invalidate the bearish structure, putting XRP in a good position to rally toward the $3.00 psychological level. Declining XRP network activity The XRP Ledger has experienced a significant drop in network activity compared to Q1 2025. Onchain data from Glassnode shows that the network's daily active addresses (DAAs) are now far below March's peak. On March 19, the ledger recorded a robust 608,000 DAAs, reflecting high user engagement and transaction activity. However, this metric crashed in April and early May, as shown in the chart below. With only around 30,000 daily active addresses, user transactions have decreased, possibly signaling reduced interest or a lack of confidence in XRP's near-term outlook. XRP Daily Active Addresses. Source: Glassnode Historically, declines in network activity typically signal upcoming price stagnation or drops, as lower transaction volume reduces liquidity and buying pressure. Meanwhile, XRP’s 1.17% drop over the last 24 hours is accompanied by a 30% increase in daily trading volume to $2 billion. Trading volume increases amid a price decline can be interpreted as profit-taking or repositioning by crypto traders as they wait for XRP’s next move. Popular analyst Dom commented on the increased selling volume, pointing out that “a large amount of market selling over the last week” is why XRP failed to sustain upward moves.

New XAI Gork (GORK) token jumped to $0.07, continuing a rally that started on Friday when it bottomed at $0.01443. It has soared by almost 400%, giving it a market cap of over $70 million. The GORK price soared as demand for the coin jumped. CoinGecko data shows that the 24-hour volume rose to over $205 million, 3x its market cap. More signs of FOMO is the fact that the number of GORK token holders continued rising. According to SolScan , it has now accumulated over 24,000 holders, a notable factor since no major tier-1 exchange has listed it. Most of its trading is happening in exchanges like Gate, Meteora, Bitget, and MEXC. GORK price is rising because of the recent demand for AI-focused cryptocurrencies. For example, Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) has surged by over 300% from its lowest level this year. Tokens on its ecosystem, like GAME and aixbt , have also jumped recently.

Its ticker, GORK is derived from that Grok name. xAI has raised over $12.1 billion, and most recently, it acquired X, formerly known as Twitter, creating a company valued at over $113 billion. It is unclear whether the GORK price will continue rising. Historically, new meme coins surge in the initial days and then crash when the momentum wanes. The crash normally happens as insiders and smart money investors sell. Indeed, Nansen data shows that these smart money holders have started selling their tokens.

It was trading at $0.066 on Monday, a few points above the lower side of the ascending channel that connects the lowest swings since Friday last week. New XAI Gork price has formed a head and shoulders pattern. It is also forming a large rising wedge, a popular bearish reversal sign. Therefore, the token will likely drop and retest the key support level at $0.035, its lowest swing on Sunday. The risk for shorting a new token like GORK is that it may short-squeeze if major exchanges like Binance and OKX announce their listings.

How to Get In Early Investors looking to secure a position before any centralized listings go live can purchase PEPEMOON using Solana (SOL) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag . All that’s needed is a compatible crypto wallet—Phantom, Solflare, or MetaMask—connected to one of the DEX platforms.Once connected, users simply paste the contract address HWBw8iSohuukkKpZwKTCTT9M9VtTsm9XAx9hhGmQMihW to begin swapping SOL for PEPEMOON.Setting up a wallet is quick and easy, and SOL can be transferred from popular exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Early entry could prove highly lucrative if PEPEMOON follows the same parabolic rise seen in the early days of DOGE and SHIB. Investors Eyeing the Next Viral Solana Token As major memecoins like SHIB, DogWifHat and DOGE lose steam, many in the crypto community are shifting their focus to new Solana-based tokens. PEPEMOON, with its catchy branding and growing online buzz, appears to be leading this new wave of interest.Despite offering no inherent utility, PEPEMOON is feeding the ongoing hunger for high-risk, high-reward plays—especially among speculators betting on the next 100x moonshot.

In his recent post on X , Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino shared a fresh update on the upcoming Tether AI platform, announcing that users will be able to transact using Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Tether ( USDT ) through the platform’s peer-to-peer network. https://t.co/qQkox6AfNg coming soon pic.twitter.com/1FZonsW5nq — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) May 5, 2025 Crypto payments on Tether AI will be enabled through the company’s wallet development kit — a toolkit that allows developers to create mobile, desktop, and web wallets where users can hold USDT and BTC without relying on third-party custody.

AI will, in the coming decades, become part of the very fabric of the universe. Our technology will be open source, transparent, scalable and able to adapt and evolve on any device regardless of hardware,” Ardoino wrote on X.

BC Wong emphasized that exchanges are no longer just trading platforms—they have become essential financial infrastructure. Over the past five years, KuCoin has made substantial investments in rebuilding its core systems, including a complete revamp of its wallet architecture, the development of a real-time data system, and enhanced security frameworks. With the majority of KuCoin’s 1,000+ global employees working in engineering roles, the company’s development strategy is deeply rooted in technical excellence and long-term scalability. Beyond technology, BC Wong stressed the importance of proactive regulatory engagement. In many markets, regulators now expect to be involved from the earliest stages of product development. To support this shift, KuCoin has assembled a dedicated team of more than 20 scientists and analysts focused on compliance, proof-of-reserve systems, and transparent reporting. “The role of exchanges has changed,” said BC Wong. “It’s no longer enough to launch fast and fix later. We must collaborate with regulators from day one—because trust isn’t just earned from users; it must be built with the entire financial ecosystem.” BC Wong also reaffirmed KuCoin’s belief that regulation should not be seen as a constraint, but as a catalyst for long-term credibility. He reiterated that security remains KuCoin’s top priority—a lesson learned through the company’s own experience. As the industry matures into a more regulated environment, BC Wong emphasized that platforms willing to lead in transparency, risk management, and regulatory collaboration will be best positioned to shape the next chapter of crypto. Looking ahead, BC previewed KuCoin’s plans to launch dedicated, compliant platforms in Europe and Australia in the second half of 2025, alongside continued expansion of the KCS ecosystem to bring more utility and value to global users About KuCoin Founded in 2017, KuCoin is one of the pioneering and most globally recognized technology platforms supporting digital economies, built on a robust foundation of cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure, liquidity solutions, and exceptional user experience. With a connected user base exceeding 40 million worldwide, KuCoin offers comprehensive digital asset solutions across wallets, trading, wealth management, payments, research, ventures, and AI-powered bots. KuCoin has garnered accolades such as “Best Crypto Apps & Exchanges” by Forbes and has been recognized among the “Top 50 Global Unicorns” by Hurun in 2024. This recognition reflects its commitment to user-centric principles and core values, which include integrity, accountability, collaboration, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.

These reforms may initially appear to be a speed hurdle for investors who are interested in digital assets and thrills. But that's just from the first glance. Taking a second look reveals something more encouraging: a path for a more respectable future for online gaming and cryptocurrencies.The amended law, which now takes effect, specifies precisely how cryptocurrency transactions are handled tax-wise, i.e., when gains above the yearly allowance, capital gains tax, or CGT, will be imposed. Yes, that may appear like a bureaucratic twist in an already complicated game to weekend dabblers. However, for genuine cryptocurrency gamblers and long-term investors, this is a move in the right direction and also a hint that the UK is embracing digital money while strengthening responsibility at the same time.It's a daring step meant to turn confusion into understanding. This may also be exactly what is required to gain the trust of the general public for a sector like cryptocurrency gaming that has long operated in regulatory shadows. That said, flying beneath the radar is a thing of the past, now is the time when placing quick, easy wagers using Bitcoin or Ethereum is not only seen as a a thing of the future but as a legitimate business. The Rise of Crypto Gambling in the UK and Beyond What makes playing free spins no deposit NZ and gambling with crypto more and more appealing isn’t just the thrill of the game, it’s the adrenaline present on the market. Players aren’t simply spinning virtual reels or predicting outcomes; they’re also riding the volatility of the digital coins they’re wagering. Every bet is a twofold gamble: on the game and on the value of the cryptocurrency itself. Sounds thrilling, right? Enter the UK’s updated tax policy, but not as a party pooper, more like a seasoned bouncer keeping the scene legit. Rather than clamping down on crypto gambling, the government has opted for a smarter approach: regulation through taxation. This move doesn’t just preserve the spirit of the game, it also nudges the industry into a more trustworthy, transparent space where users can play with confidence and operators can run with clarity. And what’s especially compelling is how the industry is responding to all this. Advanced platforms are already integrating tools that help users monitor their gains and losses. Others are teaming up with compliance experts and financial advisors to align their services with the new rules. One might say that the message is clear: crypto gambling is yet to thrive. What Crypto Gamblers Need to Know For avid crypto gamblers, understanding tax implications is now considered a must. While crypto winnings themselves are not necessarily taxed as gambling winnings in the UK, unlike fiat currency casino wins which may be tax-free, any increase in the value of the crypto from the time it was acquired to the time it was used could be subject to CGT. Let's break it down with a few key considerations for users: • Track your cost basis: Know how much you paid for your crypto assets so that you calculate gains or losses when those assets are used for gambling.• Keep detailed records: Every crypto-to-crypto transaction, even those used for betting , could be a taxable event, and, naturally, proper documentation will help you stay compliant.• Use crypto tracking software: Many platforms now offer tools that integrate with gambling sites and wallets to simplify tax reporting. Platforms that incorporate tools to assist users with these tasks can count on more widespread use . A Positive Outlook for Regulation and Innovation Instead of curbing cryptocurrency gambling, the UK's tax policy may be doing the exact opposite. It's allowing this long-undefined sector to sit at the table with adults. Now that there is a clear structure in place, lawmakers' message is quite refreshingly simple: it's all about ensuring that digital wagers are handled responsibly.This methodical, and, more importantly, mature approach may end up serving as a model for other nations looking to harness innovation without letting it go amok. Now, an increasing number of platforms are changing their image and presenting themselves as trustworthy. As a result, this sector becomes more appealing to serious partners and institutional investors who had previously kept cryptocurrency gambling at bay.Note that taxes are essentially a form of validation. Via the process of taxing cryptocurrency gambling, the UK is acknowledging that it is now a legitimate and sustainable economic sector. That sort of recognition could end up being the most beneficial of all and bring about: • Increased investor confidence: Regulated markets tend to attract more serious investors and operators.• Consumer protection improvements: As compliance increases, so do efforts to safeguard users from fraud and unethical practices.• Industry maturation: Regulation forces platforms to adopt professional standards, leading to better technology, user experience, and fairness. After doing their homework properly, users can navigate these new rules without any difficulty whatsoever. Several financial advisors and crypto-focused tax services in the UK are already offering tailored services for gamblers, traders, and hybrid users who do both. What might be the result? Responsible gaming and tax compliance could become key selling points for emerging platforms. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here Is The ADA Competitor Offering A Faster Route To Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/late-for-a-good-entry-on-cardano-here-is-the-ada-competitor-offering-a-faster-route-to-gains/,"Cardano’s 4-hour chart indicates a typical mean-reversal bounce. Enthusiasts, meanwhile, are scooping in massive numbers to buy Stage 4 presale of the new token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , and receive Play-to-Earn (P2E) utility with its apart-from-the-pack meme value. A Quant Review of ADA/USDT Chart The end-of-April liquidation peak sent Cardano price to the lower Bollinger Band (≈ $0.675) late in the month, and the candle that broke through that band closed well within it, indicating tail-ending capitulation, not trend initiation. Volume in that flush was the session high, and every subsequent red bar printed decreasing volume, a classic exhaustion profile. Cardano price has recovered both the Supertrend baseline of $0.667 and Bollinger mid-line/SMA-20 of $0.700 and turned them into double-layered supports. Volatility remains high—the bands opened to 7.6% following the dump—and % B has already retraced from 0.05 to 0.45, suggesting statistical gravity is now in favour of drift to the top envelope at $0.726. Missing out on closing above the mid-line in the next few candles, however, would turn that same zone into an anchored VWAP resistance group of April’s distribution, subjecting $0.66 liquidity to exposure again. Quantitatively, risk-reward skews at 1.9:1 for tactical long at $0.69 with a stop placed below Supertrend flip at ($0.665) and targets at the top band ($0.725) and previous value-area high at ($0.735). Momentum algos will be looking for a strong close above $0.705 to confirm continuation; otherwise, anticipate choppiness and mean-reversion flow within the range of $0.67–$0.72. A recent tweet stated how the U.S. is aligning towards the approval of Cardano spot ETFs, with an estimated chance of 71% . If said fund received just 5% of Bitcoin ETF inflows ($1.96 Bn), Cardano’s market capitalization would increase to $26.24 Bn from $24.3 Bn, pushing price to around $0.735 from $0.68—a best-case increase of 8%. More realistically, gradual OTC accumulation and just 30% of flows reaching the markets means just a modest 2.5% increase, with higher gains subject to ecosystem adoption and optimism. Yeti Ouro Stage 4 Presale $YETIO concluded Stage 3 of its presale at $0.024, with 232,837,657 of its coins sold and $3.81 million raised and moved to Stage 4 at $0.041 last week giving early bird investors a 242% ROI. The price is destined for a steeper increase in the final presale Stage 5. The 25% bonus still holds for buys over $500, and payment can be made in crypto or by card with no KYC. Developed on Ethereum, YETIO has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens to fuel the project’s Play-to-Earn environment. It’s headlining game, Yeti Go—which is built in Unreal Engine 5—rewards users with YETIO coins for emerging victorious in elimination-style races, providing real-world utility above and beyond meme-coin hype. Yeti Go delivers a pulse-pounding ride through a visually striking universe, crafted with precision by the same studio behind gaming legends like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. Every element is engineered for impact—from the razor-sharp graphics to the fluid gameplay. What truly sets it apart is the sound: an electrifying score built by audio pros who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists including Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Keep scrolling to meet the game’s lead character and get a taste of the speed, energy, and edge that define the Yeti Go experience. Recent market analysis put out this morning observes that presale’s 242% paper return since Stage 1 is attracting traders away from old memes like XRP and Dogecoin to a $21.91 Bn utility-backed GameFi product. Analysts there believe sealing today’s round will set the token to catch a wider 2025 bull run. As per ICO calendars, the presales began on 14 September 2024, with 500 million tokens, half of the total supply, going to investors. The contract has been audited by SOLIDProof , and as promised, there will be staking, yield farming, and CEX/DEX listings as soon as fundraising is done. The tokens will be claimable via the project’s dashboard when the sale ends. The official website broadcasts live presale statistics and Telegram, X, and Discord links to enable backers to keep themselves updated in real-time and remain active within the community. Key Takeaway ADA’s re-taking of the $0.700 SMA-20 with decreasing sell-side volume positions us for a clean 1.9:1 long to $0.725 — 0.735, assuming $0.665 holds. Parallel play, YETIO’s $0.041 still values just half of its audited GameFi roadmap—prior to steeper Stage-5 mark-up—presenting asymmetric upside.

Analyst predicts $314 future; others question circulating supply assumptions. Technical charts show mixed signals; RSI indicates oversold conditions. The Pi Network price has dropped more than 6% in recent days, raising concerns within its growing community. Despite the dip, some analysts believe a short-term recovery might be possible, as the token holds support around the $0.50 mark. As the price fell below $1, many long-time Pi supporters started to lose hope. However, some remain hopeful about Pi’s long-term future. Analyst’s Bullish Long-Term Pi Network Price Prediction Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin, recently shared his views, saying, “Many gave up when Pi dropped below $1. I didn’t — and I won’t. My time zone is five years, and I clearly see 1 Pi reaching $314 one day.” This Pi Network price prediction faces skepticism, with critics noting a $314 price implies a $31 trillion-plus market cap based on a 100 billion token supply. However, Dr. Altcoin counters that the effective circulating supply will likely be far lower, perhaps around 20 billion Pi due to factors like KYC compliance.… The post Pi’s 6% Drop Highlights Why $0.50 Support Is Key for Bulls appeared first on Coin Edition .",Altcoin News|CoinMarketCap Feed|Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Pi (PI),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-05 12:00:00

While this news is compelling, the news of a fast-growing Remittix project generates even more buzz as it displays the potential to deliver a staggering 15,600% price growth for early investors. With such potential, Remittix affirms its place as a credible challenger in the PayFi and general crypto market. Experts have now investigated Remittix’s chances of outshining even the progress made by established projects like Cardano and Solana. Here’s your answer. ADA’s Leios Upgrade, Price Impact and SOL Comparison Toward the end of the first quarter of 2025, The Wolf of All Streets podcast interviewed ADA founder Charles Hoskinson. This podcast episode revealed new details about Cardano’s imminent scalability upgrade, Leios. According to Hoskinson, the upgrade will be a groundbreaking advancement that will produce “Solana-style speed” while retaining ADA’s priority: decentralization and stability. Leios is another chapter in Cardano’s larger scheme to increase the network’s performance. The upgrade will speed things up by completing validation and execution processes in parallel. With that process, the ADA blockchain will complete more transaction inputs and be more efficient, making it more flexible. Following the announcement of the Leios upgrade a month ago, ADA has witnessed a 4.14% price growth. This momentum could be exactly what ADA needs to surpass the $1 price point eventually. Solana Ecosystem Receives Positive News Boosting Investors’ Confidence While Bitcoin has been the focus of news lately, especially with the Trump administration driving its adoption as a reserve currency, altcoins like Solana have seen an impressive surge in investment activity. This boom is thanks to two major SOL market moves, each involving a $100 million investment. According to the news, GSR , a popular investment firm, oversaw a $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal with UPEXI. As a brand development firm, UPEXI now holds most of the new funds intended for building a SOL treasury scheme. Moreover, Michael Novogratz’s company, Galaxy Digital, also made big Solana moves, trading $100 million worth of ETH for SOL on Binance . This event was so significant that it wasn’t completed until after two weeks. Eventually, this firm traded 65,600 ETH for 752,240 SOL. Such massive development makes it no surprise that SOL has recorded a 7.85% price growth in the past week. Remittix’s Value-Driven Ascent Promises Investors Millions In Profit Several other projects are known for only delivering quick gains, but Remittix (RTX) stands out as one built to offer real-world value through its PayFi model. Remittix connects crypto and traditional FIAT methods, making cross-border transfers happen quickly and at less cost than traditional options. Remittix also offers users a crypto-to-fiat solution, allowing users to convert more than fifty cryptocurrencies into thirty fiat currencies, including USD, GBP, EUR and JPY.

Will Bittensor go up or down? Could it surpass its previous all-time high of $767.68?? Alright, let’s jump into our Bittensor price prediction for 2025 to 2030 and see where TAO could be headed. Bittensor price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Bittensor price prediction, TAO could see a major rally — with its price expected to surge by 225.5%, potentially reaching a new all-time high of $1,206.69 by May 27, 2025. As of April 29, the overall sentiment for the Bittensor price forecast remains bullish, with 23 technical indicators signaling upward momentum, while only 7 suggest bearish trends. Based on CoinCodex’s long-term expectations for Bittensor, TAO is projected to trade between $370.72 and $1,736.29this year. If it reaches the upper end of this range, it could gain as much as 366%. Other platforms also share an optimistic projection for Bittensor. DigitalCoinPrice believes TAO will surpass its previous high of $767.68 in 2025 and then stabilize between $717.48 and $816.13. In contrast, Wallet Investor offers a more conservative view, forecasting that TAO could hit a maximum of $314 by the end of 2025. What can we expect from Bittensor’s price in five years? Bittensor price prediction 2030 CoinCodex’s forecast estimates that by 2030, TAO’s price could range between $686.17 and $2,324.91. DigitalCoinPrice predicts that Bittensor will surpass the $1,960 mark by 2030, projecting a price range between $1,762.75 and $2,036.57, which suggests strong long-term growth potential.

Moments after the 94-year-old “Oracle of Omaha” confirmed that vice-chairman Greg Abel will assume the top job when 2025 draws to a close, the world’s most celebrated value investor delivered a sweeping warning about the long-term corrosion of government money—an argument that, stripped of its author’s intent, reads like a précis of the Bitcoin thesis. Buffett Still Doesn’t Get Bitcoin From the stage in Omaha’s CHI Health Center, Buffett told shareholders that the greatest threat to capital is not a bear market or a recession but “the tendency of a government to want to debase its currency over time.” “If you’ve got people that control the currency, you can issue a paper money and you will,” he said, adding that “the natural course of government is to make the currency worth less over time, and that’s got important consequences.” He concluded that “we wouldn’t want to be owning anything that we thought was in a currency that was really going to hell.” Those sentences, delivered without reference to Bitcoin, echoed through crypto X within seconds. Pseudonymous BTC commentator Carl Menger interpreted them as an inadvertent endorsement of a non-sovereign alternative, writing that Buffett “suggests it might be wise ‘to own a lot of other currencies’ besides the US Dollar. Almost like a decentralized, non-sovereign currency could fix this.” Menger then jabbed that the nonagenarian “still can’t grasp the value of Bitcoin and rather stacks other fiat Shitcoins.” MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor—who in 2023 said , “Bitcoin is the answer to the question that mystifies Warren Buffett”—renewed the critique on Saturday, calling Berkshire “20th Century Bitcoin.” The contrast is stark: while Berkshire’s cash pile has swollen to $347.7 billion at the end of Q1 2025, up from $334.2 billion three months earlier, Saylor has been converting every spare corporate dollar into BTC. Buffett’s decision to sit on a record hoard signals that, in his view, equity valuations remain unappetizing; for Bitcoin advocates, it is further proof that fiat liquidity is best redeployed into hard digital assets rather than idling in Treasuries and T-bills. Yet “the catch” is that Buffett’s philosophical alignment with monetary debasement hawks does not alter his personal verdict on Bitcoin. He still regards the asset with unalloyed contempt. In 2018 he famously called it “probably rat poison squared .” In 2020 he told CNBC that cryptocurrencies have “no value and they don’t produce anything,” and at the 2022 shareholder meeting he declared he would not buy the entire Bitcoin supply for $25 because “it isn’t going to do anything.” Saturday’s stagecraft did nothing to soften those views; the man who transformed a floundering textile mill into a $1.16 trillion conglomerate remains committed to productive enterprises over digitally scarce commodities. At press time, BTC traded at $94,629.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|warren buffett|Warren Buffett Bitcoin,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-05 12:00:33
44189068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157172,1746446439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Australia Crypto Regulation: Urgent Industry Call Signals a Bright Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/australia-crypto-regulation-urgent/,"Following a pivotal general election, the cryptocurrency industry in Australia finds itself at a critical juncture, urgently calling on the newly formed government to prioritize clear Australia crypto regulation . This moment is seen as a significant opportunity to shape the landscape for digital assets down under, moving from ambiguity towards a defined framework that can foster growth and protect participants. Why is Clear Australia Crypto Regulation Needed Now? For years, the Australian crypto market has operated within a patchwork of existing financial regulations, often ill-suited for the unique nature of digital assets. This lack of specific, tailored rules has created uncertainty for both businesses and consumers. Businesses face challenges in scaling and innovating without clear guidelines, potentially leading to regulatory risks or forcing them to look overseas. Consumers, on the other hand, can be vulnerable to scams and market volatility without adequate protections. The recent election brought the need for clarity into sharp focus. Notably, the three major political parties – the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party, and the National Party – all acknowledged the growing importance of cryptocurrency and included pledges to introduce regulatory measures in their campaign platforms. This cross-party consensus signals a political willingness to address the issue, creating a window of opportunity the industry is keen to capitalize on. What Does the Industry Want from Australian Crypto Laws ? The calls from the crypto industry are not simply for ‘regulation’ in a broad sense, but for specific, well-considered Australian crypto laws that balance innovation with necessary safeguards. The primary goals articulated by industry representatives include: Consumer Protection: Establishing clear rules for exchanges, custodians, and service providers to prevent fraud, manage risks, and provide recourse for users. This is paramount to building trust and encouraging broader adoption. Promoting Innovation: Designing regulations that do not stifle technological development. This means creating frameworks that are adaptable, understand the nuances of different crypto assets and decentralized technologies, and encourage businesses to build and operate within Australia. Regulatory Clarity: Providing certainty for businesses regarding licensing, compliance, tax treatment, and operational requirements. This clarity is essential for attracting investment and fostering a competitive local industry. International Competitiveness: Ensuring Australia’s regulatory approach aligns with or surpasses international best practices, positioning the country as a hub for blockchain and crypto innovation in the Asia-Pacific region. Industry bodies are advocating for a collaborative approach, urging the government to work closely with experts and stakeholders who understand the technology and market dynamics. This collaboration is seen as key to developing effective and future-proof Australian crypto laws . How Will Crypto Legislation Australia Take Shape? Responding to the growing calls and fulfilling election promises, the Australian Treasury has confirmed its plans to move forward with developing specific regulations. A significant step in this process is the planned release of a draft of the proposed crypto legislation Australia by the end of the year. This draft is expected to outline the government’s initial proposals for addressing key areas within the crypto ecosystem. The release of a draft bill is typically followed by a period of public consultation. This is a critical phase where industry participants, consumer groups, academics, and the general public can provide feedback on the proposed laws. The quality and effectiveness of the final legislation will heavily depend on the government’s willingness to engage with and incorporate this feedback. Key areas the draft legislation is likely to cover include: Licensing frameworks for Digital Currency Exchanges (DCEs) and other crypto service providers. Custodial requirements for holding digital assets. Rules around product disclosure and consumer warnings for crypto investments. Potentially addressing specific types of crypto assets like stablecoins or NFTs. The development of robust crypto legislation Australia is a complex undertaking, requiring careful consideration of diverse viewpoints and technical intricacies. What Does This Mean for Australia Cryptocurrency Policy ? The move towards dedicated crypto laws signals a maturing of Australia cryptocurrency policy . It indicates a shift from viewing crypto purely through the lens of existing financial regulations or solely as a potential risk, to recognizing it as a distinct asset class and technology with significant potential benefits, provided it is appropriately managed. A coherent Australia cryptocurrency policy should aim to achieve several objectives simultaneously: Policy Objective Why It’s Important Enhance Market Integrity Builds confidence and reduces risks for all participants. Foster Innovation Encourages businesses to develop new products and services locally. Protect Consumers Shields individuals from scams, fraud, and excessive risk. Provide Regulatory Certainty Allows businesses to plan and invest with confidence. Maintain Financial Stability Manages systemic risks associated with digital assets. The policy decisions made now will have long-lasting impacts on how Australia interacts with the global digital asset space. What Does the Future of Crypto Australia Look Like? The push for clear and comprehensive regulation paints a potentially bright picture for the future of crypto Australia . With a clear legal framework, the industry can move beyond the uncertainty of the past and enter a phase of more robust growth and integration into the broader economy. Benefits could include: Increased institutional investment due to greater regulatory clarity and reduced risk. Growth in Australian crypto businesses and job creation in the sector. Enhanced consumer confidence leading to wider adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology. Australia becoming a leader in responsible crypto innovation. However, the outcome is not guaranteed. The quality of the legislation is key. Poorly designed rules could stifle innovation, create unnecessary burdens, or fail to adequately protect consumers. The consultation process and the government’s willingness to listen to informed perspectives will be crucial in shaping a positive future of crypto Australia . For participants in the Australian crypto space, staying informed about the Treasury’s draft legislation and participating in the consultation process is highly recommended. This is an opportunity to directly influence the rules that will govern the industry for years to come. In conclusion, the call for urgent Australia crypto regulation post-election is a significant development. With major parties aligned on the need for action and the Treasury planning a draft by year-end, Australia is on the cusp of defining its stance on digital assets. The industry’s focus on consumer protection and innovation highlights the potential for a regulatory framework that not only mitigates risks but also unlocks the significant opportunities presented by cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, paving the way for a more secure and dynamic future of crypto Australia .

However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.491 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.1740 over the last 24 hours. DOGE is yet to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1921 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.263401 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2029. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,849.48 DOGE in May; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.414 on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, at the start of May, Dogecoin is trading near the $0.170 mark, following some improvement.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-05 12:00:39

Investors watching current market movements are focusing on MAGACOINFINANCE , XRP , Ethereum , and Bitcoin —three names that reflect both long-term strength and emerging potential. With fundamentals aligning and institutional interest expanding, these assets are becoming central to discussions about the next phase of growth in the crypto market. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Establishing Real Traction at the Early Stage Unlike projects that rely on short-term speculation, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining attention for the right reasons: structure, execution, and growth. The project has already raised over $7.8 million , reflecting growing confidence among early investors. Wallet numbers are increasing. Developer milestones are being met. And community engagement is building steadily across multiple regions. This is the kind of momentum that often precedes widespread market recognition. For those looking to enter at a critical point in a project’s trajectory, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out. Market Foundations: Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Leading Protocols Ethereum (ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized innovation. With rapid Layer-2 scaling and increasing real-world integrations, its ecosystem continues to expand across finance, gaming, and enterprise use. Bitcoin (BTC) holds its role as a digital store of value. Its acceptance among institutional investors, along with new ETF vehicles, reinforces its long-term position in the global financial landscape. Together, these assets provide a level of stability and scale that’s essential for overall market growth—but the outsized return potential lies in identifying earlier-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE. Ecosystem Builders to Watch: Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Polygon continues to serve as a key infrastructure layer for Ethereum scalability and real-world adoption. Tron leads in transaction volume across many regions, especially for high-throughput, cost-effective use cases. Arbitrum is the frontrunner in Ethereum Layer-2 development, driving innovation across decentralized applications and financial protocols. While these protocols support broad adoption, MAGACOINFINANCE offers a rare chance to participate in an early-stage project before mass exposure. Final Insight Can an investment today grow toward $1.3 million ? In digital markets, timing and conviction remain the key drivers of transformative outcomes.

The discussion centered on the global shift from analog to digital payments, a transition described by one speaker as a profound change that the payments industry is undergoing. Ripple Partner Finastra: “This is the FIRST TIME in history that all PAYMENTS ARE MOVING TO DIGITAL.” Profound insights. Watch. pic.twitter.com/ZiqMrtJwvQ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 4, 2025 These remarks are notable because of the growing relevance of Ripple’s payment infrastructure and the potential role of XRP as the world shifts toward digital settlement systems. The speaker noted that “everything has been analog before,” emphasizing that digital instant payments are now deployed worldwide. According to the speaker, this is the first time that all payments are definitively moving to digital channels. A Fitting Environment for Ripple’s Technology The comments from the video reflect a landscape that aligns directly with Ripple’s core offering. Ripple’s payment solution uses XRP to enable real-time, cross-border payments. The move from analog to digital processes validates the need for systems like these, which provide instant settlement with transparency and cost efficiency. Ripple has long believed that traditional payment systems are outdated and slow . As more regions adopt instant payment infrastructure, the company’s solutions become increasingly relevant, and the Finastra speaker described the current phase as “a great time to be in payments.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Growing Role of Digital Assets With financial technology companies acknowledging the industry-wide pivot to digital systems, the value proposition of XRP becomes clearer. Unlike analog systems requiring multiple intermediaries, XRP allows for frictionless transfer of value across jurisdictions in seconds. In a fully digital environment, such capabilities are no longer optional but have become necessary. Reports suggest that prominent Ripple partners like Bank of America are prepared to use crypto payments , and XRP’s unique design gives it an edge over competitors. The speaker emphasized that global instant payments are now being deployed as digital instant payments, reinforcing the industry direction toward models Ripple has supported for years. Ripple’s partnership with Finastra also helps position it at the heart of this transformation, as it has access to a wide network of banks and financial institutions adapting to the new era of cross-border payments. As traditional systems are replaced, financial institutions must re-evaluate how they facilitate payments. Ripple’s emphasis on interoperability, speed, and transparency offers advantages that legacy systems lack. Finastra’s recognition of this ongoing transition supports the view that XRP is well-positioned as a backbone for modern payments .

The update , spotlighted by crypto analyst Xaif on X, is being celebrated as a major victory for the broader digital asset industry, with particular enthusiasm from supporters of XRP and decentralized finance proponents. BREAKING Apple to allow crypto payments outside the App Store. A US judge has ordered Apple to lift restrictions on developers using external payment methods. Huge win for crypto #XRP pic.twitter.com/gX1ZgvPc5V — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 4, 2025 Court Ruling Erodes Apple’s App Store Monopoly The decision stems from the long-running legal battle between Apple and Epic Games, in which Apple was accused of maintaining anti-competitive control over app payment systems. In the latest ruling, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that Apple must cease enforcing rules that bar developers from linking out to alternative payment methods. This effectively gives developers the freedom to guide users to crypto-compatible platforms or wallets without routing all transactions through Apple’s ecosystem — where the company typically claims a 30% cut. This shift drastically changes the landscape for in-app payments, and more importantly, it lowers the barriers to mainstream crypto adoption within mobile applications . Crypto payments — previously sidelined by App Store restrictions — now stand a real chance of being integrated into popular apps across a wide range of industries, including finance, gaming, e-commerce, and social media. Crypto and XRP Community Reacts With Optimism Crypto proponents quickly reacted to the ruling with celebration, calling it a game-changer for user empowerment and payment flexibility. Xaif, known for tracking macro-crypto developments, noted that this marks a “huge win” for the crypto industry, especially for assets like XRP that are designed to facilitate fast, low-cost payments across global networks. The XRP community, in particular, sees this legal milestone as an opportunity to push for broader real-world use cases, including mobile-based remittance apps, decentralized marketplaces, and peer-to-peer payment tools that are powered by the XRP Ledger . With Apple’s wall starting to crack, developers are now freer than ever to design innovative experiences that harness the speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency of digital assets like XRP. Pathway Opens for Crypto-Enabled App Innovation Until now, developers building crypto-native or blockchain-integrated apps faced major friction when trying to distribute their offerings through Apple’s App Store. The risk of rejection or limitations on crypto payment flows discouraged many from even attempting integration. With the new legal directive in place, the door is open for direct, permissionless payments using crypto, bypassing Apple’s previously impenetrable gatekeeping structure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This is particularly meaningful for decentralized applications (dApps), which often require interactions with crypto wallets and external payment portals. It also enhances the feasibility of crypto tip jars, NFT marketplaces, tokenized subscriptions, and play-to-earn models operating on mobile devices. A Turning Point for Digital Finance on Mobile Apple has long been accused of stifling innovation by forcing developers into its monetization framework, one that doesn’t accommodate the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies. This ruling sends a clear message that the future of digital payments must be open, flexible, and inclusive of blockchain-based systems. For XRP — a digital asset with a proven track record in remittances and enterprise finance — this could be the start of more seamless integrations into consumer-facing applications. While Apple may appeal the decision or implement nuanced compliance measures, the precedent has been set. As the global economy shifts more decisively toward decentralized value systems, regulatory wins like this reinforce the growing consensus: crypto is not a fringe technology — it’s an integral part of the next era of digital commerce. This court ruling, championed by voices like Xaif and embraced by the wider crypto community, may one day be remembered as a pivotal moment in the mainstreaming of digital currencies — one where barriers fell and the path was cleared for a more open financial future.

In the last two weeks alone, $WAL climbed to a high of $0.6125, pushing its market cap to approximately $806 million. While still 30% below its debut high of $0.8742, $WAL is gaining ground, especially within the AI/ML, gaming, and NFT verticals. Walrus Technology Breakdown: How Programmable Storage Changes the Game Walrus Protocol is optimized for storing large binary objects, or “blobs,” such as images, videos, PDFs, and entire apps. At press time, the platform boasts 333.33 TB in total storage capacity, with over 3,367 GB already in use across more than 3.25 million blobs, per Walruscan data. Walrus Storage Capacity/ Source: Walruscan What sets Walrus apart is its programmability. Thanks to Sui smart contracts, users get secure, private, and decentralized storage. The Walrus team hasn’t shied away from challenging industry incumbents. In a recent statement, they asserted: “Walrus stores data privately, securely, and in a decentralized way. Filecoin can’t do this—yet it’s a $2 billion project…” Backed by major VCs, Walrus raised $140 million in a tough market environment, led by Standard Crypto, with participation from a16z crypto, Electric Capital, and Franklin Templeton Digital Assets.

According to CoinGlass, Walrus recorded the highest trading volume among DePIN tokens in the past 24 hours, with over $77 million exchanged, marking a 67% increase. The protocol also led to open interest (OI), with a 22% rise and more than $32 million in capital placed by traders betting on further upside.

A key driver of early user engagement and Bitcoin Adoption was a simple concept: the Bitcoin Faucet . Now, a familiar name from that era, Charlie Shrem , is looking to bring that concept back into the spotlight. According to reports, Shrem, known for co-founding the BitInstant exchange and serving as a former vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, is working on a new platform, 21million.com, specifically designed to revive the faucet model. This initiative draws inspiration directly from the pioneering work of Gavin Andresen back in 2010. What Exactly Was the Original Bitcoin Faucet and Why Did It Matter? The very first Bitcoin Faucet , created by lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, was a revolutionary tool for its time. Its primary goal was simple: to give people small amounts of Free Bitcoin to help them understand and experiment with the nascent technology. In an era where buying Bitcoin was complex and often inaccessible, the faucet provided a frictionless way for anyone with an internet connection to acquire their first BTC. Think of it like this: Users visited a specific website. They completed a simple task, usually a CAPTCHA, to prove they weren’t a bot. In return, the faucet would dispense a small amount of Bitcoin directly to their wallet. This mechanism was incredibly effective in bootstrapping Bitcoin Adoption . It allowed early enthusiasts and developers to send transactions, test wallets, and generally get comfortable with the technology without needing to invest their own money. Over its operational period, Andresen’s faucet distributed an astounding 19,700 BTC. At Bitcoin’s peak, the value of that distributed amount reached into the billions of dollars, highlighting the immense long-term value created by simply giving away early coins. Who is Charlie Shrem, the Man Behind the Revival? Charlie Shrem is a figure deeply intertwined with Bitcoin’s early history. As a co-founder of BitInstant, one of the earliest and most prominent Bitcoin exchanges, he played a significant role in making it easier for people to buy and sell BTC. He was also a founding member and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting Bitcoin’s development and adoption. While his journey has included legal challenges related to his time at BitInstant, Shrem has remained an active voice and entrepreneur within the crypto space. His return to a foundational concept like the Bitcoin Faucet is notable, suggesting a potential belief that this early method still holds relevance today. Why Bring Back the Faucet for Bitcoin Adoption Now? In 2024, the cryptocurrency landscape is vastly different from 2010. Bitcoin is a globally recognized asset, trading on major exchanges and even having spot ETFs in some regions. So, why would someone like Charlie Shrem feel the need to revive a concept designed for a time when Bitcoin was obscure? Several factors might be at play: Educating New Users: Despite mainstream awareness, many people still find interacting with crypto wallets and transactions intimidating. A modern Crypto Faucet could serve as a low-stakes entry point. Re-engaging Early Adopters: Nostalgia for the early days is strong in the crypto community. A faucet could attract back OGs and create buzz. Promoting 21million.com: The faucet serves as a powerful marketing tool, driving traffic and attention to Shrem’s new platform. Demonstrating Accessibility: Faucets emphasize that Bitcoin, at its core, is a peer-to-peer digital cash system accessible to anyone. While the massive amounts distributed by early faucets are unlikely today due to Bitcoin’s value, a new faucet could still provide enough Free Bitcoin to cover transaction fees or allow users to send test payments, fulfilling a similar educational purpose. How Could Shrem’s New Free Bitcoin Faucet Work? Details about the functionality of 21million.com’s faucet are scarce, especially since the website is reportedly not yet fully operational and shows zero BTC available. However, we can speculate on how a modern version might operate, potentially building on the original concept: Task Completion: Like the original, users might need to complete CAPTCHAs or other simple online tasks. Educational Modules: A modern faucet could integrate short quizzes or videos about Bitcoin basics as the required task. Integration with Services: It might require users to explore features on the 21million.com platform itself. Small Payouts: Given Bitcoin’s current price, the amounts dispensed would likely be minuscule fractions of a BTC, perhaps just enough to cover transaction fees or accumulate over time. The challenge will be making the rewards significant enough to be worthwhile for users while being sustainable for the operator. Early faucets benefited from Bitcoin’s low value and large block rewards (making transaction fees less critical). Today, even small transactions can incur noticeable fees, which the faucet would need to cover. Exploring the Potential of a Modern Crypto Faucet The revival of the Crypto Faucet concept by Charlie Shrem is an interesting development. It harks back to a time when grassroots distribution was key to building a community around Bitcoin. While faucets aren’t going to make anyone rich, they can still play a role in the broader ecosystem. Potential Benefits: Low-barrier entry for complete beginners. Helps users learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet. Drives traffic and potential user acquisition for the platform hosting the faucet. Acts as a nostalgic nod to Bitcoin’s origins. Potential Challenges: Sustainability of funding the payouts. Combating bots and fraudulent activity. User expectations vs. the reality of tiny payouts. Competition from other methods of earning small amounts of crypto (e.g., micro-task platforms, certain apps). Ultimately, the success of 21million.com’s faucet will depend on its implementation, the amount of Free Bitcoin it dispenses (however small), and how effectively it integrates with Shrem’s other ventures or educational content. It’s a test of whether a tool from Bitcoin’s infancy can still find relevance in its maturity. In conclusion, Charlie Shrem ‘s effort to revive the Bitcoin Faucet through 21million.com is a fascinating callback to Bitcoin’s foundational years. Inspired by Gavin Andresen’s original, which significantly aided early Bitcoin Adoption by distributing vast amounts of BTC (now worth billions), this new venture aims to re-introduce the concept of easily accessible, Free Bitcoin . While the website is still under development, the initiative highlights a potential desire to simplify entry into the crypto world and leverage a historically proven method for engaging users. Whether this modern Crypto Faucet can replicate the impact of its predecessor remains to be seen, but it’s certainly a development worth watching for anyone interested in the history and future of cryptocurrency distribution.

The turning point came on March 10, 2025, when Ethereum’s price dipped to $1,866.70, forcing accumulating addresses (those consistently adding to their ETH holdings without significant selling) into unrealized loss territory. These addresses, typically classified as long-term holders (LTHs) due to their average holding time exceeding 155 days, had a realized price of $2,026. Rather than panic-selling, these investors doubled down on their conviction. ETH Holders Refuse to Sell: Accumulating Addresses Lower Their Cost Basis “On March 10 they held 15.5356M ETH, and by May 3 this rose to 19.0378M ETH, a 22.54% increase. Behavior reflects structural conviction & clear expectations of short-term appreciation.” – By @oro_crypto pic.twitter.com/yx12tC7N0O — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 5, 2025 As tracked by CryptoQuant’s metric, “ETH: Realized Price by Accumulating Addresses,” the cohort responded to this price downturn not by liquidating but by lowering their cost basis. Source: CryptoQuant From March 10 to May 3, they reduced their realized price to $1,980, a 2.32% decrease, and significantly ramped up accumulation. In just under two months, the total ETH held by these addresses grew from 15.5356 million to 19.0378 million, marking a substantial 22.54% increase in holdings. Source: CryptoQuant This behavior suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, even though market sentiment remained cautious. Support Holding, But Market Remains on a Knife’s Edge Ethereum has seen a turbulent start to May. After beginning the month trading above the $1,800 mark, ETH failed to sustain upward momentum and is currently struggling under the $1,820 resistance zone. On May 3, Ethereum managed to climb to a local high of $1,873 before slipping back below key support levels, including the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Technical indicators now reveal a short-term bearish trend, with a resistance line forming near $1,835 on the ETH/USD hourly chart. The immediate risk lies in ETH’s ability to hold above the $1,772 to $1,824 range, a price cluster where over 4.5 million addresses collectively purchased more than 6.36 million ETH. The average cost basis for this zone stands at approximately $1,799. If ETH dips below this support, analysts warn that the path downward could be steep. Below $1,772, the data shows significantly lower investor activity, meaning there are fewer buyers to cushion any drop. In such a scenario, Ethereum’s price could cascade toward $1,500. The most critical support level for #Ethereum $ETH is at $1,770, according to on-chain data from @intotheblock ! pic.twitter.com/PtEBRaRlWT — Ali (@ali_charts) May 3, 2025 A prominent crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, highlighted this critical juncture in a May 3 post, warning that the ETH price could fall further if this support doesn’t hold. Yet, others remain cautiously optimistic. If Ethereum can bounce from this zone and break above $1,840, followed by a key resistance at $1,880, it may rally toward $1,950, potentially reclaiming $2,000 if momentum holds. However, with the RSI dipping below 50 and the MACD turning bearish, the road ahead is fraught with short-term uncertainty. Speculation of a Breakout Grows with Market Sentiment and Roadmap Catalysts While price action appears shaky, sentiment among analysts suggests that Ethereum could be on the cusp of a breakout if the right catalyst emerges. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Fund and a well-known voice in crypto analysis, noted in an April 30 post that Ethereum is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern, a classic setup for a bullish reversal. $ETH is consolidating before a big breakout upwards. The liquidity is up for grabs, it just needs a news related item to kick it off. pic.twitter.com/VQaGvfZcA0 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 30, 2025 Van de Poppe’s observation is supported by declining trade volumes, a hallmark of the falling wedge structure, as resistance levels grow steeper and support flattens. He argues Ethereum is now in a prime position for a breakout, with bearish sentiment across altcoins creating a contrarian opportunity. “The next leg upwards is on the horizon,” he also mentioned , calling the extreme negativity around Ethereum and other major altcoins a setup for eventual strong ROI once sentiment turns. The next leg upwards is on the horizon for the #Crypto markets. The bearish sentiment remains extreme on #Altcoins and that's an ideal ingredient for the next leg up. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 30, 2025 The anticipated impact of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s 2025 roadmap adds to potential bullish catalysts. With Ethereum’s mainnet maturing and Layer 2 solutions continuing to flourish post-Dencun, investors are looking for the next phase of scalability, efficiency, and ecosystem expansion. While long-term holder behavior reflects strong confidence, and technicals suggest the possibility of a breakout, Ethereum still needs a catalyst to truly reverse the narrative. Until then, Ethereum’s future rests delicately on the shoulders of those willing to hold and accumulate amid uncertainty, believing not just in the asset’s price but in the platform’s enduring potential. It remains to be seen whether this sustained accumulation marks an inflection point in Ethereum’s price cycle, but it is clear that strong hands are getting stronger.

Over the past year, the meme coin has dropped by around 40%. While things seemed to improve a bit for SHIB in April 2025, what’s next? Is Shiba Inu a good investment? What can we expect for the SHIB token this month? To stay up to date, check out our Shiba Inu price prediction for May 2025. Table of Contents What is SHIB? SHIB price factors for May 2025 Shiba Inu crypto price prediction: general outlook Shiba Inu price prediction: May 2025 What is SHIB? Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) is a meme coin that features the Shiba Inu dog breed as its mascot. It also offers its own ecosystem, which includes several other crypto assets, the decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, and a layer-2 network called Shibarium. You might also like: How high will the Shiba Inu price reach if Bitcoin hits $100,000? The Shiba Inu token was created by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi on July 31, 2020, with the goal of building a decentralized community free from outside control. Ryoshi also positioned SHIB as a competitor to Dogecoin , using the same Shiba Inu dog breed for branding. Shiba Inu brings together a community of supporters aiming to challenge Dogecoin. That said, SHIB doesn’t have a unique use case. Its main applications are in traditional areas: sending tokens to other crypto addresses, contributing to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges, and trading on those platforms. In some cases, it’s accepted as a form of payment. What’s going to shape the Shiba Inu price prediction for May 2025? SHIB price factors for May 2025 On April 30th, Shiba Inu’s community burned 284 million tokens in just 24 hours, aiming to reduce supply and increase the token’s value. This burn is part of a broader strategy to boost scarcity and demand for SHIB. Led by key figures like Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya, the burn highlights SHIB’s commitment to long-term value growth. Shibburn’s founder noted that this move is crucial for the coin’s future. The burn’s immediate impact could lead to higher demand and potentially drive up SHIB’s price. With the burn process becoming more automated, it could offer consistent supply reductions and strengthen investor confidence in SHIB’s market position. What’s the current trend SHIB’s price, and what’s the Shiba Inu coin price prediction for the short term? Shiba Inu crypto price prediction: general outlook The current price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is $0.0000127, as of May 5, 2025. Over the last 24 hours, the price has moved by -2.2%, with a change of -0.46% in the past hour. For longer-term performance, the price has varied by -8.86% over the last 7 days and by 2.83% in the past month. SHIB 1-day chart, May 2025 | Source: crypto.news SHIB’s recent ups and downs reflect what’s going on in the wider crypto space — uncertainty is everywhere. Prices have taken a hit lately, but there’s also a spark of optimism thanks to rising investor interest and some exciting updates from the Shiba Inu team. The recent 284 million token burn on April 30, combined with progress on the Shibarium layer-2 network, shows the community’s commitment to long-term value creation and utility. Still, SHIB remains a high-risk, high-volatility asset. Its price is heavily influenced by speculative trading, social media trends, and general sentiment in the meme coin space. While technical improvements and ecosystem expansion could support gradual growth, sustained gains will likely depend on broader market recovery and continued community engagement. In short, SHIB is showing some signs of life — but its future remains closely tied to market cycles and ongoing adoption efforts. What does the SHIB price prediction for May 2025 look like according to analytical sites? Will Shiba Inu go up or down? Shiba Inu price prediction: May 2025 CoinCodex gave a slightly negative Shiba Inu price prediction for May 2025, expecting the coin to drop to $0.00001319 by May 31. The site’s technical analysis was neutral overall, with 12 indicators showing bearish signals and 16 showing bullish ones. Wallet Investor was more optimistic in its Shiba Inu price forecast, suggesting that SHIB could have a positive month, with the price potentially climbing to a maximum of $0.0000152 by mid-May 2025. DigitalCoinPrice had a more cautious projection for SHIB. Looks like SHIB might just stay put near $0.0000135 this May, without much movement either way.

Strategy Bought 1,895 Bitcoins for $180.3 Million at an Average Price of $95K The average purchase price stood at $95,167 per Bitcoin, reinforcing the firm's belief in Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This latest acquisition adds to Strategy’s growing portfolio, which is already the largest institutional Bitcoin treasury worldwide. The purchase comes as Bitcoin continues to trade in the $90,000-$95,000 range amid macroeconomic uncertainty and speculation about potential Federal Reserve policy changes. Despite the volatility, the strategy has remained consistent in its dollar-cost averaging strategy, accumulating thousands of BTC since 2020 under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Michael Saylor.

The decision was delivered during the company’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which caught investors off guard despite years of succession planning. The 94-year-old CEO stated that he will officially hand over his position to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, whom economists had predicted would become his heir apparent. In January, Buffett had told investors that his time at the conglomerate was coming to an end, although when he planned to step down had not been disclosed until now. Abel himself was reportedly unaware that the announcement would be made at the meeting. The news sent Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) down 2% in Monday’s premarket trading, falling to $528.91. According to Google Finance data, the shares’ price corrected positively to $539.83, less than an hour before markets opened. Still, Berkshire’s Class B shares have a strong year-on-year performance, recording gains of approximately 33%, well above the S&P 500’s 12% gain over the same period. Buffett trusts Abel to continue his legacy at Berkshire Hathaway At the Saturday meeting, Buffett did not give a concise elaboration on how the transition would take place, although he confirmed Abel will step up to the chair position. The vice chairman addressed shareholders, promising to be more active in overseeing Berkshire’s subsidiaries, while continuing to let each unit operate independently and “in a very positive way.” Abel has overseen most of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses since 2018, while the firm’s insurance operations, including Geico, General Re, and National Indemnity, will continue to report to Vice Chairman Ajit Jain. KBW analyst Meyer Shields told investors in a client note that Abel is competent, but the surprise Warren Buffett exit news would likely weigh on the stock in the near term. “ Buffett’s departure will probably impact investors’ view of Berkshire more than it will actual operations ,” Shields wrote. According to market insiders, Buffett is supposedly irreplaceable for his investment acumen and his reputation as the Oracle of Omaha. The company holds stocks in several industries like railroads, insurance, energy, and even an ice-cream maker, which many have coined as a symbol of “stable, long-term value” since Buffett took charge in 1965. Berkshire shareholders are worried about how the firm’s 189 operating units, $264 billion in stocks, and $348 billion in cash reserves would be managed without the $160 billion-worth CEO. Stock market in the green, futures slips Pre-market data shows the US stock market could start the week on a stronger footing, but stock futures are down across major indices. Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.8%, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 278 points (0.7%), and Nasdaq-100 futures lost 0.9%. The S&P 500 in Monday’s session looks set to open with a 1.5% gain, its tenth consecutive positive session and longest winning streak since November 2004. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also posted gains of 1.5% and nearly 1.4% respectively last Friday. The Federal Reserve is slated to begin a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, and the interest rate decision comes the following day. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, traders see only a 3.2% chance of a rate cut at this meeting. The US dollar weakened for a second straight day, threatening to end the S&P 500’s winning streak. Brent crude futures plunged by as much as 4.6% following OPEC+’s decision to increase supply, while gold prices rose to $3,260 due to a weaker greenback.

This partnership will support innovative and high-impact initiatives throughout the year. It will fund “thousands” of classroom projects and teacher requests during Teacher Appreciation Week , Teach For America’s Ignite tutoring program, and STEM Innovation Challenge .

The collaboration will focus on financial literacy. Therefore, the funding will provide students and educators with the resources to “improve academic outcomes, build economic resilience, and thrive in a rapidly evolving job market.” That said, Ripple notes that stablecoins represent over half of all onchain transaction volume in recent months, according to Chainalysis data. It argues that “the ability for charitable organizations to utilize these technologies directly within their own networks” will become increasingly valuable. Ripple introduced RLUSD – a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin fully collateralized by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries, and other cash equivalents – in June 2024 and began beta testing in early August.

Through this partnership, “students will not only get their hands on materials that will enhance their learning, but they will also have the tools to help set them on the path to a bright future,” Guerrier says. Furthermore, Ripple claims that, since 2018, it has contributed more than $200 million to global initiatives. Also, nearly 80% of its employees have joined donations and volunteering programs. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the partnership will enable the company and the nonprofits to benefit thousands of classrooms across the US. “Together, we hope to inspire others to do the same,” he concludes.

This rally, which saw Bitcoin climb more than 32 percent from its April low of $74,501 to nearly $98,000, highlights the asset’s resilience amid macroeconomic turbulence and shifting risk sentiment. Reclaiming the $95,000 level—the lower boundary of its former three-month range—is now the key technical threshold . Holding this zone, especially as BTC consolidates above the short-term holder cost basis of $93,340, could lay the groundwork for a move back toward all-time highs. On-chain data supports this narrative: miner reserves remain stable and the Puell Multiple suggests little incentive for large-scale miner selling, indicating confidence in further upside. While the near-term hinges on whether BTC can convert this reclaim into sustainable support, structural signals continue to lean bullish—setting the stage for a potential continuation of the current cycle once macro conditions stabilise. Bitcoin Miner Reserves. (Source: CryptoQuant) The US economy showed surface-level resilience in April, with 177,000 new jobs added and unemployment holding steady at 4.2 percent . Labour force participation grew, and key sectors like education, healthcare, and hospitality continued hiring. However, wage growth slowed to 0.2 percent monthly and 3.8 percent annually, job openings declined, and certain industries like manufacturing and retail lost jobs—signs of a cooling labour market. These positive headlines mask deeper structural issues, as companies may be “ labour hoarding ” after past hiring struggles, and the jobs report is increasingly seen as a lagging indicator. Meanwhile, consumer spending appears stable on the surface but reveals cracks beneath—durable goods purchases dropped sharply , while nondurables and services rose . A temporary surge in equipment investment lifted private investment numbers, but broader economic momentum remains weak. Imports soared over 40 percent, widening the trade deficit and dragging GDP down by 0.3 percent in Q1, largely due to corporations front-loading goods ahead of tariff hikes. Gross Domestic Product (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis) Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level since 2020 , with the Expectations Index dropping to a level historically linked to recessions. Rising concerns about income, job security, and inflation—driven by ongoing trade tensions—are weighing heavily on sentiment. As inflationary pressure from tariffs builds and household income growth stalls, the US faces a precarious period of economic deceleration. In the cryptosphere, Nexo has reentered the US market after a two-year exit, citing a more favourable regulatory climate and political support, particularly under the Trump campaign’s pro-crypto stance. The company now aims to offer a fully compliant suite of crypto-backed financial products, reflecting a broader industry shift toward cooperation with regulators. Meanwhile, the Arizona House passed two bills that would allow the state to invest up to 10 percent of its funds in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially making it the first U.S. state to hold crypto in its treasury and retirement systems—though the outcome remains uncertain due to Governor Hobbs’ veto warning tied to broader budget concerns. Across the Atlantic, the UK government introduced draft legislation to regulate crypto platforms, emphasising consumer protection and transparency, while also strengthening collaboration with the U.S. to establish a transatlantic regulatory framework. Lastly, the SEC concluded its investigation into PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD without enforcement action, signalling potential regulatory clarity for stablecoins and reinforcing PayPal’s position in the evolving digital asset landscape.

One sector making massive waves right now is artificial intelligence, particularly in how it’s revolutionizing software development. This brings us to the exciting news surrounding AI Coding Tools startup, Cursor AI. What’s Behind the Surge in AI Coding Tools Interest? The demand for efficiency and innovation in software development is higher than ever. Developers are constantly seeking ways to accelerate coding, reduce errors, and free up time for more complex tasks. This is where AI Coding Tools come into play. Tools like Cursor AI leverage large language models to assist programmers with everything from writing new code and debugging to understanding existing codebases. They promise a significant boost in productivity, making them incredibly attractive to companies and, consequently, to investors. This growing utility has fueled a significant surge in Startup Funding directed towards companies operating in this space. Investors see the potential for these tools to become indispensable parts of the modern development workflow, creating large and sticky markets. Cursor AI Attracts Major Venture Capital According to reports, Cursor AI is currently in discussions to raise a substantial new round of funding. The Financial Times reports that this round is expected to value Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, at a staggering $9 billion. This news highlights the intense interest from top-tier investors in the AI development sector. Leading the reported round is Thrive Capital, a firm known for its significant investments in technology. They are not alone; other prominent names in the Venture Capital world, such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Accel, are also said to be participating. This strong lineup of investors underscores the confidence in Cursor AI’s technology and market position. Rapid Growth: From $2.5 Billion to $9 Billion Valuation The reported $9 billion valuation represents a significant leap for Cursor AI in a relatively short period. Earlier this year, the company had already secured $105 million in funding from Thrive and a16z, which valued the company at $2.5 billion. Jumping from a $2.5 billion valuation to a potential $9 billion valuation within months demonstrates the rapid pace of growth and the escalating expectations surrounding AI Coding Tools . This accelerated increase in valuation is a clear indicator of the bullish sentiment in the market for companies positioned at the intersection of AI and developer productivity. It’s a trend that’s reshaping the landscape of Tech Investment . Broader Trends in the AI Development Ecosystem Cursor AI’s success isn’t happening in isolation. The entire AI-powered coding segment is experiencing heightened investor interest. For example, Bitcoin World previously reported on Windsurf, another startup in this space, discussing a potential funding round at a $3 billion valuation. There were even reports of OpenAI exploring an acquisition of Windsurf at a similar valuation, further illustrating the competitive and rapidly evolving nature of this market. This environment suggests that the adoption of AI Coding Tools is not just a niche trend but a significant shift in how software will be built in the future. As AI capabilities advance, the tools available to developers will become even more powerful, potentially democratizing coding and accelerating innovation across various industries, including blockchain and decentralized applications. Key Insights from Cursor AI’s Funding News What can we take away from this significant development? Here are some key points: High Investor Confidence: Top Venture Capital firms like Thrive, a16z, and Accel are pouring significant funds into the AI coding space, signaling strong belief in its future. Rapid Market Growth: Cursor AI’s valuation jump from $2.5 billion to a reported $9 billion in a short time highlights the explosive growth potential perceived by the market. Strategic Importance of AI Coding Tools: Companies are recognizing the value these tools bring to developer productivity and efficiency. Competitive Landscape: The interest in other startups like Windsurf shows this is a dynamic and competitive sector within the broader Tech Investment world. Fueling Innovation: Increased Startup Funding enables companies like Cursor AI to invest more heavily in R&D, pushing the boundaries of what AI can do for developers. Looking Ahead The reported funding round for Cursor AI at a $9 billion valuation is a major headline in the world of Tech Investment and AI. It underscores the immense value being placed on technologies that enhance human productivity and creativity, particularly in the crucial field of software development. As AI continues to evolve, expect to see further innovation and significant investment in tools that empower developers and shape the future of technology.

A recent survey offers fascinating insights, shedding light on expectations for Bitcoin, overall market sentiment, and crucially, perspectives on the Ethereum Pectra upgrade. Korean Crypto Investors Weigh In on Market Trends A survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between April 29 and May 2 polled 2,000 individuals, tracking weekly trends among Korean crypto investors. The results provide a snapshot of sentiment and expectations within this significant market. What Are Korean Crypto Investors Expecting for Bitcoin? When asked about Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential price movement, a notable portion of Korean crypto investors anticipate positive action: Increase or Significantly Jump: 48.1% (up from 46.2% the previous week) Stable Market: 36.5% (down from 38.9%) Decline or Sharp Drop: 15.4% (up from 14.9%) This indicates a slight increase in bullish sentiment compared to the prior week, with nearly half of respondents expecting upward movement in Bitcoin price expectation. Unpacking Crypto Market Sentiment Among Korean Investors Beyond specific price predictions, the survey gauged the general crypto market sentiment: Overall feelings expressed by respondents were: Neutral: 46.4% Optimism or Extreme Optimism: 35.2% Fear or Extreme Fear: 18.4% While a plurality felt neutral, the balance between optimism and fear leaned towards the positive side, reflecting a cautiously hopeful outlook among Korean crypto investors. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade: Korean Investors Prioritize Stability A key focus of the survey was the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, specifically the Ethereum Foundation’s decision to exclude the EVM Object Format (EOF) from the upcoming hard fork. This decision aimed for a more streamlined upgrade path. Here’s how Korean crypto investors viewed this move: Investor Viewpoint Percentage Cautious move strengthens long-term network stability 43.4% Decision could cause Ethereum to fall behind other platforms 27.9% Upgrade prioritizes users, with emphasis on stability 21.2% Technical change will have no impact on the price of ETH 7.6% The most prominent opinion, held by 43.4%, is that the exclusion of EOF is a cautious step that will ultimately enhance Ethereum network stability in the long run. Another significant portion (21.2%) also viewed the decision through the lens of user prioritization and stability. Ethereum Stability vs. Innovation: The Investor View While a majority of Korean crypto investors saw the EOF exclusion as a positive step for Ethereum network stability, a notable 27.9% expressed concern that this could potentially slow down Ethereum’s progress relative to competing platforms. This highlights a common tension in blockchain development: balancing rapid innovation with ensuring robust and stable infrastructure. The survey provides valuable insights into the mindset of Korean crypto investors. They show increasing bullishness on Bitcoin price expectation, maintain a largely neutral-to-optimistic crypto market sentiment, and significantly prioritize long-term Ethereum network stability when it comes to the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, even if it means a more phased approach to new features.

To read full editions, subscribe . In the past few months, we’ve talked about the rise of fundamentals in crypto . I take a similar stance to Arca CIO Jeff Dorman when looking at projects: I’m not expecting them to start producing revenue tomorrow, but I’m very aware that projects will need some sort of vision about how they plan to make money. VC raises can truly only get them so far. But Dorman, in this week’s episode of the Empire podcast, made an interesting point. Some projects can win in the social value category without necessarily relying on other fundamentals. “You’ve got financial value, which is cash flows. You’ve got utility value, which is some form of usefulness. And then you have social value. And social value is real. It’s much harder to define. But you can’t dismiss it,” Dorman explained. He clarified that he’s not just thinking about memecoins or memestocks, but projects that have really catered to and built up social value. If you’re searching for a winner in this category, it may be Ripple. XRP, at a market cap of $126 billion, is arguably overvalued. “ But that doesn’t [mean that] because there is no financial value, there is no utility value. It’s a hundred percent just social value,” Dorman explained. The “ social value of being one of the oldest cryptocurrencies and having this massive following could one day lead to something that does have financial value.” Dorman compared it to a call option, referring to the contract between a buyer and seller to purchase a stock at a certain price within a set period. To its credit, Ripple is eyeing ways to boost its own financial profile. Ripple acquired Hidden Road, giving it access to a new business with the added bonus of a US broker-dealer license. And, if we’re to believe a report from Bloomberg last week, Ripple also attempted to approach Circle with a hefty bid between $4 and $5 billion. The bid, at this point, is pretty on par with what Circle itself is eyeing upon public debut, but it’s too early to say whether or not it can debut at that valuation. All of this is to say that Ripple is clearly trying to take advantage of its dominance and expand its reach, which has the added potential of boosting its fundamental value. So fundamentals aren’t key to success yet, but I also wonder if any other project could copy what Ripple’s done at this stage. It seems to be in a league of its own. Get the news in your inbox.

In a May 5 Truth Social post , Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative. In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin. “President Trump’s announcement promises exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for significant investment in one of the President’s business ventures,” a letter co-signed by California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff read. A call for impeachment over a memecoin Also in late April, Senator Jon Ossoff expressed support for impeaching Trump during an April 25 town hall, citing the president’s plan to host the dinner for top TRUMP memecoin holders. He said: “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him. There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis and at least one other Republican in Congress were reportedly also critical of Trump for offering the top holders of his memecoin a dinner and White House tour. Lummis, of Wyoming, reportedly said that the US president offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” In a May 4 post on X, Warren claimed the Trump family’s stablecoin surged in market value due to a “shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates,” which involved settling the investment using USD1. She argued this raised serious national security concerns and warned against the Senate passing crypto-friendly legislation. Warren expressed concerns around foreign involvement in the US president’s finances. She also suggested that the Senate should refrain from approving pro-crypto bills: “The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption.“ Related: America’s crypto renaissance is already failing; but we can fix it Source: Elizabeth Warren Warren’s post included a clip from a recent interview during which Trump gave conflicting answers to whether he has profited from the crypto memecoin he launched in January, just days before he reentered the White House. During the clip, the president claims not to have “even looked” to check whether he profited off his endeavours. Related: Elizabeth Warren joins call for probe of Trump over crypto tokens The United Arab Emirates deal Warren was likely referring to the recent deal that saw Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX use USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Source: CoinMarketCap Eric Trump announced the deal during a panel discussion at Token2049 in Dubai. Trump, the son of the president, serves as executive vice president of the Trump Organization. He said during the event: “The US is seeing that the financial world has to progress. It’s a joke. Why do banks run nine to five, Monday to Friday, with an hour and a half of lunch break? It doesn’t make sense.” Much like the memecoin, the USD1 stablecoin also attracted its fair share of criticism. In early April, some US lawmakers went as far as to allege that Trump wanted to replace the US dollar with USD1 .

This update was highlighted by SMQKE in a recent post on X, drawing attention to the central bank’s exploration of XRP’s capabilities in the context of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The Central Bank of France has explicitly stated a preference for using XRP as the basis for issuing a digital euro. This is documented. https://t.co/oVqqat6zA4 pic.twitter.com/ACN4SYr3Ip — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 5, 2025 XRP’s Potential Role in France’s Digital Euro Initiative The Banque de France has been actively engaged in researching and experimenting with CBDCs, aiming to modernize the financial system and enhance cross-border payment efficiency. As part of this initiative, the central bank has conducted several experiments to assess the viability of various technologies in supporting a digital euro. XRP, known for its rapid transaction processing and scalability, has emerged as a candidate of interest. Reports indicate that the Banque de France has considered XRP’s underlying technology for its potential to facilitate seamless and secure digital transactions. This consideration aligns with the bank’s objective to identify robust and efficient platforms capable of underpinning a national digital currency. Implications for the Broader Financial Ecosystem The Banque de France’s exploration of XRP as a basis for the digital euro underscores a growing recognition of blockchain technologies in central banking. Should XRP be integrated into the digital euro framework, it could set a precedent for other central banks contemplating similar digital currency initiatives.

The Banque de France’s consideration of XRP as a foundational technology for the digital euro represents a significant intersection of traditional banking and innovative blockchain solutions. While the exploration is ongoing, this development highlights the evolving landscape of digital finance and the potential for cryptocurrencies like XRP to play a pivotal role in the future of monetary systems.

The Ministry of Communications and Digital claims that Worldcoin's local entities operated without proper certification and may have misrepresented their legal status. This adds to a growing list of countries raising concerns about the platform's handling of biometric data. Despite the regulatory scrutiny, World ID launched in six major US cities and announced partnerships with Visa, Match Group, and others. Meanwhile, OpenAI faced backlash for releasing a version of GPT-4o that was overly sycophantic. The company admitted to overlooking early warnings and promised to implement formal evaluations in future updates. Regulators Crack Down on Sam Altman’s Worldcoin Project OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s digital identity project, World, which was previously known as Worldcoin, is facing regulatory challenges in Indonesia after the Ministry of Communications and Digital (Komdigi) temporarily suspended its Electronic System Operator Certificate Registration (TDPSE). The suspension affects both World and World ID due to allegations of suspicious activity and registration violations. Press release from Komdigi Authorities stated that World’s local subsidiary, PT Terang Bulan Abadi, was operating without the required certification, while another affiliated entity, PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara, was allegedly involved in legal misrepresentation by registering World’s services under its name. Indonesian law mandates that all digital service providers must register their operations officially, and using another entity’s registration is considered a serious breach. In response to these violations, Komdigi announced plans to summon both local subsidiaries for further clarification. Alexander Sabar, director general for digital supervision at Komdigi, placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that strict compliance is necessary to protect Indonesia’s digital space and urged the public to report any suspicious services through official channels. Sabar also stressed the need for community involvement in ensuring a secure digital environment. Public reaction to the situation has been divided. Some people praised the Indonesian government for taking action against what they see as a risky initiative. Others suggested that World’s services might offer tangible benefits in a country where financial incentives tied to biometric data could help struggling communities. (Source: Reddit ) This latest development just adds to the number of countries who raised concerns about the potential misuse of biometric data collected through World’s platform. Some of these countries include Germany, Kenya, and Brazil. World ID Expands to Six US Cities Despite Indonesia’s recent crackdown, Sam Altman’s World project officially launched in the United States , and made its debut in six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The project is designed to verify human identity in the age of AI, and it offers its native crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to users who verify themselves by scanning their face and eyes using the project’s distinctive Orb device. These biometric scans are then used to generate a World ID, which can be used across various online platforms including Reddit, Discord, Telegram, Shopify, and even Minecraft. World was previously hesitant to operate in the US due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding its token offering, but now appears to be moving forward under a more crypto-friendly climate encouraged by the Trump administration. Despite growing its user base to 26 million globally, with 12 million of those users verified through Orb scans, the company still faces a lot of scrutiny from regulators around the world. Several European nations, including Spain and Portugal, also suspended its operations over data privacy concerns. At a launch event in San Francisco on April 30, World announced a partnership with Visa to introduce a World Visa card later this year. This will allow verified users to make payments using WLD and other cryptocurrencies. In addition to this, Match Group, the parent company of popular dating apps like Tinder, Match.com, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, will begin piloting World ID integration to help users verify the authenticity of profiles and foster genuine connections. World also revealed collaborations with decentralized lending platform Morpho and prediction market startup Kalshi. WLD’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Although WLD saw an initial price boost of around 15% after the US expansion news, the token has since lost those gains and is now trading at just under $1. This means that WLD’s price dropped by more than 3% over the past 24 hours of trading. The token’s price is also still much lower than its March 2024 all-time high of $11.74. OpenAI Faces Backlash Over Sycophantic AI Meanwhile, OpenAI acknowledged that it ignored early warnings from expert reviewers before releasing an update to its GPT-4o model, which led to the AI becoming excessively agreeable and overly flattering in its responses. The update was rolled out on April 25, but was quickly reversed just three days later after growing safety concerns and public criticism. In a May 2 postmortem blog post , OpenAI admitted that although some expert testers flagged that the model’s behavior “felt” off during pre-launch checks, the company moved forward based on positive feedback from other users who tested the model. OpenAI later admitted that this decision was a mistake. The company said it failed to properly weigh qualitative feedback that hinted at deeper issues not captured by its usual evaluation metrics. The AI’s behavior after launch led to widespread online complaints that it was excessively sycophantic, praising virtually any idea a user presented, no matter how unrealistic or poorly thought-out. One user referred to a particularly striking example where ChatGPT enthusiastically supported the idea of selling ice over the internet — essentially water customers would refreeze — without offering any critical feedback. OpenAI explained that the issue stemmed from adjustments to how the model was rewarded during training. The introduction of a new user feedback reward signal diluted the strength of the model’s primary reward signal, which previously helped keep sycophantic tendencies in check. Because user feedback often favors agreeable or affirming responses, the AI was subtly nudged into a more flattering tone, which ended up amplifying the effect. The company now recognizes the risks that such behavior can pose, especially as more people turn to AI for personal and emotional advice. Unlike a year ago, ChatGPT is increasingly being used for deeply personal conversations, which demands greater responsibility in how its outputs are tuned and reviewed. OpenAI admitted that despite internal discussions around sycophancy in the past, it did not actually implement formal ways to detect or evaluate it during testing. Going forward, it plans to include “sycophancy evaluations” in its safety reviews and will block future launches if such behavioral issues are detected. (Source: OpenAI ) The company also acknowledged the lack of transparency in how it handled the rollout, and stated that even small model changes can greatly impact user experience.

44192015,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66210,1746452426,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,How Much XRP Should You Really Hold? Here’s Expert Advice,https://timestabloid.com/how-much-xrp-should-you-really-hold-heres-expert-advice/,"All Things XRP (@XRP_investing), a respected voice in the XRP community, recently addressed one of the most common questions among new and seasoned investors: how much XRP should someone own? According to the pundit, the right amount to hold is “what you can afford.” He stated that there is no universal figure that fits everyone’s situation. This message stood in contrast to many posts on social media that trend specific minimum amounts as if they were requirements. All Things XRP encouraged a mindset of self-awareness and financial discipline. His post emphasized personal limits, peace of mind, and belief in the asset, saying that holding XRP should never come at the cost of financial strain or emotional stress. Clarity Over Hype The statement comes when discussions around XRP ownership are filled with speculation, predictions, and so-called “magic numbers” that suggest future wealth. All Things XRP provided a needed counterpoint, highlighting that responsible investing isn’t about chasing figures set by others, but about aligning decisions with one’s finances and understanding of the market. His advice was not centered on price projections or timelines. Instead, it focused on encouraging holders to remain realistic and informed. Instead of chasing these magic numbers, prominent figures in the XRP community have pushed for strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging . For many in the community, these comments resonate more strongly than hype-driven price predictions. It reminds investors to stay grounded and avoid overexposure based on community pressure or speculative forecasts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Responses from the Community Several replies to the post echoed this approach. One commenter reflected on missing early opportunities in crypto, particularly Bitcoin, noting that XRP feels different due to its institutional connections. He shared plans to allocate a small percentage of his account to XRP, attempting to invest responsibly. Another user offered a personal motto: “Hold confidently. Stack responsibly.” This reinforces the principle that ownership should be based on education and purpose, not blind accumulation. A different commenter added that investments should never jeopardize one’s livelihood. He stated that the ideal amount is one that, if lost, would not disrupt the investor’s life, but could make a significant impact if successful. A Focus on Long-Term Thinking The broader takeaway from All Things XRP’s message and the surrounding conversation is the emphasis on patience, discipline, and strategy. The XRP community is known for its belief in long-term utility and mainstream use. However, this belief does not justify reckless behavior. For those who believe in XRP’s future, buying what feels right may be the most responsible decision. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

44192065,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157216,1746452454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Top Crypto Keywords Dominating the Korean Crypto Community,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-crypto-community-trends-2/,"Understanding the pulse of regional cryptocurrency markets can offer unique insights into sentiment, interest, and potential narratives. The South Korean market, often referred to as the K-Community, is known for its active and passionate participants. This report from Bitcoin World provides a fascinating glimpse into the specific crypto tokens that captured the most attention within the Korean crypto community between April 25 and May 1. What Were the Top Crypto Keywords in the K-Community Search? Bitcoin World tracked the search activity within its K-Community platform to identify which tokens users were most actively looking up. The results reveal a mix of established giants and some potentially surprising altcoins: XRP: 63,869 searches TRUMP: 24,781 searches MOVE: 20,113 searches ETH: 19,437 searches BTC: 17,188 searches SUI: 16,846 searches ONDO: 15,293 searches SIGN: 9,490 searches PUNDIAI: 9,152 searches VIRTUAL: 7,654 searches The dominance of XRP at the top of the search list is immediately striking, showing a level of interest significantly higher than the second-place token. This highlights the continued strong following and perhaps ongoing curiosity surrounding XRP’s developments or legal status within the Korean market. The appearance of tokens like TRUMP and MOVE, with substantial search volumes, suggests specific narratives or project-related hype were driving curiosity during this period. While BTC and ETH remain in the top 10, their search volumes are notably lower than XRP, indicating that users were perhaps more focused on researching specific altcoin opportunities or news rather than the market anchors. Beyond Search: Which Tokens Sparked the Most Crypto Discussion Trends? While search volume indicates curiosity, the list of most mentioned tokens often reflects active discussion, community sentiment, and news reaction. Here’s what the crypto discussion trends looked like in the K-Community during the same week: BTC: 1,212 mentions ETH: 668 mentions TRUMP: 371 mentions XRP: 316 mentions SOL: 222 mentions SUI: 188 mentions ONDO: 118 mentions LAYER: 108 mentions MOVE: 82 mentions DOGE: 81 mentions Comparing the two lists reveals fascinating differences. BTC and ETH take the top spots in mentions, suggesting they are the fundamental topics of conversation, likely related to overall market sentiment, price movements, and major news. XRP, while dominating searches, drops to fourth place in mentions, implying high individual curiosity but perhaps less active community-wide discussion compared to BTC, ETH, and even TRUMP. TRUMP remains high on both lists, confirming it was a significant topic of interest and conversation. The appearance of SOL, LAYER, and DOGE in the mentions list, despite not being in the top 10 searches, indicates that broader market movers and popular altcoins were also subjects of active community chat. Analyzing Bitcoin World Korea Data: Why These Top K-Community Tokens? Delving into the specifics of why these particular tokens emerged as the top K-Community tokens provides valuable context. The data from Bitcoin World Korea points to several potential drivers: XRP’s Enduring Appeal: The high search volume for XRP likely stems from the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple and the SEC. The Korean community has historically shown strong support for XRP, and any news or developments related to the case or Ripple’s business updates tend to generate significant interest. The Rise of Narrative Tokens: TRUMP’s high ranking in both searches and mentions is a clear indicator of the impact of political meme coin narratives, especially with global political events unfolding. These tokens often gain traction based on social trends and speculative interest. Project-Specific Hype: Tokens like MOVE, SUI, and ONDO appearing prominently suggest that these projects had recent news, updates, or specific catalysts that piqued the interest of the Korean community. SUI, for instance, has been active with ecosystem developments, while ONDO is associated with real-world asset (RWA) narratives, which are gaining traction. Majors as Market Barometers: While not always leading searches for specific information, BTC and ETH remain central to community discussions. Their price action, network developments (like Ethereum’s upgrades), and role as market leaders make them constant topics of conversation. Emerging or Niche Interest: Tokens like SIGN, PUNDIAI, and VIRTUAL in the search list, and LAYER in the mentions list, could represent interest in newer projects, specific technological trends (like Layer 2s), or tokens with a dedicated but perhaps smaller community base driving focused attention. This breakdown highlights that the K-Community’s focus is diverse, driven by a mix of long-term holdings (XRP), speculative narratives (TRUMP), specific project developments (SUI, ONDO, MOVE), and the foundational market movements of BTC and ETH. Actionable Insights from Crypto Search Trends Korea For investors and market observers, these crypto search trends Korea offer several actionable insights: Community Sentiment Matters: High search and mention volumes can indicate areas of intense retail interest, which can sometimes precede price movements or indicate potential community support for a token. Search vs. Discussion: A token high in searches but lower in mentions (like XRP in this instance) might indicate individual research rather than widespread community debate or consensus. Conversely, tokens high in mentions but lower in search (like SOL or DOGE here) might be part of broader, more general market chatter rather than specific deep dives. Identify Emerging Narratives: The appearance of tokens like TRUMP, MOVE, SUI, and ONDO signals that specific themes (political memes, RWA, specific ecosystems) were resonating strongly with the K-Community during this period. Regional Differences Exist: The prominence of certain tokens in the Korean market may differ significantly from global trends, underscoring the importance of understanding regional nuances. Paying attention to these community-driven metrics can provide an edge in understanding which tokens are capturing the retail imagination in key markets like South Korea. Conclusion The data from Bitcoin World for the week of April 25 to May 1 provides a compelling snapshot of the tokens that were top of mind for the Korean crypto community . From XRP’s enduring search dominance and the surprising rise of narrative tokens like TRUMP and MOVE, to the consistent discussion around market leaders BTC and ETH, the K-Community’s interests are dynamic and diverse. Monitoring these trends offers valuable insights into where retail attention is focused and helps illuminate the unique dynamics of one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Understanding these specific search and discussion patterns is key to staying informed about the evolving landscape of top K-Community tokens .

44192051,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/5-global-players-betting-big-on-tokenized-real-world-assets,1746452472,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44192051.jpeg,5 Global Players Betting Big On Tokenized Real-World Assets,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/5-global-players-betting-big-on-tokenized-real-world-assets,"Globally, attitudes are shifting and becoming more favorable towards crypto, and one of the main reasons for this change is thought to be the emergence of tokenized real-world assets, which help to bring traditional financial assets on-chain. Called RWAs, they enable things like real estate to be traded in the same way as Bitcoin. With tokens, investors can own a fraction of a high-value asset such as a castle or a Monet painting without putting up millions in capital. Traditional financial powerhouses in the U.S, such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have made headlines for throwing their weight behind RWAs, but this movement is actually occurring on a much bigger, global scale. Indeed, globally, the value of RWAs has already surpassed more than $10 billion. So let's take a closer look at some of the biggest players in these emerging RWA markets. Saudi Arabia Surprisingly, the conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia has positioned itself as one of the most enthusiastic supporters of RWAs. It has just kicked off a new initiative that aims to accelerate blockchain and AI adoption across the Middle East and Africa regions. The Saudi Arabia AI and Blockchain Centre , known as SAAIBC, was created in partnership with a startup called COTI , with the aim being to merge traditional finance with blockchain-based economics. Saudi Arabia is already a big believer in technology, with its famed Vision 2030 fund dedicated to transforming the country into a global AI powerhouse, aided by a $40 billion Public Investment Fund. SAAIBC believes that the Middle East and Africa are ripe for a blockchain-based revolution, as it sees the technology as the perfect foil for AI-led innovation. By combining AI with blockchain, it can lead to endless possibilities for the automation of more efficient, tokenized financial economies. COTI's role in the partnership is to ensure privacy for SAAIBC's tokenization infrastructure, enabling the compliance that's necessary to support institutional adoption. Dubai It was no accident that SAAIBC first announced itself to the world during the Real-World-Asset Summit in Dubai earlier this year, for the city has become another staunch supporter of tokenization and RWAs. Dubai has firmly established itself as one of the world's foremost hubs for Web3 and blockchain technologies, fostering a welcoming regulatory climate that has encouraged hundreds of startups to flock to the country. Some of the crypto industry's biggest names have established their regional headquarters in Dubai, and the city is believed to host more than 1,000 blockchain startups in total, with many of them being laser-focused on RWAs. It's also a regular host of blockchain-focused events . The city has also embraced local tokenization initiatives, with the Dubai Land Department spearheading a Real Estate Tokenisation Project that aims to diversify property ownership by enabling multiple investors to become co-owners of properties. USA We cannot ignore the USA, where the aforementioned institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have already brought billions of dollars in value on-chain. BlackRock is a global name and it has done wonders in terms of bringing more attention to the idea of tokenization. It first launched the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, on the Avalanche blockchain in March 2024, backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. Since then, it has amassed more than $2.5 billion worth of assets under blockchain management. Franklin Templeton is perhaps even more invested in blockchain, with its tokenized money fund recently being expanded to Coinbase's Layer-2 network Base, in addition to earlier deployments on Ethereum, Stellar, Polygon and Arbitrum. Known as FOBXX, the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund boasts more than $435 million in assets under management, and has been generating monthly returns of around 4.7% since its launch in 2021. Singapore Singapore has earned itself a reputation as another of the world's most pro-crypto countries, and it's now looking to take a leading role in the global push towards tokenization, partnering with dozens of traditional financial giants to do so. Last November, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced an expansion of Project Guardian , an initiative launched in 2022 that's aimed at scaling and growing the adoption of tokenized markets. The Southeast Asian city state kicked off Project Guardian with five pilot projects, including one that sees Citi team up with T Rowe Price and Fidelity International. They're exploring ways to use blockchain to price and execute digital asset trades more efficiently, along with enhancing real-time, post-trade reporting. The financial services giant Ant Group is involved in a different project that's testing out a blockchain-based treasury management system for clearing and settlements using tokenized assets, while BNY Mellon and OCBC Bank are partnering on a tokenized, cross-border foreign exchange product. Other projects include Franklin Templeton's experimental tokenized money market fund. Finally, JPMorgan Chase and the asset manager Apollo are exploring how digital assets can be used to facilitate more seamless investing and portfolio management, including automated rebalancing. The goal of the project is to eliminate the manual processes involved in traditional asset servicing. Project Guardian has also created a number of frameworks for tokenized economies. These include the Guardian Fixed Income Framework that integrates international standards within a guide for creating tokenized debt capital markets, and a Guardian Funds Framework, which recommends best practices for fund tokenization. European Union Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation came into effect in December 2024, and it has made a lot of headlines for the way it legitimizes digital assets. The regulation was primarily designed to establish a legal framework for crypto services providers and token issuers in the European Union, and it also serves as the basis of regulatory compliant tokenized assets. With MiCA, Europe has taken a major step forward towards creating a safe, regulated environment for tokenized assets, paving the way for more institutional investors to get involved. Among other things, MiCA lays down comprehensive legal standards for digital token issuers, including mandatory disclosures, while mandating that stablecoin issuers maintain reserves to back up their circulating supply and meet strict liquidity standards. It also enhances consumer protection by promoting increased transparency around tokenized assets, though on the downside, it has been criticized for increasing the regulatory burden of crypto and DeFi startups. That said, the response to MiCA has largely been positive, and it's expected that the framework will boost Europe's status as a leader in the race towards tokenizing the financial economy.

The ratio of newly-opened XRP shorts compared to long positions reached a 2-week low on May 5, as the token’s price failed to breach resistance at $2.20. To be more precise, 55.07% of positions opened in the past 12 hours have been longs, and 44.93% have been XRP shorts , per data retrieved by Finbold from market intelligence platform CoinGlass . XRP long-short ratio chart. Source: CoinGlass At press time, the price of XRP had fallen to $2.15, marking a 1.67% decline on the daily chart. Prices briefly touched the $2.14 mark on two occasions, but quickly bounced off, demonstrating a strong degree of demand at those levels. XRP price 1-day chart. Source: Finbold Is the reduction in XRP shorts a bullish signal or a false alarm? XRP’s relative strength index ( RSI ) currently sits at 38, indicating that the cryptocurrency has not yet entered oversold conditions. In addition, Ripple’s recent unlock of 1 billion tokens has led to an increase in selling pressure. With that being said, 700 million of those tokens were promptly re-locked , so the development is unlikely to drive prices below crucial support levels, at least on its own. Conversely, an increase in speculative bullish positions isn’t something that will likely cause a rebound in price — but it does speak to widespread bullish sentiment. Moreover, there appears to be no clear bearish catalyst at play — at present, the drop in price appears to be solely the result of market-wide dynamics and exhaustion on the part of the bulls. On the other hand, positive developments regarding the Ripple v. SEC case , which is expected to conclude soon, could cause enough of a sentiment shift to keep XRP out of the danger zone in the near term.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired an additional 1,895 Bitcoin ( BTC ) last week, spending roughly $180.3 million between April 28 and May 4, according to a filing with the SEC on Monday. The average purchase price was $95,167 per Bitcoin. The company funded the purchase by selling 353,825 shares of its MSTR common stock and 575,392 shares of STRK preferred stock. The equity sale was part of Strategy’s ongoing capital-raising programs aimed at increasing its bitcoin reserves. With this transaction, the company has now exhausted the MSTR portion of its “21/21 Plan,” a campaign launched to raise $42 billion for bitcoin purchases. The STRK component still has $20.87 billion in remaining capacity. In response, Strategy has initiated a new “42/42 Plan,” which aims to raise another $42 billion through a combination of equity and debt offerings over the next two years. The firm continues to issue both STRK and STRF perpetual preferred shares to support additional bitcoin acquisitions. Strategy now holds a total of 555,450 BTC, acquired at an aggregate cost of $38.08 billion. With bitcoin trading around $94,000, the company’s holdings are currently valued at over $52 billion — representing an unrealized gain of approximately $14.2 billion. That stash accounts for over 2.6% of bitcoin’s total circulating supply. You might also like: Stablecoin bill unraveling?

PI remains down by 4% in a week and by 8% in a month, with the altcoin also sitting on an 80% decline since reaching an all-time high of $2.99 on February 26. While the token has performed disappointingly since this peak, recent news has seemingly turned more positive for Pi Network, with its community celebrating a “collaboration” between the platform and French multinational bank BNP Paribas. However, a quick dive into the details reveals that BNP Paribas has confirmed no such collaboration at its end, and that the partnership actually amounts to little more than a Pi Network API that could be usable in the hypothetical event of a deal between the two parties. It’s therefore unlikely that this will have a big impact on PI’s price prediction for the longer term, which remains uncertain given the lack of wider exchange support. Pi Network Price Prediction: Can BNP Paribas Partnership Trigger the $10 Rally? This piece of ‘news’ stems from a post on X by Pi Coin Magazine, which has all of 282 followers. This post describes two separate things, but presents them in such a vague and misleading way as to suggest they’re somehow related. Firstly, it talks about the digital payment systems which BNP Paribas has been developing and rolling out in recent months, with BNP Paribas’s page on these products actually making no mention of Pi Network, at all. Flash News: BNP Paribas and Pi Network, what a great collaboration! @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao Transforming the Financial Landscape: Pi Coin and BNP Paribas Collaboration ahead! BNP Paribas has unveiled an innovative Online Payment service that harnesses the… pic.twitter.com/UQrYRWWSmg — Pi Coin Magazine (@Pi_CoinMagazine) May 3, 2025 Secondly, the post talks about the Pi Nexus Banking System, which is a set of APIs aimed at enabling integration between the Pi Network and various banks and fintech firms. Yet the thing is, even though Pi Network developers have prepared an API for integration with BNP Paribas, the latter has provided no signal whatsoever that it will ever enter into a partnership with Pi Network. In fact, a GitHub repository shows that developers have prepared similar APIs for a wide variety of financial service firms, including Barclays, Apple Pay, PayPal, Adyen, and many others. Of course, such APIs do not mean that Pi Network has entered into a partnership with Apple or PayPal, and the same goes for BNP Paribas. This fact may help explain why the Pi Network price has traded sideways today, with momentum cooling after brief signs of recovery earlier this week. The RSI has slipped just below 50 again, indicating neutral sentiment, while the 30-period moving average continues to lag beneath the 200-period level – a structure typical of consolidation before a potential move. Despite the buzz surrounding Pi’s banking ambitions, the lack of confirmation from key institutions has kept price action muted for now. Still, if further developments emerge or real traction is gained, Pi could break out of its current range and make a run toward $1 later this summer. And if momentum accelerates on the back of real adoption, a $10 target could quickly come back into focus. This New Presale Altcoin Could Outpace PI with Massive Breakout Potential Given that PI lacks any real adoption news (at least for now), many traders might prefer to look at alternatives, with several presale tokens looking like they could rally big soon. One of these is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised $8.7 million in its soon-to-be-ending sale. $MIND is almost upon us In just under 30 days the pre-sale phase of Mind of Pepe will end. Are you prepared to Enter the $MIND ? https://t.co/YQZ9DDOeVb pic.twitter.com/3IFT7oh5I4 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 1, 2025 With its sale ending in 26 days, MIND of Pepe has proven highly popular because it will launch an autonomous AI agent. MIND of Pepe’s platform will scan masses of social and market data to produce market analysis and advice, while also using big data to identify trends it will tap into via its self-generated tokens. On top of this, its AI agent will use its insight into market trends to generate its own meme tokens, which will list on exchanges and potentially surge by themselves. As its native token, MIND is exciting because it’s the only way of gaining access to its market analysis, while it will also grant early access to the tokens it creates, before they list. MIND could therefore be one of the big new tokens of 2025, with investors able to buy it before listing by going to the MIND of Pepe website . MIND is currently selling at its final presale price of $0.0037515, although judging by its follower count on X , it could rally well beyond this level once it lists.

44192355,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157228,1746453058,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Binance Wallet TGE Features MYX Finance on PancakeSwap,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-wallet-tge-myx/,"Get ready for an exciting development in the decentralized finance space! Binance Wallet is set to host its 15th Binance Wallet TGE (Token Generation Event), putting the spotlight on MYX Finance . This highly anticipated event will take place on the popular decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap , offering crypto enthusiasts a new opportunity to engage with an emerging project. If you’re interested in new token launches and the growth of the DeFi ecosystem, this event is definitely one to watch. What is the Binance Wallet TGE Program All About? The Binance Wallet TGE program is an initiative by Binance Wallet to support promising new projects in the crypto space by facilitating their initial token distribution events. By leveraging the reach and user base of the Binance ecosystem, these TGEs aim to provide projects like MYX Finance with a strong start and offer Binance Wallet users early access opportunities. Key aspects of the program: Support for New Projects: It helps emerging protocols gain visibility and distribute their native tokens. User Access: Provides Binance Wallet users with potential opportunities to acquire new tokens at their initial offering phase. Ecosystem Growth: Fosters innovation and expands the variety of assets available within the broader Binance ecosystem and supported networks. Track Record: This upcoming event is the 15th iteration, indicating a consistent effort by Binance Wallet to curate and feature new projects. Spotlight On: The MYX Finance Token The focus of this particular crypto token generation event is MYX Finance . While specific details about the MYX Finance project itself are crucial for potential participants to research, it’s understood to be a decentralized perpetual exchange protocol. These platforms allow users to trade perpetual contracts directly on the blockchain, offering leverage and trading tools without relying on centralized intermediaries. What makes the MYX Finance token potentially interesting? Protocol Utility: Native tokens in DeFi protocols often have utility within the platform, such as governance rights, staking rewards, or reduced trading fees. Ecosystem Role: The token will likely play a central role in the MYX Finance ecosystem, driving incentives and participation. Growth Potential: As a new project, there is potential for growth if the protocol gains traction and adoption in the competitive perpetual exchange market. It’s vital for anyone considering participation to conduct thorough research into MYX Finance’s whitepaper, team, technology, and tokenomics. Why PancakeSwap for This Crypto Token Generation Event?

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in its presale phase, has become a growing focus for those looking for the best crypto to buy now ahead of the next surge. With a price of just $0.025 and a launch target of $0.06, the upside looks compelling — but it’s the long-range forecast of a 2900% increase that’s turning this token into a serious contender among emerging cryptocurrencies. So why are early investors locking in their positions now? The answer goes beyond speculation. It’s about functionality, token structure, and the protocol’s plan to expand DeFi access through two distinct lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Together, they offer a flexible, yield-driven experience that appeals to both passive participants and more active crypto users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s P2C model is built around pooled contracts. Here’s how it works: users deposit assets into shared liquidity pools and earn interest based on real-time demand. As more borrowers use the pool, rates for lenders increase. This system is fully automated, with smart contracts adjusting yields dynamically — making it ideal for users who want to earn without having to manage positions constantly. On the flip side, the P2P model gives users direct control. Lenders and borrowers connect one-on-one, negotiating terms such as interest rate and loan length. This is especially useful for niche or high-volatility tokens that don’t fit into standard pool-based systems. Rather than isolating these tokens, Mutuum offers a secure way to interact with them — expanding possibilities for custom strategies. By supporting both models, Mutuum builds a bridge between flexible yield generation and personal lending agreements. That combination opens the door for a broader user base, while giving the MUTM token more utility in both scenarios. The MUTM token serves as the core of the platform’s ecosystem. It’s not just a placeholder or governance tool — it plays an active role in the protocol’s incentives. Users who deposit assets into the protocol receive mtTokens, ERC-20 tokens that reflect the original deposit and accumulate value over time through interest. These mtTokens can be staked, and the protocol uses revenue from platform activity to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to those stakers. This design links token value to actual usage. As lending and borrowing increase, so does the volume of rewards for active participants. It’s a more sustainable approach that draws interest from those exploring what crypto to invest in with both short-term momentum and long-term earning potential. Let’s say someone puts in $550 at the current presale price of $0.025. That would give them 22,000 MUTM tokens. Once the token hits its launch price of $0.06, that alone would already more than double the initial investment. But if projections hold — and the token reaches $0.75 during this cycle — that $550 position would be worth $16,500. That’s a 2900% gain, built not on speculation alone but on a system that rewards both lending activity and early adoption. Given that the presale has already raised over $7.55 million, and more than 9,400 holders are on board, interest is clearly building. Nearly 60% of the current phase is already sold, with the next price jump set at $0.03. For anyone recognizing the value of getting in early, this window won’t stay open for long. Mutuum isn’t aiming to flood the market with features — it’s focusing on tools that work. The protocol is currently undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK, and the team plans to launch a beta version around the token’s official debut. These steps show clear progress and commitment to a product-first rollout, which is why many are calling it one of the top cryptocurrencies to monitor before exchange listings begin. This isn’t about guessing the next crypto to explode — it’s about recognizing a system that’s already in motion and priced at an early stage. For anyone researching which crypto to buy today for short-term growth, MUTM is well-positioned, with structured utility and defined earning channels. Mutuum Finance is doing more than just preparing for a listing — it’s laying the groundwork for real use cases. With its dual lending models, mtToken system, and a revenue-backed rewards structure, the fundamentals are in place. And at $0.025, the entry price is still accessible — but not for long. As other projects chase headlines, MUTM continues building. And early investors — including those starting with $500 or even less — are already securing their positions before the next wave begins.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekend price movement has brought attention to the $88,800 support level, while XRP, the payments-focused cryptocurrency, seems close to confirming a bearish chart pattern known as the “death cross."" BTC fell 1.5% on Sunday (UTC), diving out of a trendline connecting lows reached on April 9 and April 20, according to charts sourced from TradingView. The breakdown of the rising trendline, a demand zone, indicates that the recovery rally from April 9 lows under $75,000 may have run its course, suggesting potential for a renewed price swoon. Prices crossing below the Ichimoku cloud on the hourly chart, a momentum indicator, also suggests the same. On the downside, $88,800 could serve as a key support level, having previously capped upward moves on March 24 and April 2, which suggests it may act as a critical price point if tested again. The bearish hourly chart set up risks invalidation on renewed above the Ichimoku cloud, which would reinstate the bullish outlook for rise to $100K. XRP death cross XRP's recovery from April 7 lows has run out of steam, too, with prices falling back below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). More importantly, the 50-day SMA appears on track to cross below the 200-day SMA in what is known as the death cross long-term bearish indicator. The impending death cross, against the backdrop of the overall downward trend since mid-January, raises the risk of a deeper sell-off. Note, however, that the death cross' record in predicting price trends has been mixed in both bitcoin and traditional markets.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Technical Analysis|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-05 13:54:36

Experts say ditch Dogecoin (DOGE) for Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) 63x growth prospects,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/05/bitcoin-btc-bounces-back-experts-say-ditch-dogecoin-doge-for-mutuum-finances-mutm-63x-growth-prospects/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is surging once again, trading around $96,470 and eyeing a potential climb to $120,000 or even $200,000 by year-end, fueled by institutional demand and favorable U.S. policy shifts. Yet, while BTC reclaims the spotlight, experts are advising investors to rethink their altcoin strategies, specifically, to reconsider Dogecoin (DOGE). Despite DOGE’s current price of approximately $0.18, forecasts suggest it may struggle to surpass $0.60 in 2025, raising concerns about its long-term growth potential. In contrast, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are capturing attention for their ambitious growth prospects, with some analysts projecting up to 63x returns. Priced at just $0.025 in Phase 4 of its presale, and with a projected 140% ROI by launch. As the crypto market changes, the focus is shifting from meme-driven tokens to assets with robust fundamentals and real-world applications. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges Past $7.6M Mutuum Finance has obtained $7.6 million surpassing the investments of 9,500 investors which exhibits a positive shift in investor trust. The fourth presale phase of the token currently trades at $0.025 while more than 50% of this phase has reached its selling limit. After Phase 5 starts the token supply price will increase by 20% to establish a rate of $0.03. Current investors can secure a 140% total return on investment because the MUTM token launched at $0.06 per token. Additionally the platform started a giveaway for MUTM tokens worth $100,000 where 10 users each received $10,000. The hybrid lending protocol of Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems as its main operating feature. Users achieve passive earnings through the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system by putting their stablecoins particularly USDT into pools that are supervised by smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system has direct lender and borrower communication so users can create customized terms independently of third-party intermediaries while keeping both transactions transparent and flexible. A dual structure within the platform enables passive MUTM token holders to earn passive income from P2C while allowing active DeFi users to take part in P2P transactions. Users gain personal control of their investments combined with decentralized management. Mutuum’s USD-backed stablecoin adds real-world utility A USD-backed stablecoin built on the Ethereum network stands as the main feature introduced in the roadmap which aims to deliver stable value compared to the volatility of algorithmic methods. This USD-backed token offers market prediction capabilities to bring more stability into volatile conditions which may attract additional users. Built with security in mind: CertiK audit underway Security remains a key pillar of the project. Mutuum Finance has teamed up with blockchain auditing leader CertiK to conduct a comprehensive audit of its smart contracts. Once completed, the results will be published publicly to reinforce trust and transparency among its growing user base. Community maintains central importance for the Mutuum Finance platform structure. The platform provides a $100K reward to users while additionally rewarding them with bonus incentives if they successfully refer new platform entrants. Participating users as initial nucleus receive early access to platform updates which assists in creating a strong loyal investor network. Users can check the leaderboard dashboard which displays the top 50 token holders live and provides bonus rewards to boost user engagement. Bitcoin’s latest peak to $96,470 has been in the news, but experts are asking investors to shift focus from altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) to early-stage projects with more potential to grow. Whereas DOGE will have a hard time beyond $0.60 in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the talk of the town with its projected 63x growth and current presale price of $0.025. Having already raised over $7.6 million from 9,500 investors, MUTM’s innovative dual-lending system, USD-backed stablecoin, and CertiK-backed security make it a strong contender in the DeFi space. Act now to secure your MUTM tokens before Phase 4 ends and prices rise—position yourself for exceptional returns in 2025.

But for most LINK holders, participation has always been passive. You buy, you hold, and you wait. Running a node? Technically possible, but prohibitively complex. Earning yield? Limited, and usually requires staking through third-party platforms with their own risks. That passive ceiling is exactly what’s pushing some Chainlink investors toward Bitcoin Solaris — a project with a hard-capped supply, a functioning two-layer architecture, and most notably, a mining system that runs from a smartphone. No specialized hardware, no delegation hoops — just a working app, a Solana wallet, and BTC-S flowing directly to your address. From Holding to Earning The problem isn’t that LINK lacks utility — it powers data feeds, helps with price oracles, and supports DeFi execution. But for retail investors, that functionality doesn’t translate into direct returns. You can’t mine LINK. You can’t stake it on-chain without technical overhead. And there’s no predictable way to compound gains through basic usage. Bitcoin Solaris flips that experience entirely. Its Nova App allows users to start mining BTC-S from their phones — immediately. There’s no node setup, no hardware threshold, and no lock period. Users contribute idle storage and CPU capacity to the network, earning BTC-S rewards in real time. It’s accessible by design. Where Chainlink leans toward enterprise integrations and infrastructure scaling, Bitcoin Solaris focuses on users — giving them a stake in the system from day one. How Smartphone Mining Works The Nova App connects to your Solana wallet and allocates a small portion of storage (1–5 GB) and light processing power for mining. Once initiated, the app runs passively in the background, completing micro-cycles that support transaction validation and Base Layer integrity. This isn’t Proof-of-Work in the Bitcoin sense. Bitcoin Solaris uses a hybrid consensus model — Helios — which blends Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Capacity, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Time. The result is a mining system that adapts to your device rather than locking users out based on performance. There’s no minimum stake required. No rig cost. And no steep technical curve. The system is built for actual users, not engineers. A Fixed-Supply Asset With Daily Rewards Bitcoin Solaris mirrors Bitcoin’s economic structure. Total supply is capped at 21 million BTC-S tokens, with halving events built into the block schedule every 210,000 blocks. The scarcity model is hard-coded — no inflation, no token unlock tricks, and no stealth dilution. Of the total supply, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are available in the presale. These tokens are liquid on day one — mineable, stakeable, and integrated into the broader app and wallet ecosystem. It’s an asset designed to reward participation, not just speculation. Moreover, all contract code and mining logic has been independently verified: Cyberscope Audit Freshcoins Audit KYC Verified There are no private staking contracts, no reliance on third-party governance, and no off-chain dependencies. The system is verifiable and open—down to individual mining cycles and reward flows. Want a full walkthrough? Crypto Chino dives into how mining, rewards, and token mechanics work across mobile and desktop. Early Access Still Open Phase 1 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale sold out, and Phase 2 is now live — with tokens priced at 2 USDT. Total presale supply remains capped at 4.2 million BTC-S, and availability is running down. There are no hidden rounds or late-stage discounts. Once this phase closes, it’s market pricing from here on out. How to Join Bitcoin Solaris Presale 1 — Visit bitcoinsolaris.com This is your verified access point for presale participation. 2 — Connect a Solana-Compatible Wallet Use Phantom or Solflare. Once connected, your wallet is eligible to purchase and hold BTC-S. 3 — Buy BTC-S at 2 USDT per Token Choose your amount, confirm the transaction, and tokens are delivered instantly to your wallet. 4 — Join the Community Stay updated and connected through Telegram and X Chainlink gave DeFi the tools to talk to the outside world. But it never gave its users the tools to earn from the inside. Bitcoin Solaris makes that shift simple — by turning the device in your hand into a live mining node, powered by a scarce asset that actually rewards participation.

The program, called Chainlink Rewards, allows those projects based on the network to reward eligible Chainlink node operators and community members who help secure the network. Founded in 2022, Space and Time is a decentralized data network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify database queries and deliver them to smart contracts. Space and Time has made 4% of their total SXT token supply (200 million) available to Chainlink ecosystem participants, including LINK Stakers. The first batch of SXT tokens, consisting of 100 million SXT, will become claimable by eligible historical and active LINK Stakers on May 8. The remaining 100 million SXT, as well as any unclaimed SXT, are planned to be made available in a separate campaign in the future. SXT will be offered to both historical and active LINK stakers. Claims will remain open for 90 days. Token incentives help drive money and users to a blockchain network, adding to demand for that network’s token and a user base that may have previously not interacted with that ecosystem. Chainlink Rewards is expected to expand over time, with additional Build partners likely to participate in future reward seasons. While token distribution will be project-specific, the broader goal is to create new incentives for users to stake LINK and engage with the Chainlink network more actively.

Such a setup typically indicates that there is a breakout on the horizon. As BNB has been on an upward trend prior to this pattern forming, some assume it will keep going up—if the support zones hold. However, a breach below those support levels might reverse the trend and push the price down. Price Targets Established At $599, $617, And $644 If BNB keeps surging, analysts have cited three possible targets. The first is $599, which is just below the psychological barrier of $600. The second is $617, a place where BNB fought to move above back in March. The third is $644, which is the entire range of the triangle formation. These will likely be checkpoints if there is momentum. BNBUSD trading at $593 on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com Although short-term bullish indications are there, the token has not yet breached any of these levels. For now, BNB is probing a significant level of support and resisting. This type of price action is typical before bigger moves in either direction.

ProShares XRP future ETF received an April 28 regulatory greenlight, propelling XRP slightly up, something traders believe is the start of an increased institutional push. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, up 1% over the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of almost $127.7 billion and over 4% increased volume. Meanwhile, an under-the-radar innovation in cross-border financing from a nimble disruptor is set to shake the market once again in the not-so-distant future. Ripple 2025 Price Prediction: Is XRP destined for $4? Its recent surge came after approval of future products from the SEC, its first in non-Bitcoin, non-Ether tokens. The move came on the back of the breakdown of a falling wedge pattern, with traders anticipating room for the $4 mark to be tested. Today’s action finds XRP trading for around $2.18, bouncing from an April 7 low of $1.68 a drop tied to Trump’s tariffs and a risk-off spell in global markets. The bounce indicates XRP’s sensitivity to policy shifts as well as its function as proxy for crypto sentiment. Analysts have observed that Ripple is trading above the broken falling wedge structure in the 2 days chart. The price is capable of rallying towards the levels of $2.60, $2.84, $3.00, as well as $3.32, says Jonathan Carter, after the recent breakout. Technical indicators turned positive in mid-April to signal the beginning of a new spell as Polymarket bettors wagered on another 5% rise. Wider market headwinds in the form of rising bond yields, as reflected in April’s dip amid global equity losses, remain a worry for investors.

The Taiwan dollar has surged by 6.5% in two days, the largest two-day jump in decades. The country’s currency has also risen by almost 10% since the start of April.

Or something bigger brewing? Either way – will def have hurt a few market players. pic.twitter.com/Oh5Qn0RUqc — Wilfred Frost (@WilfredFrost) May 5, 2025 The Taiwan dollar recorded an uptick of 2.5% as trading opened on Monday, marking its two-day gain at 6.5%. The currency has also realized a 10% surge since the start of April and the beginning of Trump’s trade policies. The currency’s jump shows how the impact of the U.S. trade war is rippling through the global economy. Ju Wang, a strategist at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong, argued that the sudden currency movement could harm the competitiveness of the island’s export-oriented economy and expose Taiwanese life insurers to losses through their holdings of U.S. assets. BNP’s strategist noted that local exporters were panicking and local lifers were under-hedged, while equity-related outflows have ceased. Wang also acknowledged that the Taiwan central bank remains the only buyer but has not been aggressively supporting the market. She believes it has fueled speculation that currency valuation is part of the trade talks. The country has a huge pile of overseas assets amounting to $1.7 trillion. Much of the assets are in the form of U.S. bonds, including Treasuries and corporate debt, held by life insurers. Wang also noted many of those insurers have not hedged their currency exposure, which exposes them to losses when the U.S. dollar falls. She argued that a rush to hedge those risks in a falling market might have worsened the currency’s move. Taiwan’s president calls for end of ‘false’ news about U.S. FX talks Wang also maintained that the currency jump has been heightened by speculation that a possible trade deal with the U.S. could include provisions to strengthen the Taiwanese currency and make it less competitive. Taiwan’s central bank released a statement on Friday denying claims that the U.S. Treasury Department had requested an appreciation in its currency as part of a trade deal. Wang argued that despite no economy officially acknowledging that currency valuation is a point of negotiation, market expectations still indicated otherwise. She believes it is notable given the Mar-a-Lago [accord]’s emphasis on an overvalued U.S. dollar being a root cause of the U.S.’s trade imbalances. The East Asian country is currently the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, driven by its globally competitive semiconductor sector. TSMC ’s stock, the world’s biggest contract semiconductor producer, dropped by 1.3% on Monday. The country recorded a trade surplus of $74 billion with the U.S. in 2024. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te said the country’s trade surplus with the U.S. is because of soaring demand for the tech products the island specializes in, like semiconductors. He also acknowledged that Washington had never listed Taiwan as a currency manipulator. “Precisely because the cause of the Taiwan-U.S. deficit has nothing to do with the exchange rate, the exchange rate issue will naturally not be mentioned in negotiations between Taiwan and the United States.” -Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s President. The U.S. dollar was down 0.44% on the Japanese yen at 144.3 on Monday. The Australian dollar also hit a five-month high in early trade and was up 0.4% at 0.6473. The U.S. dollar also plummeted over 3% against the Taiwan dollar to 29.772, adding to a record 4.4% move on Friday. The President also noted that Taiwan’s economy was doing well and people should have confidence. The country’s Office of Trade Negotiations has also denied that the White House was pressing for a rise in some Asian currencies as part of a trade deal, which might have caused the markets to shift.

44192647,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157271,1746453650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BNB ETF: VanEck Files Bold Proposal with SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vaneck-bnb-etf-filing/,"Big news hitting the crypto wires! Asset management giant VanEck has taken a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the world of digital assets, specifically focusing on Binance Coin (BNB). Reports indicate that VanEck has officially submitted an S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the potential launch of a BNB ETF . This move, initially hinted at by the registration of a BNB ETF entity in Delaware back on April 2nd, according to JinSe, marks a notable development in the ongoing saga of crypto adoption within regulated investment structures. What Exactly is a BNB ETF and Why is This VanEck BNB ETF Filing a Big Deal? Let’s break down what a BNB ETF is and why VanEck’s filing is generating buzz. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like regular stocks. An ETF typically holds assets like stocks, commodities, or bonds, and its price fluctuates throughout the trading day based on the underlying assets. A cryptocurrency ETF, like the proposed VanEck BNB ETF , would hold the underlying cryptocurrency – in this case, BNB – and allow investors to gain exposure to its price movements without directly buying, storing, or managing the digital asset themselves. For many traditional investors, this is a much more familiar and accessible investment vehicle compared to navigating crypto exchanges, wallets, and private keys. The significance of VanEck’s filing lies in several areas: Institutional Interest: VanEck is a major player in the traditional finance world. Their move signals increasing institutional confidence and interest, not just in Bitcoin or Ethereum, but potentially in a wider range of digital assets like BNB. Accessibility: An approved Binance Coin ETF would open the door for investors who prefer regulated brokerage accounts to easily add BNB exposure to their portfolios. This could potentially bring in a new wave of capital. Regulatory Push: Each filing, regardless of the outcome, adds to the ongoing dialogue between the crypto industry and regulators like the SEC, pushing the conversation around how digital assets can be integrated into traditional financial markets. The SEC Filing BNB Process: What Happens Now? The submission of an S-1 filing is just the initial step in a lengthy and often complex regulatory process with the SEC. The S-1 is essentially a registration statement required by the SEC for U.S. companies planning to offer securities to the public. In the context of an ETF, it provides detailed information about the proposed fund, its structure, investment objectives, risks, and how it will operate. Here’s a simplified look at what the SEC Filing BNB process typically involves: Initial Submission (S-1): VanEck submits the detailed proposal to the SEC. SEC Review and Comments: The SEC staff reviews the filing, often providing comments or requesting clarification and amendments. This back-and-forth can take months. Amendments: VanEck will likely submit multiple amendments to address the SEC’s feedback. Decision: Eventually, the SEC must approve or disapprove the filing, or delay the decision. The timeline for this can vary significantly. The fact that VanEck registered a separate entity for the VanEck BNB ETF in Delaware beforehand is a standard procedural step, setting up the legal structure for the proposed fund. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: The SEC and Crypto ETFs The journey for crypto ETFs in the U.S. has been a long and challenging one. While the SEC has approved Bitcoin spot ETFs and recently greenlit filings for Ethereum spot ETFs, the path for other cryptocurrencies, including BNB, is less clear. The SEC’s primary concerns often revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and the underlying market’s surveillance sharing agreements. For assets like BNB, which is closely associated with the Binance exchange – an entity that has faced significant regulatory scrutiny globally and in the U.S. – the SEC might have additional questions or concerns. Past filings for various altcoin ETFs have typically faced significant hurdles or outright rejection until the landscape for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum became clearer. The approval of Ethereum ETFs might pave a potential, albeit still uncertain, path for other assets, but each asset faces its own unique regulatory considerations. Potential Benefits and Hurdles for a Binance Coin ETF Let’s weigh the potential upside and the significant challenges facing a potential Binance Coin ETF . Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity: An ETF could potentially increase liquidity for BNB by bringing in traditional market participants. Price Discovery: Trading on regulated exchanges might contribute to more robust price discovery. Ease of Investment: As mentioned, it simplifies investment for traditional investors. Custodian Solutions: The ETF structure would likely involve regulated custodians holding the underlying BNB, potentially offering a layer of security and regulatory compliance not always available to individual holders. Potential Hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty Specific to BNB: The SEC’s view on BNB’s classification (security or commodity) and its association with Binance’s regulatory issues are major potential roadblocks. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC will scrutinize the spot market for BNB for potential manipulation. Lack of Surveillance Sharing: Establishing adequate surveillance sharing agreements with relevant markets, a key requirement for the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, could be challenging for BNB. Competition: If approved, it would enter a growing landscape of crypto investment products. Comparing Direct BNB Holding vs. a Binance Coin ETF (Hypothetical): Feature Direct BNB Holding Hypothetical BNB ETF Accessibility Requires crypto exchange account, wallet management Available via traditional brokerage accounts Ownership Direct ownership of asset Ownership of fund shares representing asset exposure Custody Risk Self-custody (if applicable) or exchange risk Fund custodian risk (typically regulated) Fees Trading fees on exchanges Annual expense ratio charged by fund manager Taxation Complex depending on jurisdiction and activity Generally simpler (like stock investments) but varies Functionality Can be used for staking, exchange fee discounts, etc. Typically only provides price exposure; cannot be used for utility Regulatory Status Varies; individual holdings less regulated Regulated investment product The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Crypto ETF News The VanEck filing for a Binance Coin ETF adds another layer to the evolving narrative of crypto integration into traditional finance. Following the successful launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs and the recent progress on Ethereum ETFs, attention is naturally turning to which digital asset might be next in line for a potential ETF wrapper. While BNB faces unique challenges, particularly related to regulatory perceptions of Binance, this filing keeps the conversation going. It signals to the market and regulators that institutional interest in a broader range of digital assets exists. This piece of Crypto ETF News is significant not just for BNB holders, but for the wider altcoin market, as it tests the waters for regulatory acceptance beyond the two largest cryptocurrencies. The outcome of VanEck’s filing will likely influence the appetite and strategy of other asset managers considering ETFs for other altcoins. It’s a test case that the industry will be watching closely. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this development, here are a few things to consider: This is an Early Stage: An S-1 filing is a long way from an approved and trading ETF. Expect a potentially lengthy review process and uncertain outcome. Understand the Risks: Investing in a potential BNB ETF would still carry the inherent volatility and risks associated with the underlying asset, BNB. Do Your Own Research: Before making any investment decisions based on ETF filings or news, thoroughly research BNB, the potential ETF structure (if it progresses), and your own risk tolerance. Regulatory Environment Matters: Keep a close eye on regulatory developments surrounding both BNB and the broader crypto market, as these will heavily influence the likelihood of approval. Conclusion VanEck’s decision to file for a BNB ETF with the SEC is a noteworthy event in the crypto space. It underscores the growing institutional interest in providing regulated access to digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the path to approval is fraught with significant regulatory hurdles, particularly given the unique circumstances surrounding BNB and its association with Binance, the filing itself is a positive signal of continued efforts to integrate crypto into traditional financial markets. Whether this bold proposal receives the green light from the SEC remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly adds another fascinating chapter to the ongoing evolution of Crypto ETF News .

Back then, Dogecoin (DOGE) kicked things off with a community-fueled sprint to the top. Not long after, Shiba Inu (SHIB) followed with a parabolic run that surprised even the most seasoned crypto watchers. Now, in 2025, a new duo is emerging, and history may be repeating itself. Pepe (PEPE ) is set to assume the role of Dogecoin (DOGE): an early mover, meme-heavy, and backed by a powerful rally. But beneath the surface, it’s FloppyPepe (FPPE) that’s positioning itself as this cycle’s Shiba Inu (SHIB), the one with the potential to catch fire next. Pepe (PEPE) Moves First, But the Door’s Still Open There’s no denying that Pepe (PEPE) was one of the most viral meme coins of this cycle so far. Much like Dogecoin (DOGE) , it’s fast, simple, and backed by raw internet power. It took off quickly, capturing attention across multiple platforms, including X, Discord, and Telegram, in just weeks. But Pepe’s (PEPE) rally may already be peaking, and those looking for the next major mover are already scanning the market . On the other hand, FloppyPepe (FPPE), an AI Meme coin, is making waves by combining meme culture with functional tools and community-driven energy. While Pepe (PEPE) has the first-mover glow, this emerging AI coin is building the structure to go the distance. It is even more fitting that they are both members of the Matt Furie family, a family of meme coins renowned for their outstanding success in the cryptocurrency space. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Shiba Inu (SHIB) Vibes With More Under the Hood Shiba Inu (SHIB) didn’t succeed just because it followed Dogecoin (DOGE). It offered more—staking, NFTs, DeFi integrations, and added depth to what initially appeared to be a meme on the surface. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is following that same formula but tailoring it for 2025. Built as an AI Meme coin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) isn’t just designed to be held; it’s built to be used. The project comes with two powerful tools: FloppyAI , a plug-and-play meme generator FloppyX , a rapid video creation tool for social-first content These tools empower the FloppyPepe (FPPE) community to flood platforms like X and TikTok with branded, community-created content, thereby maintaining awareness growth without incurring significant expenses. Strong Token Mechanics and Real Market Buzz Beyond its tools, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is backed by a token model designed to encourage long-term holding. Every transaction burns a small portion of tokens and redistributes another portion back to holders. This keeps supply under pressure and rewards those who stick around. Early response has been strong. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already raised millions through its presale, and crypto-focused Telegram groups are increasingly naming it one of the top projects to watch this quarter. The buzz is no accident — it’s coming from a well-executed rollout and a smart understanding of what meme coin buyers actually want: energy, utility, and early upside. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Could Follow the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Path The comparisons are hard to ignore. Just like Shiba Inu (SHIB) came up under Dogecoin’s (DOGE) shadow, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is rising fast in the wake of Pepe (PEPE). It’s hitting the same key points: Cheap entry price Active and growing community Clear vision beyond the meme Tools that support viral spread and long-term engagement Far from being another low-effort token banking on memes, it is building an ecosystem. And like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2021, it may be the second mover that ultimately outpaces the first. Final Thought: Pepe (PEPE) Moved First — FloppyPepe (FPPE) Might Move Bigger If Pepe (PEPE) is this cycle’s Dogecoin (DOGE), then all signs point to FloppyPepe (FPPE) stepping into the Shiba Inu (SHIB) role. It’s the next-wave meme coin with actual functionality, real market attention, and a roadmap that doesn’t stop at the hype. With presale prices still low at $0.0000002 and an 80% bonus for early buyers who use the FLOPPY80 code, those watching the meme coin space may not want to blink. With a positive audit report underscoring its security, this new Shiba Inu (SHIB) promises to be a lasting presence.

Today, smart investors are evaluating MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin , and Ethereum as assets that could turn a small position into something significant over time. With traction building and the market gaining broader momentum, early-stage engagement in the right projects remains one of the most effective paths to scaling returns. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Groundwork for Strategic Expansion The strongest digital asset trends typically begin with fundamentals—not fanfare. That’s precisely the path MAGACOINFINANCE is following. Wallet adoption is increasing steadily. Product development is progressing on schedule. Community activity is growing across key channels—and notably, without reliance on promotional hype. This level of organic traction signals a maturing project. For investors seeking early exposure to a structured and scalable asset, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a candidate worthy of close attention. Established Ecosystem Drivers: Ethereum and Bitcoin Remain Key Ethereum (ETH) continues to serve as the backbone of decentralized innovation. With scaling solutions accelerating adoption and enterprise interest expanding, its long-term viability remains strong. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its role as a digital macro asset. Institutional adoption is rising, and global sentiment is increasingly shifting toward BTC as a foundational component of diversified portfolios. While these two assets represent market leadership, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the type of entry-stage opportunity that has historically delivered the most dramatic percentage returns. Additional Assets Gaining Momentum: Polkadot and Sei Polkadot is advancing multi-chain connectivity through its parachain model, supporting a wide range of use cases in the growing Web3 ecosystem. Sei is optimizing blockchain architecture for speed and trading functionality, attracting developers building next-generation financial tools. Both are strong in their own categories, but MAGACOINFINANCE stands out for its early-phase potential and the room it offers for meaningful price discovery. Conclusion A $190 investment might seem small—but placed early in the right project, it can produce results far beyond expectations. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide long-term value, but MAGACOINFINANCE represents something rarer: a structured, early-stage asset entering its growth phase with strong fundamentals. Those watching closely now may be positioning ahead of broader recognition.

MSTR trades at a premium to Bitcoin NAV due to its exposure to leverage, simplicity, and convenience relative to other Bitcoin products. The company's capital structure includes selling shares, convertible notes, and preferred shares, each with varying impacts on BTC yield and risk. The current NAV premium of about 2x is a reasonable price to pay. I believe the NAV could exceed 2.5x in the coming months and therefore expect very positive returns. Prelude For all intents and purposes, Michael Saylor is a maverick. He is the first public CEO to fully and loudly adopt a Bitcoin standard, much of which he credits to the book titled just that, The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. To claim that this book engendered an almost religious belief in Bitcoin is to put it lightly. I would consider it required reading for anyone considering investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Strategy ( MSTR ). I am writing this article today to tackle a question that I'm sure many MSTR onlookers have had: why should I pay a premium to the company's bitcoin NAV? In the pursuit of answering this question, you are thrown headfirst into fanatical language about bitcoin and new terms that finance has never before seen. The arc of a MSTR investor is likely the same as that of a Bitcoin investor. When you first hear of it, you are skeptical. Skepticism slowly evolves into curiosity. Curiosity transforms into an obsession. The obsession leads you further down the bitcoin rabbit hole as you read manifestos about the end of modern finance and how we can herald in the future of currency. Among those at the front lines of this fight is Michael Saylor. He has used a toolbelt full of traditional financial tools to create one of the most interesting synthetic financial structures I've ever researched. The Bitcoin financial framework is complicated at first glance, but most of it is just modern financial concepts re-bundled with bitcoin-first terminology. MSTR Investor Presentation So, let's work through how to conceptualize these ideas. We need to understand why folks believe in Saylor long-term so we can tackle the question about just what premium you should be willing to pay. Understanding MSTR The Strategy At the most basic level, Strategy just owns bitcoin. They take on debt to buy bitcoin, and once they've exhausted those funds they take on additional debt - typically through convertible notes or preferred stock - to buy more. As Saylor puts it: ""you use fiat debt to acquire perfect money"". Therefore, the stock is just a leveraged proxy of bitcoin. Due to this leverage strategy, the company trades at a premium to Bitcoin net asset value (""NAV""). In this context, BTC NAV = (BTC held * current BTC price – secured debt) ÷ fully diluted shares. The same asymmetrical reward you earn from traditional leverage applies here, and it's what the company refers to as 'BTC Torque'. Over time, Saylor expects the annualized return on bitcoin to exceed the cost of capital, so it's always worthwhile to take debt and buy bitcoin. The more capital you get up front magnifies the value it generates over time. MSTR Investor Presentation The Capital Structure The cheapest fundraising MSTR can do is to simply sell newly minted shares ATM. As long as MSTR is trading at a premium to NAV, Saylor can sell newly minted MSTR shares and generate BTC Yield. This term is essentially the increase in bitcoin per share that existing shareholders will experience because of new credit facilities that the company opens to buy bitcoin. Using convertible notes is next. These provide MSTR liquidity from a lender who is given the right to convert that loan into stock at some point in the future. Convertible notes generate more torque over time since they give the company more current BTC equity without any current dilution. This results in a higher BTC multiple than MSTR commons. The BTC Multiple is essentially return on equity. Say you have $10,000 in cash and borrow another $90,000 to invest the full sum in Bitcoin. A year later, the price of bitcoin appreciates 25%, turning your $100,000 into $125,000. You've effectively created $25,000 in value with only $10,000. Your equity is now $35,000. Saylor would refer to this as a 2.5x multiple. BTC torque, on the other hand, is basically just value created divided by capital deployed. It is just return on invested capital. Finally, the company can raise funds through preferred shares. The preferreds have no maturity date, a fixed dividend, are callable by MSTR, and have no voting rights. These allow MSTR to raise capital now, buy bitcoin with it, and pay interest as dividends instead of with common stock conversions. STRK and STRF carry the highest BTC yield because they are not convertible to MSTR commons, meaning the existing MSTR shareholder is not diluted on a per share BTC basis when STRK and STRF are distributed. For more detail on the preferred structure, this article was quite informative. The preferreds don't carry the same risk as convertible notes for MSTR since the company itself has more optionality in bitcoin bear markets. The big risk with the convertibles is forced dilution during a bear market. Considering MSTR owns over 2% of total bitcoin supply now, this could create a vicious cycle where MSTR needs to sell because bitcoin price has fallen, which causes bitcoin price to fall more, which forces MSTR to sell more, and so on. MSTR has a sufficiently large pile of bitcoin that it can produce market-moving events. So this risk is real. We'll discuss more later. Why The NAV Premium? If Saylor can get debt at a rate of 10% and he models an expected 30% return from the bitcoin he purchases with that debt, it's always worthwhile to take more debt and buy more bitcoin. It's an infinitely scalable loop. In this game, Saylor is using money with functionally unlimited supply to buy money with strictly fixed supply. At a certain point, he will control enough of the bitcoin market that the supply shock he creates will accelerate the ARR he can expect on new bitcoin purchases. Over time, he believes he can create a virtuous cycle of this debt creating more value than it's worth ad infinitum. Does it seem too good to be true? Yes. But it's not, with one condition. The price of bitcoin must continue moving higher over time. That is the single critical factor in MSTR's success. If it doesn't, the entire structure loses its legs. The strategy here hinges on the relentless accumulation of bitcoin without regard to current price. Saylor believes full stop in bitcoins value, believes that value will continue to increase relative to USD over time, and therefore has no concerns creating a capital structure to maximize the amount of bitcoin he can accumulate. Valuing MSTR Common Stock The question becomes how much risk you as an investor are willing to take in this accumulation of leverage over time. The NAV premium is simply a function of that risk and the torque that MSTR creates with its debt. The question is simply, what premium should you be willing to pay? Obviously, paying 1.2x bitcoin NAV is a fundamentally different investment decision than 20x bitcoin NAV. How should we consider finding this level? Obviously, the base on which we start is BTC NAV. For MSTR currently, that is currently about 553,550 bitcoin at an average cost of $68,459. At current market prices, this is worth roughly $52.59b. The market is paying 2x NAV. One might model out the intrinsic value of MSTR as a function of the following variables: BTC NAV, BTC Torque, Execution Premium, Narrative Premium. NAV and Torque are described above. I've also included here two subjective factors. A premium on Saylor's ability to execute on the bitcoin accumulation strategy and a premium for the overall narrative surrounding bitcoin, MSTR, and Saylor himself. The resulting function would be: Intrinsic MSTR Value ≈ BTC NAV * [1 + BTC Torque + Execution Premium + Narrative Premium] In the investor presentation , the company lays out the four different asset types and their associated 10-year torque. This assumes 30% CAGR for bitcoin. It is as follows: Financing Vehicle Torque MSTR Common 6.9x Convertibles 8.9x STRK 10.4x STRF 12.8x Basically, this means that $100m raised through those vehicles will result in a return of that torque multiple in 10 years. For commons, $100m invested in bitcoin today will generate $698m in value over 10 years assuming 30% bitcoin CAGR. We can say that the torque would then be 0.69x per year (assuming linear compounding for simplicity), which would be used in the intrinsic value formula provided above. Considering Saylor fundraises through the most efficient mechanism possible, the overall torque is higher than this. But let's use the lowest BTC torque provided, 6.9x, for simplicity. Then, execution and narrative premium are entirely subjective, but I'd be comfortable assigning a value of .25 to each of these. This means that these premiums add an additional 25% premium on top of the company's BTC NAV. I'm using 25% here for a few reasons. First, there are clear advantages to owning MSTR which will always give it a minor premium to NAV. It's more convenient for those that don't want to maintain bitcoin keys, it's highly liquid, doesn't have the same expense structure as ETFs, and is quickly reaching 'cult' status. Stocks like Tesla ( TSLA ) and Palantir ( PLTR ) have a similar cult of die-hard investors that have shown they are willing to completely ignore overvaluation by conventional standards and hold or continue buying regardless. MSTR has reached that point in the crypto community. Finally, MSTR is using much more efficient leverage than any individual investor could use. If an investor wanted to lever their exposure to bitcoin, there is no way to do it without a prohibitively high interest rate. This also comes at a risk to your personal credit and has very real implications on your real life. An investment in MSTR comes only at the risk of the capital you deploy. This deserves a premium. With the company's debt structure, there is risk of dilution. However, as long as the company can maintain a positive BTC Yield, this dilution is meaningless. The 0% unsecured debt results in more BTC per share, making all existing shareholders better off. Anyway, right now, I'd estimate MSTR value as: $52.59b * [1 + 0.69 + .25 + .25] --> $52.59b * 2.19 = $115.17b. As you can see, the market appears to be pricing MSTR fairly. We are neither grossly overvalued nor undervalued, but my estimates of the subjective execution and narrative premium suggest there is minor upside in the stock relative to Bitcoin over the next 12 months. The true upside can come from an expansion of those premiums, which will be most impactful on the NAV premium over time. Should Bitcoin be lurched into a deep bear market, the NAV premium will collapse because there is greater execution risk and investors may begin losing faith. However, should we see a significant move to the upside, it will fortify the belief in this strategy and the reputation of Saylor himself, thus expanding the NAV premium that investors are willing to pay. Valuing MSTR Debt Next, you can go a layer deeper. What about the value of Strategy's synthetic BTC instruments today? Michael Saylor believes they are incredibly mispriced. The company reports 'Market Credit Spread' and 'Spread Premium' to illustrate this. They also present 'BTC Credit' which is what the company thinks the risk of the debt really is. The spread premium, therefore, shows the spread between the rate that MSTR pays on debt and what the true rate should be based on the fundamental risk presented. Recall that interest rates are a function of repayment risk. Since Saylor believes that bitcoin will continue appreciating in value and therefore presents basically no repayment risk, he believes MSTR debt today is insanely lucrative. Further, should the market generally expect that if bitcoin becomes regarded as a safer treasury asset than it is now, MSTR debt could get re-rated higher quite significantly. The resulting profit would go to the existing bondholders. For institutions that believe in bitcoin, it makes sense to allocate to MSTR debt. This is the value proposition that has allowed MSTR to borrow enormous sums of cash up front at 0% interest. The lenders are arbitrageurs. This is important for common stock investors because it sets up a strong likelihood that the company will continue the process of taking debt to accumulate more bitcoin. MSTR Q1 Investor Presentation My Take When I initially began my research into MSTR, I misunderstood the stock and the strategy a bit. I wrote an article titled MicroStrategy Is Buying Train Cars, Block Is Building Railroads . I largely stand by that sentiment, that MSTR is not building infrastructure on which the bitcoin economy will operate, but this company is more sophisticated than a simple asset hoarder. To me, it appears that MSTR is building the synthetic BTC finance industry from the ground up. It is just as abstract as the traditional synthetic finance industry and comes with just as much, if not more, risk. However, Saylor is doing this transparently and completely openly. They only investors who don't understand the stock and the strategy are those that haven't done the requisite research. Still, listening to Saylor talk about this reminds me of the movie The Big Short, where viewers begin learning how structurally unsound the synthetic CDO market truly is. Hold on, hold on, hold on... CDO A has parts of CDO B, and CDO B has parts of CDO A, but then they both get put inside CDO C? Yeah, that one's called CDO Squared. A CDO of a CDO. And then there's CDOs made up of the opposite side of the bet you made with your swaps, those are called synthetic CDOs. Synthetic CDOs? That is ******* crazy. It's not, it's awesome. Of course, the 2008 collapse was triggered by one thing: a rise in default rates on subprime mortgages. Those subprime loans were bundled into countless opaque financial products with 'diversified' risk at up to 20x leverage. The house of cards came tumbling down. I am not suggesting that MSTR is as fundamentally flawed as the CDO market was in 2008. The flaw in CDOs was that the true risk and complexity was hidden behind guarantees of substantial returns. However, MSTR's entire structure could be brought down by a severe and protracted bitcoin bear market. The price of bitcoin is famously volatile with pain of severe contractions matching the exuberance of face-ripping upward runs. An investment in MSTR today is functionally a bet on two things: 1) you find it more likely that Bitcoin will explode higher than tumble downward in the short-term, and 2) if Bitcoin does tumble downward, the correction will not be so severe that it forces liquidation of any part of MSTR's BTC hoard. MSTR is currently way over-collateralized on its bitcoin stack because Wall Street recognizes risk #2. The company has bitcoin worth about $52.5b and only $8b in debt. Most of this debt is unsecured, meaning the lenders have no mechanism by which to force MSTR to sell BTC to pay the debt. They simply have the opportunity to convert their loan into MSTR commons when the NAV premium collapses during a BTC bear market. This could result in significant dilution of existing shareholders and the loss of capital inherent in that dilution. On the other hand, should the price of bitcoin collapse, the company also faces the risk that it won't be able to raise new capital to buy more. It would be stuck in a holding pattern until faith in Bitcoin's resilience is rebuilt. The stock would likely trade sideways for this entire duration. In the next bitcoin bear market, we will learn whether MSTR is a house of cards or an impenetrable fortress. As of right now, the stock looks more like a fortress than a house of cards to me. Of course, it is a leveraged, unilateral bet on the upward price movement of bitcoin. But the structure is transparent even if the terminology is complicated. Bitcoin is seeing widespread institutional adoption, sovereign interest, and decreasing barriers to entry. I find it likely that bitcoin goes much higher before it goes much lower, so I believe the MSTR show can go on for a while longer, at least. Investor Takeaway By this point you should concretely understand why MSTR trades at a premium to NAV. The market understands that the strategy of taking debt to accumulate an asset that consistently generates real returns deserves a premium. However, there is still arbitrage potential considering bitcoin's risk profile creating a mispricing in MSTR debt. As long as this arbitrage opportunity exists, MSTR should be able to continue the process of taking debt to accumulate bitcoin at a positive BTC yield. For income-oriented investors, the preferred shares offer the possibility of 1) earnings interest on the capital invested into Strategy or 2) accumulating more preferred shares through payments in kind (when preferred dividends are paid through stock instead of cash). Regardless of the mechanism by which Strategy opts to raise cash, the fundamental investment thesis in the stock remains. Do you believe bitcoin will continue appreciating in value?

But as decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to mature, there's a growing push to bring XRP into the fold — a movement increasingly referred to as “ XRPFi .” The goal is simple: enable XRP holders to participate in the broader DeFi ecosystem, from lending and staking to trading and yield farming. This isn’t merely a speculative trend. Recent events — including Ripple’s court victory against the SEC and the launch of Ripple’s own stablecoin RLUSD — have reignited interest in XRP as a foundational asset. But unlike Ethereum, the XRPL wasn’t built with smart contract capabilities. It lacks native support for programmable DeFi primitives, making it difficult to use XRP in the kinds of applications that define DeFi today. Several solutions have emerged to address this. XRPL sidechains like the EVM-compatible chain developed by Peersyst and Ripple allow Solidity-based applications to run with XRP as the native gas token. The Xahau sidechain offers another alternative by introducing “Hooks” — lightweight WebAssembly-based smart contracts. These initiatives are promising and important to XRP’s long-term growth, but they’re still early-stage and require bridging assets across networks. This is where Flare enters the picture — not as a sidechain or auxiliary layer, but as a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain aiming to give non-smart contract tokens like XRP full access to DeFi functionality. And based on adoption metrics, it’s clear Flare is leading the XRPFi charge. How Flare Brings XRP to DeFi Flare is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 network built from the ground up to unlock the utility of assets like XRP, BTC, and DOGE. Through a combination of native bridging mechanisms, decentralized oracles, and data acquisition protocols, Flare allows these previously siloed assets to be used in smart contracts and DeFi applications without relying on centralized custodians. For XRPFi specifically, the cornerstone is the FXRP system — a mechanism that allows XRP to be trustlessly wrapped into a DeFi-compatible form and deployed on Flare. This process involves no centralized intermediaries; instead, it relies on decentralized agents and collateral to mint FXRP at a 1:1 peg with XRP locked on the XRPL. Once wrapped, FXRP becomes usable across any smart contract on the Flare network. Equally important is liquidity — and Flare has tackled this with the deployment of USD₮0, a native stablecoin backed 1:1 by Tether’s USDT on Ethereum. Unlike wrapped tokens, USD₮0 uses LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to move seamlessly between chains. This gives Flare an immediate injection of deep, stable liquidity — a critical ingredient for any DeFi ecosystem. In the weeks following USD₮0’s launch, nearly $70 million was bridged to Flare . This figure, tracked via Flare’s own analytics dashboard on Dune, represents one of the most significant stablecoin inflows to any new chain in recent memory. For context, this occurred even before Flare’s full DeFi suite had officially launched, underscoring a strong vote of confidence from users and investors. To complement FXRP and USD₮0, Flare has cultivated a native DeFi ecosystem that includes applications like SparkDEX for decentralized trading, Kinetic for lending and borrowing, and Sceptre for liquid staking. Wallets such as Bifrost and Oxenflow have integrated Flare, making it easy for XRP holders to interact with these dApps through familiar interfaces. Flare has described this architecture as the “XRPFi flywheel”: FXRP brings in XRP, USD₮0 provides the liquidity, and native DeFi apps give users a reason to stay — driving compounding growth for the entire ecosystem. Flare vs. the Field Flare isn’t the only entity working to make XRP a DeFi-ready asset, but its approach and execution stand out. On one end, XRPL’s AMM implementation and the EVM sidechain provide important experimentation grounds for bringing DeFi to XRP. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is also a meaningful addition to the XRP toolkit. But these efforts remain fragmented and are often limited in scope or user accessibility. Xahau offers an innovative direction with its “Hooks” model and native smart contracts, but it introduces a new token (XAH) and has yet to gain serious traction outside the XRPL enthusiast community. In contrast, Flare brings together all the necessary components — trustless XRP bridging, stablecoin liquidity, and an expanding suite of DeFi dApps — into a single, composable Layer-1 environment. Its interoperability-first design allows DeFi builders to tap into multiple ecosystems without starting from scratch, while EVM compatibility ensures that tools from Ethereum and other chains can be easily ported over. Importantly, users are already showing up. Flare’s total value locked has risen sharply, and stablecoin liquidity continues to grow. The fact that nearly $70 million in USD₮0 arrived on Flare prior to any major incentive program or token farming campaign speaks volumes about its perceived legitimacy. Conclusion: XRPFi’s Present and Future XRPFi is no longer a theoretical vision. The infrastructure is being built — and used. While XRPL-based solutions are making progress, Flare has effectively leapfrogged the field by delivering an integrated, high-liquidity environment for XRP-based DeFi. It remains to be seen how the broader XRPFi movement will evolve. There’s room for multiple ecosystems to coexist, and innovations on XRPL itself may mature in time. But if early traction, user capital, and developer engagement are any indicators, Flare has secured a significant early lead — and may well be the chain that finally brings XRP into the DeFi mainstream.

While many altcoins have started to break key levels, XRP continues to respect its long-standing compression patterns against both the dollar and Bitcoin. Technical Analysis The USDT Pair On the USDT pair, XRP has been locked within a descending channel since the start of the year. After getting rejected near the $2.40 level just below the higher trendline, the asset has slid back into the mid-zone of the pattern and is currently holding just above $2.10. Despite the lack of directional breakout, there’s visible structure in this range. The 200-day moving average continues to offer dynamic support around $2.10, while the 100-day moving average is closing in on it from above. If the price manages to hold the 2.00–2.10 support and break above the channel’s upper boundary near $2.5, the next major level to watch would be the $2.80 region, followed by the $3.00–$3.30 zone. The BTC Pair The BTC pair tells a similar story. XRP/BTC has been sliding inside a falling wedge for over two months, forming lower highs and lower lows within the structure. However, Ripple’s token is now trading right on top of a major confluence level around 2200 SAT. This level has been held multiple times and coincides with the 200-day moving average. The wedge pattern typically resolves to the upside, but XRP still needs to break out and reclaim 2400–2450 SAT to generate any bullish momentum. Until then, the downtrend structure remains intact.

44192966,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157274,1746454252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Potential: Kyrgyzstan Crypto Reserve Eyed with Bold Bitcoin and BNB Proposal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kyrgyzstan-crypto-reserve-proposal/,"In a move that has sent ripples through the global cryptocurrency community, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), now serving as a cryptocurrency policy advisor to the government of Kyrgyzstan, has put forth a remarkable suggestion: the establishment of a Kyrgyzstan crypto reserve . This isn’t just any reserve; CZ specifically recommended starting with two prominent cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) , as the foundational assets. This proposal highlights the increasing interest from sovereign nations in integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. While some countries have explored central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or adopted Bitcoin as legal tender (like El Salvador), the concept of a national treasury holding a reserve of cryptocurrencies is still relatively new and potentially groundbreaking. The CZ Kyrgyzstan Connection: What Led to This Proposal? The involvement of CZ Kyrgyzstan as a policy advisor is a significant development in itself. His expertise, stemming from building and leading the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, provides a unique perspective on the potential benefits and complexities of integrating digital assets at a national level. His advisory role positions him to influence the country’s future approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The suggestion to create a Kyrgyzstan crypto reserve likely stems from discussions around national economic diversification, technological advancement, and attracting foreign investment in the digital economy sector. By proposing specific assets like BTC and BNB, CZ is offering a concrete starting point for this ambitious endeavor. Why Bitcoin and BNB for a National Reserve? The choice of Bitcoin national reserve and BNB national reserve assets is strategic, though potentially controversial, particularly the inclusion of BNB, which is associated with his former company. Bitcoin (BTC): As the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold. Its decentralized nature, established network effects, and growing institutional acceptance make it a logical, albeit volatile, candidate for a reserve asset aimed at long-term value storage and diversification away from traditional fiat currencies or commodities. Binance Coin (BNB): BNB is the native token of the BNB Chain ecosystem, closely linked to the Binance exchange. While its inclusion in a national reserve might raise questions about potential conflicts of interest given CZ’s history, BNB does have significant utility within a large ecosystem, including trading fee discounts, participation in token sales, and use in various DeFi applications. Its value is tied to the health and activity of the Binance ecosystem. The combination suggests a potential strategy that balances the perceived stability and store-of-value narrative of Bitcoin with the utility and ecosystem-driven value of BNB. However, the inherent volatility of both assets presents considerable risks for a national treasury. What Are the Potential Benefits of a Kyrgyzstan Crypto Reserve? Adopting a Kyrgyzstan crypto policy that includes a national reserve could unlock several potential advantages for the country: Economic Diversification: Holding crypto assets can diversify national reserves away from traditional assets like gold, foreign currencies, or government bonds, potentially offering uncorrelated returns. Attracting Investment: A progressive stance on crypto, including holding reserves, could signal to the global tech and crypto industry that Kyrgyzstan is open for business, potentially attracting investment and talent. Technological Advancement: Establishing a crypto reserve requires building infrastructure and expertise in managing digital assets, fostering technological development within the country. Inflation Hedge (Potential): While volatile, some proponents argue that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, could serve as a hedge against inflation of fiat currencies over the long term. Increased National Wealth (If Successful): Should the value of the reserve assets appreciate significantly, it could substantially increase the nation’s wealth. Imagine the possibilities if Kyrgyzstan successfully navigates the complexities and benefits from the growth of the crypto market. It could position the nation as a forward-thinking player in the digital age. What Challenges and Risks Does This Kyrgyzstan Crypto Policy Face? Establishing a Kyrgyzstan crypto reserve is not without significant hurdles and risks. Governments operate under different constraints and risk tolerances than private entities. Key challenges include: Challenge Description Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Significant price swings could rapidly decrease the value of the national reserve, impacting national finances. Regulatory Uncertainty The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in international regulations could impact the usability or value of the reserve assets. Security Risks Managing large reserves of cryptocurrencies requires robust security measures to protect against hacking, theft, and loss of private keys. National-level security is paramount. Technical Complexity Setting up and managing a national crypto reserve requires significant technical expertise and infrastructure, which may not be readily available. Public Perception & Political Risk Adopting such a novel policy could face domestic political opposition and skepticism from the public or international bodies. Liquidity Concerns Liquidating a large national reserve during a market downturn could be challenging and could further impact market prices. Addressing these challenges requires careful planning, robust risk management frameworks, and potentially international cooperation. Comparing Kyrgyzstan’s Potential Move to Other Nations While no country has officially announced a national crypto reserve in the way CZ proposes for a Bitcoin national reserve and BNB national reserve , El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender offers a point of comparison regarding national exposure to crypto volatility and its impact on state finances. Other nations have explored blockchain technology for various purposes, including digital identity, supply chain management, and CBDCs. However, directly holding significant amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies like BTC and BNB in the national treasury is a more aggressive step into the asset class itself. The outcome of this potential Kyrgyzstan crypto policy could serve as a case study for other developing nations considering similar strategies. What Actionable Insights Can We Draw? For observers and potential stakeholders, CZ’s proposal to the CZ Kyrgyzstan advisory role offers several insights: Government Interest is Growing: This reinforces the trend of governments worldwide exploring how cryptocurrencies and blockchain fit into their future. Advisors Matter: Individuals with significant industry experience can directly influence national policy directions. Reserve Strategy is Evolving: Nations are looking beyond traditional assets for reserve diversification. Due Diligence is Crucial: Any nation considering such a move must undertake extensive research, risk assessment, and build necessary infrastructure. This development is a reminder that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world continue to blur, with nation-states becoming increasingly involved. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future? Changpeng Zhao’s suggestion for a Kyrgyzstan crypto reserve , starting with Bitcoin and BNB, is a bold and ambitious proposal. It highlights Kyrgyzstan’s potential willingness to embrace digital innovation and diversify its national assets in the volatile, yet potentially rewarding, world of cryptocurrencies. While the benefits of economic diversification and technological advancement are clear, the significant risks associated with market volatility, security, and regulatory uncertainty cannot be ignored. Whether Kyrgyzstan adopts this specific proposal remains to be seen. However, the fact that such a high-profile figure is advising a nation on creating a Bitcoin national reserve and BNB national reserve underscores the growing mainstream relevance of cryptocurrencies and sets a fascinating precedent for national economic strategy in the digital age. The world will be watching closely to see how this potential Kyrgyzstan crypto policy unfolds.

Brett, a well-followed crypto analyst on X, spotlighted this development, noting its implications for Ripple’s potential involvement in BlackRock’s BUIDL ecosystem, a fund aimed at institutional tokenization and liquidity. Ripple’s Strategic Acquisition of Hidden Road Signals Bold Move: $XRP to Power Institutional Settlement in BlackRock’s BUIDL Ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/Cm9weD2mvO — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) May 5, 2025 BlackRock’s BUIDL, Triparty Collateral, and the Ripple Connection An official report dated October 17, 2024, from Finadium, reveals that Hidden Road and Komainu jointly added BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as eligible collateral under triparty collateral management agreements. These agreements allow whitelisted BUIDL investors to trade via Hidden Road, with collateral remaining in custody at Komainu. This structure enables institutions to retain secure, regulated custody of their digital assets while participating in collateralized trading. At the time of the October announcement, Hidden Road was operating independently. However, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road now brings the firm’s extensive institutional network, including its close integration with BlackRock’s BUIDL infrastructure, under Ripple’s strategic control. The significance of this move is underscored by the nature of BUIDL itself, which is designed to tokenize U.S. Treasury yields and offer them on-chain to institutions seeking both liquidity and compliance. Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Ambitions Ripple has long been viewed as a key infrastructure provider for the future of finance, with XRP poised to serve as a global liquidity bridge. The acquisition of Hidden Road could mark a turning point where Ripple not only facilitates payments but also becomes a central figure in institutional settlement, collateralization, and tokenized finance. By inheriting Hidden Road’s role in BlackRock’s BUIDL ecosystem, Ripple potentially positions XRP to support or even power these settlements. BUIDL’s integration into triparty collateral structures means that Ripple, through Hidden Road, now has access to a framework that intersects with major financial players and prime brokerage solutions. These institutional systems, traditionally reserved for high-grade fiat and securities, are now interfacing with digital assets, and Ripple’s control of Hidden Road gives it a direct hand in shaping that interface. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Role in the New Financial Framework The big question is whether XRP will be actively utilized within this BUIDL-linked institutional framework. While Ripple’s current relationship with BlackRock and Komainu is indirect and inherited through Hidden Road, the potential for XRP to serve as a real-time settlement token within triparty agreements is substantial. The cryptocurrency’s design as a fast, low-cost, and scalable settlement asset makes it an ideal fit for tokenized U.S. Treasuries and other digital representations of real-world assets. Furthermore, Ripple’s extensive experience in cross-border liquidity and CBDC collaborations adds a layer of credibility and utility to any expanded role XRP may play in institutional settlement. With Ripple now entrenched in an ecosystem that touches BlackRock, Komainu, and global collateral networks, it is only a matter of strategic integration before XRP becomes a functional part of this infrastructure. Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road could prove to be a masterstroke in its quest to redefine institutional finance. By absorbing Hidden Road’s position in BlackRock’s BUIDL infrastructure, Ripple is no longer simply offering blockchain-based alternatives to banks—it is embedding itself directly into the systems banks and financial institutions already use. As Brett noted in his analysis, this development could see XRP emerge as a critical component in powering institutional settlement, providing Ripple a unique leverage point in the rapidly evolving tokenized financial world. The financial future is being reshaped—and Ripple, through Hidden Road, is now sitting at the heart of the transformation.

Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted this detail in an X post today, stressing the shift in market sentiments. Per the tweet , the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had a stellar outing the previous week, outperformed only by Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO).Resurgent IBIT Dominates InflowsThe IBIT saw a net inflow of $2.48 billion, about 19% of the total positive flows between 28th April and 4th May. Only the VOO saw a better inflow ($3.93 billion) than the BlackRock Bitcoin-focused product. Inflows Among Major ETFs This renewed traction indicates a changing narrative from earlier sentiments at the beginning of the year, as appetite towards Bitcoin rejuvenates. Balchunas noted that this shift tilted towards market users’ “beta with a side of bitcoin” bias last year.For context, in 2024, ETF investors sought exposure to funds that track the general performance of the market with a touch of Bitcoin , evident in the $117 billion VOO and $37 billion IBIT net inflows. The Bloomberg ETF expert highlighted that recent inflow data suggest that this mentality seems to be crawling back into the market.Meanwhile, the BlackRock Bitcoin product has rebounded from earlier setbacks to record a year-to-date inflow of $6.4 billion. The investment product languished below the top 50 in YTD performance across all ETFs before recent momentum pushed it to 8th on the log.BlackRock Bitcoin Product Dominates Other Bitcoin ETFsWhile bearing the torch for Bitcoin in the global ETF markets, IBIT has also been schooling other investment products tracking the performance of Bitcoin. The Monday data identified that it has all been about the BlackRock Bitcoin product, with 96% of all inflows to the US Bitcoin spot ETFs moving into IBIT. For perspective, the funds have a one-month net inflow of $4 billion, with the BlackRock product accounting for a staggering $3.85 billion. Balchunas noted that the massive traction despite the Bitcoin ETF decoupling from the actual BTC price could be due to hedge funds leveraging the variation, driving up trading activities. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Leads Bitcoin ETF Inflows Meanwhile, the IBIT has recorded a cumulative net inflow of $43.64 billion since its market debut last year and ranks as the most successful ETF launch in history. The US Bitcoin spot ETF generally holds a net asset of $113.15 billion, about 5.87% of the asset’s market cap.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-05 15:22:25

The U.S. authorities said Monday that the organization has provided a haven for transnational criminal organizations who use the border region controlled by the KNA to run illicit operations such as human trafficking and smuggling. The group, which is said to have ties with the Burmese military, is also accused of fostering cyber scams and crypto thefts on an ""industrial scale"" tied to billions of dollars in losses. Under KNA's control, hotels and casinos were retrofitted to house elaborate ""pig butchering"" scam operations in which U.S. citizens were lured with fraudulent romantic ties and had money stolen from them in the form of cryptocurrency, according to the Treasury Department. Those engaging in the scams were themselves often held captive or under pressure to run months-long thefts that sometimes used attractive models to engage in video calls. In the new U.S. sanctions — also specifically targeting the organization's leader, Saw Chit Thu, and his sons, Saw Htoo Eh Moo and Saw Chit Chit — the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control is blocking any use of U.S. assets or interactions with U.S. people or entities. This action follows closely on the heels of last week's move by the U.S. to sever the Cambodian company Huione Group from the financial system. Huione was said to provide a money-laundering outlet for criminal organizations in Southeast Asia.

This latest acquisition pushes the company's total holdings to 555,450 BTC. Chairman Michael Saylor highlighted the purchase through a post on X.https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1919362210804990383Latest Acquisition Follows $1.4 Billion Bitcoin BuyNotably, this $180 million acquisition is modest compared to last week’s $1.4 billion purchase. Still, it fits into the company’s consistent pattern of strategic buying. Since its inception of Bitcoin purchases, Strategy has significantly ramped up its buying activity, especially following the U.S. 2024 elections. At an average purchase price of $68,550 per BTC, the company has now invested approximately $38.08 billion in Bitcoin. With the market price of Bitcoin currently exceeding $94,000, Strategy holds an unrealized profit estimated at more than $14 billion.The timing of the latest purchase aligns with the company’s ongoing capital deployment plan. Just days prior, Strategy unveiled a $42 billion funding program. This initiative includes a $21 billion common stock issuance and an additional $21 billion through fixed-income instruments. The funds aim to expand Bitcoin holdings and increase yield targets throughout 2025.Saylor Signals Continued Accumulation StrategyWhile no longer CEO, Michael Saylor continues to play a visible role in Strategy’s direction. On Sunday, he hinted at the upcoming buy by pointing to a chart on SaylorTracker, noting the lack of ""orange dots"" used to represent BTC purchases. His messaging comes amid comments reiterating his belief in persistent and large-scale acquisitions. He recently stated plans to continue purchasing even if Bitcoin reaches a price of $1 million per coin. https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1919314657757495319According to Saylor, acquisitions could scale to $1 billion per day depending on market conditions and availability.Future Approach as Liquidity Concerns EmergeThis posture toward aggressive acquisition has prompted industry discussions about the future of Bitcoin supply. Richard Byworth, a partner at Syz Capital and adviser to Jan3, speculated on whether Saylor’s current acquisition method would remain viable if supply tightens significantly. He proposed that the company could consider acquiring firms and using their treasury assets for future Bitcoin purchases.

This article reveals the top three coins that could see major value increases. Dive in to discover which digital assets are set to ride the next wave of excitement and potential profit. Pepe (PEPE) Price Overview and Trend Snapshot Last month saw Pepe climbing by 14.67% but experiencing a recent pullback of 5.34%. Over the last six months, the performance dipped by 3.32%. Price swings during these periods reflect a mix of short bursts of gains and declines, indicating that the coin is still testing its support levels and resilience against market volatility. Current trading levels show a price range between $0.00000647 and $0.00001057, with resistance near $0.00001223 and support at $0.00000404. Bears are slightly in control due to a downward movement last week, though the neutral 52.17 RSI and mixed momentum indicator suggest no strong trend. Traders might consider buying near support or selling short if prices reach resistance levels. Pudgy Penguins Show Mixed Momentum in Recent Rally Pudgy past month performance shows a striking surge of nearly 130%, while the half-year gain sits at about 116%. A one-week drop of 15% added some volatility to the run, reflecting both brief pullbacks and underlying strength in the coin’s movement. The price history over these periods points to robust long-term interest despite short-term pressure. Current trading sees prices moving between $0.005 and $0.015 dollars, with a key resistance at $0.02 and a second resistance at $0.03. Bulls appear to lead the mid-term trend with RSI levels around 63, although bears have impacted the recent weekly decline. Trading within these levels may involve buying near support and looking for breakouts past initial resistance levels. Bonk Displays Mixed Price Trends Amid Volatile Movements BONK 's recent monthly action recorded a surge of 50.75% while the half‐year performance dropped by 10.68%. The coin witnessed a swift turnaround after a slight one‐week fall of 7.90%, indicating periods of quick gains paired with notable corrections. Price behavior over the past month reflects strong bullish impulses followed by cautious retreats, painting a picture of volatile market sentiment with intermittent bursts of buyer activity. Current trading levels show price hovering near a resistance at $0.00003 with support almost at zero. The next resistance lies at $0.00004, while technical measures such as a 55.39 RSI hint at balanced market conditions. Neither bulls nor bears dominate decisively, leaving room for trades within these levels as market participants wait for a clearer trend to form. Conclusion PEPE , PENGU , and BONK show strong potential for significant gains in May. Market interest in memecoins is growing, and these three are emerging as favorites. With increasing community support and attention, they could see notable value increases. Their growth is fueled by the current market trends and active online communities driving hype. Investors are watching closely, anticipating these coins to perform well. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Strategy (MSTR) is likely to be the largest buyer, with an additional $124 billion of the world's largest crypto, in the broker's bull case. The company led by Michael Saylor announced a further $21 billion at-the-market common stock offering last week to buy more bitcoin. ""The U.S. pro crypto regulatory regime have further accelerated the corporate ownership growth of bitcoin,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Bernstein expects other listed companies to allocate around $205 billion to bitcoin acquisition strategies, led by smaller firms with lower growth looking to emulate Strategy's treasury model. Public companies now own ~2.4% of the bitcoin supply, or about 720,000 BTC on their balance sheets, the report noted. Still, Strategy's ""scale is hard to replicate"" and not every bitcoin treasury will be successful in attempting to replicate the company's playbook, the report added.

Attorney John Deaton, a reputable trial lawyer known for his pro-Ripple and XRP outlook, has taken to X, formerly Twitter, to share his position. According to Deaton, Circle’s refusal to sell to Ripple at a $5 billion offer is backed by an optimistic bet that the firm’s valuation could skyrocket in the long term. According to a Bloomberg report, Circle, the peer-to-peer payments technology that manages the USDC stablecoin, rejected the offer because it considered it significantly low. “Circle’s rejection of the $5B offer suggests Circle believes its market value, particularly post-IPO, is likely to exceed $5 billion, possibly approaching or surpassing the $9 billion from its 2022 SPAC attempt.” Deaton writes. The notable shift across regulatory bodies, particularly the SEC, has placed crypto in a less hostile environment. The new development, expected to usher in the approval of the STABLE GENIUS Act, validates Circle’s expectations of a higher deal, particularly around the $10 billion level, Deaton added . Circle first filed for its S-1, a form used to register securities offerings with the SEC, on April 1, 2025, ahead of plans to debut under the “CRCL” ticker on the NYSE. Key underwriters for the firm include leading investment banking firms Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. Although the stablecoin issuer failed to hit its $9 billion valuation target from its failed SPAC deal in 2022, Deaton notes that expectations for the firm’s IPO sit between $4 billion and $5 billion in valuation, further amplifying Circle’s decision to decline the offer. In 2024, Circle reported yearly profits of $156 million. Although significantly lower than its $1.67 billion revenue recorded in the same year, the metrics came after the firm paid off 60% of its revenues to distributors like Coinbase.",Cryptocurrency|News|Circle|Ripple|USDC|XRP News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-05 15:27:10

This level could determine the next phase of price action, as bulls aim to reclaim control and push prices into higher territory. Holding this support is essential to maintain the bullish momentum built over the past few weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Critical Range: Breakout Or Breakdown? However, macroeconomic tensions and persistent global market volatility continue to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. With financial markets responding to rising geopolitical uncertainty and interest rate concerns, altcoins like Avalanche face mounting pressure. Despite the headwinds, some analysts remain optimistic. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical setup highlighting that AVAX is bouncing off the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart — a level often watched closely by traders. According to Martinez, this bounce could act as a pivot point for bulls, especially if volume increases and price action confirms strength above short-term resistance. A clean move higher from here could reignite AVAX’s uptrend and bring it back into focus as one of the leading altcoins in the Layer-1 ecosystem. The coming days will be crucial to confirm the direction. Avalanche Bounces From Key Level As Bulls Regain Momentum After months of volatility and sustained selling pressure, Avalanche is trading at a pivotal juncture that took the asset down from its earlier highs. Despite the difficult environment, sentiment appears to be shifting. Over the past few weeks, AVAX has drawn renewed attention from traders and analysts who believe the current structure could lead to a meaningful recovery. Market participants are closely watching for a confirmed reversal from the local lows to signal the beginning of a broader move into higher supply zones. According to Martinez’s insights, Avalanche is currently bouncing off its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart — a level often seen as a key dynamic support in trending markets. This bounce is further supported by the TD Sequential indicator, which has flashed a buy signal, indicating that bullish momentum could be building at this critical price level. For this reversal to gain real traction, AVAX must not only defend current support but also break through short-term resistance zones to establish a bullish continuation pattern. This week’s price action will be crucial, as the broader crypto market also seeks direction amid macroeconomic uncertainty. If bulls step in with conviction and volume confirms strength, Avalanche could position itself for a significant push toward the $25–$30 range. However, a failure to hold above the $20 level could result in further downside and a retest of previous lows. With technical indicators aligning and market sentiment improving, the next few sessions could define AVAX’s trajectory for the coming weeks. Related Reading: Cardano Consolidates In Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Sets Bull/Bear Price Targets AVAX Price Details: Technical Levels To Watch Avalanche is currently trading at $19.98, testing a key psychological support level after a significant recovery from its local bottom in early April. Despite a modest bounce, AVAX remains well below both the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $29.80 and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $26.30. This confirms that the broader trend is still bearish, and bulls have yet to reclaim any major technical ground. The recent price rejection near the $22–$23 zone suggests that sellers are still in control. Volume appears to be tapering off, signaling weakening momentum. The declining slope of both the SMA and EMA reinforces the structural weakness in the medium term. Unless AVAX can break above the $26–$30 resistance cluster, the path of least resistance remains to the downside.

If this support at $20 fails, AVAX could revisit March lows near $16. On the flip side, a decisive breakout above the EMA could spark renewed interest from bulls and signal a potential trend reversal. Traders should watch for increased volume and a close above $26 to confirm a shift in sentiment.

However, the European country has recorded slower economic growth recently, a development that crypto market onlookers believe Bitcoin could solve. Bitcoin technology firm JAN3 took to X to break down the possibilities for the Central European country if it decides to follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. For existing Bitcoin users in the country, the asset is tax-favored, as there has been no capital gains tax for private transactions or VAT on transactions for Bitcoin holders since 2018. Regarding sustainability, Switzerland’s current energy structure could help smoothly integrate Bitcoin into the country’s financial system. With its energy mix relying on renewable energy, with 60% stemming from hydroelectricity, sustainable mining could be achieved, especially during winter when power production outpaces demand. “With 15,000 MW of energy capacity (60% from hydro), Switzerland has the potential to scale sustainable #Bitcoin mining. It can do this by surplus renewable power that could help stabilize the grid while unlocking new revenue streams for the country.” – JAN3 . Is Switzerland on its way to adopting Bitcoin as legal tender? While the Swiss government has yet to make any official statement regarding Bitcoin as a substitute for the Swiss Franc, its national currency, multiple Bitcoin—and crypto-friendly developments have been implemented in the region over the years. A rise in Bitcoin adoption has resulted in 11% of the Swiss population, around 1.6 million Swiss people, holding Bitcoin. Bitcoin and blockchain-related activities have also been sustained in physical locations like the canton of Zug, also known as Crypto Valley. In 2022, a Plan B initiative was launched in Lugano to host over 260 Bitcoin merchants. Although the Swiss bank recently rejected Bitcoin as an asset for its reserves over volatility concerns, the growing demand for the asset amongst Swiss nationals could continue to drive integration across different sectors.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-05 15:34:14

Ripple has announced a $25 million commitment to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America as a way of supporting teachers. This funding will equip US classrooms, support critical resources, and facilitate financial literacy initiatives. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said, “Together, we hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.” DonorsChoose and Teach For America will take most of the $25 million grant in Ripple USD (RLUSD), Ripple’s stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar. This is the first time that this has ever been done. Teachers power the future—and we’re proud to support them: https://t.co/yjvoQdBMtj Starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, Ripple is committing $25M to U.S. classrooms through @DonorsChoose & Teach For America, supporting critical resources and financial literacy initiatives,… — Ripple (@Ripple) May 5, 2025 Stablecoins are quickly becoming a useful way to send money. According to Chainalysis data, they have become the most popular type of crypto-enabled payment method and have made up more than half of all onchain transaction volume in the past few months. Ripple donation is also meant to increase RLUSD user cases According to DonorsChoose, teachers are going the extra mile for their students’ education, even spending hundreds – sometimes thousands – of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms. A 2024 Gallup survey found that 55% of U.S. parents and adults are unhappy with the quality of K–12 education in the country. This is in line with larger concerns about the lack of funds for education. Therefore, Ripple’s pledge will help close this gap by giving students, teachers, and staff the tools they need to gain confidence again and do well in school. Alix Guerrier, CEO of DonorsChoose, said, “Through their initiatives, Ripple is directly providing teachers with the resources their students need for the best education. Students will not only get their hands on materials that will enhance their learning, but they will also have the tools to help set them on the path to a bright future.” In addition, Aneesh Sohoni, CEO of Teach For America, said, “We’re deeply grateful to Ripple for this transformative support This funding will expand our Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance to thousands of new corps members during their teacher preparation.” This is not a first for Ripple. Since 2018, Ripple has given more than $200 million to global projects, and almost 80% of its employees take part in giving and volunteering activities. Ripple has helped hundreds of nonprofits, mission-driven fintechs, and top colleges through its University Blockchain Research Initiative. However, this is also a strategy to grow the stablecoin that was launched recently. RLUSD is becoming more popular as collateral in both crypto and standard finance markets. NGOs are also looking into how they can use it to make donations. The stablecoin also works with decentralized finance (DeFi) and can switch between fiat and crypto. This lets businesses settle payments quickly and keep track of their cash flow. The stablecoin can be bought on Kraken, LMAX Digital, Bitstamp, and other big exchanges, which lets more regular people and businesses use it. Ripple said that, over time, it wants to make RLUSD an even bigger part of its payment platform. Meanwhile, Stablecoin has a market cap of over $316 million. Also, the trading volume has gone up by 55% in 24 hours to over $46 million. With growth potential, Ripple is set to integrate it further into its global payments network, which spans 90+ markets.

Using shell entities for licensing violates Indonesian digital laws. Users question the ethics of trading biometric data for crypto rewards. Indonesia has suspended the operating certificates of Sam Altman’s digital identity venture, World (formerly Worldcoin), after investigators flagged registration irregularities and “suspicious activity” in an announcement on May 4. The country’s Ministry of Communication and Digital (Komdigi) found that the project operated without proper permits, using a shell entity to bypass local laws. Worldcoin’s Bait-and-Switch in Indonesia Reveals Crypto’s Regulatory Loopholes Komdigi’s investigation revealed that World’s local partner, PT Terang Bulan Abadi, failed to secure the mandatory Electronic System Operator Certificate (TDPSE). Instead, the project operated under PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara, whose permit did not cover iris‑scanning services. In a press release , Komdigi’s Director‑General, Alexander Sabar, labeled the switch “a serious violation” and warned that any digital provider that borrows another firm’s credentials breaks Indonesian law. Worldcoin diblokir Komdigi karena isu privasi biometrik. Benarkah teknologi iris mata ini solusi atau justru eksploitasi baru? BACA SELENGKAPNYA: https://t.co/Rb90vIOmre #komdigi #WorldID #Worldcoin #crypto #cryptonews #asetkripto #beritakripto pic.twitter.com/4coP1bUBL4 — Blockchainmedia.id (@Vingika) May 5, 2025 Public opinion is divided, as some applaud the crackdown, calling World a “scam,” while others argue that cash‑strapped Indonesians may find value in trading iris data for World’s WLD tokens. Regulators have ordered World to halt new sign‑ups during the suspension period and will question both operators. Komdigi’s intervention threatens to slow that momentum. Under Indonesian law, digital platforms that fail to secure a valid TDPSE face sanctions up to permanent blacklisting. Indonesia joins a growing list of governments pushing back against the eyeball‑for‑crypto model launched in July 2023. Data protection watchdogs in Germany, Kenya, and Brazil have already opened probes. Despite this, World pressed ahead with its U.S. expansion last week , scheduling orb‑based verifications in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, and other states. American users will receive Worldcoin (WLD) after passing the scan and receiving a World ID. Will Indonesia’s Youth Drive Global Crypto Dominance? The suspension of World in Indonesia is especially influential because the country represents one of the fastest-growing crypto markets. Asia’s fourth-largest country by population, Indonesia, saw crypto transaction volume skyrocket to over $30 billion in 2024 , up from $6.5 billion the previous year, a 352% increase. INDONESIAN CRYPTO BOOM: $30B TRANSACTIONS IN 2024! Indonesia’s crypto scene is catching fire with $30B in transactions in 2024, a 350% increase! They’ve bounced back hard after that nasty dip in 2022, but it’s still a long way from the $54B glory days. Still, they’re nowhere… pic.twitter.com/hyjf4DdaIJ — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) November 29, 2024 The country now has over 20 million active traders on local and global platforms as of 2024. Chainalysis ranks Indonesia among the top crypto adopters worldwide, thanks to its growth in Southeast Asia. Youth investors drive this boom, with more than 60 percent of users aged 18–30 . Tokens like Bitcoin, Ether, USDT, and Solana remain the most traded assets. Local exchanges recorded 716,000 registered accounts, underlining growing retail and institutional interest. Regulators also eased restrictions by enacting CoFTRA Regulation No. 9 of 2024, which opened doors for institutional participation and sparked a September rally. A dual-tax policy imposed in 2022 temporarily cooled market activity, but 2024 volumes have already surpassed the combined totals of 2022 and 2023. Indonesia’s policymakers are now debating revising the “double tax” on crypto gains to sustain momentum. This would help the nation cement its status as a fast-emerging global crypto hotspot, outpacing many peers in adoption and technical advancements. Did Sam Altman’s World Just Lose Its Hold on Asia’s Crypto Hotspot? Indonesia’s crackdown on the World project isn’t just a local dispute—it’s a warning shot. Across Southeast Asia, resistance to unchecked data harvesting by Western tech firms is mounting. For example, Singapore’s regulators are already investigating World over biometric data and money laundering risks. Tech giants once exploited lax oversight in emerging markets—not anymore. Nations like Indonesia enforce strict data sovereignty, so even Sam Altman-backed ventures can’t ignore local laws. Asian nations like Malaysia and Thailand, with a similar demographic profile and rising crypto use, will scrutinize World’s compliance before granting the project access, as user data becomes a guarded asset for these nations. The monitoring goes beyond the continent. Germany, Kenya, and Brazil are also investigating World’s biometric data model. World and @Circle are bringing native @USDC and Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2 to the most distributed network of humans. pic.twitter.com/5aiMZ14FoW — World (@worldcoin) May 1, 2025 Despite this, the World Network is pushing ahead elsewhere. The project recently partnered with Circle to integrate USDC stablecoins into its network. It has also expanded to the U.S., offering $WLD tokens in exchange for iris data. The development in Asia marks a shift and proves a hard truth. Regulatory shortcuts are no longer permissible, even in crypto-friendly markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What stops the World project from bypassing US biometric laws like in Indonesia? Unlike Indonesia’s centralized system, the U.S. already enforces strict state-level biometric laws. These laws levy hefty fines for collecting biometric data without consent, making covert workarounds legally and financially perilous. In addition, U.S. regulators and a strong tradition of class-action litigation actively penalize violations, discouraging shell-entity tactics. Will Indonesia’s crypto tax revisions attract more institutional investors? Yes, easing the “double tax” (VAT + income tax) could incentivize institutions, especially as CoFTRA’s 2024 regulations already allowed their entry. However, lingering regulatory uncertainty around asset classification may still deter conservative funds.

This is a great example of how generative AI can directly benefit our learners,” said Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn. Journalist Brian Merchant noted that the shift to AI isn't really a new policy for Duolingo. The company laid off about 10 percent of its contractors at the end of 2023, and another series of layoffs took place in October 2024, a former employee said. In both cases, workers were replaced by artificial intelligence. Merchant also pointed to publication by The Atlantic about the unusually high unemployment rate among recent college graduates. Presumably, companies are applying AI instead of white-collar jobs. ”Almost every professional artist or illustrator I meet tells me that they have lost clients and jobs because of firms that have decided to turn to artificial intelligence instead of paying for human labor. Some have been forced out of their fields altogether,” Merchant emphasized. The crisis has arisen because of a series of management decisions made by executives seeking to cut payroll costs and consolidate control in their organizations, the journalist noted. This is evident in attrition in the creative industries, declining incomes for freelance artists, writers and illustrators, and the tendency of corporations to simply hire fewer workers. ”The AI jobs crisis is not some SkyNet-style robot apocalypse, but the layoff of tens of thousands of federal employees waving the banner of the first AI strategy,” the expert added. Layoffs According to layoff tracking site Layoffs.Fyi , 121 tech companies will lay off 52,305 employees in 2025. Including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Intel and other firms have announced job cuts to streamline and automate their operations. By comparison: In 2024, 551 companies laid off 152,922 employees; in 2023, 1,193 companies laid off 264,220 employees; in 2022, 1,064 companies laid off 165,269 employees. The number of software developer job openings on the popular job search site Indeed has been falling since 2022. Get ready for layoffs: AI will lead to massive layoffs Millions of employees could lose their jobs to artificial intelligence. British unions will be warned of this at next month's Congress, writes the Financial Times . The organizations will call on banks, insurance companies and accounting firms to prepare to pay for retraining millions of workers. The unions are relying on a June report from Citigroup that said half of banking jobs will be cut as a result of automation. Meanwhile, Swedish company Klarna is preparing to cut nearly half of its staff amid the introduction of artificial intelligence. CEO Sebastian Semiatkowski said AI helped reduce the firm's second-quarter losses to SEK10 million from SEK854 million ($84 million) a year ago. Over the past year, the company has cut its workforce from 5,000 employees to 3,800. Speaking to the FT, Siemiatkowski said their numbers could be reduced to 2,000 in the coming years. Artificial intelligence is replacing workers in customer service and marketing. According to the CEO of the fintech firm, AI provides benefits even if it leads to lower employment, but that's a problem governments should address. Klarna has increased average annual revenue per employee from $400,000 to $700,000 through layoffs and cost reductions thanks to artificial intelligence.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-05 15:36:53

This potential inflow stems from a growing number of corporates adopting a strategy modeled after MicroStrategy's aggressive Bitcoin accumulation culture. Bernstein disclosed this projection in a recent report.The asset manager’s base case outlines that between 2025 and 2030, listed corporations could direct nearly $205 billion into Bitcoin . An additional $124 billion is expected to come from companies replicating the capital deployment plan of Strategy (formerly Microstrategy). Currently, Strategy holds 555,450 BTC, purchased at a total cost of approximately $38.08 billion, based on an average price of $68,550 per coin. Most recently, Strategy added 1,895 BTC for $180 million.https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1919362210804990383These projections rely on the premise that more public companies with limited organic growth paths and large cash reserves will follow Strategy’s lead. Screened Firms May Drive Billions in Bitcoin DemandBernstein estimated that if just 20% of these screened companies allocated 25% of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, it could generate approximately $190 billion in inflows. The firm noted that such companies are typically low-growth and have surplus capital without productive avenues for reinvestment. As a result, Strategy’s approach may appeal to these firms as they seek new asset strategies.Meanwhile, the share of total Bitcoin supply held by public companies has climbed to 3.4%, up from 1.3% at the end of 2023. This increase coincides with broader regulatory and accounting shifts. Data confirms that these companies hold a total of 720,898 BTC worth $67.8 billion at press time. Meanwhile, private firms hold 398,323 BTC currently worth $37.44 billion.Market Conditions Support ExpansionMeanwhile, the Bernstein report also pointed to Strategy’s role in building institutional-grade instruments that facilitate access to Bitcoin. Bernstein analysts observed that Strategy’s financial structuring has allowed it to scale during multiple market cycles, although they cautioned that similar success is not guaranteed for others attempting to imitate the model.Still, growing access to capital markets and the declining float of available Bitcoin suggest that corporate adoption could tighten supply. Strategy’s Chairman, Michael Saylor, recently reiterated his intention to continue acquiring Bitcoin, stating readiness to buy even at $1 million per coin, with potential daily purchases of $1 billion.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-05 15:40:22

Notably, while ADA’s price has remained under $0.70, whale accumulation at this scale suggests strategic positioning for what could be a major breakout. A conviction that is also being echoed by others in the space. According to Chris from the popular YouTube channel “Chris Does Crypto,” the timing of this accumulation is what stands out, as the purchases came despite ADA failing to break key resistance levels and even slipping in market cap rankings. “ Whales don’t gamble small ,” Chris stated, “ They’re strategic. When they move like this, it usually signals something brewing under the surface.” That said, while price action has remained subdued, Cardano’s bullish narrative seems mostly grounded in its strong fundamentals. At the heart of this optimism is the upcoming Leios upgrade, a highly anticipated milestone that aims to deliver transaction speeds exceeding Solana’s while preserving Cardano’s core principle of decentralization. Unlike Solana, which has suffered multiple outages due to its resource-heavy architecture and concentrated validator set, Cardano stands out with a flawless seven-year uptime record. This uninterrupted performance underscores the network’s architectural resilience and long-term reliability, key attributes that continue to attract strategic investors. Beyond speed, Cardano is also entering what Charles Hoskinson has recently called the “fourth generation of crypto,” with privacy at the core. The upcoming Midnight airdrop, expected to onboard millions of users through cross-chain integration, aims to introduce privacy-preserving tokens like Knight and Dust. These innovations not only widen Cardano’s use case but also position it as a platform for next generation decentralized finance (DeFi). Meanwhile, institutional adoption and ETF speculation are adding more fuel to the bullish narrative. According to popular predictions platform Polymarket, the odds of a Cardano ETF approval in 2025 have risen to 70%. Given the massive inflows that spot ETFs brought to Bitcoin and Ethereum, a similar approval for ADA could open the floodgates to institutional capital. Adding to the momentum is speculation of a strategic partnership between Ripple and Cardano, after Ripple teased a major infrastructure announcement featuring Cardano’s logo. If confirmed, this alliance could facilitate a shared ecosystem for real-world asset tokenization, estimated to be valued at up to $19 trillion by 2033. Perhaps most groundbreaking is Cardano’s planned integration with Bitcoin, enabling smart contract functionality for BTC via Cardano’s UTXO-compatible architecture. Through features like Babel fees, users will be able to transact on the Bitcoin network while paying fees in ADA. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.6908 reflecting a 1.58% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|SOL|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-05 15:42:28

The 47-year-old is accused of participating in the 2022 hack of US-based Nomad , a crypto bridge, which resulted in the theft of nearly $190 million in digital assets, according to reporting from The Jerusalem Post. According to a US extradition request, Gurevich exploited a vulnerability in Nomad’s code, withdrawing about $2.89 million in tokens. He later contacted Nomad’s CTO under a false identity, apologized, returned a fraction of the funds, and demanded a $500,000 “reward” for finding the bug. Authorities say he ceased communication after Nomad offered him 10% of the stolen assets. Gurevich changed his name to “Alexander Block” on April 29 and obtained a new passport the next day. Israeli police arrested him at the airport before he could board his flight. He appeared in court on May 2 in handcuffs.

Gurevich immigrated to Israel in 2017 but reportedly spent much of his time abroad, including in Africa.

Trump denies profiting from the Solana-based TRUMP token amid growing scrutiny. Despite a pro-crypto stance, TRUMP coin dips 85%, since its ATH, raising concerns. President Donald Trump has doubled down on his support for cryptocurrency, stating that digital assets have shown greater resilience than traditional markets during recent economic turbulence. In an interview with NBC News , Trump emphasized on the strategic importance and growing popularity of crypto assets. “I want crypto,” Trump stated plainly when asked about concerns regarding potential profits from his presidency. “I think crypto is important because if we don’t do it, China is going to. It’s new. It’s very popular. It’s very hot.” The President specifically highlighted the sector’s performance during market downturns. He noted that crypto “stayed much stronger than other aspects of the market.” He pointed to the widespread adoption as a key factor influencing his pro-crypto position and suggested that the technology has become too important to ignore.

Dogecoin fell drastically, losing 25% and trading near $0.17 with volatility. Along the way, one new pay-token soared by 400% in presale, grabbing headlines with its frictionless crypto-to-fiat system and heavy inflows of capital. Investors who’ve watched meme coins lose steam are now shifting their gaze to the presale star tied to real-world utility and explosive price growth. Dogecoin Falls 4% Amid Bearish Sentiment The coin has gained about 2.4% in value in the last one month, showing promise in breaking through. Dogecoin is trading at about $0.1725, dropping by nearly 4% in the last one week due to overall market weakness that brings down investors’ morale. Technical indicators point to strong resistance at about $0.20 and strong support at around $0.1280, indicating any recovery could be capped in the absence of fresh buying interest. A monthly close above $0.20 could set the stage for a run towards its all-time high of $0.74 if Dogecoin is able to achieve it. The analyst says that this sort of breakout would be highly bullish in character and could attract additional investor interest. Innovative Speed and Recovery: Solana Thrives Under Pressure Solana (SOL) started trading during May in the vicinity of $146.67 after rebounding off April lows of nearly $115, so buyers came in on major support levels. The network’s 23% growth over the past month, and the 5% increase in spot volumes, are proof of renewed on-chain interest that may fuel additional upside. Technically, SOL is only beneath resistance at $157, supported by a trend line since February. The SOL’s 4-hourly chart is experiencing tightening Bollinger Bands , signaling that there is likely to be a big price move soon. In the longer term, there are some predictions that have Solana reaching up to $505 by the end of 2025, from here meaning a rise of 237% if the bulls are still behind it. With growingly rapid throughputs and growing DeFi, Solana is still one of the best altcoins to place faith in with regards to favorable price movements this year.

When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $1.84 billion, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an inflow of $149.2 million. When we look at other altcoins, XRP experienced an inflow of $10.5 million, Solana (SOL) $6 million, Tezos (XTZ) $8.2 million, and Cardano (ADA) $1.2 million. “As usual, Bitcoin had the biggest inflow last week, seeing $1.8 billion in inflows. Ethereum saw solid inflows totaling $149 million in its second week, bringing the inflows in the last 2 weeks to $336 million, while its rival Solana saw smaller inflows of $6 million. Other notable flows were XRP and Tezos (XTZ) with inflows of $10.5 million and $8.2 million respectively. When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 1.92 billion dollars.

Notably, the coin’s muted response to the March 2025 dismissal of the SEC lawsuit has raised concerns within the crypto community, with one prominent pundit claiming the damage runs deeper than price charts can show. “All Things XRP,” a popular influencer in the XRP community, recently sparked this conversation, blaming the SEC for not just slowing XRP down but stealing its years of growth, all while other crypto assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL soared. The post referred to the lawsuit filed by the SEC in December 2020, which accused Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering. The impact was immediate and brutal with XRP’s price plunging from $0.65 to $0.17 in a matter of days, marking a 73% crash. Major U.S. exchanges including Coinbase and Kraken delisted the coin, effectively cutting off access for American investors and collapsing its liquidity. “The lawsuit didn’t just hit the price. It painted XRP as “toxic.” Banks paused. Institutions bailed. Investors lost faith. Even post-victory, that stigma lingers,” he noted . The pundit further reminded his followers that for the next three years, XRP was trapped in regulatory limbo. From 2021 to 2023, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana rallied during the bull market, XRP remained flat, trading between $0.30 and $0.50. The lawsuit suppressed price action and drained investor interest and institutional confidence. “Retail FOMO couldn’t reach it,” the pundit wrote . “U.S. buyers were locked out. Total price suppression.” However, he noted a brief glimmer of hope in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security when sold on exchanges to retail buyers. The price doubled overnight to $0.84, but the celebration was short-lived. The SEC filed an appeal, casting a fresh shadow of doubt and halting XRP’s momentum once again. When the SEC finally dropped the case in March 2025, XRP jumped to $2.49. But instead of a euphoric rally, the response was underwhelming. The broader market had moved on, and XRP’s reputation had taken a lasting hit. According to the pundit, the true cost for XRP hasn’t just been legal fees but the missed opportunities. He emphasized that Ripple had the potential to lead the way in blockchain-powered cross-border payments. Instead, years were squandered in courtroom battles while competitors surged ahead. He further argued that the biggest challenge facing XRP today isn’t the SEC. “XRP’s biggest problem now isn’t the SEC — it’s apathy,” he said, before offering a note of optimism. He believes that ETF applications, the upcoming launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, and a renewed focus on institutional partnerships could give XRP the foundation to rally alongside other crypto assets in the next bull market, especially now that much of its regulatory baggage is behind it.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-05 15:49:17

The project will initially be backed by $500M in gold reserves. During the 2025 Token2049, it was revealed that Kyrgyzstan will be launching a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar but backed by gold reserves of up to $500M. The Kyrgyzstan stablecoin will be backed by gold Kyrgyzstan is attempting to position itself as an innovator in the Central Asian digital finance market with the planned launch of its USDKG. The USDKG is a gold-backed stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. According to the project advisor, Gabriel Guerra, the Ministry of Finance will begin the project with $500M worth of gold in reserve and intends to grow that to $2B over time. The project aims to combine the reliability of gold with the accessibility of blockchain-powered finance. The Gold Dollar ( USDKG ) is set to debut in the third quarter of 2025, as revealed by Guerra at the Token2049 conference in Dubai. The launch of the USDKG is part of the Kyrgyz government’s plan to modernize the country’s financial infrastructure and improve international money movement, with the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance leading the plan. “This stablecoin will be used in cross-border transactions and international trade,” Guerra explained. He added that the initial rollout will target Central Asia before they explore expanding into Southeast Asia and the Middle East. 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP comes from remittances. A serviceable USDKG could ease overseas transfers if it offers a faster, cheaper, and more stable alternative to traditional remittance channels. Guerra emphasized the potential for USDKG to address the inefficiencies in cross-border transactions, which would help both individuals and businesses avoid the costly processes of current banking systems. Reserves will be overcollateralized Unlike some digital assets like Paxos Gold (PAXG) or Tether Gold (XAUT), which track the real-time price of gold, USDKG is not designed to mirror the fluctuations of the gold market. Rather than track the price of gold, the USDKG is backed by physical gold reserves and maintains a stable value through its direct tie to the U.S. dollar. This design helps to shield users from any volatility in gold’s price. By maintaining a 1:1 redemption ratio with the U.S dollar, the stablecoin will preserve purchasing power and reduce price fluctuations. To further secure the value of the stablecoin and build public confidence, the project will also be overcollateralized. This means that the value of gold held in reserve will exceed the amount of USDKG issued. This safety measure further protects users in case of sudden gold price dips. Additionally, the reserves will undergo independent audits, and transparency will be central to the stablecoin’s operations. Stablecoin holders can redeem their tokens for physical gold, other cryptocurrencies, or fiat currencies. This flexibility gives the USDKG a potential edge in both traditional finance and emerging crypto economies. Traders looking for an asset-backed by a trusted commodity with the ease of blockchain movement may find the USDKG especially appealing. Governments and institutions in regions where gold is culturally and economically valued, such as the Middle East, may find it easy to integrate the stablecoin into their economies. Also, Guerra did not rule out the USDKG stablecoin’s availability on centralized and decentralized exchanges, which would facilitate accessibility for institutional and retail investors.

With growing interest in these digital assets, questions arise about whether this signals a full-throttle bull market. This article delves into the factors making these coins prime candidates for significant growth in the evolving crypto landscape. Jupiter Coin Market Snapshot Amid Altcoin Season Jupiter has shown mixed performance recently, gaining 7.53% over the past month while suffering a substantial decline of 52.57% over the last six months. The weekly activity indicates pressure with a drop of 6.08%. Despite price swings, the coin has maintained a range that reflects a blend of cautious optimism and ongoing concerns among investors. Current resistance levels sit at $0.63 and $0.84, with support found at $0.22. Jupiter Coin is currently trading between $0.3441 and $0.552. The RSI, hovering around 49, suggests indecision in the market. However, slightly bearish signals from momentum and moving averages imply caution. Traders may want to wait for a clear breakout from these levels before making new trades. Hyperliquid's Bull Run and Key Levels in View Hyperliquid recorded a one-month surge of 73.90% and a six-month rise of 106.72%. The coin showed a strong weekly increase of 18.90% that confirms a pattern of rapid gains.

The current price sits between $12.83 and $23.67 with a near-term resistance at $27.33 and a second resistance at $38.17 while support holds at $5.64. Market indicators show an RSI of 64.33, an Awesome Oscillator at 4.09, and a Momentum Indicator at 2.29, favoring bullish moves. Traders might consider entering near support and watching for a break of resistance to capture potential gains. Conclusion The focus on Jupiter (JUP) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) suggests growing interest in new opportunities. Both coins exhibit strong potential due to their unique features and active communities. Their performance could indicate a strengthening market trend. Continued observation is essential to understand their long-term value. Investors might find these options intriguing for diversifying their portfolios. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Strategy has acquired 1,895 BTC for ~$180.3 million at ~$95,167 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 14.0% YTD 2025. As of 5/4/2025, we hodl 555,450 $BTC acquired for ~$38.08 billion at ~$68,550 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/dDl1csg0LX — Strategy (@Strategy) May 5, 2025 This acquisition, announced by the firm on Monday, was made at an average price of $95,167 per bitcoin. The latest purchase brings MicroStrategy’s total bitcoin holdings to about 555,450 BTC, acquired for an aggregate sum of $38.08 billion. This positions the company’s average cost basis at $68,550 per bitcoin. With bitcoin currently trading well above that figure, the company has realized a year-to-date (YTD) BTC yield of 14.0% as of May 4, 2025. MSTR is trading 3.9% lower on Monday following the announcement. This latest move is consistent with Saylor’s long-standing thesis that bitcoin is a superior store of value in comparison to traditional fiat currencies or commodities. Strategy Holds More BTC Than Any Other Publicly Traded Firm Despite market fluctuations, MicroStrategy has steadily accumulated bitcoin since its first purchase in 2020, transitioning its treasury reserve strategy into one centered around digital assets. The most recent acquisition, while modest compared to previous bulk purchases, reflects a pattern of tactical buying during periods of consolidation in the bitcoin market. By continuing to build its position, MicroStrategy appears to be reinforcing its commitment to bitcoin as a core corporate asset, even as broader institutional adoption evolves. Bitcoin’s strong performance in early 2025 has supported MicroStrategy’s strategy, with price appreciation driving gains both in market value and shareholder sentiment. The company’s bitcoin portfolio now substantially exceeds its initial investment, aligning with its thesis of bitcoin as a long-term inflation hedge and appreciating asset. While skeptics have long warned of the risks associated with such concentrated exposure to a volatile asset, MicroStrategy’s results to date show strong returns and have sparked conversations around how corporations might increasingly integrate digital assets into treasury management. Aggressive Accumulation and Capital Strategy Raise Criticism Behind Strategy’s stock performance lies a consistent and aggressive acquisition model that blends software revenue with capital market maneuvers. In April alone, Strategy acquired over $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin across two separate purchases. On April 28, the company disclosed a $1.42 billion purchase of 15,355 BTC at an average of $92,737 per bitcoin.

He highlighted a promising technical setup forming on the Shiba Inu price chart. As the Shiba Inu price prepares for another leg up, investors are re-entering the meme coin market with a new under-the-radar meme coin called FloppyPepe (FPPE) . This coin is quickly gaining attention as a high-utility, high-upside alternative that could deliver far greater returns. Shiba Inu Price May Double Soon, Analyst Highlights Key Setup Behind It Crypto analyst Charting Guy shared a technical analysis suggesting the Shiba Inu price may be preparing for a rally toward the $0.00003 level, potentially doubling its current value. After finding support just above $0.00001, the Shiba Inu price has steadily rebounded, reaching a local high of $0.00001510 before correcting to the $0.0000135 range. This analyst believes this Shiba Inu price pullback is part of a broader accumulation phase, forming a launchpad for the next major leg. With momentum building, a return to $0.00003 is firmly on the table for the Shiba Inu price. Why Investors Are Flocking To FloppyPepe (FPPE) For Massive Returns FloppyPepe (FPPE) is connected to Matt Furie’s legendary characters, linking it directly to a fundamental part of internet culture. Being part of the same universe as Pepe the Frog provides it with immediate recognition and an inherent meme credibility that most tokens can only aspire to. In addition to its meme origins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is driven by AI, the same technology behind the next phase of crypto evolution. Many investors look beyond the excitement this time, opting to invest in a project that offers genuine utility rather than just another typical meme coin. Early FloppyPepe (FPPE) Buyers Could Turn Pennies Into Millions, Here’s Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale pricing positions it within the same “pennies on the dollar” category that attracted investors to tokens like Solana and Bitcoin. With its low market cap, this meme coin presents an unparalleled potential for growth: a small investment of $100 now could lead to significant returns of at least $10,000 if the token gains even a small amount of mainstream interest. The zero-tax framework and token-locking systems safeguard early investors against abrupt sell-offs, while ongoing transparent updates and community involvement efforts help sustain trust. Meme Utility Reinvented: How FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Changing The Game FloppyPepe (FPPE) recently released its beta version, drawing interest from leading investors in its ongoing presale. These investors will have complete access to FloppyAI and Meme-o-matic , a decentralized AI platform designed for easy meme creation. The beta testing also features FloppyX , an AI-driven tool that automates video content production for marketing and community engagement. This AI tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret user prompts and transform them into popular memes. It also scans the web for global meme trends to guarantee that each creation remains culturally relevant. Security: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Passes Major Audit, Earning Investor Trust SolidProof, a leading smart contract and security agency, has thoroughly audited the FloppyPepe (FPPE) smart contract. The smart contract was found to be safe and free of vulnerabilities, boosting investor trust in the token’s growth. Notably, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is preparing for wider acceptance by integrating with the Binance Smart Chain and Polygon networks soon. These strategic initiatives will improve scalability, reduce transaction costs, and boost cross-chain interoperability, making the meme coin more globally accessible. Don’t Miss Out On This Groundbreaking Meme Coin Presale As the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale continues, many investors are increasingly focusing on the utility behind the meme token. Using the promo code “ FLOPPY80 ,” investors can receive an 80% bonus on their token purchase, meaning a $1,000 investment becomes $1,800 worth of tokens. At its current presale price of $0.0000002 , early investors in this token presale can enjoy an immense upside of up to 100x their investment once it officially launches. In light of its utility and potential, investors should accumulate their tokens before it is too late.

44196523,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720884,1746460800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44196523.jpeg,Q2 Could Be Huge for Low-Cap Tokens — And This One’s Already Building Long-Term Positioning,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/q2-could-be-huge-for-low-cap-tokens-and-this-ones-already-building-long-term-positioning/,"As Q2 unfolds, market sentiment around cryptocurrency is beginning to shift from speculation to strategy. While large-cap coins continue to draw headlines, seasoned investors are increasingly turning their attention to low-cap tokens with solid fundamentals and long-term potential. Among the names quietly gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi-focused protocol that’s been actively laying the groundwork for sustainable participation, not just short-term gains. Still in presale at just $0.025, MUTM represents the kind of entry point that long-term crypto investors look for when building early positions. Unlike projects that chase quick hype or rely on unsustainable token mechanics, Mutuum is setting itself apart by offering real financial utility through decentralized lending and borrowing — two services that remain at the heart of modern decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What makes Mutuum Finance a standout in the current world isn’t just its price — it’s the underlying mechanics that support user engagement and protocol sustainability. From the start, the team has prioritized a non-custodial model. This means users can interact directly with smart contracts, without surrendering access to their funds. At the core of Mutuum’s model are two familiar functions: borrowing and lending, both executed through audited, transparent smart contracts. Let’s break down how that works for users. When you deposit a supported cryptocurrency into the protocol, you’re not just parking it in an idle wallet. Your assets are added to a shared liquidity pool, and in return, you receive mtTokens — ERC-20 tokens that represent your contribution. These tokens are dynamic: they not only reflect your share of the pool but also automatically accumulate value over time as interest flows from borrowers. This setup allows users to earn passive income while maintaining full flexibility. You can redeem your mtTokens at any time, provided there’s available liquidity, and your earnings adjust in real time as market usage fluctuates. It’s a smooth, transparent system designed for both everyday DeFi users and larger participants who want to generate yield without exposing themselves to unnecessary complexity. On the borrowing side, Mutuum Finance is equally strategic. Instead of selling off assets to access capital — which can create unwanted tax implications or eliminate future upside — users can borrow against their holdings. The platform uses overcollateralization to ensure solvency. For instance, someone holding $10,000 worth of ETH might borrow $6,000 in stablecoins while keeping exposure to ETH’s price movement. That flexibility is invaluable. It allows for short-term liquidity without long-term sacrifice. Traders can hedge, investors can reinvest, and all without giving up control of their portfolio. This crypto investment model empowers users to make smart moves based on real needs rather than forced liquidation. What makes it even more compelling is that interest paid by borrowers doesn’t vanish into a black hole. It feeds directly back into the protocol, creating a circular economy that benefits depositors and reinforces long-term value creation. Mutuum Finance is already demonstrating growing confidence from its community of early supporters. With more than 9,300 holders, over 440 million tokens sold, and $7.5 million raised, the protocol is gathering real traction even before going live. These aren’t inflated metrics — they reflect organic growth and early support from participants who see more than just a short-term flip. The launch price of $0.06 is already confirmed, meaning current presale participants are securing a position at less than half of what the token will list for. That’s a built-in 2.4x opportunity, before considering any post-launch movement. And with the next phase price rising to $0.03, time is a major factor for anyone still sitting on the fence. The protocol’s long-term appeal is further reinforced by its upcoming stablecoin, which will be minted from overcollateralized positions. Unlike centralized options, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be backed entirely by on-chain collateral, offering full transparency. The interest generated through its use will flow directly into the protocol’s treasury, reinforcing the platform’s revenue base and overall sustainability. In addition, the team is undergoing a CertiK audit, which enhances trust and reinforces the project’s commitment to building secure, verifiable smart contract systems. It’s the kind of move serious investors look for when evaluating what crypto to invest in — particularly during volatile cycles. Q2 may prove decisive for low-cap tokens, and Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to be one of the standouts. The combination of real use cases, structured tokenomics, and product readiness makes MUTM a compelling entry at just $0.025. For investors scanning the market for the best crypto to buy now, this project checks every box — and as adoption ramps up, today’s entry could become tomorrow’s milestone. With fundamentals in place and momentum already growing, Mutuum Finance isn’t just another presale — it’s a strategic move into DeFi’s next evolution.

Experts Predict $1.00 Price in 2025 and 11,900% Growth During Altcoin Season",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-surpass-ripple-xrp-experts-predict-1-00-price-in-2025-and-11900-growth-during-altcoin-season/,"XRP, the leader in blockchain technology and payment systems, has set the bar for innovation and decentralization. Ruvi AI takes that and merges the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to solve a wider range of industry challenges around the world. What Makes Ruvi AI Different? Ruvi AI uses the strengths of both blockchain and AI to offer solutions that are not only innovative but practical. Its blockchain infrastructure ensures transactions are secure and transparent, while its AI tools analyze data to give you actionable insights. Whether it’s detecting fraud in financial systems, predicting logistical risks or streamlining supply chain operations, Ruvi AI’s dual technology approach helps industries be more efficient and accurate. Designed for user accessibility, Ruvi AI’s tools are intuitive and adaptable for businesses of all sizes. Rather than focusing on theoretical use cases, Ruvi AI focuses on real world applications, bridging the gap between technology and solutions. That makes it a unique player in the blockchain space. Presale Record Breaker Ruvi AI’s presale has already made it one of the most promising projects in the blockchain space. Selling over 10 million tokens and raising over $100,000 in the first few days of the presale, it’s clear investors are excited and confident in Ruvi AI. Ruvi tokens are available in Phase 1 at $0.01 per token. That’s an incredibly low entry price. But token prices will increase by 50% in Phase 2 to $0.015. Ruvi AI launched the beta version of the platform shortly after the presale started. The beta shows off Ruvi AI’s AI powered analytics and blockchain backed transparency. Users can get an early look at the platform’s capabilities. That’s a big deal. VIP Tiers with High Rewards To sweeten the deal, Ruvi AI has a VIP tier program with each tier offering significant rewards based on the level of participation. Two stand out tiers are VIP Tier 3 and VIP Tier 5. VIP Tier 3 VIP Tier 3 is perfect for mid-level investors looking for decent rewards without a high entry requirement. To qualify for this tier, you need to accumulate at least 100,000 RUVI tokens. If you buy during Phase 1, that’s $1,000 at $0.01 per token. VIP Tier 3 investors get a 60% bonus, which adds 60,000 tokens to their holdings. That’s 160,000 RUVI tokens. At Ruvi AI’s listing price of $0.07, that’s $11,200. When the $1 target is reached, that’s $160,000. This is a great opportunity for growth. VIP Tier 5 For high-level investors looking for maximum rewards, VIP Tier 5 is the gold standard. This tier requires a 500,000 RUVI token threshold, which is $5,000 during Phase 1 at $0.01 per token. What makes VIP Tier 5 so attractive is the 100% bonus. That doubles their holdings. That’s 1,000,000 RUVI tokens. At the $0.07 listing price, that’s $70,000 and at the $1 target, that’s $1,000,000. VIP Tier 5 is a chance to get life changing returns for those who can invest more. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Contributors Ruvi AI goes beyond traditional rewards with its Leaderboard program to recognize and reward the most loyal supporters. This allocates token rewards to those who contribute the most during the presale. For example, the Top 10 contributors get 500,000 RUVI tokens. That’s $35,000 at the listing price and $500,000 when RUVI hits $1. The Top 50 contributors get 250,000 RUVI tokens. That’s $17,500 at the listing price and $250,000 when RUVI hits $1. By rewarding enthusiastic participation, Ruvi AI makes sure its success is shared with those who believe in the project Blockchain and AI Evolution Ruvi AI is not just another blockchain project; it’s a game changer. Its combination of blockchain’s secure and decentralized infrastructure with AI’s analytical power makes it a platform that can solve real world problems across industries.

Investors are not relenting in their search for the next top crypto and they believe there is an undervalued altcoin still in its presale stage that can leapfrog LTC, SUI, and AVAX to enter the top 10, attracting the interest of both seasoned investors and newcomers. Let’s dive in. Litecoin: ETF Hopes and Price Recovery on the Horizon The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation as Litecoin ($LTC) emerges as a strong contender for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by 2025. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has estimated a high probability alongside Solana ($SOL), as shared on May 3, 2025. This comes on the back of Bloomberg updating its list of most probable Spot ETF listings for 2025 that sees Solana and Litecoin topping the charts. LTC is currently at $86.62 today , having gained a modest 2.5% in the past month. Analysts are guardedly optimistic, predicting that if LTC can hold above $81.40 support and break resistance at $88.55, it could rally to the $100 mark by the end of June. Haedal Launches On SUI Network To Huge Success; Expansion Fuels Bullish Optimism For SUI Sui (SUI) has quickly emerged as a top-20 market-cap cryptocurrency, with eye-watering transaction volumes that dwarf even Ethereum and Tron. As of today, SUI is trading at $3.31, up 45% on the month and with a healthy market cap of $11.08 billion. Haedal, a leading liquid staking protocol , has successfully launched on the SUI network, earning widespread acclaim for its innovative tokenomics and seamless integration, as announced on April 29, 2025, via Medium. With its Token Generation Event (TGE) reaching 99.99% completion and a massive Haedal airdrop engaging nearly 1 million SUI users , Haedal’s dynamic validator selection and high-yield staking products like haSUI and haWAL are driving significant adoption. Trading volume on Haedal’s AMM has surpassed $700 million, fueling optimism for SUI’s DeFi growth, with analysts predicting a potential 5x surge for the HAEDAL token by Q4 2025 as partnerships with Cetus and Scallop expand its ecosystem. Additionally, SUI’s new data model and secure Move programming language have attracted fierce developer interest. Optimistic analysts at Coincodex think SUI can surge to over $11 by August making SUI a front-runner in the next generation of blockchain innovation Avalanche Card Launch Revolutionizes Crypto Spending with Global Reach Avalanche (AVAX) is still an attraction as a high-performance smart contract platform having seen tremendous volatility as market forces changed. In ecosystem news though, Avalanche achieved a major milestone in real-world crypto adoption as it launched Avalanche Card, now available to everyone without a waitlist since May 3, 2025. Supported by Rain Cards and riding the fast blockchain of Avalanche, the card, either digital or physical, enables easy spending of AVAX, USDC, USDT, and wAVAX wherever Visa is accepted. With AVAX currently trading at $20.16 and 11% up MoM , investors are watching closely for signs of renewed bullish momentum as competition intensifies among next-generation blockchains. Analysts predictions are that AVAX may rise to $30 at the end of the year if technicals remain bullish. Remittix: The Next-Generation Altcoin on the Verge of Redefining the Top 10 Remittix (RTX) is rapidly becoming a game-changing altcoin to disrupt the cryptocurrency market and reach the top 10 charts by 2025. With the use of a high-throughput Layer-1 blockchain in Ethereum, Remittix introduces its revolutionary PayFi protocol supporting instant and low-value crypto-to-fiat transactions to target the $190 trillion global remittance market in 150+ countries. Its staking system is equally compelling, offering up to 8% APY for regular users and 18% for VIP members fostering long-term investment. The ongoing presale has already raised over $14.74 million and sold more than 532 million tokens, positioning Remittix as one of the most talked-about projects in 2025. At a current presale price of just $0.0757, early investors are jumping at the chance to join a movement that combines high utility, security , and transparent development. With fast-growing traction, transparent tokenomics, and strategic backing, it’s now being seen as a viable contender to challenge legacy coins like Litecoin, and other newer tokens like SUI and AVAX. Analysts predict RTX’s blend of utility, scalability, and community strength could propel it into the top 10 cryptocurrencies when listing occurs. Don’t get left out!

It’s a major moment for the project and another sign that institutional investors are starting to take layer-1 crypto infrastructure more seriously. However, a growing segment of the market is shifting its focus toward more agile, community-driven projects, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is leading the charge. SUI Makes Headlines With New 21Shares ETF Filing Sui (SUI) entered the spotlight this week after 21Shares filed for the first US-based ETF linked to the SUI price. The 21Shares ETF application, submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aims to give institutional investors exposure to the SUI price without requiring direct token ownership — a move widely interpreted as a step toward mainstream legitimacy. The announcement of the 21Shares SUI ETF filing had an immediate effect on the SUI price, which surged by more than 10% in a single day. Market analysts pointed to increased trading volume and renewed interest in Layer-1 networks as signs that institutional momentum may be building. However, it’s important to note that the 21Shares ETF is still awaiting approval, and no launch date has been confirmed. This move places Sui (SUI) alongside other major crypto projects that have recently drawn increased attention due to ETF filings. But while the 21Shares ETF filing reflects growing institutional curiosity for the token, many in the crypto market are asking: By the time an ETF hits the market, how much opportunity is left for investors? What Sets FloppyPepe (FPPE) Apart? While Mysten Labs aims to improve the SUI price by making it a platform for serious institutional infrastructure, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is thriving in the exact opposite lane. This AI-powered meme coin is rewriting the rulebook on what early-stage tokens can look like when utility meets community. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is anchored by two live AI tools that serve a clear purpose: giving users the power to generate and control the project’s visibility. First is FloppyAI — a meme generator that lets users create fast, platform-ready memes tied to market trends or crypto culture moments. Whether it’s a jab at market conditions or a nod to the latest token pump, FloppyAI makes it easy to keep the project’s name in the feed. Then there’s FloppyX , a short-form video creation tool powered by AI agents that can be customized, styled, and turned into crypto-relevant content in minutes. At a time when TikTok clips and X videos dominate attention spans, FloppyX gives the FloppyPepe (FPPE) community exactly what they need to compete — and win — in the attention economy. Floppynomics That Produces Real Value Beyond the AI-driven content engine, FloppyPepe (FPPE) also comes with a smart set of token mechanics that reward holders and reduce supply over time. Every transaction burns a small portion of tokens, creating constant supply pressure. Another slice is redistributed to existing holders, encouraging long-term commitment. This has structured FloppyPepe (FPPE) for sustainability in a space where many tokens dump after listing. The presale price is set at $0.0000002 , and early buyers are getting in before the next pricing tier kicks in. Also, the token has already been audited by SolidProof, adding another layer of trust to a project that’s already outperforming expectations. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Attracting SUI Price Watchers The buzz around the SUI price and its 21Shares ETF filing has pulled new attention into the market , especially from those who missed its early price action. But as analysts point out, most ETF-driven moves are late-stage. They may offer stability, but not necessarily scale. That’s where FloppyPepe (FPPE) comes in. It’s giving early adopters a rare window to join a project that hasn’t peaked yet. With tools already active, a clear roadmap, and a token model designed to reward participation, this AI meme coin is doing what few meme coins can: building something that lasts.

Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Arbitrum Could Be the Answer",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-2700-turn-10x-ethereum-xrp-solana-and-arbitrum-could-be-the-answer/,"As the second quarter of 2025 unfolds, investors are zeroing in on altcoins showing both technical strength and forward-looking fundamentals. Ethereum (ETH) , XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Arbitrum (ARB) are standing out with strong signals. But for those scouting early-stage potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming one of the cycle’s most talked-about names. MAGACOINFINANCE – Quietly Emerging as a Strategic Standout In contrast to headline-driven tokens, MAGACOINFINANCE is growing with intent. Its appeal stems from a focused brand, committed community, and structured rollout strategy. More than $7.8 million has already been raised, and investor sentiment continues to trend higher. What’s different here is the timing. With a capped supply, message-driven momentum, and real presence across Telegram and X, MAGACOINFINANCE offers rare early exposure ahead of broader listings. The 50% bonus (code: MAGA50X ) is still active, but not for long. Ethereum and XRP Remain Core Anchors for Long-Term Confidence Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,736 , buoyed by whale accumulation and increased utility in AI-driven ecosystems. Analysts point to a near-term move toward $2,700 , supported by rising transaction volume and renewed institutional interest. Its Layer-1 dominance remains undisputed as May’s momentum builds. XRP , currently around $2.15 , continues to attract attention thanks to the launch of ProShares’ XRP futures ETF. Technicals suggest a potential breakout past $2.45 , with institutional inflows expected to follow. Regulatory clarity and infrastructure adoption are reinforcing XRP’s leadership role. Solana and Arbitrum Offer Strong Technical Setups Solana (SOL) is trading in the $145–$150 range and riding a wave of renewed optimism after its Canadian ETF approval. With growing institutional interest and healthy on-chain activity, traders are watching for a breakout past $180 , which could trigger a path toward $220+ this quarter. Arbitrum (ARB) remains stable near $0.35 after recent volatility. While it exited Nvidia’s accelerator program, its Layer-2 credentials on Ethereum remain intact. If ETH rallies further, ARB could retest the upper $0.40s , especially with L2 scaling back in the spotlight. Final Thoughts With Ethereum , XRP , Solana , and Arbitrum delivering strong foundations and momentum, portfolios are being built with confidence. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that may provide the real asymmetric upside this cycle. As the broader market chases familiar names, early movers are positioning for what could be one of 2025’s biggest surprises.

The main aim of the upgrade is to improve the transaction speed on the network and enhance the scalability and validator’s operations. Many expect a rise in the volatility around the upgrade that may ultimately push the ETH price beyond the bearish captivity. The price of Ethereum has remained stagnant for more than a fortnight, and despite this, the holders do not appear to have backed down. The accumulating addresses are up by 22.5% since March, and the exchange netflow remains negative, as both whales and retailers are withdrawing. Besides, the stock-to-flow ratio has hit a yearly high of 374, indicating that the ETH scarcity is increasing. On the other hand, the whale activity has risen suddenly as a dormant whale woke up after 4 years and withdrew over 1200 ETH, and the total whale accumulation has smashed new highs. Source: X The whales are buying ETH like never before, just ahead of the major upgrade. This suggests they are extremely bullish on the ETH price. On the other hand, the ETB/BTC pair has reached a yearly support level, coinciding with January 2020 lows, with the RSI deeply oversold. This suggests the token is ready to trigger a strong reversal, which may also change the fate of the other altcoins as well. Will the ETH Price Reclaim $2200 This Week? The ETH price broke out of the descending triangle in April and quickly entered an ascending one. Currently, the price remains stuck around $1800 after pulling back from the local highs at $1842. As the support has been tested in the short term at around $1785, the growth trajectory appears to have become more prominent. The weekly chart of ETH price suggests the second-largest token could be subjected to a prolonged consolidation between a pre-determined range of $2500 and $1500. Mainly because the weekly Gaussian channel has just turned bearish. Previously, when this occurred, the price remained accumulated within a range and triggered a breakout only when the price surged above the average bands. On the other hand, the weekly RSI has hit the lower threshold, which occurred during the 2022 lows. Therefore, a rebound could elevate the levels towards new highs.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 16:02:44

By 2028, the minimum WLD price might drop to $3.69 while its maximum can reach $4.39 The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $7.18 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the wld prediction . In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $0.9632 Market Cap $1.27B Trading Volume $143.11M Circulating Supply 1.32B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 Sep 13, 2023 24-hour High $1.02 24-hour Low $0.9494 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 3.13 (226.35%) Volatility 20.11% 50-Day SMA $ 0.856272 14-Day RSI 60.07 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 17/30 (57%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD sees modest recovery amid market fluctuations Resistance at $0.9581. Limits Upside Price recovery stalled below $0.9581, holding back further gains. Support at $0.9175 Shows Accumulation. Buyers continue to defend $0.9175, but the broader trend remains weak. 4-Hour Chart Hints at Reversal A double-bottom pattern suggests bullish potential if $0.9581 breaks. Worldcoin (WLD) on 5th May 2025 is priced at $0.9506, reflecting a slight 0.08% increase over the last 24 hours. The token saw price fluctuations between a low of $0.9175 and a high of $0.9581, showing both buying and selling pressure throughout the day. The WLD token, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain, remains significantly below its all-time high of $11.82 recorded on July 24, 2023. Activity picked up early on May 5 after a decline in the previous night’s session. The rebound from the intraday low led to a strong rally, briefly pushing the price to $0.9581, where resistance was encountered. Momentum has since slowed, with price action consolidating just below the peak. This indicates a temporary stalling in bullish momentum, as traders wait for more decisive signals. Worldcoin daily chart: Recovery attempts within a bearish context as key resistance holds The daily chart for WLD presents a cautious recovery structure within a broader bearish trend. Price action showed early weakness but formed higher intraday lows throughout the session, leading to a strong upward move that peaked at $0.9581. Despite the upward reaction, the move has failed to break above the overhead resistance, keeping the broader trend neutral to bearish. The price now consolidates near $0.950, which lies in the mid-range of the day’s swing. Recovery attempts within a bearish context as key resistance holds Support at $0.9175 remains intact after being tested multiple times, indicating accumulation at lower levels. Resistance at $0.9581 has emerged as the critical level to watch. A confirmed close above this threshold could pave the way toward the psychological barrier at $1.00. RSI bounces from near-oversold conditions, reflecting fresh buying interest, but momentum indicators remain mixed. Daily volume surged during the recovery phase, confirming the strength of demand at lower prices, but a lack of follow-through raises the risk of a pullback if resistance holds. Worldcoin 4-hour chart: Double-bottom rebound faces key resistance at $0.9581 After a sharp correction during the overnight session, the 4-hour timeframe reveals a clear rebound structure. A W-shaped double-bottom pattern is evident, with the price bouncing strongly after hitting a low of $0.9175. This structure indicates a potential trend reversal, backed by a rise in short-term bullish sentiment. The upward move halted at $0.9581, which has now become the level to break for continued bullish momentum. Double-bottom rebound faces key resistance at $0.9581 Short-term support is around $0.940, whereas buyers previously stepped in during the consolidation phase. If WLD maintains its position above this level, another test of $0.9581 is likely. Failure to break higher could see the price revert to the $0.925–$0.930 range. MACD on this timeframe is flattening, suggesting weakening momentum unless buyers regain strength quickly. A bullish breakout above $0.9581 with volume would validate a short-term uptrend and could open the door to $0.98–$1.00 targets. What to expect from Worldcoin? Worldcoin (WLD) shows short-term rebound potential but remains below key resistance at $0.9581, with the broader trend still bearish. Support at $0.9175 suggests accumulation, but momentum remains weak without a breakout. WLD trades far below its all-time high of $11.82, and price action is mostly speculative. A move above $0.9581 could target $0.98–$1.00, but without that, upside remains limited. While short-term traders may find opportunities, long-term investment remains high-risk until stronger fundamentals and sustained demand emerge.

Worldcoin (WLD) may appeal to long-term investors who believe in its digital identity vision, but its current technical outlook is bearish. Price is trading near key support and showing no signs of reversal. The project faces ongoing regulatory and adoption challenges, and short-term sentiment remains weak. Given high volatility and downward momentum, WLD is a high-risk investment at this stage, and caution is advised unless clear recovery signals emerge. Why is WLD Price up today Worldcoin (WLD) is up slightly on May 5, 2025, due to a short-term rebound driven by renewed buying interest after the price found support at $0.9175. This support level has held firm through multiple tests, suggesting accumulation by buyers at lower levels. The bounce created a double-bottom pattern on the 4-hour chart, signaling potential for a trend reversal. Increased volume during the recovery phase confirms strong demand, helping push the price toward resistance at $0.9581, although the broader trend remains bearish. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, requiring substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025 Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin’s average value is predicted to be $0.86, with the potential to reach a high of $2.11 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a good long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider to invest in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Three clear technical factors suggest a local top may be forming, with a short-term pullback increasingly likely. Over the weekend, Bitcoin’s price action began to stall after a strong move up over the past couple of weeks. The rejection isn’t happening randomly, it’s occurring at a level packed with technical resistance. If this area continues to hold as a ceiling, it may confirm a local top for now, potentially triggering a correction back to lower levels. Here’s what to watch as the new week begins. Key technical points Channel High Resistance: Price has been rejected right at the top of a long-standing trend channel Point of Control: A high-volume node from the November 2024 range is acting as resistance Bearish Shark Pattern: A harmonic setup has now activated, hinting at a potential trend reversal Bitcoin USDT (4H) Chart Source: TradingView Detailed breakdown Bitcoin has spent the past week climbing steadily, but that momentum hit a wall at the upper boundary of a trend channel that’s been in place since late 2024. These levels often act as natural turning points, and this rejection could signal that the uptrend is losing steam. In addition to the channel, Bitcoin is also reacting to the Point of Control from a major range dating back to November 2024. The POC represents the price where the most volume has traded and tends to be a battleground for bulls and bears. Right now, sellers are showing strength at this level. You might also like: Israeli-Russian man faces extradition to US over $190m Nomad crypto hack Lastly, a bearish Shark harmonic pattern has completed at this resistance zone. Harmonic patterns like the Shark are based on Fibonacci symmetry and are known to signal market turning points. While the pattern has activated, full confirmation would come with a breakdown below the recent swing low at $91,648, a level that remains intact for now. If that low is breached on strong volume, it could trigger a cascade of stop-losses and initiate a deeper correction, possibly targeting the $86,000 range. This would align with the nature of Bitcoin’s recent climb of fast and steep which has left limited structural support beneath. What to expect in the coming price action Until key support levels break, the pullback may remain a healthy pause. But if $91,600 is lost, it could mark the beginning of a deeper correction phase. The short-term bias leans bearish as long as Bitcoin holds below resistance. Bulls will need to reclaim the upper zone quickly to regain control of the trend.

However, BTC could not continue this rise and fell to $94,000 and encountered resistance at $98,000. Evaluating the latest situation in Bitcoin, Glassnode said that Bitcoin is on its way to an increase of $ 100,000, but the $ 95,000 support must be maintained and the $ 98,000 resistance must be successfully overcome. Bitcoin (BTC) Is at a Crucial Decision Point! Glassnode said that Bitcoin has failed to clear the $98,000 resistance and profit-taking is limiting the upward momentum. At this point, Glassnode analysts noted that for a potential rally to $100,000, Bitcoin would need to hold the $95,000 support and close above $98,000 on the daily chart. According to Glassnode data, analysts stated that 86% of the Bitcoin supply is in profit, and said that these high rates generally indicate a bullish period. However, it also shows potential risks, as historical data shows increased profit taking, especially by short-term investors, when the supply at profit exceeds 80-90%, which can lead to corrections. Analysts emphasized that Bitcoin is at a key decision point and that closes and price movements above $98,000 are necessary for the continuation of the rise. In turn, analysts also reminded that failure to maintain the $95,000 support in Bitcoin could lead to a retest of lower levels between $85,000 and $75,000. A drop to $75,000 would wipe out all gains from the 90-day tariff pause. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) On Its Way to $100,000!
