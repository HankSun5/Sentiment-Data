However, the largest cryptocurrency market seems to have witnessed a significant shift, with prices now less responsive to changes in on-chain activity. For instance, the Bitcoin price continues to hold above $95,000 and looks set to reclaim the $100,000 level despite the sustained dip in blockchain activity. An on-chain analytics firm has weighed in on how and why this is possible for the flagship cryptocurrency. Why BTC Price Is Less Correlated To On-Chain Activity Crypto analytics platform Alphractal shared in a new post on X the major reasons why the Bitcoin price has managed to stay afloat despite transaction volume and active addresses being at low levels. According to the firm, BTC’s price rise doesn’t necessarily correlate to increased blockchain usage. Firstly, Alphractal acknowledged that the Bitcoin market experienced a dynamic shift when the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved in January 2024. The value of BTC is now being driven by capital inflows through these financial products rather than blockchain activity. The on-chain firm also mentioned that the historically low volatility in the market has had a major part to play in the low Bitcoin network activity. With relatively little price movement, traders are less incentivized to take new positions, leading to lower on-chain activity. Additionally, Alphractal mentioned that the Bitcoin price has been kept afloat largely by the activities of speculative traders through derivatives and other financial instruments. As a result, there has been a reduced everyday adoption and limited practical demand for the Bitcoin network. Alphractal also alluded to the macroeconomic uncertainty that has clouded the global financial markets in recent weeks. According to the on-chain analytics firm, this market condition, even though improving, has most investors waiting for clearer bullish signals before making any move. Finally, Alphractal highlighted artificial exchange volumes amongst the main reasons for the Bitcoin price staying afloat . “Some exchange volume may be inflated, creating a misleading sense of activity while real network usage stays modest,” the on-chain platform added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,150, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the choppy price action this weekend, the premier cryptocurrency is still up by nearly 2% on the weekly timeframe, according to data from CoinGecko.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Network|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-04 21:30:22

According to Wedson, movement has begun in the altcoin market and this trend may accelerate further in the coming months. Wedson defined June and July as the starting point of the altcoin season, and evaluated this period as the process of “exit from the accumulation zone.” The CEO, who predicted that interest in altcoins would peak in August and September, described this period as a phase in which Memecoin, GameFi and DeFi projects would shine. Expecting the Bitcoin dominance to fall rapidly, Wedson claimed that the altcoin rally would continue.

Stating that Bitcoin is not preferred for daily transactions due to its technical limitations, the CEO used the following statements: “Today, the vast majority of crypto transactions occur over networks like Ethereum, Tron, and BSC. The Bitcoin blockchain is now used very little for direct transactions, and the rate has been declining since 2022.” *This is not investment advice.

This marks a 27.3% increase compared to the $72.6 million reported last year in the same month. Compared to previous months in 2025, the figure more than doubled from March’s total of $41.4 million. Losses Surpass 2024’s Full-Year Total According to the latest report from the blockchain security platform Immunefi, the year-to-date total stands at $1.74 billion. This is already higher than the full-year total of $1.49 billion in 2024, which was previously considered the worst hit year in crypto-related hacks. Further, the survey highlighted that the figure represents a fourfold increase from the $420 million recorded during the same period last year. Most of April’s setbacks came from just two incidents; blockchain payments platform UPCX suffered the largest single hit, losing $70.0 million, while decentralized exchange KiloEx followed with $7.5 million in losses. Other affected platforms included Loopscale ($5.8 million), ZKsync ($5.0 million), and Term Labs ($1.5 million). Additional cases were recorded across Bitcoin Mission ($1.3 million), The Roar ($790,000), Impermax ($152,200), Zora ($140,800), and ACB ($84,100). Hacks continue to be the predominant cause of losses as opposed to fraud, with 100% of the attacks being exploits. Notably, no incident recorded in April targeted centralized platforms. The affected players were exclusively from the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most targeted blockchain networks, together accounting for 60% of the total. The former recorded five incidents, representing 33.3% of the total, while the latter followed with four, or 26.7%. Base experienced three incidents (20%), while Arbitrum, Solana, Sonic, and ZKsync each recorded one. More 2025 Exploits Outside of April, the crypto industry has been heavily hit in the first quarter of 2025, with the Bybit hack standing out as the largest. In this incident, bad actors took advantage of a vulnerability in the exchange’s hot wallet infrastructure, executing multiple transactions to steal $1.46 billion. Infini was also targeted , with the attackers making away with $50 million after they manipulated vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The exploit caused major disruptions, leaving users unable to access their funds for several days. Meanwhile, DeFi lending platform zkLend fell victim to a $9.5 million flash loan attack that drained its liquidity pools. Ionic also experienced an $8.5 million loss after exploiters compromised a private key, gaining unauthorized access to wallets and transferring funds externally.

Part of the development deal includes plans for an 830,000-square-meter facility used to house and host blockchain, crypto, and Web3 firms. Maldives sits between Africa, Asia, and Australia.

The project's total funding will exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Maldives, which is around $7 billion annually. Pro-crypto Democrats pull support for stablecoin bill in last minute A group of US Senate Democrats known for supporting the crypto industry have said they would oppose a Republican-led stablecoin bill if it moves forward in its current form. The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico. Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made. Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.

This surge in accumulation has caught the eye of many in the crypto community. Could this lead to a strong upward trend for these coins? Find out which cryptocurrencies might be on the brink of notable growth and what this could mean for the market. Cardano: Surge Over Six Months with Recent One-Month Correction Cardano experienced a decline of 0.71% in the past week but has grown by 7.67% in the last month and risen by 115.33% over the past six months. The price data reflects a trend of steady growth, with short-term fluctuations indicating that the coin has gained significant momentum. Despite this impressive performance, recent trends show a mild correction, creating a potential shift in market sentiment. Currently, the coin trades between $0.547 and $0.781, with resistance around $0.88 and a further level at $1.11. Support levels are identified at 0.41 dollars and a lower level near $0.18. The indicators suggest a lack of a clear trend, with bulls attempting to break above $0.88 while bears may look to test the $0.41 support for short-term opportunities. Polkadot Price Momentum Hits Key Levels Amid Market Adjustments DOT experienced a modest 1.23% decline over the past month with a sharper weekly dip near 5.87%. A 6.65% gain over the last six months signals underlying strength. Price action has ranged between $3.41 and $4.54, reflecting a mix of corrections and gradual build-up over time. Current levels place immediate support at $2.77 and resistance at $5.03, with further limits at $1.64 and $6.16. The coin shows neither a clear bullish nor bearish trend, as indicators signal a mix. Traders may find opportunities by watching these critical levels for a reversal or continuation pattern, especially with expectations for broader altcoin season enthusiasm. Conclusion Recent movements in the crypto market show increased accumulation of ADA and DOT by large holders. This often indicates strong confidence from major investors. Such behavior has historically preceded significant price rises for these coins. If past trends are any guide, ADA and DOT may be on the verge of entering a bullish phase. This could present a notable opportunity for those tracking market dynamics and looking for broader growth signals. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While giants like Cardano (ADA), Floki (FLOKI), and Toncoin (TON) have carved their niches, all eyes are on an underdog that’s performing well, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.025, MUTM is rapidly gaining traction, and experts predict a jaw-dropping 60x upside as it disrupts the DeFi market. Its decentralized lending platform is already turning heads, attracting over 9,400 investors and raising more than $7.5 million in its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token is set to climb to $0.03 in Phase 5, a 20% increase, before its projected launch at $0.06. For Phase 4 participants, that could mean a 140% return on investment. Cardano, Floki, and Toncoin: Strong Coins for Crypto Growth in 2025 Cardano (ADA), sitting at around $0.69, remains the long-term investor’s favorite as far as scalability and sustainability are concerned in blockchain technology. As a focus on smart contracts and decentralized applications, ADA has an incredibly solid groundwork that continues to make it center stage, especially with upcoming improvements. Floki (FLOKI), however, sitting at a paltry $0.000084, has been rapidly developing a passionate following, all due to its highly community-centric approach and ever-growing ecosystem. Its meme-based origins combined with novel utility projects cause it to possess vast growth potential. Lastly, Toncoin (TON) at $3.19 is also cementing itself as one of the leading decentralized networks with great speed and scalability. As all these projects toil towards milestone milestones, their growth trends in 2025 are optimistic. But of course, they all have great futures, and investors need to keep an eye out for future alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is going to cause a stir in the next couple of months. Presale Momentum Builds in Phase 4 The excitement around Mutuum Finance keeps building as its presale gains traction. Selling at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token has already attracted strong interest from more than 9,400 participants and continues to pull in capital, crossing the $7.5 million mark. With the next phase set to raise the token price by 20%, early investors are positioning themselves for significant gains. To further boost user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently rolled out a new dashboard that features a live leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those ranked in the top 50 will be eligible for bonus tokens, adding a gamified twist that not only incentivizes holding but also builds community loyalty and long-term participation. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is breaking new ground in decentralized lending by combining the benefits of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models into a single, powerful hybrid framework. In the P2C model, users can earn passive income by staking stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-managed liquidity pools, while also enabling fast, permissionless borrowing for others. On the other side, the P2P option eliminates intermediaries altogether, letting borrowers and lenders negotiate directly and privately. This dual-model setup brings a higher level of decentralization, flexibility, and efficiency. Whether you’re a cautious investor looking for predictable returns or someone seeking more control and yield, Mutuum Finance offers a tailored solution that meets both ends of the risk spectrum. It’s a DeFi platform built for inclusivity and autonomy, two pillars the current financial system often lacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set for 60x upside, currently priced at $0.025. With $7.5 million raised from 9,400+ investors, the token is set to rise to $0.03 in phase 5 and $0.06 at launch, offering 140% ROI for early investors. While ADA, FLOKI, and TON have growth potential, Mutuum’s unique hybrid lending model and gamified incentives make it a standout. Get in now before it’s too late.

However, the altcoin failed to end the month in profit, making April its fourth consecutive month with a negative performance. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum price seems to be sitting above a crucial support level, which could determine the altcoin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. ETH Price At Risk Of Falling To $1,772 In a May 3 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the price of Ethereum might be at a critical juncture that could decide its short-term future. Based on the latest on-chain data, the altcoin is at risk of falling to around $1,500 should it lose this support level in the coming days. This on-chain evaluation of the Ethereum price revolves around the average cost bases of several Ethereum investors. In crypto trading, cost-basis analysis determines a price level’s capacity to serve as support or resistance based on the volume of coins last acquired by investors in the region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally As shown in the above chart, the size of the dot (green and red) represents and directly corresponds to the number of Ether tokens bought within a price region. The larger the circle, the higher the amount of tokens bought in and around the price zone, and the stronger the resistance or support level. According to data from IntoTheBlock, more than 6.36 million ETH tokens were purchased by 4.5 million addresses within the price range of $1,772 and $1,824 (at an average price of $1,799). As explained earlier, the high buying activity within this price zone has led to the formation of a major support level just beneath the current price. The Ethereum price is expected to bounce back when it falls to this level. The rationale behind this expectation is that when the ETH price returns to around $1,772, investors with their cost bases in and around this level are likely to defend their positions by buying more tokens, helping the price to stay afloat the support region. However, the highlighted chart shows that the price levels beneath the $1,772 support level have significantly less investor activity. This suggests that the Ethereum price could fall to around $1,500 without catching a break if $1,772 is breached. On the flip side, the price of ETH could travel to as high as $2,100 if this support level remains unbreached, as no significant resistance lies ahead. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ETH token is valued at around $1,830, reflecting an almost 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

While the Pi price trend remains range-bound and the latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update shows a strong 100% rebound from April lows, a separate opportunity is quietly gaining traction. BlockDAG , through its 25% referral program, offers a practical route to crypto earnings without mining, staking, or direct buying, positioning itself as a candidate for the best long-term crypto opportunity. Even without purchasing BDAG, users can earn 25% of any referral-driven sale. There’s no need for technical setup or upfront capital. Sharing a referral link is all it takes. With over $225 million already raised and the coin currently priced at $0.0019, BlockDAG’s ecosystem, including the X1 mining app and its upcoming mainnet, offers more than just presale hype. This referral phase won’t last, and once BDAG launches on exchanges, these earnings vanish. How BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus Delivers Crypto Without Buying BlockDAG simplifies crypto earnings. No technical knowledge required, no purchases needed. Its 25% referral reward allows anyone to earn BDAG tokens by inviting others. Priced at $0.0019 and aiming for a $0.05 listing, the value of these referral bonuses could multiply significantly. With the presale entering its final phase, the offer is time-sensitive and potentially high-impact. A Telegram post outlines one user’s experience. After purchasing $1,000 in BDAG, the user shared a referral link across several groups. Within a week, referrals brought in $4,000 in purchases, earning the original user $1,000 in BDAG, over 526,000 coins, without further action. This kind of reward structure is usually reserved for early buyers or project insiders, yet BlockDAG has opened it to the public. In parallel, BlockDAG’s presale continues gaining momentum. Over $225 million has been secured and 19.6 billion coins have been sold. The $0.0019 price point presents a last-chance entry before the token’s exchange debut. With the X1 mining app active and the full mainnet scheduled for later in 2025, BlockDAG is emerging as a contender for the best long-term crypto , especially while this referral opportunity remains available. Pi Price Trend Signals Consolidation With a Potential Move Ahead The Pi price trend has remained between $0.58 and $0.66, following a sharp drop from March highs near $3.00. This flat trading range reflects indecision in the market, with no clear signals from either buyers or sellers. Support sits at $0.58 and $0.50, while resistance at $0.66 could lead to further upside if breached. With RSI currently at 53 and Bollinger Bands narrowing, a breakout could occur soon, but the direction remains uncertain. On the 4-hour timeframe, a descending triangle is forming. A drop below $0.58 may push the price down toward $0.48 or even $0.40. Conversely, early signs of bullish strength, like rising volume and a MACD crossover, are appearing. However, without major ecosystem developments or exchange activity, the Pi price trend could remain range-bound in the short term. The next few weeks will likely determine its near-term trajectory. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Update Shows Strong Recovery & Potential Upside The latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update reveals a sharp recovery, with HYPE climbing from below $10 to nearly $20. This rally followed a breakout above $13.55, ending a multi-week downtrend. The move above the Ichimoku Cloud and confirmation of a MACD bullish crossover both suggest that bullish momentum could continue. A break above the $21.07 resistance level could set up a short-term target of $23.84. Supporting metrics include Open Interest surpassing $600 million, signaling increased participation and market confidence. The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator remains in positive territory, reflecting ongoing buying strength. That said, the $14.37 support level, aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, remains a critical floor. Should that break, downside risks could increase. Still, current sentiment in the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update leans bullish, and market watchers are eyeing a clean break above $21 to confirm the next leg up. Key Insights! The Pi price trend remains stuck in consolidation, with $0.66 and $0.58 acting as critical levels. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update shows solid recovery momentum, pointing to a possible climb toward $23.84. Both assets are being watched closely, but neither offers the same accessible upside as BlockDAG’s referral campaign. With a 25% bonus structure that doesn’t require upfront spending, BlockDAG is providing one of the most effective passive crypto setups currently available. Just sharing a link can deliver sizable rewards, and with BDAG priced at $0.0019 and aiming for $0.05 on launch, those earnings could grow significantly. With over $225 million raised and a mainnet on the horizon, the current phase could close quickly. For anyone evaluating the best long-term crypto , BlockDAG’s referral bonus presents a low-risk, high-reward entry before listings begin.

The global crypto exchange recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Kyrgyzstan’s National Agency for Investments. This agreement opens the door to crypto payments, better financial education, and support for new Web3 projects in the region. Kyrgyzstan Taps Binance for Crypto Push The MoU was signed during the first meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets. Interestingly, President Sadyr Japarov attended the event. This high-profile presence shows that the government is committed to crypto and blockchain growth and innovation. As part of the signed agreement, the trading platform will help introduce its subsidiary BPay Global service in Kyrgyzstan. This payment platform enables fast and secure crypto payments, even across borders. Earlier in April, Binance BPay Global secured a payment license in Bahrain . The approval marks a big step for Binance’s push into regulated markets, allowing it to offer more fiat-related services. BPay Global’s debut in Kyrgyzstan is a big step for the country, which looks to become a major player in the digital world of Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union. In a recent statement, Farhat Iminov, Head of the National Agency for Investments, said the partnership will bring innovation and economic growth to Kyrgyzstan. Binance Regional Head Kyrylo Khomiakov added that the company is excited to work with the Kyrgyz government to unlock new opportunities through blockchain technology . Binance To Educate Kyrgyzstan on Digital Finance Binance’s educational arm, Binance Academy, will collaborate with local organizations to promote crypto literacy. The program will teach Kyrgyz citizens about digital currencies, Web3, and the risks and benefits of using crypto safely. The initiative aims to support local startups and encourage the development of new blockchain-powered businesses by improving financial education. A Growing Global Trend Kyrgyzstan’s deal with Binance is part of a growing global movement in the crypto industry. More countries are working closely with big crypto companies to build digital economies. This comes as governments are beginning to view crypto and blockchain technologies as a way to improve financial systems, support local businesses, and give people better access to digital tools. This is especially common in developing countries, where many people do not have access to traditional banking. By teaming up with crypto companies, these countries hope to bring more people into the financial system and create new job opportunities through blockchain and Web3 projects.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $850 to $880K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors a chance to position early—before the spotlight finds it.

XRP Surges & Solana Aims for $176,https://thecoinrise.com/early-entry-into-unstakeds-presale-could-deliver-27x-returns-xrp-surges-solana-aims-for-176/,"Crypto activity in May 2025 is not being driven by blind excitement, it’s backed by platforms showing real use and measurable progress. Ripple is expanding fast across Asia and the Middle East, placing XRP in a strong position to regain its role in international payments. At the same time, Solana’s growth in the DeFi and NFT space is reviving confidence after a long stretch of sideways action. Still, neither is shifting the crypto structure the way Unstaked is. With XRP entering the global remittance space and Solana regaining strength in DeFi, Unstaked is steadily building the first AI-driven crypto workforce where intelligent agents can post, respond, and scale engagement across social platforms. Its presale sits at just $0.006695, offering unmatched early access to a project built for the Web3 AI era. In a market that’s demanding real results, Unstaked isn’t chasing trends, it’s setting new ones. XRP Builds Momentum With Expanding Ecosystem and Global Reach Ripple continues gaining attention as it adds key partnerships across Asia and the Middle East, focusing on the massive cross-border transaction market. These efforts have led to a wave of strong on-chain activity for XRP, with more than 650 million tokens moved in just one day, pointing to rising network demand. XRP’s recent move beyond the $2.20 resistance has pushed it to around $2.27, where it remains strong above both the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Analysts think this movement may signal a lasting shift in trend rather than just a short-term rally. If positive momentum holds, XRP may be headed toward the $2.50 and $2.85 targets. With use cases growing and price trends supporting the move, XRP could become one of the key players in the upcoming crypto cycle. Solana Prepares for a Rally With Strong DeFi and Price Action Solana (SOL) is seeing steady growth in both its value and its ecosystem, supported by institutional backing and rising user activity. After briefly dipping to $148, the coin has remained stable following a 10% increase over the past week, boosted by the market’s optimistic mood. Its DeFi scene is expanding quickly, with platforms like Drift Protocol and MarginFi reporting all-time high engagement. Adding to this momentum, DeFi Dev Corp’s recent $9.8 million SOL acquisition shows serious capital confidence. From a technical view, Solana’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders formation could send it toward $176 if the $150 level is retaken. With solid backing from its 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, experts say Solana may soon outpace Ethereum in DeFi and NFTs. The upward trend is likely to continue as new partners and liquidity come in. Unstaked’s $0.006695 Presale Builds a Full AI Agent System Before Launch Unstaked is rising as one of the most compelling crypto projects going into 2025. The project is now in Stage 2 of its presale, with each unit priced at just $0.006695. Unlike others focused on hype, Unstaked brings practical AI use cases from the start. The platform will allow people to launch smart AI agents across social apps like X and Telegram after the project’s official launch. These are not ordinary bots, they react to real data, adapt to feedback, and actively grow social groups. Every step they take is recorded through Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, which only rewards agents who show strong results. With a planned launch value of $0.1819, current supporters are looking at around 2,700% potential gains based on real tools, not empty promises. Fair design is central to Unstaked. There are no private sales, no early deals for firms, and 60% of all supply is open to public buyers. The project also includes a $20 million liquidity pool, and agent tools will be available as soon as Unstaked goes live. Instead of waiting passively, users get to take part in a working system that ties AI with on-chain earning. In a market filled with hype, Unstaked stands out for offering something that performs and rewards based on action. Final Thoughts! XRP is showing strength with its global partnerships, and Solana’s ecosystem push is making real progress, but the greatest upside appears to be with Unstaked. While others refine old models, Unstaked is setting up a decentralized system where AI actions are rewarded, creating new ways for users to earn actively. With its presale still at $0.006695 and a future listing price near $0.1819, the chance to gain 2,700% puts Unstaked far ahead of many competing projects. As the crypto space moves into a phase where working products matter more than talk, Unstaked could take the lead as one of the top-performing crypto projects of 2025.

Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction as one of the most talked-about early-stage opportunities. For those working with a modest investment of $180 , these names offer a compelling blend of established performance and high-upside potential. MAGACOINFINANCE – A Rising Altcoin With Early-Stage Momentum While legacy coins anchor portfolios, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a serious early-stage contender. With a growing base of supporters and increasing visibility across media and social channels, the project is drawing comparisons to early successes in previous market cycles. Now backed by over $7.8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE is executing a deliberate strategy—building infrastructure, expanding community engagement, and preparing for its public listing. Early investors can claim a 50% token bonus by using the promo code MAGA50X at checkout. Cardano, Sei, and Optimism Reflect Broader Strength Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.67 , up over 15% in the past week. It’s gaining technical strength, crossing key moving averages and supported by a record 130,000+ smart contracts deployed across its ecosystem. Sei (SEI) , priced at $0.208 , is enjoying a 4.52% daily uptick, with 127% growth in trading volume. Its steady $415 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) signals consistent ecosystem participation and investor confidence. Optimism (OP) is navigating a scheduled token unlock of 31.34 million OP , valued above $24 million . Despite the short-term implications, the network’s core metrics show rising activity and recovery trends, positioning it well for future growth. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, Cardano, Sei, and Optimism showing solid performance, and MAGACOINFINANCE rapidly gaining attention, the market is offering diverse pathways for upside. For investors working with an entry-level allocation of $180 , a combination of established strength and strategic early positioning could generate meaningful returns.

The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is setting sights on $2,100, if ETH can keep its footing above $1,800. At the same time, Ripple news about a major 1 billion XRP token unlock, valued at $2.2 billion, is creating concerns. Even though much of it may be relocked, the immediate impact has already pushed XRP lower. While these major names navigate their next moves, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention through a different channel. Its just-launched podcast series is giving the public a peek into its strategy, building serious trust, and powering a presale that has already crossed $225 million. It’s no wonder it’s being counted among the top-rated crypto currencies right now. Ethereum (ETH) Price Forecast Hints at Bullish Continuation The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast comes with growing confidence. ETH is holding above $1,800 after shaking off a tough Q1. Now, a bullish flag is forming, and analysts are eyeing a breakout toward $2,100 if ETH can clear the $1,850 level. Institutional interest is picking up too, with $183 million flowing into ETH-based ETFs just last week. If Ethereum maintains this momentum and crosses the $2,000 mark, the next resistance zones could be within striking distance soon. Ripple News: Token Unlock Sparks Uncertainty Fresh Ripple news is making waves as traders brace for a massive token unlock. On May 1, Ripple is set to release 1 billion XRP, worth over $2.2 billion. This move has already sparked a 2.78% drop in XRP’s price, bringing it to $2.23. Even though Ripple typically relocks most of the unlocked tokens, the short-term selling pressure is already showing. The focus is now on Ripple (26) and Ripple (27), two mostly dormant wallets scheduled to release large amounts of XRP. Even if the impact is short-lived, the event is raising market sensitivity. On top of that, the SEC’s delayed decision on a Ripple ETF is also adding to the uncertainty. BlockDAG’s New Podcast Series Gives Buyers a Backstage Pass BlockDAG (BDAG) is cranking up the volume with its newly launched official podcast series, adding a fresh layer of transparency and connection for its fast-growing community. Each episode pulls back the curtain, diving deep into the project’s roadmap, upcoming exchange listings, and its ambitious plans for long-term expansion. This podcast drop joins a powerful lineup of updates that continue to keep BlockDAG in the spotlight, from live AMAs and major keynote drops to a presale model built on credibility. Now in Batch 28, BDAG is up for grabs at a limited-time rate of just $0.0019 until May 13, a steep markdown from the usual $0.0262 batch price. With launch projections set at $0.05, this offer stands out as one of the best entry prices seen this year. The numbers speak for themselves: over $225 million raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and early holders enjoying a 2,520% gain, all before listings even go live. But this podcast isn’t just another update. It’s a key part of BlockDAG’s long-term strategy, offering a level of openness rarely seen in crypto. That’s exactly why BlockDAG is being counted among the top rated crypto currencies to watch in 2025. Final Thoughts The Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is sticking to the $2,100 mark, driven by strong ETF inflows and a bullish technical pattern. Holding above $1,800 remains key. Meanwhile, Ripple news is shaking things up. The 1 billion XRP unlock may be short-lived in impact, but it’s already unsettling the market. BlockDAG, though, is on its own track. Instead of waiting on market events, it’s building trust and talking directly to its users. That’s something even the biggest names haven’t nailed yet. With the presale still open at $0.0019 until May 13 and over $225 million raised already, the window to get in early is closing fast. For those looking beyond just charts and hype, BlockDAG is proving it has what it takes to be one of the top-rated crypto currencies for the years ahead.

Recent market trends suggest these digital currencies could be set for a significant rise. Investors might find intriguing opportunities as the bullish momentum gathers pace. This article delves into the factors driving this potential growth and what might be on the horizon for these promising assets. Sui Price Rally Amid Mixed Signals Past month data shows a 40.90% surge and a 72.47% rise over six months, while a weekly decline of 9.34% hints at short-term pullbacks. A notable upward trend has been building, reflecting strong market interest and consistent gains over the observed periods. SUI current prices range from $2.19 to $4.34 with immediate resistance at $5.18 and additional resistance at $7.34, while support is near $0.87. Indicators show a subtle mix, with the Awesome Oscillator at $0.81 and RSI at 58.88, while momentum slightly dips to -0.15. Bulls have influence as prices edge higher, but caution is warranted within these key levels for potential trading opportunities. Upgrading XRP for a Bullish Move XRP price action over the past month shows a modest gain of around 7.06%, building on a remarkable 338.86% surge over the last six months. Performance reflects steady investor interest and price recovery after past dips, with activity increasing as the coin consolidates gains. Recent movements indicate that XRP’s historical volatility has calmed, leading to tighter trading ranges and renewed market trust. Currently, XRP trades within a range of $1.75 to $2.50, with key resistance at $2.80 and a secondary barrier at $3.55 while finding primary support near $1.31 and lower support at $0.56. Bulls are edging in control within these levels, though no clear trend has fully emerged. Traders might explore entries at support zones and consider exits or buys near resistance if upward pressure holds. Conclusion The outlook for SUI and XRP appears promising. Both coins show potential for growth in the near term. SUI has been gaining attention due to recent developments. XRP is benefiting from positive market trends and increased adoption. Investors might consider these factors when evaluating their portfolios. The potential for upward movement makes these assets worth watching.

Projects that show real-world use, not just flashy whitepapers, are starting to separate themselves from the noise. And with digital tools becoming vital for creators, professionals, and businesses across Latin America and beyond, more community members are paying close attention to platforms that solve problems, not just promise moonshots. One name standing out is Qubetics . Even while still in presale, it’s generating buzz for its practical applications and layered tech architecture. At the same time, well-established contenders like Theta and Story(IP) are holding their ground as reliable alternatives to traditional investment tools—particularly in the content, streaming, and IP ownership sectors. Let’s break down why each is worth watching, and why these three are among the Top Cryptos to Join Now. Qubetics (TICS): Built for Cross-Border Simplicity, It’s One of the Top Cryptos to Join Now Forget the hassle of international wire transfers, foreign transaction fees, or days of delay just to move money between countries. Qubetics is changing that game with its seamless Cross-Border Transactions feature—built right into its blockchain architecture. Imagine a small digital agency in Medellín working with clients in Texas or Madrid. Instead of waiting days for traditional bank transfers or paying up to 10% in fees, they can receive funds instantly and securely using Qubetics’ multi-chain infrastructure. For freelancers, digital nomads, e-commerce vendors, and remote teams across Latin America, this isn’t just helpful—it’s revolutionary. The feature works by leveraging decentralized liquidity pools and smart routing to enable low-fee, real-time transactions across borders. No central authority. No risk of being blocked or delayed. Just peer-to-peer value movement—on-chain and on-demand. That utility alone puts Qubetics in a different bracket compared to most early-stage blockchain projects. That’s exactly why it’s being called one of the Top Cryptos to Join Now—because it’s already delivering something users want and need, not just building for potential down the road. Presale Performance and ROI Projections Let’s talk numbers. The crypto presale is in stage 32. More than 510 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 25,600 token holders, raising $16.6 million and counting. The current presale price sits at $0.2093 per token. Those who joined at stage 1? They got in at $0.01 and are already looking at a 1993% return. But here’s the kicker—there’s still room to run. Right now, buyers entering at $0.2093 could see: $TICS at $1 = 377% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2,288% ROI $TICS at $6 = 2,766% ROI $TICS at $10 = $,677% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet = 7,066% ROI This isn’t just a speculative jump. It’s backed by tech, traction, and timing. Qubetics is delivering a working product to a market that’s been underserved for too long. That’s what makes it one of the most credible early-stage projects on the radar right now. Theta: Reinventing Video Streaming with Decentralized Infrastructure When it comes to decentralized streaming, Theta Network is the name that keeps coming up—and for good reason. This project is laser-focused on changing the way video content is delivered, shifting the model away from costly, centralized servers and toward a peer-powered mesh of users who share bandwidth and storage in exchange for rewards. That’s not just some nerdy backend feature—it has real implications for creators and platforms. Think of an indie streamer in Buenos Aires or a small film studio in Mexico City. Instead of relying on YouTube’s algorithm or Twitch’s monetization policies, they can build directly on Theta’s infrastructure and reach their audience on their own terms. The protocol allows users to earn tokens by relaying video content to others, which reduces the load on content delivery networks (CDNs) and dramatically cuts costs. Big names have already bought into the ecosystem—Samsung, Sony, Google, and Lionsgate have explored or partnered with Theta in various capacities, showing it has institutional respect to go along with grassroots energy. Theta’s TFUEL and THETA tokens power this network, enabling everything from payments to governance. And the community continues to grow, with developers building decentralized video platforms, NFT tools for creators, and live events infrastructure—all fueled by Theta’s protocol. Theta is doing more than talking about decentralization—it’s actively reshaping how creators interact with their audiences. It’s one of the few projects that has consistently shipped, delivered, and partnered with major players. Story(IP): Where Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property For anyone who’s ever created a song, written a story, or filmed a short documentary, ownership is everything. That’s where Story(IP) comes in. This project is building a decentralized platform for managing, validating, and monetizing intellectual property in the digital age. Story(IP) turns content into verified on-chain assets. Whether it’s a script for a telenovela, a comic series, or an indie track from a DJ in Mexico City, creators can mint their work on Story(IP), timestamp it, and prove ownership without depending on centralised systems or expensive third-party registrars. This is especially relevant in regions where copyright enforcement can be slow, costly, or unreliable. For creators in Latin America, Story(IP) becomes a digital notary—a trustless proof of originality and origin. The platform also integrates token-based monetization options, allowing creators to fractionalize their content, license it to studios, or even crowdfund their next project—all on-chain. Its community-first model appeals to both indie creators and established producers, bridging a gap between creative freedom and blockchain verification. And as global interest in digital identity and intellectual property grows, Story(IP) is positioning itself as the go-to chain for protecting what people make. Intellectual property is a trillion-dollar industry—and Story(IP) is giving it a decentralized home. Its relevance is growing every week, and its tools are empowering creators globally to take back control of their work. Final Thoughts Theta and Story(IP) are both tackling billion-dollar industries—streaming and IP ownership—with tech that empowers users and decentralizes legacy systems. They’ve earned their places as top-tier alternatives to traditional digital infrastructure. But Qubetics? That’s where the doors are still open for early entry. It’s not only providing cross-border payment rails that make sense for freelancers, businesses, and creators—but it’s also offering one of the most generous ROI potentials of any legit presale in the space right now. For those who’ve been watching and waiting for a project that mixes purpose, utility, and timing, this might be it. This week, if the search is for top cryptos to join now , these three belong on that shortlist. But one of them still has a front-row seat available—Qubetics.

Bitcoin and XRP are already legends in their own right. Solana continues expanding across Web3. And Ethereum (ETH) remains central to everything from smart contracts to institutional adoption. But now, one name is quietly joining that elite conversation: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Momentum is rising, and the real question now is whether one of these five tokens could deliver that rare multi-million-dollar return for those positioned early enough. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Catching Fire—and the Early Signs Are Hard to Ignore It’s easy to miss the early signals—until it’s too late. But right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing every indicator of a breakout in motion. Wallet counts are ticking upward fast. Community growth is unfolding naturally, without gimmicks. And on-chain trackers are beginning to highlight MAGACOINFINANCE as one of the few early-stage plays with meaningful activity and traction. This isn’t temporary attention. It’s foundational progress—and those entering now may be catching the inflection point before the next phase begins. Rising Players to Watch: Kaspa, Polkadot, and Their Growing Ecosystems Kaspa is gaining ground with a high-speed, proof-of-work blockDAG model that’s built for real-time payments and scalable infrastructure. Polkadot continues leading the way in cross-chain functionality, giving developers the tools to launch scalable projects across a multi-chain future. Both names have real utility—but when it comes to asymmetric upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for its early strength and rising investor activity. Final Word Could $2.1 million truly be within reach? History suggests that those who moved early on Bitcoin , Solana , Ethereum , and XRP made that a reality. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is stepping into that same conversation—with speed, structure, and growing conviction behind it.

Per the South Korean media outlet Digital Daily , officials think 16.3 million South Koreans have previously or currently own cryptoassets. Their data is based on the number of crypto wallets and linked bank accounts held on the nation’s five fiat-trading crypto exchanges at the end of February this year. South Korean Presidential Elections: Crypto a Key Battleground The media outlet noted that the South Korean political world is now “putting considerable effort” into making pledges about ways to boost crypto market growth. South Korean Presidential Candidate Kim Moon-soo (center) with senior People Power Party officials at an event on May 3. (Source: News1 TV/YouTube) In late April, Kim caused a storm in the crypto community. The candidate said he would “allow government agencies such as the National Pension Service (NPS) and the Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) to invest in virtual assets.” The NPS is the world’s third-largest pension fund. The KIC is the nation’s sovereign wealth fund. The media outlet noted that, should the NPS and the KIC start directly investing in BTC and other cryptoassets, the move would “further enhance the crypto market’s reputation.” On April 27, Kim said: “Considering the changes in the domestic and international economic environment, we can no longer deny the existence of virtual assets.” The former labor minister said that he would “foster” the “important” domestic crypto industry if he wins power on June 3. Democratic Party (DP) presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung appealed for support during a visit to Yeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Sunday, asking, “What did I do so wrong?” https://t.co/YF27ZsVGkG — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) May 4, 2025 Kim told attendees at the People Power Party convention in KINTEX in Goyang on May 3: “Many young people make money with virtual assets. But some young people lose money on their purchases. I will try to make the market more stable by institutionalizing it.” Rival Party Also ‘Crypto-keen’ The PPP and its biggest rival, the Democratic Party, have also talked up the possible approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs. Late last month, the PPP unveiled seven crypto-related policies ahead of June 3’s poll . The party says it will move to scrap restrictive banking rules for crypto exchanges. It has also promised to speed up the process of allowing corporations to buy BTC and other coins with their balance sheets. Kim Moon-soo, a former labor minister and a candidate for the presidential nomination of the People Power Party, promised to extend the Great Train eXpress (GTX) railway network to five metropolitan areas within his term as president, if elected. https://t.co/ZBWpUwkMqK — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) April 21, 2025 The DP has also unveiled its own set of crypto policies. Some senior party officials claim they want to establish a national strategic crypto reserve . Both parties have claimed that they will institutionalize crypto and security tokens if they are elected. DP candidate Lee Jae-myung has said relatively little on crypto-related matters in the run-up to the June poll. The Democratic Party Presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung. (Source: Lee Jae-myung/YouTube/Screenshot) But other DP officials, including many close to Lee, have spoken publicly about plans to launch a new crypto regulator. Some also want to let domestic firms issue stablecoins. Mixed Opinions on Manifesto Promises South Korean crypto insiders have reacted to the pledges with a mixture of caution and optimism. The same media outlet wrote that the industry was “greatly encouraged” by the parties’ “unanimous” support for market-friendly polices. South Korea's conservatives pick hardline Kim Moon-soo as presidential candidate https://t.co/AhdzBkNbbu https://t.co/AhdzBkNbbu — Reuters (@Reuters) May 3, 2025 However, some will recall that candidates made similar pledges in the lead-up to the 2022 and 2024 elections. Following the polls, however, only a small fraction of these manifesto promises were later turned into laws. An unnamed official from a major domestic crypto exchange was quoted as saying: “Institutionalization plans have been a major disappointment for the industry so far. So in that respect, the candidates’ pledges are a very positive sign. However, we will have to wait and see if these pledges are actually put into action after the election.” The post South Korean Presidential Hopeful Wants to Let State Pension Fund Buy BTC appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Politics|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-04 23:30:00

This move comes as President Donald Trump’s administration’s regulatory policies become less stringent and clearer. Deribit has built its reputation as a leading platform for crypto options. Last year, the company processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume. However, the exchange is now looking beyond its Dubai base to explore new opportunities in the United States. Why Deribit Is Looking to Enter the US Market Deribit’s CEO, Luuk Strijers, revealed why the exchange is considering entering the US market. Strijers believes that the US is becoming more supportive of the crypto industry, as there are recent changes in the country’s crypto regulations. These relaxed crypto rules come after crypto firms in the country have faced challenges over the past few years. Under Joe Biden’s administration, regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) cracked down on industry. However, with President Trump’s administration, the regulatory environment is changing. The president has promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Since his electoral victory in November 2024, the SEC has paused or dropped several enforcement actions against crypto companies. Additionally, the DOJ recently dissolved its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a more relaxed approach. Deribit’s Potential Deal with Coinbase The news of Deribit’s US expansion comes alongside reports that Coinbase, a leading US-based crypto exchange, is in talks to acquire Deribit. According to a recent report, both companies have notified Dubai’s regulators about the deal. Coinbase would need to transfer Deribit’s operating license to the US if the deal goes through. This move could strengthen Coinbase’s position in the global crypto market. This potential deal shows the growing interest in the crypto derivatives market, which is becoming more competitive. Kraken, a leading asset manager, is also making moves in this space. The company recently acquired NinjaTrader in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Growing Confidence in the US Market Deribit’s potential move into the US reflects the broader trend, as the regulatory shift is positively impacting the industry. Companies that once left the US due to regulatory uncertainty are rethinking their strategies. OKX, a major crypto exchange, has announced plans to set up a U.S. headquarters in California, just months after settling a significant legal case with the US authorities. Meanwhile, Nexo, which exited the US in 2022 , has announced its return to the market in response to the more favorable conditions. Other notable players, such as DWF Lab and Wintermute, are also eyeing US expansion , further demonstrating the growing confidence in the US market.

Curve Finance is a stablecoin-focused ecosystem, specializing in the efficient and low-slippage trading of dollar-pegged crypto assets. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid is a layer-1 protocol serving a decentralized exchange (DEX). Says Altcoin Sherpa, “But if you’re an investor that relies on these types of fundamentals, there are a few good ones like CRV and HYPE, those charts look pretty solid overall .” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $20.55 Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, CRV is worth $0.697. Turning to the memecoin Bonk ( BONK ), the trader says he plans to accumulate the altcoin at current levels. “Staying patient for BONK and would love to buy in the green box if it gives.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.0000164. As for Bitcoin, the trader says BTC looks bullish on the high time frame after the crypto king retested the $74,000 level as support. “Higher time frame view of BTC: higher low formed in that chop period, it was similar to that May 2021 area where price formed a low. I think it’s a great low given the amount of time (two months) and volatility that we saw. While there are going to be some small pullbacks, I think we strongly break $100,000 in the next several weeks as long as equities don’t completely sh** the bed (sadly, I see a lot of lower high / it’s over type of posts).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,921.

Here’s what sets Ruvi apart: Fixed Supply, Rising Value Unlike inflationary tokens, Ruvi caps its total supply at 1.5 billion tokens , ensuring scarcity will drive long-term value as demand grows. AI Meets Real-World Blockchain Applications Ruvi isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that uses artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems in logistics, predictive analytics, and even clean energy. While Cardano adds wallet features, Ruvi aims to redefine global industries. Early Investor Incentives You Won’t Find Elsewhere Ruvi’s presale includes jaw-dropping bonuses of up to 100% , giving early backers an unmatched edge before the token even hits major exchanges. The Ruvi Presale Advantage By joining Ruvi’s presale, you’ll gain access to tokens priced at a mere $0.01 apiece and receive significant bonuses based on your investment level. Here’s how quickly your investment can skyrocket: A Modest $500 Stake Investing $500 gives you 50,000 Ruvi tokens , priced at $0.01 each. Add the 40% bonus , and you walk away with 70,000 tokens . When Ruvi hits $1.25 , your holdings surge to $87,500 , marking a 17,500% ROI . A Strategic $7,000 Investment For $7,000, you’ll purchase 700,000 tokens . Ruvi’s 100% bonus boosts your total to 1,400,000 tokens . If Ruvi climbs to $2.00 , your initial commitment transforms into $2,800,000 . That’s a life-changing 40,000% return ! Go Big with $15,000 A high-stakes bet of $15,000 secures you 1.5 million tokens and, with the 100% VIP bonus , doubles your holdings to 3 million tokens . When Ruvi reaches $3.00 , your portfolio skyrockets to $9 million , securing your financial freedom. Why the Timing Is Critical Recent Cardano news highlights how early adopters can ride the wave of innovative blockchain projects. Cardano’s market activity and speculative $1 targets remind us of crypto’s wealth-building potential. However, Ruvi offers a fresh entry point with unparalleled upside. Cardano believers once paid cents for tokens that are now worth many multiples of their original investment. With Ruvi available at just $0.01 per token during presale, the potential to multiply your wealth is staggering. Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late The crypto space rewards those who act decisively. Waiting too long to get in on Ruvi could mean missing the kind of returns that early Cardano investors rave about today.

The most recent Cardano (ADA) price analysis shows $379 million in accumulation, yet the token is still struggling to hold above $1, while transaction fees have dropped 52%. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price outlook appears more optimistic, with the asset hovering near $15.30 as bullish chart signals build, but a breakout remains elusive. Waiting for momentum can mean missed chances. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. One wallet just earned 25.29 million extra BDAG coins through its Buyer Battle event, a windfall potentially worth $1.26 million at launch. With its presale already passing $225.5 million, a clearer picture is forming of where real opportunity might be found. Accumulation Grows for ADA, But Price Still Stalls The latest Cardano (ADA) price analysis indicates strong accumulation, with more than $379 million added over the past seven weeks. ADA recently cleared the $0.60 resistance, but the move hasn’t been sustained. Volume remains light and on-chain activity has slowed, making the upward momentum uncertain. Although past performance hints at upside potential, current conditions are not confirming a trend. Fees on the network have dropped 52% since earlier in the year, reflecting reduced usage. Without stronger fundamentals and increased demand, ADA may continue to struggle to reclaim $1 in the near term. LINK Price Setup Builds as Bulls Eye Key Resistance The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook has improved after a recovery of over 50% from April lows. LINK is now testing the $15.30 mark, where resistance has previously held. Indicators like the SuperTrend and a short-term inverse head-and-shoulders pattern support the possibility of a breakout. On-chain data also shows falling exchange reserves and rising wallet activity, both typically bullish signs. However, to confirm further upside, LINK must convincingly break through the $15.30 level. If that occurs, prices could rise toward $17, and in stronger market conditions, even approach $30. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Offer High Rewards for Daily Top Spenders One wallet recently received 25.29 million BDAG coins during a BlockDAG Buyer Battle, without paying anything beyond their own purchase. The event rewards the top buyer each day if the 24-hour sales goal of 50 million BDAG is not met. On this specific day, only 24.71 million BDAG were sold, leaving 25.29 million unsold. According to the rules, those extra coins went to the day’s highest buyer, wallet 0xbcdc…cfb. The value of this reward becomes more apparent when considered with BlockDAG’s pricing. The current special offer is $0.0019 per coin, even though Batch 28 is listed at $0.0262. The listing price is confirmed at $0.05. That means the 25.29 million bonus BDAG is worth around $1.26 million at launch. This happened as part of a presale that has already raised $225.5 million and sold 19.6 billion BDAG coins. Buyer Battles occur daily. If the 25 million target is not reached, the remaining coins go to that day’s biggest purchaser. The system refreshes every 24 hours, and someone new wins each time. Which Project Holds the Strongest Position for 2025? Based on the current Cardano (ADA) price analysis, strong accumulation hasn’t yet turned into a solid price move, with ADA unable to confidently hold above $0.60. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook is more promising after a 50% rebound, but it still depends on breaching the resistance near $15.30 to continue higher. Both remain contenders for the top crypto for 2025 , but require favorable technical follow-through to realize potential. BlockDAG, in contrast, is already delivering tangible value. Through its Buyer Battle program, a user gained 25.29 million BDAG coins for free. With the $0.0019 special price active until May 13 and a future listing at $0.05, the return potential is substantial. Combined with daily chances to earn additional BDAG without spending more, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious player for those seeking high ROI in 2025.

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

Canada and the EU are strengthening their economic cooperation and free trade through the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Carney stated, “When Canada and the European Union build together, our futures are stronger.” Canada and the EU investigate ways to strengthen their relationship for mutual benefits The cornerstone of the trade relationship between Canada and the EU is the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement which has been applied provisionally since September 2017. CETA has scrapped 98% of tariffs from Canada to the EU and vice versa, greatly facilitating trade. The trade agreement uses a phased strategy described in a tariff dismantling schedule to achieve this elimination. The tariff lines were removed initially, and the remaining ones, which include some grains, seafood products, and passenger cars, are being phased out gradually. This procedure seeks to lower business expenses while boosting Canadian exporters’ and producers’ competitiveness in the EU market. Still, the agreement has yet to be fully ratified in some EU countries, including Belgium and Bulgaria. Mary Ng, Canada’s Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, said on February 8 that Canada was looking to deepen economic ties with the EU while respecting world trade rules in the midst of US threats to impose tariffs . Additionally, since 2017, the EU and Canada have enjoyed the benefits of a free trade agreement that increased bilateral trade by 65% and established a partnership for raw materials in 2021. The recent election of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has added momentum to this transatlantic collaboration . Carney, a former central banker with leadership experience in both Canada and the UK, has pledged to reduce Canada’s economic dependence on the US, which currently accounts for over 75% of Canadian exports. In his victory speech, Carney emphasized the need to pursue closer ties with Europe and Asia, including potential security and trade alliances with the EU. Ng noted that trade agreements are one thing, and they had seen really great numbers, but emphasized the need to explore what more can be done to help Canadian businesses enter any of the 27 EU member states and reciprocate by supporting similar efforts within Canada. She also said the EU would focus on small businesses and strategic minerals. Moreover, to reduce its reliance on China, the EU, particularly, was keen to forge alliances to ensure that Europeans had access to the metals, including cobalt, lithium, and nickel, needed for the energy transition. Further evidence of Canada’s aggressive pursuit of trade agreements in the Indo-Pacific region can be found in the agreements it signed with Ecuador in February and Indonesia in December. The minister also made trips to Australia, Singapore, and Brunei. Ng mentioned, “We are at the table with Southeast Asian countries, so the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. I took a very large delegation of Canadian businesses to the Philippines in December, to Indonesia, to markets like Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, and Korea.” CETA promotes prosperity and economic growth in EU-Canada trade Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said in an X post that she had a conversation with Mark Carney and congratulated him on his election. The occasion, she argued, was a perfect opportunity to highlight the close ties between Canada and the EU and the opportunities that lie ahead. In addition, along with discussing ways to build on the achievements of CETA, she revealed that they had agreed to investigate deeper defense and economic security cooperation. CETA seeks to ensure growth and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, increase trade and investment, and generate jobs. It also contains resolute pledges to protect the environment, uphold labor rights, and promote sustainable development.

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find. Of them all, MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one still hidden in plain sight—quietly preparing to lead the next wave.

Smart Money Is Heading To This Token With 65x Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-solana-sol-and-ethereum-eth-still-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-now-smart-money-is-heading-to-this-token-with-65x-potential/,"Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been the darlings of the crypto market, delivering impressive returns and revolutionizing blockchain technology. But as the market matures, smart money is starting to pivot towards a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM is catching the eye of savvy investors who are forecasting a staggering 65x potential in 2025. Currently in Phase 4, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.5 million from more than 9,400 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over half of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. As Ethereum and Solana fight to reclaim their highs, it might be time to shift focus and look at the rising star that promises to disrupt the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major innovator in the decentralized finance world, with a dual-lending model that’s turning heads across the crypto community. By combining both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks in a uniquely integrated system, the project is bringing something genuinely new to the table. With more than 9,300 investors already on board and over $7.5 million raised during the presale, there’s clearly a strong level of trust in the project’s vision. Tokens are still available at $0.025 during Phase 4, but that price is about to jump to $0.03 in the next phase, a 20% increase that reflects growing demand and limited time to get in early. To keep its momentum going and foster long-term loyalty, Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic new dashboard that features a real-time leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those at the top of the board are rewarded with bonus MUTM tokens, creating a fun, competitive edge that helps fuel continued investment and deeper community involvement. This gamified element adds another layer to what’s already proving to be a highly engaging ecosystem. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely, giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly, ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The $100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech—it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. Solana and Ethereum remain strong, but smart money is moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi gem with real utility and 65x potential. With $7.5M raised from 9,400+ investors, MUTM is still just $0.025, but set to rise 20% in Phase 5. Over 50% of Phase 4 is sold, and time is running out.
