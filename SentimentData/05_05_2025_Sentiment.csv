However, the largest cryptocurrency market seems to have witnessed a significant shift, with prices now less responsive to changes in on-chain activity. For instance, the Bitcoin price continues to hold above $95,000 and looks set to reclaim the $100,000 level despite the sustained dip in blockchain activity. An on-chain analytics firm has weighed in on how and why this is possible for the flagship cryptocurrency. Why BTC Price Is Less Correlated To On-Chain Activity Crypto analytics platform Alphractal shared in a new post on X the major reasons why the Bitcoin price has managed to stay afloat despite transaction volume and active addresses being at low levels. According to the firm, BTC’s price rise doesn’t necessarily correlate to increased blockchain usage. Firstly, Alphractal acknowledged that the Bitcoin market experienced a dynamic shift when the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved in January 2024. The value of BTC is now being driven by capital inflows through these financial products rather than blockchain activity. The on-chain firm also mentioned that the historically low volatility in the market has had a major part to play in the low Bitcoin network activity. With relatively little price movement, traders are less incentivized to take new positions, leading to lower on-chain activity. Additionally, Alphractal mentioned that the Bitcoin price has been kept afloat largely by the activities of speculative traders through derivatives and other financial instruments. As a result, there has been a reduced everyday adoption and limited practical demand for the Bitcoin network. Alphractal also alluded to the macroeconomic uncertainty that has clouded the global financial markets in recent weeks. According to the on-chain analytics firm, this market condition, even though improving, has most investors waiting for clearer bullish signals before making any move. Finally, Alphractal highlighted artificial exchange volumes amongst the main reasons for the Bitcoin price staying afloat . “Some exchange volume may be inflated, creating a misleading sense of activity while real network usage stays modest,” the on-chain platform added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,150, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the choppy price action this weekend, the premier cryptocurrency is still up by nearly 2% on the weekly timeframe, according to data from CoinGecko.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Network|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-04 21:30:22

According to Wedson, movement has begun in the altcoin market and this trend may accelerate further in the coming months. Wedson defined June and July as the starting point of the altcoin season, and evaluated this period as the process of “exit from the accumulation zone.” The CEO, who predicted that interest in altcoins would peak in August and September, described this period as a phase in which Memecoin, GameFi and DeFi projects would shine. Expecting the Bitcoin dominance to fall rapidly, Wedson claimed that the altcoin rally would continue.

Stating that Bitcoin is not preferred for daily transactions due to its technical limitations, the CEO used the following statements: “Today, the vast majority of crypto transactions occur over networks like Ethereum, Tron, and BSC. The Bitcoin blockchain is now used very little for direct transactions, and the rate has been declining since 2022.” *This is not investment advice.

This marks a 27.3% increase compared to the $72.6 million reported last year in the same month. Compared to previous months in 2025, the figure more than doubled from March’s total of $41.4 million. Losses Surpass 2024’s Full-Year Total According to the latest report from the blockchain security platform Immunefi, the year-to-date total stands at $1.74 billion. This is already higher than the full-year total of $1.49 billion in 2024, which was previously considered the worst hit year in crypto-related hacks. Further, the survey highlighted that the figure represents a fourfold increase from the $420 million recorded during the same period last year. Most of April’s setbacks came from just two incidents; blockchain payments platform UPCX suffered the largest single hit, losing $70.0 million, while decentralized exchange KiloEx followed with $7.5 million in losses. Other affected platforms included Loopscale ($5.8 million), ZKsync ($5.0 million), and Term Labs ($1.5 million). Additional cases were recorded across Bitcoin Mission ($1.3 million), The Roar ($790,000), Impermax ($152,200), Zora ($140,800), and ACB ($84,100). Hacks continue to be the predominant cause of losses as opposed to fraud, with 100% of the attacks being exploits. Notably, no incident recorded in April targeted centralized platforms. The affected players were exclusively from the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most targeted blockchain networks, together accounting for 60% of the total. The former recorded five incidents, representing 33.3% of the total, while the latter followed with four, or 26.7%. Base experienced three incidents (20%), while Arbitrum, Solana, Sonic, and ZKsync each recorded one. More 2025 Exploits Outside of April, the crypto industry has been heavily hit in the first quarter of 2025, with the Bybit hack standing out as the largest. In this incident, bad actors took advantage of a vulnerability in the exchange’s hot wallet infrastructure, executing multiple transactions to steal $1.46 billion. Infini was also targeted , with the attackers making away with $50 million after they manipulated vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The exploit caused major disruptions, leaving users unable to access their funds for several days. Meanwhile, DeFi lending platform zkLend fell victim to a $9.5 million flash loan attack that drained its liquidity pools. Ionic also experienced an $8.5 million loss after exploiters compromised a private key, gaining unauthorized access to wallets and transferring funds externally.

Part of the development deal includes plans for an 830,000-square-meter facility used to house and host blockchain, crypto, and Web3 firms. Maldives sits between Africa, Asia, and Australia.

The project's total funding will exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Maldives, which is around $7 billion annually. Pro-crypto Democrats pull support for stablecoin bill in last minute A group of US Senate Democrats known for supporting the crypto industry have said they would oppose a Republican-led stablecoin bill if it moves forward in its current form. The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico. Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made. Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.

This surge in accumulation has caught the eye of many in the crypto community. Could this lead to a strong upward trend for these coins? Find out which cryptocurrencies might be on the brink of notable growth and what this could mean for the market. Cardano: Surge Over Six Months with Recent One-Month Correction Cardano experienced a decline of 0.71% in the past week but has grown by 7.67% in the last month and risen by 115.33% over the past six months. The price data reflects a trend of steady growth, with short-term fluctuations indicating that the coin has gained significant momentum. Despite this impressive performance, recent trends show a mild correction, creating a potential shift in market sentiment. Currently, the coin trades between $0.547 and $0.781, with resistance around $0.88 and a further level at $1.11. Support levels are identified at 0.41 dollars and a lower level near $0.18. The indicators suggest a lack of a clear trend, with bulls attempting to break above $0.88 while bears may look to test the $0.41 support for short-term opportunities. Polkadot Price Momentum Hits Key Levels Amid Market Adjustments DOT experienced a modest 1.23% decline over the past month with a sharper weekly dip near 5.87%. A 6.65% gain over the last six months signals underlying strength. Price action has ranged between $3.41 and $4.54, reflecting a mix of corrections and gradual build-up over time. Current levels place immediate support at $2.77 and resistance at $5.03, with further limits at $1.64 and $6.16. The coin shows neither a clear bullish nor bearish trend, as indicators signal a mix. Traders may find opportunities by watching these critical levels for a reversal or continuation pattern, especially with expectations for broader altcoin season enthusiasm. Conclusion Recent movements in the crypto market show increased accumulation of ADA and DOT by large holders. This often indicates strong confidence from major investors. Such behavior has historically preceded significant price rises for these coins. If past trends are any guide, ADA and DOT may be on the verge of entering a bullish phase. This could present a notable opportunity for those tracking market dynamics and looking for broader growth signals. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While giants like Cardano (ADA), Floki (FLOKI), and Toncoin (TON) have carved their niches, all eyes are on an underdog that’s performing well, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.025, MUTM is rapidly gaining traction, and experts predict a jaw-dropping 60x upside as it disrupts the DeFi market. Its decentralized lending platform is already turning heads, attracting over 9,400 investors and raising more than $7.5 million in its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token is set to climb to $0.03 in Phase 5, a 20% increase, before its projected launch at $0.06. For Phase 4 participants, that could mean a 140% return on investment. Cardano, Floki, and Toncoin: Strong Coins for Crypto Growth in 2025 Cardano (ADA), sitting at around $0.69, remains the long-term investor’s favorite as far as scalability and sustainability are concerned in blockchain technology. As a focus on smart contracts and decentralized applications, ADA has an incredibly solid groundwork that continues to make it center stage, especially with upcoming improvements. Floki (FLOKI), however, sitting at a paltry $0.000084, has been rapidly developing a passionate following, all due to its highly community-centric approach and ever-growing ecosystem. Its meme-based origins combined with novel utility projects cause it to possess vast growth potential. Lastly, Toncoin (TON) at $3.19 is also cementing itself as one of the leading decentralized networks with great speed and scalability. As all these projects toil towards milestone milestones, their growth trends in 2025 are optimistic. But of course, they all have great futures, and investors need to keep an eye out for future alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is going to cause a stir in the next couple of months. Presale Momentum Builds in Phase 4 The excitement around Mutuum Finance keeps building as its presale gains traction. Selling at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token has already attracted strong interest from more than 9,400 participants and continues to pull in capital, crossing the $7.5 million mark. With the next phase set to raise the token price by 20%, early investors are positioning themselves for significant gains. To further boost user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently rolled out a new dashboard that features a live leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those ranked in the top 50 will be eligible for bonus tokens, adding a gamified twist that not only incentivizes holding but also builds community loyalty and long-term participation. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is breaking new ground in decentralized lending by combining the benefits of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models into a single, powerful hybrid framework. In the P2C model, users can earn passive income by staking stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-managed liquidity pools, while also enabling fast, permissionless borrowing for others. On the other side, the P2P option eliminates intermediaries altogether, letting borrowers and lenders negotiate directly and privately. This dual-model setup brings a higher level of decentralization, flexibility, and efficiency. Whether you’re a cautious investor looking for predictable returns or someone seeking more control and yield, Mutuum Finance offers a tailored solution that meets both ends of the risk spectrum. It’s a DeFi platform built for inclusivity and autonomy, two pillars the current financial system often lacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set for 60x upside, currently priced at $0.025. With $7.5 million raised from 9,400+ investors, the token is set to rise to $0.03 in phase 5 and $0.06 at launch, offering 140% ROI for early investors. While ADA, FLOKI, and TON have growth potential, Mutuum’s unique hybrid lending model and gamified incentives make it a standout. Get in now before it’s too late.

However, the altcoin failed to end the month in profit, making April its fourth consecutive month with a negative performance. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum price seems to be sitting above a crucial support level, which could determine the altcoin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. ETH Price At Risk Of Falling To $1,772 In a May 3 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the price of Ethereum might be at a critical juncture that could decide its short-term future. Based on the latest on-chain data, the altcoin is at risk of falling to around $1,500 should it lose this support level in the coming days. This on-chain evaluation of the Ethereum price revolves around the average cost bases of several Ethereum investors. In crypto trading, cost-basis analysis determines a price level’s capacity to serve as support or resistance based on the volume of coins last acquired by investors in the region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally As shown in the above chart, the size of the dot (green and red) represents and directly corresponds to the number of Ether tokens bought within a price region. The larger the circle, the higher the amount of tokens bought in and around the price zone, and the stronger the resistance or support level. According to data from IntoTheBlock, more than 6.36 million ETH tokens were purchased by 4.5 million addresses within the price range of $1,772 and $1,824 (at an average price of $1,799). As explained earlier, the high buying activity within this price zone has led to the formation of a major support level just beneath the current price. The Ethereum price is expected to bounce back when it falls to this level. The rationale behind this expectation is that when the ETH price returns to around $1,772, investors with their cost bases in and around this level are likely to defend their positions by buying more tokens, helping the price to stay afloat the support region. However, the highlighted chart shows that the price levels beneath the $1,772 support level have significantly less investor activity. This suggests that the Ethereum price could fall to around $1,500 without catching a break if $1,772 is breached. On the flip side, the price of ETH could travel to as high as $2,100 if this support level remains unbreached, as no significant resistance lies ahead. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ETH token is valued at around $1,830, reflecting an almost 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

While the Pi price trend remains range-bound and the latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update shows a strong 100% rebound from April lows, a separate opportunity is quietly gaining traction. BlockDAG , through its 25% referral program, offers a practical route to crypto earnings without mining, staking, or direct buying, positioning itself as a candidate for the best long-term crypto opportunity. Even without purchasing BDAG, users can earn 25% of any referral-driven sale. There’s no need for technical setup or upfront capital. Sharing a referral link is all it takes. With over $225 million already raised and the coin currently priced at $0.0019, BlockDAG’s ecosystem, including the X1 mining app and its upcoming mainnet, offers more than just presale hype. This referral phase won’t last, and once BDAG launches on exchanges, these earnings vanish. How BlockDAG’s Referral Bonus Delivers Crypto Without Buying BlockDAG simplifies crypto earnings. No technical knowledge required, no purchases needed. Its 25% referral reward allows anyone to earn BDAG tokens by inviting others. Priced at $0.0019 and aiming for a $0.05 listing, the value of these referral bonuses could multiply significantly. With the presale entering its final phase, the offer is time-sensitive and potentially high-impact. A Telegram post outlines one user’s experience. After purchasing $1,000 in BDAG, the user shared a referral link across several groups. Within a week, referrals brought in $4,000 in purchases, earning the original user $1,000 in BDAG, over 526,000 coins, without further action. This kind of reward structure is usually reserved for early buyers or project insiders, yet BlockDAG has opened it to the public. In parallel, BlockDAG’s presale continues gaining momentum. Over $225 million has been secured and 19.6 billion coins have been sold. The $0.0019 price point presents a last-chance entry before the token’s exchange debut. With the X1 mining app active and the full mainnet scheduled for later in 2025, BlockDAG is emerging as a contender for the best long-term crypto , especially while this referral opportunity remains available. Pi Price Trend Signals Consolidation With a Potential Move Ahead The Pi price trend has remained between $0.58 and $0.66, following a sharp drop from March highs near $3.00. This flat trading range reflects indecision in the market, with no clear signals from either buyers or sellers. Support sits at $0.58 and $0.50, while resistance at $0.66 could lead to further upside if breached. With RSI currently at 53 and Bollinger Bands narrowing, a breakout could occur soon, but the direction remains uncertain. On the 4-hour timeframe, a descending triangle is forming. A drop below $0.58 may push the price down toward $0.48 or even $0.40. Conversely, early signs of bullish strength, like rising volume and a MACD crossover, are appearing. However, without major ecosystem developments or exchange activity, the Pi price trend could remain range-bound in the short term. The next few weeks will likely determine its near-term trajectory. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Update Shows Strong Recovery & Potential Upside The latest Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update reveals a sharp recovery, with HYPE climbing from below $10 to nearly $20. This rally followed a breakout above $13.55, ending a multi-week downtrend. The move above the Ichimoku Cloud and confirmation of a MACD bullish crossover both suggest that bullish momentum could continue. A break above the $21.07 resistance level could set up a short-term target of $23.84. Supporting metrics include Open Interest surpassing $600 million, signaling increased participation and market confidence. The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator remains in positive territory, reflecting ongoing buying strength. That said, the $14.37 support level, aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, remains a critical floor. Should that break, downside risks could increase. Still, current sentiment in the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update leans bullish, and market watchers are eyeing a clean break above $21 to confirm the next leg up. Key Insights! The Pi price trend remains stuck in consolidation, with $0.66 and $0.58 acting as critical levels. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) price update shows solid recovery momentum, pointing to a possible climb toward $23.84. Both assets are being watched closely, but neither offers the same accessible upside as BlockDAG’s referral campaign. With a 25% bonus structure that doesn’t require upfront spending, BlockDAG is providing one of the most effective passive crypto setups currently available. Just sharing a link can deliver sizable rewards, and with BDAG priced at $0.0019 and aiming for $0.05 on launch, those earnings could grow significantly. With over $225 million raised and a mainnet on the horizon, the current phase could close quickly. For anyone evaluating the best long-term crypto , BlockDAG’s referral bonus presents a low-risk, high-reward entry before listings begin.

The global crypto exchange recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Kyrgyzstan’s National Agency for Investments. This agreement opens the door to crypto payments, better financial education, and support for new Web3 projects in the region. Kyrgyzstan Taps Binance for Crypto Push The MoU was signed during the first meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets. Interestingly, President Sadyr Japarov attended the event. This high-profile presence shows that the government is committed to crypto and blockchain growth and innovation. As part of the signed agreement, the trading platform will help introduce its subsidiary BPay Global service in Kyrgyzstan. This payment platform enables fast and secure crypto payments, even across borders. Earlier in April, Binance BPay Global secured a payment license in Bahrain . The approval marks a big step for Binance’s push into regulated markets, allowing it to offer more fiat-related services. BPay Global’s debut in Kyrgyzstan is a big step for the country, which looks to become a major player in the digital world of Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union. In a recent statement, Farhat Iminov, Head of the National Agency for Investments, said the partnership will bring innovation and economic growth to Kyrgyzstan. Binance Regional Head Kyrylo Khomiakov added that the company is excited to work with the Kyrgyz government to unlock new opportunities through blockchain technology . Binance To Educate Kyrgyzstan on Digital Finance Binance’s educational arm, Binance Academy, will collaborate with local organizations to promote crypto literacy. The program will teach Kyrgyz citizens about digital currencies, Web3, and the risks and benefits of using crypto safely. The initiative aims to support local startups and encourage the development of new blockchain-powered businesses by improving financial education. A Growing Global Trend Kyrgyzstan’s deal with Binance is part of a growing global movement in the crypto industry. More countries are working closely with big crypto companies to build digital economies. This comes as governments are beginning to view crypto and blockchain technologies as a way to improve financial systems, support local businesses, and give people better access to digital tools. This is especially common in developing countries, where many people do not have access to traditional banking. By teaming up with crypto companies, these countries hope to bring more people into the financial system and create new job opportunities through blockchain and Web3 projects.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $850 to $880K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors a chance to position early—before the spotlight finds it.

XRP Surges & Solana Aims for $176,https://thecoinrise.com/early-entry-into-unstakeds-presale-could-deliver-27x-returns-xrp-surges-solana-aims-for-176/,"Crypto activity in May 2025 is not being driven by blind excitement, it’s backed by platforms showing real use and measurable progress. Ripple is expanding fast across Asia and the Middle East, placing XRP in a strong position to regain its role in international payments. At the same time, Solana’s growth in the DeFi and NFT space is reviving confidence after a long stretch of sideways action. Still, neither is shifting the crypto structure the way Unstaked is. With XRP entering the global remittance space and Solana regaining strength in DeFi, Unstaked is steadily building the first AI-driven crypto workforce where intelligent agents can post, respond, and scale engagement across social platforms. Its presale sits at just $0.006695, offering unmatched early access to a project built for the Web3 AI era. In a market that’s demanding real results, Unstaked isn’t chasing trends, it’s setting new ones. XRP Builds Momentum With Expanding Ecosystem and Global Reach Ripple continues gaining attention as it adds key partnerships across Asia and the Middle East, focusing on the massive cross-border transaction market. These efforts have led to a wave of strong on-chain activity for XRP, with more than 650 million tokens moved in just one day, pointing to rising network demand. XRP’s recent move beyond the $2.20 resistance has pushed it to around $2.27, where it remains strong above both the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Analysts think this movement may signal a lasting shift in trend rather than just a short-term rally. If positive momentum holds, XRP may be headed toward the $2.50 and $2.85 targets. With use cases growing and price trends supporting the move, XRP could become one of the key players in the upcoming crypto cycle. Solana Prepares for a Rally With Strong DeFi and Price Action Solana (SOL) is seeing steady growth in both its value and its ecosystem, supported by institutional backing and rising user activity. After briefly dipping to $148, the coin has remained stable following a 10% increase over the past week, boosted by the market’s optimistic mood. Its DeFi scene is expanding quickly, with platforms like Drift Protocol and MarginFi reporting all-time high engagement. Adding to this momentum, DeFi Dev Corp’s recent $9.8 million SOL acquisition shows serious capital confidence. From a technical view, Solana’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders formation could send it toward $176 if the $150 level is retaken. With solid backing from its 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, experts say Solana may soon outpace Ethereum in DeFi and NFTs. The upward trend is likely to continue as new partners and liquidity come in. Unstaked’s $0.006695 Presale Builds a Full AI Agent System Before Launch Unstaked is rising as one of the most compelling crypto projects going into 2025. The project is now in Stage 2 of its presale, with each unit priced at just $0.006695. Unlike others focused on hype, Unstaked brings practical AI use cases from the start. The platform will allow people to launch smart AI agents across social apps like X and Telegram after the project’s official launch. These are not ordinary bots, they react to real data, adapt to feedback, and actively grow social groups. Every step they take is recorded through Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, which only rewards agents who show strong results. With a planned launch value of $0.1819, current supporters are looking at around 2,700% potential gains based on real tools, not empty promises. Fair design is central to Unstaked. There are no private sales, no early deals for firms, and 60% of all supply is open to public buyers. The project also includes a $20 million liquidity pool, and agent tools will be available as soon as Unstaked goes live. Instead of waiting passively, users get to take part in a working system that ties AI with on-chain earning. In a market filled with hype, Unstaked stands out for offering something that performs and rewards based on action. Final Thoughts! XRP is showing strength with its global partnerships, and Solana’s ecosystem push is making real progress, but the greatest upside appears to be with Unstaked. While others refine old models, Unstaked is setting up a decentralized system where AI actions are rewarded, creating new ways for users to earn actively. With its presale still at $0.006695 and a future listing price near $0.1819, the chance to gain 2,700% puts Unstaked far ahead of many competing projects. As the crypto space moves into a phase where working products matter more than talk, Unstaked could take the lead as one of the top-performing crypto projects of 2025.

Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction as one of the most talked-about early-stage opportunities. For those working with a modest investment of $180 , these names offer a compelling blend of established performance and high-upside potential. MAGACOINFINANCE – A Rising Altcoin With Early-Stage Momentum While legacy coins anchor portfolios, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a serious early-stage contender. With a growing base of supporters and increasing visibility across media and social channels, the project is drawing comparisons to early successes in previous market cycles. Now backed by over $7.8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE is executing a deliberate strategy—building infrastructure, expanding community engagement, and preparing for its public listing. Early investors can claim a 50% token bonus by using the promo code MAGA50X at checkout. Cardano, Sei, and Optimism Reflect Broader Strength Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.67 , up over 15% in the past week. It’s gaining technical strength, crossing key moving averages and supported by a record 130,000+ smart contracts deployed across its ecosystem. Sei (SEI) , priced at $0.208 , is enjoying a 4.52% daily uptick, with 127% growth in trading volume. Its steady $415 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) signals consistent ecosystem participation and investor confidence. Optimism (OP) is navigating a scheduled token unlock of 31.34 million OP , valued above $24 million . Despite the short-term implications, the network’s core metrics show rising activity and recovery trends, positioning it well for future growth. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, Cardano, Sei, and Optimism showing solid performance, and MAGACOINFINANCE rapidly gaining attention, the market is offering diverse pathways for upside. For investors working with an entry-level allocation of $180 , a combination of established strength and strategic early positioning could generate meaningful returns.

The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is setting sights on $2,100, if ETH can keep its footing above $1,800. At the same time, Ripple news about a major 1 billion XRP token unlock, valued at $2.2 billion, is creating concerns. Even though much of it may be relocked, the immediate impact has already pushed XRP lower. While these major names navigate their next moves, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention through a different channel. Its just-launched podcast series is giving the public a peek into its strategy, building serious trust, and powering a presale that has already crossed $225 million. It’s no wonder it’s being counted among the top-rated crypto currencies right now. Ethereum (ETH) Price Forecast Hints at Bullish Continuation The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast comes with growing confidence. ETH is holding above $1,800 after shaking off a tough Q1. Now, a bullish flag is forming, and analysts are eyeing a breakout toward $2,100 if ETH can clear the $1,850 level. Institutional interest is picking up too, with $183 million flowing into ETH-based ETFs just last week. If Ethereum maintains this momentum and crosses the $2,000 mark, the next resistance zones could be within striking distance soon. Ripple News: Token Unlock Sparks Uncertainty Fresh Ripple news is making waves as traders brace for a massive token unlock. On May 1, Ripple is set to release 1 billion XRP, worth over $2.2 billion. This move has already sparked a 2.78% drop in XRP’s price, bringing it to $2.23. Even though Ripple typically relocks most of the unlocked tokens, the short-term selling pressure is already showing. The focus is now on Ripple (26) and Ripple (27), two mostly dormant wallets scheduled to release large amounts of XRP. Even if the impact is short-lived, the event is raising market sensitivity. On top of that, the SEC’s delayed decision on a Ripple ETF is also adding to the uncertainty. BlockDAG’s New Podcast Series Gives Buyers a Backstage Pass BlockDAG (BDAG) is cranking up the volume with its newly launched official podcast series, adding a fresh layer of transparency and connection for its fast-growing community. Each episode pulls back the curtain, diving deep into the project’s roadmap, upcoming exchange listings, and its ambitious plans for long-term expansion. This podcast drop joins a powerful lineup of updates that continue to keep BlockDAG in the spotlight, from live AMAs and major keynote drops to a presale model built on credibility. Now in Batch 28, BDAG is up for grabs at a limited-time rate of just $0.0019 until May 13, a steep markdown from the usual $0.0262 batch price. With launch projections set at $0.05, this offer stands out as one of the best entry prices seen this year. The numbers speak for themselves: over $225 million raised, 19.6 billion coins sold, and early holders enjoying a 2,520% gain, all before listings even go live. But this podcast isn’t just another update. It’s a key part of BlockDAG’s long-term strategy, offering a level of openness rarely seen in crypto. That’s exactly why BlockDAG is being counted among the top rated crypto currencies to watch in 2025. Final Thoughts The Ethereum (ETH) price forecast is sticking to the $2,100 mark, driven by strong ETF inflows and a bullish technical pattern. Holding above $1,800 remains key. Meanwhile, Ripple news is shaking things up. The 1 billion XRP unlock may be short-lived in impact, but it’s already unsettling the market. BlockDAG, though, is on its own track. Instead of waiting on market events, it’s building trust and talking directly to its users. That’s something even the biggest names haven’t nailed yet. With the presale still open at $0.0019 until May 13 and over $225 million raised already, the window to get in early is closing fast. For those looking beyond just charts and hype, BlockDAG is proving it has what it takes to be one of the top-rated crypto currencies for the years ahead.

Recent market trends suggest these digital currencies could be set for a significant rise. Investors might find intriguing opportunities as the bullish momentum gathers pace. This article delves into the factors driving this potential growth and what might be on the horizon for these promising assets. Sui Price Rally Amid Mixed Signals Past month data shows a 40.90% surge and a 72.47% rise over six months, while a weekly decline of 9.34% hints at short-term pullbacks. A notable upward trend has been building, reflecting strong market interest and consistent gains over the observed periods. SUI current prices range from $2.19 to $4.34 with immediate resistance at $5.18 and additional resistance at $7.34, while support is near $0.87. Indicators show a subtle mix, with the Awesome Oscillator at $0.81 and RSI at 58.88, while momentum slightly dips to -0.15. Bulls have influence as prices edge higher, but caution is warranted within these key levels for potential trading opportunities. Upgrading XRP for a Bullish Move XRP price action over the past month shows a modest gain of around 7.06%, building on a remarkable 338.86% surge over the last six months. Performance reflects steady investor interest and price recovery after past dips, with activity increasing as the coin consolidates gains. Recent movements indicate that XRP’s historical volatility has calmed, leading to tighter trading ranges and renewed market trust. Currently, XRP trades within a range of $1.75 to $2.50, with key resistance at $2.80 and a secondary barrier at $3.55 while finding primary support near $1.31 and lower support at $0.56. Bulls are edging in control within these levels, though no clear trend has fully emerged. Traders might explore entries at support zones and consider exits or buys near resistance if upward pressure holds. Conclusion The outlook for SUI and XRP appears promising. Both coins show potential for growth in the near term. SUI has been gaining attention due to recent developments. XRP is benefiting from positive market trends and increased adoption. Investors might consider these factors when evaluating their portfolios. The potential for upward movement makes these assets worth watching.

Projects that show real-world use, not just flashy whitepapers, are starting to separate themselves from the noise. And with digital tools becoming vital for creators, professionals, and businesses across Latin America and beyond, more community members are paying close attention to platforms that solve problems, not just promise moonshots. One name standing out is Qubetics . Even while still in presale, it’s generating buzz for its practical applications and layered tech architecture. At the same time, well-established contenders like Theta and Story(IP) are holding their ground as reliable alternatives to traditional investment tools—particularly in the content, streaming, and IP ownership sectors. Let’s break down why each is worth watching, and why these three are among the Top Cryptos to Join Now. Qubetics (TICS): Built for Cross-Border Simplicity, It’s One of the Top Cryptos to Join Now Forget the hassle of international wire transfers, foreign transaction fees, or days of delay just to move money between countries. Qubetics is changing that game with its seamless Cross-Border Transactions feature—built right into its blockchain architecture. Imagine a small digital agency in Medellín working with clients in Texas or Madrid. Instead of waiting days for traditional bank transfers or paying up to 10% in fees, they can receive funds instantly and securely using Qubetics’ multi-chain infrastructure. For freelancers, digital nomads, e-commerce vendors, and remote teams across Latin America, this isn’t just helpful—it’s revolutionary. The feature works by leveraging decentralized liquidity pools and smart routing to enable low-fee, real-time transactions across borders. No central authority. No risk of being blocked or delayed. Just peer-to-peer value movement—on-chain and on-demand. That utility alone puts Qubetics in a different bracket compared to most early-stage blockchain projects. That’s exactly why it’s being called one of the Top Cryptos to Join Now—because it’s already delivering something users want and need, not just building for potential down the road. Presale Performance and ROI Projections Let’s talk numbers. The crypto presale is in stage 32. More than 510 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 25,600 token holders, raising $16.6 million and counting. The current presale price sits at $0.2093 per token. Those who joined at stage 1? They got in at $0.01 and are already looking at a 1993% return. But here’s the kicker—there’s still room to run. Right now, buyers entering at $0.2093 could see: $TICS at $1 = 377% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2,288% ROI $TICS at $6 = 2,766% ROI $TICS at $10 = $,677% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet = 7,066% ROI This isn’t just a speculative jump. It’s backed by tech, traction, and timing. Qubetics is delivering a working product to a market that’s been underserved for too long. That’s what makes it one of the most credible early-stage projects on the radar right now. Theta: Reinventing Video Streaming with Decentralized Infrastructure When it comes to decentralized streaming, Theta Network is the name that keeps coming up—and for good reason. This project is laser-focused on changing the way video content is delivered, shifting the model away from costly, centralized servers and toward a peer-powered mesh of users who share bandwidth and storage in exchange for rewards. That’s not just some nerdy backend feature—it has real implications for creators and platforms. Think of an indie streamer in Buenos Aires or a small film studio in Mexico City. Instead of relying on YouTube’s algorithm or Twitch’s monetization policies, they can build directly on Theta’s infrastructure and reach their audience on their own terms. The protocol allows users to earn tokens by relaying video content to others, which reduces the load on content delivery networks (CDNs) and dramatically cuts costs. Big names have already bought into the ecosystem—Samsung, Sony, Google, and Lionsgate have explored or partnered with Theta in various capacities, showing it has institutional respect to go along with grassroots energy. Theta’s TFUEL and THETA tokens power this network, enabling everything from payments to governance. And the community continues to grow, with developers building decentralized video platforms, NFT tools for creators, and live events infrastructure—all fueled by Theta’s protocol. Theta is doing more than talking about decentralization—it’s actively reshaping how creators interact with their audiences. It’s one of the few projects that has consistently shipped, delivered, and partnered with major players. Story(IP): Where Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property For anyone who’s ever created a song, written a story, or filmed a short documentary, ownership is everything. That’s where Story(IP) comes in. This project is building a decentralized platform for managing, validating, and monetizing intellectual property in the digital age. Story(IP) turns content into verified on-chain assets. Whether it’s a script for a telenovela, a comic series, or an indie track from a DJ in Mexico City, creators can mint their work on Story(IP), timestamp it, and prove ownership without depending on centralised systems or expensive third-party registrars. This is especially relevant in regions where copyright enforcement can be slow, costly, or unreliable. For creators in Latin America, Story(IP) becomes a digital notary—a trustless proof of originality and origin. The platform also integrates token-based monetization options, allowing creators to fractionalize their content, license it to studios, or even crowdfund their next project—all on-chain. Its community-first model appeals to both indie creators and established producers, bridging a gap between creative freedom and blockchain verification. And as global interest in digital identity and intellectual property grows, Story(IP) is positioning itself as the go-to chain for protecting what people make. Intellectual property is a trillion-dollar industry—and Story(IP) is giving it a decentralized home. Its relevance is growing every week, and its tools are empowering creators globally to take back control of their work. Final Thoughts Theta and Story(IP) are both tackling billion-dollar industries—streaming and IP ownership—with tech that empowers users and decentralizes legacy systems. They’ve earned their places as top-tier alternatives to traditional digital infrastructure. But Qubetics? That’s where the doors are still open for early entry. It’s not only providing cross-border payment rails that make sense for freelancers, businesses, and creators—but it’s also offering one of the most generous ROI potentials of any legit presale in the space right now. For those who’ve been watching and waiting for a project that mixes purpose, utility, and timing, this might be it. This week, if the search is for top cryptos to join now , these three belong on that shortlist. But one of them still has a front-row seat available—Qubetics.

Bitcoin and XRP are already legends in their own right. Solana continues expanding across Web3. And Ethereum (ETH) remains central to everything from smart contracts to institutional adoption. But now, one name is quietly joining that elite conversation: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Momentum is rising, and the real question now is whether one of these five tokens could deliver that rare multi-million-dollar return for those positioned early enough. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Catching Fire—and the Early Signs Are Hard to Ignore It’s easy to miss the early signals—until it’s too late. But right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing every indicator of a breakout in motion. Wallet counts are ticking upward fast. Community growth is unfolding naturally, without gimmicks. And on-chain trackers are beginning to highlight MAGACOINFINANCE as one of the few early-stage plays with meaningful activity and traction. This isn’t temporary attention. It’s foundational progress—and those entering now may be catching the inflection point before the next phase begins. Rising Players to Watch: Kaspa, Polkadot, and Their Growing Ecosystems Kaspa is gaining ground with a high-speed, proof-of-work blockDAG model that’s built for real-time payments and scalable infrastructure. Polkadot continues leading the way in cross-chain functionality, giving developers the tools to launch scalable projects across a multi-chain future. Both names have real utility—but when it comes to asymmetric upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for its early strength and rising investor activity. Final Word Could $2.1 million truly be within reach? History suggests that those who moved early on Bitcoin , Solana , Ethereum , and XRP made that a reality. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is stepping into that same conversation—with speed, structure, and growing conviction behind it.

Per the South Korean media outlet Digital Daily , officials think 16.3 million South Koreans have previously or currently own cryptoassets. Their data is based on the number of crypto wallets and linked bank accounts held on the nation’s five fiat-trading crypto exchanges at the end of February this year. South Korean Presidential Elections: Crypto a Key Battleground The media outlet noted that the South Korean political world is now “putting considerable effort” into making pledges about ways to boost crypto market growth. South Korean Presidential Candidate Kim Moon-soo (center) with senior People Power Party officials at an event on May 3. (Source: News1 TV/YouTube) In late April, Kim caused a storm in the crypto community. The candidate said he would “allow government agencies such as the National Pension Service (NPS) and the Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) to invest in virtual assets.” The NPS is the world’s third-largest pension fund. The KIC is the nation’s sovereign wealth fund. The media outlet noted that, should the NPS and the KIC start directly investing in BTC and other cryptoassets, the move would “further enhance the crypto market’s reputation.” On April 27, Kim said: “Considering the changes in the domestic and international economic environment, we can no longer deny the existence of virtual assets.” The former labor minister said that he would “foster” the “important” domestic crypto industry if he wins power on June 3. Democratic Party (DP) presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung appealed for support during a visit to Yeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Sunday, asking, “What did I do so wrong?” https://t.co/YF27ZsVGkG — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) May 4, 2025 Kim told attendees at the People Power Party convention in KINTEX in Goyang on May 3: “Many young people make money with virtual assets. But some young people lose money on their purchases. I will try to make the market more stable by institutionalizing it.” Rival Party Also ‘Crypto-keen’ The PPP and its biggest rival, the Democratic Party, have also talked up the possible approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs. Late last month, the PPP unveiled seven crypto-related policies ahead of June 3’s poll . The party says it will move to scrap restrictive banking rules for crypto exchanges. It has also promised to speed up the process of allowing corporations to buy BTC and other coins with their balance sheets. Kim Moon-soo, a former labor minister and a candidate for the presidential nomination of the People Power Party, promised to extend the Great Train eXpress (GTX) railway network to five metropolitan areas within his term as president, if elected. https://t.co/ZBWpUwkMqK — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) April 21, 2025 The DP has also unveiled its own set of crypto policies. Some senior party officials claim they want to establish a national strategic crypto reserve . Both parties have claimed that they will institutionalize crypto and security tokens if they are elected. DP candidate Lee Jae-myung has said relatively little on crypto-related matters in the run-up to the June poll. The Democratic Party Presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung. (Source: Lee Jae-myung/YouTube/Screenshot) But other DP officials, including many close to Lee, have spoken publicly about plans to launch a new crypto regulator. Some also want to let domestic firms issue stablecoins. Mixed Opinions on Manifesto Promises South Korean crypto insiders have reacted to the pledges with a mixture of caution and optimism. The same media outlet wrote that the industry was “greatly encouraged” by the parties’ “unanimous” support for market-friendly polices. South Korea's conservatives pick hardline Kim Moon-soo as presidential candidate https://t.co/AhdzBkNbbu https://t.co/AhdzBkNbbu — Reuters (@Reuters) May 3, 2025 However, some will recall that candidates made similar pledges in the lead-up to the 2022 and 2024 elections. Following the polls, however, only a small fraction of these manifesto promises were later turned into laws. An unnamed official from a major domestic crypto exchange was quoted as saying: “Institutionalization plans have been a major disappointment for the industry so far. So in that respect, the candidates’ pledges are a very positive sign. However, we will have to wait and see if these pledges are actually put into action after the election.” The post South Korean Presidential Hopeful Wants to Let State Pension Fund Buy BTC appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Politics|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-04 23:30:00

This move comes as President Donald Trump’s administration’s regulatory policies become less stringent and clearer. Deribit has built its reputation as a leading platform for crypto options. Last year, the company processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume. However, the exchange is now looking beyond its Dubai base to explore new opportunities in the United States. Why Deribit Is Looking to Enter the US Market Deribit’s CEO, Luuk Strijers, revealed why the exchange is considering entering the US market. Strijers believes that the US is becoming more supportive of the crypto industry, as there are recent changes in the country’s crypto regulations. These relaxed crypto rules come after crypto firms in the country have faced challenges over the past few years. Under Joe Biden’s administration, regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) cracked down on industry. However, with President Trump’s administration, the regulatory environment is changing. The president has promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the world.” Since his electoral victory in November 2024, the SEC has paused or dropped several enforcement actions against crypto companies. Additionally, the DOJ recently dissolved its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a more relaxed approach. Deribit’s Potential Deal with Coinbase The news of Deribit’s US expansion comes alongside reports that Coinbase, a leading US-based crypto exchange, is in talks to acquire Deribit. According to a recent report, both companies have notified Dubai’s regulators about the deal. Coinbase would need to transfer Deribit’s operating license to the US if the deal goes through. This move could strengthen Coinbase’s position in the global crypto market. This potential deal shows the growing interest in the crypto derivatives market, which is becoming more competitive. Kraken, a leading asset manager, is also making moves in this space. The company recently acquired NinjaTrader in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Growing Confidence in the US Market Deribit’s potential move into the US reflects the broader trend, as the regulatory shift is positively impacting the industry. Companies that once left the US due to regulatory uncertainty are rethinking their strategies. OKX, a major crypto exchange, has announced plans to set up a U.S. headquarters in California, just months after settling a significant legal case with the US authorities. Meanwhile, Nexo, which exited the US in 2022 , has announced its return to the market in response to the more favorable conditions. Other notable players, such as DWF Lab and Wintermute, are also eyeing US expansion , further demonstrating the growing confidence in the US market.

Curve Finance is a stablecoin-focused ecosystem, specializing in the efficient and low-slippage trading of dollar-pegged crypto assets. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid is a layer-1 protocol serving a decentralized exchange (DEX). Says Altcoin Sherpa, “But if you’re an investor that relies on these types of fundamentals, there are a few good ones like CRV and HYPE, those charts look pretty solid overall .” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $20.55 Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, CRV is worth $0.697. Turning to the memecoin Bonk ( BONK ), the trader says he plans to accumulate the altcoin at current levels. “Staying patient for BONK and would love to buy in the green box if it gives.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.0000164. As for Bitcoin, the trader says BTC looks bullish on the high time frame after the crypto king retested the $74,000 level as support. “Higher time frame view of BTC: higher low formed in that chop period, it was similar to that May 2021 area where price formed a low. I think it’s a great low given the amount of time (two months) and volatility that we saw. While there are going to be some small pullbacks, I think we strongly break $100,000 in the next several weeks as long as equities don’t completely sh** the bed (sadly, I see a lot of lower high / it’s over type of posts).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,921.

Here’s what sets Ruvi apart: Fixed Supply, Rising Value Unlike inflationary tokens, Ruvi caps its total supply at 1.5 billion tokens , ensuring scarcity will drive long-term value as demand grows. AI Meets Real-World Blockchain Applications Ruvi isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that uses artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems in logistics, predictive analytics, and even clean energy. While Cardano adds wallet features, Ruvi aims to redefine global industries. Early Investor Incentives You Won’t Find Elsewhere Ruvi’s presale includes jaw-dropping bonuses of up to 100% , giving early backers an unmatched edge before the token even hits major exchanges. The Ruvi Presale Advantage By joining Ruvi’s presale, you’ll gain access to tokens priced at a mere $0.01 apiece and receive significant bonuses based on your investment level. Here’s how quickly your investment can skyrocket: A Modest $500 Stake Investing $500 gives you 50,000 Ruvi tokens , priced at $0.01 each. Add the 40% bonus , and you walk away with 70,000 tokens . When Ruvi hits $1.25 , your holdings surge to $87,500 , marking a 17,500% ROI . A Strategic $7,000 Investment For $7,000, you’ll purchase 700,000 tokens . Ruvi’s 100% bonus boosts your total to 1,400,000 tokens . If Ruvi climbs to $2.00 , your initial commitment transforms into $2,800,000 . That’s a life-changing 40,000% return ! Go Big with $15,000 A high-stakes bet of $15,000 secures you 1.5 million tokens and, with the 100% VIP bonus , doubles your holdings to 3 million tokens . When Ruvi reaches $3.00 , your portfolio skyrockets to $9 million , securing your financial freedom. Why the Timing Is Critical Recent Cardano news highlights how early adopters can ride the wave of innovative blockchain projects. Cardano’s market activity and speculative $1 targets remind us of crypto’s wealth-building potential. However, Ruvi offers a fresh entry point with unparalleled upside. Cardano believers once paid cents for tokens that are now worth many multiples of their original investment. With Ruvi available at just $0.01 per token during presale, the potential to multiply your wealth is staggering. Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late The crypto space rewards those who act decisively. Waiting too long to get in on Ruvi could mean missing the kind of returns that early Cardano investors rave about today.

The most recent Cardano (ADA) price analysis shows $379 million in accumulation, yet the token is still struggling to hold above $1, while transaction fees have dropped 52%. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price outlook appears more optimistic, with the asset hovering near $15.30 as bullish chart signals build, but a breakout remains elusive. Waiting for momentum can mean missed chances. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. One wallet just earned 25.29 million extra BDAG coins through its Buyer Battle event, a windfall potentially worth $1.26 million at launch. With its presale already passing $225.5 million, a clearer picture is forming of where real opportunity might be found. Accumulation Grows for ADA, But Price Still Stalls The latest Cardano (ADA) price analysis indicates strong accumulation, with more than $379 million added over the past seven weeks. ADA recently cleared the $0.60 resistance, but the move hasn’t been sustained. Volume remains light and on-chain activity has slowed, making the upward momentum uncertain. Although past performance hints at upside potential, current conditions are not confirming a trend. Fees on the network have dropped 52% since earlier in the year, reflecting reduced usage. Without stronger fundamentals and increased demand, ADA may continue to struggle to reclaim $1 in the near term. LINK Price Setup Builds as Bulls Eye Key Resistance The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook has improved after a recovery of over 50% from April lows. LINK is now testing the $15.30 mark, where resistance has previously held. Indicators like the SuperTrend and a short-term inverse head-and-shoulders pattern support the possibility of a breakout. On-chain data also shows falling exchange reserves and rising wallet activity, both typically bullish signs. However, to confirm further upside, LINK must convincingly break through the $15.30 level. If that occurs, prices could rise toward $17, and in stronger market conditions, even approach $30. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Offer High Rewards for Daily Top Spenders One wallet recently received 25.29 million BDAG coins during a BlockDAG Buyer Battle, without paying anything beyond their own purchase. The event rewards the top buyer each day if the 24-hour sales goal of 50 million BDAG is not met. On this specific day, only 24.71 million BDAG were sold, leaving 25.29 million unsold. According to the rules, those extra coins went to the day’s highest buyer, wallet 0xbcdc…cfb. The value of this reward becomes more apparent when considered with BlockDAG’s pricing. The current special offer is $0.0019 per coin, even though Batch 28 is listed at $0.0262. The listing price is confirmed at $0.05. That means the 25.29 million bonus BDAG is worth around $1.26 million at launch. This happened as part of a presale that has already raised $225.5 million and sold 19.6 billion BDAG coins. Buyer Battles occur daily. If the 25 million target is not reached, the remaining coins go to that day’s biggest purchaser. The system refreshes every 24 hours, and someone new wins each time. Which Project Holds the Strongest Position for 2025? Based on the current Cardano (ADA) price analysis, strong accumulation hasn’t yet turned into a solid price move, with ADA unable to confidently hold above $0.60. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook is more promising after a 50% rebound, but it still depends on breaching the resistance near $15.30 to continue higher. Both remain contenders for the top crypto for 2025 , but require favorable technical follow-through to realize potential. BlockDAG, in contrast, is already delivering tangible value. Through its Buyer Battle program, a user gained 25.29 million BDAG coins for free. With the $0.0019 special price active until May 13 and a future listing at $0.05, the return potential is substantial. Combined with daily chances to earn additional BDAG without spending more, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious player for those seeking high ROI in 2025.

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

Canada and the EU are strengthening their economic cooperation and free trade through the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Carney stated, “When Canada and the European Union build together, our futures are stronger.” Canada and the EU investigate ways to strengthen their relationship for mutual benefits The cornerstone of the trade relationship between Canada and the EU is the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement which has been applied provisionally since September 2017. CETA has scrapped 98% of tariffs from Canada to the EU and vice versa, greatly facilitating trade. The trade agreement uses a phased strategy described in a tariff dismantling schedule to achieve this elimination. The tariff lines were removed initially, and the remaining ones, which include some grains, seafood products, and passenger cars, are being phased out gradually. This procedure seeks to lower business expenses while boosting Canadian exporters’ and producers’ competitiveness in the EU market. Still, the agreement has yet to be fully ratified in some EU countries, including Belgium and Bulgaria. Mary Ng, Canada’s Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, said on February 8 that Canada was looking to deepen economic ties with the EU while respecting world trade rules in the midst of US threats to impose tariffs . Additionally, since 2017, the EU and Canada have enjoyed the benefits of a free trade agreement that increased bilateral trade by 65% and established a partnership for raw materials in 2021. The recent election of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has added momentum to this transatlantic collaboration . Carney, a former central banker with leadership experience in both Canada and the UK, has pledged to reduce Canada’s economic dependence on the US, which currently accounts for over 75% of Canadian exports. In his victory speech, Carney emphasized the need to pursue closer ties with Europe and Asia, including potential security and trade alliances with the EU. Ng noted that trade agreements are one thing, and they had seen really great numbers, but emphasized the need to explore what more can be done to help Canadian businesses enter any of the 27 EU member states and reciprocate by supporting similar efforts within Canada. She also said the EU would focus on small businesses and strategic minerals. Moreover, to reduce its reliance on China, the EU, particularly, was keen to forge alliances to ensure that Europeans had access to the metals, including cobalt, lithium, and nickel, needed for the energy transition. Further evidence of Canada’s aggressive pursuit of trade agreements in the Indo-Pacific region can be found in the agreements it signed with Ecuador in February and Indonesia in December. The minister also made trips to Australia, Singapore, and Brunei. Ng mentioned, “We are at the table with Southeast Asian countries, so the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. I took a very large delegation of Canadian businesses to the Philippines in December, to Indonesia, to markets like Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, and Korea.” CETA promotes prosperity and economic growth in EU-Canada trade Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said in an X post that she had a conversation with Mark Carney and congratulated him on his election. The occasion, she argued, was a perfect opportunity to highlight the close ties between Canada and the EU and the opportunities that lie ahead. In addition, along with discussing ways to build on the achievements of CETA, she revealed that they had agreed to investigate deeper defense and economic security cooperation. CETA seeks to ensure growth and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, increase trade and investment, and generate jobs. It also contains resolute pledges to protect the environment, uphold labor rights, and promote sustainable development. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find. Of them all, MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one still hidden in plain sight—quietly preparing to lead the next wave.

Smart Money Is Heading To This Token With 65x Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-solana-sol-and-ethereum-eth-still-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-now-smart-money-is-heading-to-this-token-with-65x-potential/,"Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been the darlings of the crypto market, delivering impressive returns and revolutionizing blockchain technology. But as the market matures, smart money is starting to pivot towards a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM is catching the eye of savvy investors who are forecasting a staggering 65x potential in 2025. Currently in Phase 4, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.5 million from more than 9,400 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over half of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. As Ethereum and Solana fight to reclaim their highs, it might be time to shift focus and look at the rising star that promises to disrupt the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major innovator in the decentralized finance world, with a dual-lending model that’s turning heads across the crypto community. By combining both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks in a uniquely integrated system, the project is bringing something genuinely new to the table. With more than 9,300 investors already on board and over $7.5 million raised during the presale, there’s clearly a strong level of trust in the project’s vision. Tokens are still available at $0.025 during Phase 4, but that price is about to jump to $0.03 in the next phase, a 20% increase that reflects growing demand and limited time to get in early. To keep its momentum going and foster long-term loyalty, Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic new dashboard that features a real-time leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those at the top of the board are rewarded with bonus MUTM tokens, creating a fun, competitive edge that helps fuel continued investment and deeper community involvement. This gamified element adds another layer to what’s already proving to be a highly engaging ecosystem. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely, giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly, ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The $100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech—it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. Solana and Ethereum remain strong, but smart money is moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi gem with real utility and 65x potential. With $7.5M raised from 9,400+ investors, MUTM is still just $0.025, but set to rise 20% in Phase 5. Over 50% of Phase 4 is sold, and time is running out.

At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction leans positive, with DOGE pushing against a downward trendline near $0.175. While SHIB and DOGE try to overcome resistance, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already rewarding buyers. Through its daily Buyer Battles, the platform recently awarded 25.29 million BDAG to a single wallet after the day’s sales fell short of the target. With $225.5 million raised, 19.6 billion tokens sold, and a current price of $0.0019 valid through May 13, BlockDAG’s upward move looks increasingly likely. Those who accumulate now could gain significantly, especially if they top the leaderboard and win the next Buyer Battle. SHIB Breaks Out of April Range With New Bullish Momentum After moving between $0.000010 and $0.000014 for most of April, Shiba Inu is now showing signs of renewed interest. A breakout past the $0.000011 neckline has triggered a Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal, supported by increased money flow and a MACD crossover. The 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age has also declined, suggesting that previously inactive coins are now on the move. This shift often comes before upward price trends. However, for the bullish signal to remain intact, SHIB must hold above $0.000015. If successful, the next likely target is $0.000019. DOGE Eyes a Breakout if $0.18 Resistance Gives Way Dogecoin is trading close to $0.175, pressing against a key downward resistance trendline that has limited its progress since February. Based on the current Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction, the coming trading sessions will be critical. If DOGE closes above $0.19, the price structure may shift, allowing targets of $0.21 and $0.24 to come into view, assuming volume increases. However, there is still risk below. A move under $0.167 could push the price toward $0.13, which would undermine the current bullish outlook. Understanding BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles & Why Whales Are Watching Every day, BlockDAG sets a token sale goal. When that target is missed, something unique happens, the unsold tokens go to the top buyer of the day. In one recent round, BlockDAG aimed to sell 50 million BDAG but only moved 24.71 million. The remaining 25.29 million were awarded to the buyer who made the largest single purchase that day. This is the core mechanic of the Buyer Battles. Every 24 hours is another chance to gain much more than what was paid, simply by acting decisively while others hold back. Currently, BlockDAG is in Batch 28, which has a listed price of $0.0262 per coin. But until May 13, the special rate of $0.0019 remains available. The project has raised more than $225.5 million and distributed over 19.6 billion coins, reflecting solid early-stage demand. Participants from Batch 1 have already seen gains as high as 2,520% ROI. And with long-term price projections reaching $1 by 2025, early buyers may be in for significantly higher returns. The daily nature of Buyer Battles makes each day an opportunity to maximize profits. Even without winning the bonus pool, BlockDAG’s ROI and forecasts suggest the project holds serious value. Which Projects Are Worth Watching? Most signals suggest a potential breakout: the Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish signal points toward $0.000019, and the Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction indicates higher levels if resistance near $0.18 breaks. These forecasts are valid, but there are no guarantees. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers measurable results. Its Buyer Battles reward fast movers daily. One wallet recently claimed 25.29 million BDAG in a single win, a direct result of action rather than speculation. Add to that a $0.0019 entry price, only available until May 13, and a projected listing at $1 in 2025, and the case for BlockDAG becomes clear. Among the top crypto coins to watch, this is one with both momentum and reward built in.

Ethereum continues to follow seasonal cycles, with predictable ups and downs that traders can analyze and act upon. Yet beneath the surface, a larger issue is becoming clear. Most of Web3 still overlooks privacy, and that is where Cold Wallet is quietly reshaping the narrative. Ethereum’s historical Easter patterns have sparked curiosity among analysts, especially as the asset dipped to $1,575 in 2025. While these seasonal shifts may guide short-term moves, they do little to address crypto’s growing need for secure, private transactions. Cold Wallet ($CWT), now available in Stage 2 presale at $0.00714 with a projected launch price of $0.35171, offers more than speculative upside. Built from the ground up to protect users, Cold Wallet is fast becoming the preferred choice for those seeking a combination of privacy, regulatory readiness, and genuine long-term utility. Ethereum’s Seasonal Patterns Offer Clues, But Not Solutions Ethereum (ETH) has a long history of shifting prices around Easter, providing useful and repeatable data points for traders. From $2,093 in 2021 to $3,648 in 2024, these Easter periods have marked significant gains as well as sharp losses. In 2025, however, ETH reversed course and dropped to $1,575, once again reminding market watchers that no trend or pattern lasts forever. While these patterns can be insightful, they reflect more about market psychology and timing than true fundamentals. Reduced trading volumes during holidays, speculative positioning, and shifting sentiment are often the real forces behind such movements. The rebound in 2024, for example, likely resulted from bullish sentiment rather than meaningful upgrades to the Ethereum network. Likewise, the 2025 decline suggests broader market uncertainty and growing hesitation among investors. Although spotting these seasonal behaviors can offer an edge to swing traders, they offer little comfort to those focused on projects with deeper staying power. In volatile markets, relying only on patterns is risky and can lead to missed opportunities elsewhere. Ethereum remains vital to the crypto ecosystem in many ways, but price cycles alone should not define a project’s long-term future. Cold Wallet ($CWT) Builds the Private Foundation Web3 Forgot Web3 has made impressive strides, yet privacy remains one of its weakest and most overlooked layers. While decentralized finance, tokenized assets, and dApps continue to evolve, the tools designed to shield users often lag behind. Wallets, which act as the gateways to this digital economy, tend to prioritize convenience and integrations while neglecting the essential need for privacy and control. Cold Wallet is stepping forward to address this gap head-on. Unlike standard hot wallets that quietly track IP addresses, monitor user behavior, and expose transaction histories, Cold Wallet integrates privacy at its core. Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to verify balances, execute stealth transactions, and authenticate without revealing sensitive or traceable data. Privacy is not an add-on here, it is a guiding design principle. At the heart of this privacy-first vision is the $CWT token. It unlocks advanced wallet features and empowers holders to participate in governance decisions. Cold Wallet’s roadmap is also clear and forward-looking. The project targets a Q3 2025 MVP launch, followed by multichain support and major exchange listings by year-end. This ensures $CWT will remain central to a growing privacy ecosystem. Currently in Stage 2 presale at $0.00714 and with a confirmed launch price of $0.35171, Cold Wallet offers early supporters the chance to access a projected 4,900% upside. Beyond potential returns, the project’s dedication to compliance, with full GDPR alignment and KYC/AML infrastructure, makes it appealing to serious long-term participants. Cold Wallet is not chasing headlines or market buzz. Instead, it is carefully building what Web3 has been missing: a secure, private infrastructure that is designed to protect users and thrive as the crypto space matures. Closing Summary Seasonal price trends and meme-driven rallies may generate headlines, but they rarely translate into lasting impact. Cold Wallet offers something fundamentally different. Its approach prioritizes security and privacy, serving users who want full control over their crypto presence without sacrificing usability. Ethereum’s Easter cycles offer short-term opportunities, and projects like it will continue to attract attention during market shifts. However, Cold Wallet focuses on what remains vital no matter the season, protecting user data and enabling safe, compliant crypto access. Priced at $0.00714 during presale and designed for both retail and institutional users, Cold Wallet stands out not because of hype, but because of vision. For those looking beyond price charts to real-world utility, $CWT may be the answer to what truly defines the best crypto right now.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact. Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met. Peterson believes a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index below 18 could trigger a “risk-on environment” favoring Bitcoin. The other crucial points needed for the Bitcoin rally are a fall in interest rates and a solid performance in the above-average performing months of June and July. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 The cryptocurrency markets may remain volatile in the near term as traders await the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision next week . Although the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool projects a low probability of a rate cut on May 7, markets may make a decisive move after the event. Could Bitcoin hold the retest of the $95,000 level? If it does, let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin broke above the $95,000 resistance on May 1, but the bulls failed to sustain the momentum. The price turned down from $97,895 on May 2 and has reached the breakout level of $95,000. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($92,106) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that buyers have the edge. If the price rebounds off the zone between $95,000 and the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the rally above $95,000 may have been a bull trap. That heightens the risk of a drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($86,682). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI has dropped near the midpoint on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a weakening momentum. If the price drops below $95,000, the pair could descend to $92,800 and then to $91,660. A break below $91,660 clears the path for a fall to $86,000. Buyers will have to drive and sustain the price above $97,895 to regain control. The pair could climb to $100,000 and later to $107,000. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is facing resistance at $21.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($18.48) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $21.50 could start the next leg of the up move to $25 and then to $27.50. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA, suggesting profit booking by the short-term bulls. The HYPE/USDT pair could then fall to $17.35, which is likely to act as solid support. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears are defending the $21.50 level, but the bulls have not allowed the price to slip below the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. A solid bounce off the 20-EMA could challenge the overhead hurdle. If the $21.50 level is scaled, the pair could soar toward $25. Instead, if the price breaks the 20-EMA, select short-term buyers may be tempted to book profits. That could sink the pair to the 50-SMA, which is a critical support to keep an eye on. If the level cracks, the pair may descend to $17.35. AAVE price prediction Aave ( AAVE ) turned up from the moving averages on April 30, indicating that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. AAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to push the price to the $196 level, where the bears are expected to sell aggressively. If the price turns down from $196 but finds support at the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break above the overhead resistance increases. The AAVE/USDT pair could then travel to $220 and later to $240. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly pull the price below the moving averages. If they can pull it off, the pair may collapse to $130. AAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair is facing selling near $180, but a positive sign is that the bulls have maintained the price above the moving averages. If the price turns up from the moving averages and breaks above $180, the pair could accelerate toward $196. There is minor resistance at $190, but it is likely to be crossed. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the price down to $155 and subsequently to $150.

RNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($4.31), where the bulls are likely to mount a strong defense. If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, it increases the possibility of a break above $4.87. If that happens, the RNDR/USDT pair could pick up momentum and climb to $6.20. This positive view will be negated in the near term if the price continues to slide and breaks below the $4.22 support. That opens the doors for a fall to the 50-day SMA ($3.80) and, after that, to $3.55. RNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers have pulled the price to the $4.22 support, which is an important support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off $4.22 with strength, it signals a possible range formation in the near term. The pair may swing between $4.22 and $4.87 for some time. A break and close above $4.87 indicates the resumption of the up move toward $5.52. On the contrary, if the price continues lower and breaks below $4.22, it suggests that the bears are attempting a comeback. The pair may decline to $3.88. Fetch.ai price prediction Fetch.ai ( FET ) turned down from the $0.84 overhead resistance and has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.65). FET/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to arrest the pullback at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the FET/USDT pair could reach the $0.84 level. A break and close above $0.84 opens the doors for a possible rise to $1.09. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could fall to the 50-day SMA ($0.54), where the buyers are expected to step in. FET/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has reached the crucial support at $0.67. If the price rebounds off $0.67, the bears will try to halt the relief rally at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks below $0.67, it suggests that the bulls have given up. That could drag the pair down to $0.60. Alternatively, a break above the moving averages signals demand at lower levels. That suggests a possible range formation between $0.67 and $0.80. The uptrend could resume on a close above $0.80.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.5 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

There will be no future releases of any new NFT series or feature drops for the “foreseeable future,” Mattel said in an update on its website. The company said it will decide on the “long-term future” of Mattel digital collectibles. “Your unwavering support and enthusiasm for the Hot Wheels Virtual Garage has been legendary, and we’re incredibly grateful to have been on this journey with you,” the company said. “As we evaluate the changing world of virtual collectibles, we’ve determined the time has come to end our Series and Feature Drops in 2025 and onward.” There are no plans for any new NFT series or feature drops for Mattel's Hot Wheels Virtual Garage.

Holders can still buy, sell and trade their Hot Wheels NFTS on the Mattel Digital Collectibles Marketplace , while existing and outstanding redemptions will be “fulfilled as promised.” However, there is no option to transfer the NFTs to other wallets or marketplaces at the moment. Mattel says it’s exploring possible options around this feature. “We are developing a long-term plan for Virtual Collectibles and will share updates with the community in the future,” the company said.

On one hand, meme tokens like PEPE are turning heads, pulling in $37 million despite technical warning signs. On the other, XRP is carving out bullish patterns, signaling that a potential breakout could be on the horizon. Traders are asking, “Is now the best time to buy crypto?” That depends on your strategy. Momentum plays like PEPE and XRP can reward quick movers. However, if you’re looking beyond today’s price charts and focusing on lasting impact, Cold Wallet ($CWT) brings a very different proposition to the table. With privacy at its core, Cold Wallet is reshaping how users interact with Web3, all while offering early access at $0.00714 during Stage 2 of its presale. Let’s break down what’s happening with each project and why Cold Wallet might just be the smartest choice for serious crypto holders. PEPE Defies Bearish Signals With $37 Million in New Capital In a surprising turn, PEPE has rallied strongly as $37 million in spot buys flowed in, defying a series of bearish indicators. Technical warning signs were clear. A death cross, where the 20-day simple moving average fell below the 200-day, typically signals downward pressure. Meanwhile, the Accumulation/Distribution indicator pointed to growing sell-side activity. Despite these headwinds, PEPE still managed modest price gains. However, trading volume fell sharply, down over 36%, creating a classic divergence. This suggests that while some traders see opportunity, others are exercising caution. Adding to the mixed picture, the funding rate flipped negative at -0.0097, showing that short sellers currently dominate the derivatives market. Yet, the substantial spot buying hints that retail traders are strategically positioning for a potential rebound, hoping lower prices create a buying window. For now, PEPE’s journey reflects classic market tension. It is a story of bullish belief running against technical caution, making it one of the market’s more unpredictable plays. XRP Breaks Trendline as Bulls Set Sights on $5.81 XRP has emerged as a talking point after pushing above a multi-month descending trendline. The breakout has traders excited, signaling that momentum could be shifting in favor of bulls. Crucially, XRP recently retested the $1.98 support level and held steady. This strengthens the breakout narrative, although staying above this zone will be key to sustaining upward movement. Technical indicators are also flashing green. The Relative Strength Index is nearing 66, a level that suggests strengthening buying pressure, and the MACD has formed a bullish crossover. Together, these indicators reinforce a positive outlook. Analysts believe that if institutional interest keeps building, XRP could test $5.81 by the end of the year. However, risks remain. Bearish forces could pull it back to $2.06, and if weakness persists, the critical $1.20 support will be tested. Kalshi markets currently estimate a 44% chance of XRP reclaiming its previous high of $3.40 during 2025. For now, XRP stays on the radar of traders looking for the next big move, though as always, market sentiment will play a deciding role. Cold Wallet ($CWT) Solves the Problem That Even Hardware Wallets Cannot While PEPE wrestles with technical signals and XRP tries to break higher, Cold Wallet is focusing on a completely different mission. It is tackling what many in crypto overlook: making privacy effortless while maintaining easy access to DeFi. Hardware wallets provide excellent security, but they are clunky when it comes to real-time blockchain interaction. Signing every transaction, bridging assets, and moving to hot wallets introduces complexity and exposure. Cold Wallet takes a smarter approach. It is designed as a live-chain wallet that blends cold storage privacy with online convenience. Users get full access to DeFi and Web3 without leaking IP addresses, transaction history, or behavior data. Everything is protected through zero-knowledge architecture, so every transaction is stealthy by default. Even better, there are no browser plugins or hidden trackers. Cold Wallet simply works, offering secure and seamless blockchain access. Powering this experience is $CWT. More than just a token, it unlocks platform features, powers governance, and acts as the key to advanced privacy tools. Currently available in Stage 2 presale at $0.00714 and with a launch price of about $0.35171, $CWT offers early buyers a potential 4,900% return window. Cold Wallet is not chasing hype. Instead, it is quietly delivering a solution to Web3’s biggest flaw: How to interact privately and securely without sacrificing usability. Final Reflections Short-term trades dominate crypto headlines. PEPE’s surge and XRP’s breakout have created buzz, and rightfully so. They present interesting setups for those watching the charts closely. Cold Wallet, however, belongs in a different conversation. It is not about chasing fleeting momentum or waiting on technical breakouts. It is about building the invisible infrastructure that keeps Web3 running securely in the background. At $0.00714 and backed by privacy, usability, and a roadmap built for compliance and growth, Cold Wallet offers something rare in crypto. It is not just another token play. It is a product that delivers what the market is starting to realize it needs the most. For anyone wondering when the best time to buy crypto with long-term value is, the answer might not lie in timing the next pump. Instead, it could be about securing a stake in the tools and infrastructure that will define the next era of digital ownership.

While most eyes stay glued to price charts, something far more transformative is quietly taking shape behind the scenes. XRP is holding firm at $2.08, with Ripple’s tracker fund hinting at a potential breakout. Meanwhile, Chainlink is hovering between $12 and $13, with whale activity building and resistance near $14.50 drawing attention. Both offer solid setups, but they still rely on market timing and sentiment shifts. Unstaked ($UNSD) is focused on infrastructure. With a projected $1.09 billion market cap, its $UNSD token powers AI agents built to automate DAO tasks, grow communities, and engage users without manual effort. It’s not just a new token, it’s a working system for scalable, on-chain productivity. XRP Holds Steady as Ripple Fund Sparks Breakout Speculation XRP is holding firm around $2.08, showing resilience even as the broader market shifts. The buzz now centers on Ripple’s newly launched tracker fund, which could pave the way for more institutional involvement. If the fund gains momentum, analysts believe it might help XRP push through key resistance levels. The fund adds a layer of structure to XRP’s appeal, especially for those looking beyond spot trades. While price action has remained stable, the setup suggests potential for steady, adoption-driven growth. For mid- to long-term traders, this range is quickly becoming one to watch. Chainlink (LINK) Consolidates, But Whale Activity Signals Possible Move Chainlink is hovering between $12 and $13, with consolidation keeping the LINK price potential in check. Analysts have marked support between $12.28 and $12.62, and resistance between $14.19 and $14.58, forming a clear trading range for now. Interestingly, whale activity has surged to its highest levels since 2023, a signal that volatility may be on the horizon. Whether that sparks a breakout or a pullback depends on volume and sentiment. LINK isn’t moving yet, but the pressure is building, and a strong push past resistance could set the tone for the next leg up. Unstaked ($UNSD): Where AI Becomes the Workforce of Web3 Unstaked is entering the market with a projected cap of $1.09 billion, and it’s not riding on hype alone. The $UNSD token powers AI agents built to handle real operational tasks in the Web3 world, everything from community management to DAO coordination. These agents are designed to offload the repetitive work that typically slows down decentralized platforms. What makes them different is autonomy. Once deployed after launch, Unstaked’s AI agents will monitor metrics, analyze sentiment, and act in real time. This isn’t basic automation, it’s tokenized digital labor that can cut down operational overhead by up to 100×. Instead of being just another tool, Unstaked aims to become the infrastructure layer behind decentralized ecosystems. The presale is currently live with 150 pricing stages. Stage 1 began at $0.0065, with a projected listing price of $0.1819, representing a potential return of over 2,700% for early participants. The structure rewards early adopters while reinforcing long-term utility. If you’re asking what the best crypto to buy right now is, Unstaked brings a compelling case. It’s not about chasing pumps. It’s about creating productivity at scale. $UNSD is shaping up to be a utility token with daily use cases—something rare in a market that still rewards speculation over function. The Bottom Line XRP is holding steady at $2.08, and Chainlink is setting up for a potential breakout, but both still depend on timing the market. While they offer strong narratives, they remain reactive to broader trends and external momentum. Unstaked is taking a different route. With a projected $1.09 billion market cap and AI agents built to automate community, DAO, and on-chain operations, $UNSD isn’t just another token, it’s building crypto’s operational core. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy right now , consider where long-term value will come from. Unstaked is laying the groundwork that others may soon rely on.

Ethereum (ETH) price action is trending upward with the Pectra upgrade approaching, showing bullish patterns that could drive stronger moves if resistance breaks. At the same time, XRP price prediction is improving, backed by utility developments and a rebound above important levels. While analysts watch both closely, BlockDAG (BDAG) is grabbing attention in another way. Its new referral system offers 25% more BDAG to referrers and 5% more to referees for every purchase using a shared link. With BDAG priced at just $0.0019 until May 13, buyers are rushing in to maximize both token value and referral rewards. XRP Price Prediction Targets $2.38 After Reclaiming Key Support XRP price prediction is looking stronger after rising from $2.24 to $2.30, bouncing back from ETF-related turbulence. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s plan to use the XRP Ledger for real-time salary payments has added fresh value to XRP’s practical use. Technically, XRP price prediction benefits from bullish signals, as the token stays above its 50-period EMA and approaches resistance at $2.2613. A close above this point could lead the price to $2.38. As long as $2.20 support holds, the outlook remains positive. Growing adoption and increasing use cases may continue to push the token higher in the near future. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action Builds Strength Before Pectra Launch Ethereum (ETH) price action has bounced back to $1,817 after briefly dipping to $1,737, showing renewed energy ahead of a major network update. The Pectra upgrade, scheduled for May 7, brings improvements in staking and scalability that could appeal to both everyday users and institutions. Current Ethereum price action shows strong indicators, including a MACD Golden Cross and a Dragonfly Doji on the monthly chart. Market analysts are eyeing the $1,812 resistance area closely. The token is still following its parabolic support curve, which has previously triggered major rallies. A breakout depends on sustained trading volume and continued market confidence. BlockDAG’s Referral Plan Pays Big for Sharing, 25% for You, 5% for Them BlockDAG’s referral offer is becoming one of the top passive earning opportunities in crypto. Many holders are already using it to build extra income simply by sharing a referral link. Here’s how it works: referrers earn 25% of the total BDAG bought by their referees, while each referee gets a 5% bonus. For example, if three friends each purchase $3,000 in BDAG using one link, that’s $9,000 in total, giving the referrer $2,250 in BDAG and each friend an extra $150. It’s a powerful reward system with no added cost. Long-time holders are already seeing big returns. And for newcomers, this might be the best time to buy. Batch 28 is now live. While the initial price for this batch was $0.0262, BlockDAG is still offering the special $0.0019 price until May 13. Based on its planned listing at $0.05, new buyers stand to gain a 2,531% return. With over $225.5 million raised and 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold, BlockDAG continues to grow rapidly. Among the top crypto coins right now , this project’s referral system is more than just a bonus; it’s a path to become part of a growing holder base of 170,000. Key Insights! With Ethereum price action heating up ahead of its major upgrade and XRP price prediction gaining strength from new applications, both tokens are under close watch. But while they build slowly, BlockDAG is delivering fast. Its referral system offers buyers up to 25% more coins, while referees gain an extra 5%. This has helped push demand even higher, with batch 28 moving fast. The $0.0019 price is still active until May 13, offering a 2,531% potential return at listing. Among all the top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG stands out by turning hype into tangible results, and that’s what makes it one to watch.

Meanwhile, Mantra (OM) price analysis reveals deep trouble. A drop of 88% followed liquidations tied to large holders and concerns over token control. As these shifts play out, Web3 ai is starting to stand out. This AI-based crypto project is not built on buzzwords. It is building real features: 12 tools that handle trading tasks like portfolio checks, risk scans, and automation. Everything runs in real time across different chains. The ai crypto presale has 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267. With a listing price of $0.005242, early buyers are looking at a 1747% ROI. If finding the best crypto to buy now matters, this one may be worth a closer look. Web3 ai Focuses on Real Tools, Not Just Tech In AI crypto, the problem isn’t a lack of infrastructure. It’s the lack of tools. Web3 ai shifts focus to what people can use. No hype, just 12 AI tools designed to solve trading problems. These include auto trading bots, fraud monitors, and yield tracking tools. It’s modular and works across Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and others. No single-chain limit.

The token sale runs through 50 steps. It begins at $0.0003 and ends at $0.003267. Listing is set at $0.005242, locking in a 1747% ROI for those who get in early. On top of that, the token lets holders stake, vote, and earn part of platform revenue. For those scanning the space for the best crypto to buy now, Web3 ai looks built to handle real tasks. While many projects work on backend systems, this one puts utility first. That may be why it’s turning heads as traders rethink what they actually want to use. AVAX Price Moves Toward $30 as Interest Rises Around ETF and DeFi Avalanche (AVAX) recorded a 16% price rise over the last week, and the trend appears to be linked to stronger signals. VanEck’s recent ETF filing has drawn renewed attention from institutional players, and Avalanche’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) has climbed to $1.63 billion, marking its highest level in several months. This 14.4% monthly increase puts it ahead of bigger platforms like Ethereum and Solana. With more than 430 active protocols, developers seem to be returning in larger numbers. From a technical perspective, Avalanche (AVAX) is now testing major resistance zones. Analysts are focusing on the $24 to $26 range, and if bulls push through, the $30 level could be the next key target. Some traders see this period as one of accumulation, especially as Layer 1 networks gain traction again. With features like real-time transaction finality, scalable smart contracts, and EVM support, Avalanche is working toward practical use in finance. If the pace continues, AVAX may be setting up for a more extended move upward. OM Token Faces Challenges Following Major Sell-Off It’s been a tough week for Mantra (OM), with the token falling 88% after a sharp sell-off during low liquidity periods dropped the price from $6.30 to $0.38. Blockchain data shows large transactions by whales, including those tied to Laser Digital VC and team-associated wallets, which has sparked concerns about internal control. SpotOnChain also noted that $91 million worth of OM was sent to exchanges shortly before the drop. Now trading around $0.70, indicators suggest continued pressure. The RSI remains in oversold territory, and the MACD still reflects a downward trend. Still, there are early signs of a possible rebound. If the market regains trust, OM might revisit the $1 to $1.50 range, though reaching the $3.4 to $4.2 zone could be more difficult. Looking at the Mantra (OM) price today, it’s clear this situation goes beyond charts. The focus is now on clarity. With doubts about token distribution and shaken community confidence, OM needs more than price movement. It needs openness and accountability. Overall Insights Avalanche has shown new strength, with AVAX rising 16% over the week, supported by ETF-related news and growth in its DeFi space. In contrast, Mantra (OM) is still in recovery mode, working to rebuild trust after a large drop tied to whale actions and token transfers. While some crypto markets are facing uncertainty, there’s a shift toward building useful networks instead of chasing trends. This is where Web3 ai is beginning to stand out. The project is building 12 AI-powered modules aimed at crypto users, going beyond just developer tools. With a 50-step ai crypto presale priced from $0.0003 to $0.003267, a launch value of $0.005242, and an expected ROI at listing of 1747%, Web3 ai is focusing on technology that can actually be used. As the search continues for the best crypto to buy right now , Web3 ai could become the functional “AI internet” many are waiting for, serving traders, holders, and others in the space.

MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off Spotting a strong project before the crowd is rare—but MAGACOINFINANCE is offering just that kind of window right now. Wallet growth is consistent. Community engagement is rising without artificial spikes. Developer updates are arriving on time, and early-stage capital is quietly moving in before mainstream exposure. There’s no shortcut being taken—just disciplined execution and strategic growth. For investors seeking uninflated value and authentic early-stage positioning, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the final high-upside opportunities in this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano continues to lead with its research-driven approach to secure smart contract deployment and sustainability.

44172190,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720852,1746410844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44172190.jpeg,Trump orders 100% tariff on imported films to save Hollywood,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-orders-100-tariff-on-imported-films/,"President Donald Trump announced that he is authorizing the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on American films produced abroad, also known as runaway productions. According to Trump, American films that are produced in “foreign lands“ pose a national security threat”. He claimed it’s causing the movie industry to die “a very fast death” in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, adding that Hollywood and other areas of the country “are being devastated” over films produced in “foreign lands.” Trump argued that the President’s job was to defend the United States against foreign and domestic threats and that the issue involved messaging and propaganda, among other concerns. Trump said the tariff would take effect immediately and that the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative would soon start taking all necessary and appropriate action under Section 301, a trade sense law, to halt what he said were unfair trade practices. Yet he did not detail when or how the policy would take effect. The post was one in a series Trump has touched on tariffs since he began the tariff wars, indicating that no industry may remain untouched. He cast the move in patriotic terms to preserve American jobs and values. China plans to cut American movie quota China had already begun to act just weeks before Trump’s announcement. On April 10, China’s Film Administration announced it would cut the number of American movies permitted into the market. The action is believed to be in retaliation to previous U.S. talks of increasing tariffs on imported entertainment. The administration said in a public statement that the U.S. government’s abuse of tariffs to interfere with and suppress legitimate industries had reshaped domestic audiences’ attitudes toward American films. It added that China would follow market rules and respect audience preferences by reducing the number of U.S. films allowed into the country. China is the world’s second-largest film market, and Hollywood increasingly depends on it. But it has become more protective of its homegrown entertainment industry. For the last few years, Chinese films have been kicking the backsides of Hollywood imports at the local box office. In 2024, U.S. movies accounted for about 14% of China’s box office. This is a significant decrease from 36% in 2018. That partly has to do with the fact that Chinese audiences are increasingly weary of sequels and reboots and what they view as formulaic storytelling from Hollywood, experts say. The Chinese government is now backing more local productions and encouraging audiences to watch homegrown content. The most recent attempt to reduce the United States imports of films threatens to hit Hollywood where it hurts. Hollywood studios struggle under trade tensions Hollywood studios are growing increasingly concerned about these developments. The President’s new 100% tariff would significantly raise the cost for foreign films to enter the U.S. — the world’s largest movie market. This could depress competition for American films and ratchet up tensions between the country’s four biggest trade partners , China, France, South Korea, and India. Just recently, Voight’s manager, Steven Paul, confirmed that he and the actor had put a proposal together that they planned to present to Trump with a plan to reinvigorate American film and television production. However, it was unclear what ideas were in their plan or if they had a confirmed appointment with Trump. One potential suggestion Voight and Paul might be floating is a federal tax incentive, something the industry — which has suffered economically in recent years from Covid shutdowns, writers strikes, and the wildfires — would likely favor. Overseas tax incentives have helped studios reduce production costs due to economic challenges. Meanwhile, China’s reduction of U.S. film imports is already having an impact. For studios like Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, which use international markets to help cover production costs, the dependence is even greater for costly blockbusters. Companies that have long wielded great power are now on the brink of ruin because of the pandemic. Dwindling ticket sales in China — once a top early revenue market for Hollywood — has left major studios scrambling for new sources of revenue. Film critics also caution that moviegoers could be denied various stories worldwide. In his Sunday post, Trump did not mention the television or streaming industries, which have also depended on productions outside the U.S. If the move entails increased tariffs worldwide, international films could become a thing of the past in American theaters.

A May 3 post-mortem from the Solana Foundation said that the security vulnerability, first discovered on April 16, could have allowed an attacker to forge an invalid proof affecting Solana’s privacy-enabling “Token-22 confidential tokens.” There is no known exploit of the vulnerability, and Solana validators have since adopted the patched version, the foundation said. Solana zero-day security bug affected Token-22 confidential tokens The Solana Foundation said the security vulnerability concerned two programs: Token-2022 and ZK ElGamal Proof. Token-2022 handles the main application logic for token mints and accounts, while ZK ElGamal Proof verifies the correctness of zero-knowledge proofs to show accurate account balances. The foundation said certain algebraic components were omitted from the hash in the Fiat-Shamir Transformation's transcript generation, which specifies how provers create public randomness using a cryptographic hash function. The flaw could have enabled an attacker to exploit the unhashed components by crafting a forged proof that passes verification to mint and steal Token-22 confidential tokens. Token-22 confidential tokens, or “Extension Tokens,” leverage zero-knowledge proofs for private transfers and aim to enable advanced token functionality. The vulnerability was first identified on April 16, and two patches were deployed to resolve the issues. A super majority of Solana validators adopted the patches around two days later. Solana development firms Anza, Firedancer and Jito were the main parties behind the security patch, while Asymmetric Research, Neodyme and OtterSec also assisted. The foundation confirmed that all funds remain safe. Related: Bloomberg Intelligence boosts Solana ETF approval odds to 90% Despite the fix, the Solana Foundation's private handling of the issue with Solana validators raised centralization concerns from some in the crypto community. This included a Curve Finance contributor who raised concerns about the foundation’s close relationship with Solana validators. “Why does someone have a list of all validators and their contact details? What else are they talking about in those comms channels,” they asked, fearing that they could collude to potentially censor transactions or roll back the chain. Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko didn’t directly deny the claims but said members of the Ethereum community could also coordinate to resolve a similar security bug. Source: Clouted More than 70% of Ethereum network validators are also controlled by crypto exchanges or staking operators such as Lido, Yakovenko said in arguing his point. “It’s the same people to get to 70% on ethereum. All the lido validators (chorus one, p2p, etc..) binance, coinbase, and kraken. If geth needs to push a patch, I’ll be happy to coordinate for them.” In August, the Solana Foundation and network validators resolved another critical vulnerability behind the scenes. At the time, the foundation’s executive director, Dan Albert, said the ability to coordinate a patch doesn’t mean that Solana is centralized. Ethereum wouldn’t fall for the same issue, community member says Ethereum community member Ryan Berckmans slammed claims that Ethereum is subject to the same centralization issues as Solana, pointing out that Ethereum has sufficient client diversity. The most popular Ethereum client, geth, has at most 41% market share on Ethereum, Berckmans said, while noting that Solana has just one production-ready client, Agave. “This means zero day bugs in the single Sol client are de facto protocol bugs. Change the single client program, change the protocol itself. The client is the protocol.” Meanwhile, Solana is looking to roll out a new client, Firedancer, in the next few months, which is expected to improve the network’s resilience and uptime. However, Berckmans said that Solana would need three clients to be sufficiently decentralized at the client level.

Legal clarity and strategic partnerships position XRP as a frontrunner in regulated digital finance. Ethereum (ETH): Scaling with Network Upgrades Current Price: $1,729 2025 Forecast: $3,174 average, up to $10,000 Ethereum continues to dominate as the foundation of decentralized applications. Its ongoing network upgrades and staking model have brought new scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for institutional inflows via potential spot ETH ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC): Leading the Market with Renewed Strength Current Price: ~$95,000 2025 Forecast: Targets suggest a move to $132,000 by mid-year Bitcoin remains the macro anchor of the crypto market. Following a 14.5% rise in April , analysts project continued momentum as ETF inflows, institutional demand, and increasing scarcity drive long-term value. TRON (TRX): Advancing Utility in DeFi Current Price: $0.2457 2025 Forecast: $0.259 by mid-year TRON is steadily advancing with gas-free transactions, making it a reliable player in decentralized finance and payments—particularly in emerging markets. Its consistent transaction volume keeps it relevant in a rapidly evolving space. Final Thoughts XRP, Ethereum, TRON, and Bitcoin represent strong foundations and long-term utility.

According to Coinglass data , the long/short ratio for Ripple ( XRP ) is 0.9205, meaning that more traders are betting on a decline than a rally. For almost two weeks, this ratio has remained below 1, indicating that bearish sentiment has taken over. Even though open interest has dropped by 1.92%, derivatives volume jumped 35% to $3.28 billion. This tells us traders are still active, but mostly on the short side, expecting a move down. On the technical front, XRP is trading at $2.14, just above a crucial support level of $2.05. If that level is broken, there may be more severe short-term declines. The relative strength index is neutral at 47 but is progressively declining. Since it is not yet oversold, there is still room for a further decline. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The moving average convergence divergence recently turned negative, suggesting that their downside momentum may be building. At 11, the average directional index, which gauges trend strength, is extremely low, indicating that there is currently only choppy sideways action rather than a strong trend. The majority of short- and medium-term moving averages are also flashing sell signals.

The squeeze, however, occurs at the same time that XRP is testing support, which might suggest that a decline rather than a bounce is more likely. While short-term setup is bearish, XRP’s fundamentals are still solid. A major regulatory burden was recently lifted as Ripple resolved its legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, there is increasing interest in a possible spot XRP exchange-traded fund, which Bloomberg analysts predict will be approved by the end of 2025 with an 85% chance. ETF approvals could increase institutional demand and drive up prices considerably. Meanwhile, Ripple’s $4-5 billion offer to purchase stablecoin issuer Circle, although unsuccessful, shows the company’s ambitious growth goals. Macroeconomic challenges still exist though. Risk sentiment is being distorted by President Trump’s tariff policies and sticky inflation. The Federal Reserve’s May 7 interest rate decision and May 13 CPI data are also drawing attention the focus of attention because they have the potential to impact the movements of cryptocurrency assets, including XRP. If XRP loses $2.05, it could fall toward $1.98–$2.00, where the 200-day support sits. Still, the bulls aren’t out. If XRP can bounce from this range and break back above $2.20, it might flip momentum back in its favor. But right now, the odds don’t support that move.

Some X users from the crypto community have recently reported having received a private message from the New York Post’s X account inviting them to feature in a podcast and to contact them via Telegram. The spurious messages were first discovered on May 3 by Kerberus founder and CEO Alex Katz, who shared a screenshot of a message made out to be from author and journalist Paul Sperry via the official nypost account. “What’s interesting about this case is that the scammer gained unauthorized access but didn’t post a Pump.fun address or wallet drainer. Instead, they’re messaging users and then directing them to Telegram,” observed cybersecurity engineer and NFT collector “Drew”. Related: ‘I’m sick’ — Scammers use AI, fake ID of crypto influencer to steal $4M After sending the message, the scammer blocks users from replying to prevent the actual New York Post team from being alerted to the compromise, he added. Donny Clutterbuck from NFT Bitcoin’s ordinals platform Fomojis also reported having been contacted by the hacker, suggesting that it could be a potential Zoom exploit from enabling audio. When you click to enable audio, a pop-up gives the option to either cancel or enable WiFi, he said before adding, “I guess WiFi gives network access to the scammer.” Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT said this compromise was similar to one from a few weeks ago when direct messages were sent from The Defiant’s X account. Private message from New York Post’s X account. Source: Alex Katz Cointelegraph contacted the New York Post for more information but did not receive an immediate response. There was nothing regarding the social media compromise on the NYP or Sperry’s X feeds. Scammers seeking victims on Zoom Scammers have increasingly shifted their social engineering techniques to messaging users directly after having established trust from previous conversations, and video conference platform Zoom has become a hotbed of crypto scams recently. In April, Emblem Vault CEO Jake Gallen warned users to be wary of malicious actors using Zoom after losing $100,000 in crypto assets. Gallen was also contacted via X to arrange a Zoom interview during which the scammer installed malware that drained his wallets. It is not the first time the New York Post’s verified Twitter account has been hijacked. In 2022, an employee hacked the account to post a series of obscene messages designed to look like real headlines.

The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post. The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks , and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests. During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.” “Unfortunately, this was the wrong call,” the company admitted. “The qualitative assessments were hinting at something important, and we should’ve paid closer attention. They were picking up on a blind spot in our other evals and metrics.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on April 27 that it was working to roll back changes making ChatGPT too agreeable. Source: Sam Altman Broadly, text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weighting, impacting how the model responds. OpenAI said introducing a user feedback reward signal weakened the model’s “primary reward signal, which had been holding sycophancy in check,” which tipped it toward being more obliging. “User feedback in particular can sometimes favor more agreeable responses, likely amplifying the shift we saw,” it added. OpenAI is now checking for suck up answers After the updated AI model rolled out, ChatGPT users had complained online about its tendency to shower praise on any idea it was presented, no matter how bad, which led OpenAI to concede in an April 29 blog post that it “was overly flattering or agreeable.” For example, one user told ChatGPT it wanted to start a business selling ice over the internet, which involved selling plain old water for customers to refreeze. Source: Tim Leckemby In its latest postmortem, it said such behavior from its AI could pose a risk, especially concerning issues such as mental health. “People have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn’t see as much even a year ago,” OpenAI said. “As AI and society have co-evolved, it’s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.” Related: Crypto users cool with AI dabbling with their portfolios: Survey The company said it had discussed sycophancy risks “for a while,” but it hadn’t been explicitly flagged for internal testing, and it didn’t have specific ways to track sycophancy. Now, it will look to add “sycophancy evaluations” by adjusting its safety review process to “formally consider behavior issues” and will block launching a model if it presents issues. OpenAI also admitted that it didn’t announce the latest model as it expected it “to be a fairly subtle update,” which it has vowed to change. “There’s no such thing as a ‘small’ launch,” the company wrote. “We’ll try to communicate even subtle changes that can meaningfully change how people interact with ChatGPT.” AI Eye: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-05 03:30:34

MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP are climbing the ranks quickly, with a clear uptick in engagement and positioning. Meanwhile, names like Solana (SOL) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Injective (INJ) are gaining quiet traction, especially among technical analysts and long-horizon investors looking for sustained momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE – Smart Positioning in a Crowded Market MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t aiming to compete through hype—it’s aiming to win through precision. With over $7.8 million raised , rising pre-sale demand, and a $0.007 listing price in view, the fundamentals are aligning fast. Its message, branding, and consistency in execution make MAGACOINFINANCE stand out among early-stage contenders. Investor communities across X, Telegram, and YouTube are increasingly focused on this project—not as a trend, but as a calculated long-term position.

XRP – Strong Foundation and Institutional Appeal Current Price: $2.15, XRP continues to show impressive resilience, supported by rising ETF volume and on-chain strength. Analysts are closely monitoring the $2.45 breakout level, which could trigger renewed upward movement as institutional investors deepen their positions. Solana (SOL) – Strengthening as a Scalable Leader Current Price: ~$148, Solana has regained momentum after a robust 41% surge in April , positioning itself as a core platform for high-performance decentralized apps and real-world tokenization. If buying pressure holds, SOL is likely to test resistance around the $180 mark—opening the door to new upside in Q2. Kaspa and Injective – Quiet Builders with Real Fundamentals Kaspa (KAS) continues to gain ground among proof-of-work advocates. Trading around $0.10, the project is benefiting from rising interest in blockDAG tech and scalable architecture. If demand continues, a breakout above $0.30 remains a plausible scenario. Injective (INJ) remains anchored near $35. While not making headlines daily, its developer adoption and cross-chain ecosystem give it solid long-term fundamentals. Smart money continues to accumulate INJ quietly, anticipating future infrastructure relevance.

He blamed other countries for offering financial incentives to attract U.S. filmmakers and studios overseas, leaving Hollywood and other parts of the country struggling. Concerns Over Foreign Control of the Movie Industry In his message, Trump described this situation as a national security threat, claiming it’s not just about business — but also about messaging and propaganda. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump said. “Other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away. Hollywood and other areas within the U.S.A. are being devastated.” https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114452117143235155 Trump believes this is a coordinated effort by other nations to weaken the U.S. film industry. In response, he announced that he’s authorizing the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to start the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the United States. “We want movies made in America again,” Trump declared. This proposed move is aimed at protecting American jobs, preserving the country’s cultural influence, and keeping U.S. film production within its borders.

Right now, four names are aligning as early movers: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the breakout contender MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As dominant players consolidate, new opportunities are taking form—and for investors seeking aggressive upside, this may be the time to pay close attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Foundation for Breakout Growth Momentum in crypto is earned—not manufactured—and MAGACOINFINANCE is earning it in all the right ways. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is showing real strength: wallet activity is up, the community is expanding organically, and development milestones are being met with precision. Rather than chasing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is focusing on structure and sustainability. It’s laying a true foundation for breakout growth—something few early-stage projects achieve. Those entering now aren’t late—they’re early, and they may be entering just as the wider market starts to notice. Other Assets on the Move: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism remains a leader in Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, drawing demand for fast, cost-effective smart contracts. Arbitrum is thriving on strong developer activity and a vibrant dApp ecosystem, pushing Ethereum usability to new levels. Sei is gaining attention with its trading-focused architecture, built for speed and reduced congestion. Litecoin continues to hold its place as a reliable peer-to-peer transfer coin, especially where simplicity and speed are essential. Each of these assets has a clear use case—but none offer the raw early-stage momentum of MAGACOINFINANCE at this moment. Conclusion The next wave of crypto wealth won’t be built by those holding yesterday’s champions—it will come from those spotting what’s quietly emerging today. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP continue to command relevance.

With a sharp 1 million BDAG purchase, the wallet not only won the daily round but also sent a clear message, this presale is heating up fast. A total of 26 million BDAG were sold that day, setting the tone for a high-stakes final phase in BlockDAG’s presale. With time running out, new participants still have a chance to join in, take advantage of the discounted token price, and compete for daily wins. Here’s why BlockDAG’s presale is building serious momentum and why now could be your moment to act. Buyer Battles Bring Daily Action & Competitive Rewards BlockDAG’s presale has captured attention for months, but its upgraded Buyer Battles format has taken the excitement to another level. Now, the biggest daily buyer earns exclusive rewards, and on April 26, wallet 0x4e06…9e5 did just that with a bold 1 million BDAG purchase. That day’s 26 million total BDAG volume gave this wallet a clear lead, locking in extra tokens and spotlighting the power of decisive moves. This format is making things more engaging for everyone involved. By turning daily purchases into a competitive race, BlockDAG has attracted new interest and brought fresh energy to its presale. The battles are working, buyers want in, and they’re moving fast to secure their place before it’s too late. Presale Numbers Reveal Strength & Urgency Since launching, BlockDAG’s presale has crossed major milestones, raising $225.5 million and selling more than 19.6 billion BDAG coins across 28 batches. While the current batch price sits at $0.0262, a limited-time offer gives buyers access to BDAG at just $0.0019. This special rate lasts only until May 13, the same day BlockDAG plans to reveal its initial exchange listings. Early buyers from batch one have already seen an impressive ROI of 2,520%. And for those jumping in now, the gap between the discounted price and the batch price offers serious upside potential. With limited time left, the opportunity to lock in a low entry is narrowing fast, and interest continues to grow. Why Now Might Be the Best Entry Point for BlockDAG The countdown is on, but there’s still time to be part of BlockDAG’s presale. Whether you’re interested in scoring discounted tokens or chasing daily Buyer Battles rewards, this project offers something few others do. With the presale already raising $225.5 million and momentum building ahead of exchange listings, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities of the year. For anyone searching for the best presale crypto in 2025, BlockDAG is hard to ignore. The $0.0019 offer won’t last, and exchange trading will soon bring a new phase of growth.

Warren Calls Out Potential Trump Family Conflict in Urging Senate to Pause Crypto Bill,https://cryptonews.com/news/sen-warren-calls-out-potential-trump-family-conflict-in-urging-senate-to-pause-crypto-bill/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren has called on the Senate to delay the passage of a controversial digital asset bill, warning of potential corruption linked to the Trump family’s stablecoin project. Over the weekend, Warren urged lawmakers to reconsider rushing through the bill. She pointed to the involvement of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial in a high-stakes deal with the United Arab Emirates, which could have significant financial implications. “The Trump family stablecoin surged to 7th largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates—a foreign government that will give them a crazy amount of money,” Warren wrote on Sunday.

The Trump family’s stablecoin, pegged to the dollar, is linked to a $2b deal with the Emirati investment firm MGX . The firm, backed by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and AI firm G42, announced its use of the stablecoin to facilitate its investment in Binance . GENIUS Act Faces Senate Gridlock as Democrats Push Back Against GOP Revisions The situation has become even more complex with the ongoing debate over the GENIUS Act , a landmark piece of legislation aimed at establishing federal regulations for stablecoins. This bill has become a flashpoint in the Senate, with bipartisan talks encountering significant hurdles. Politico reported that nine key Senate Democrats voiced opposition to revisions unveiled by GOP lawmakers, creating a roadblock in the negotiations. The bill seeks to create the first-ever regulatory framework for stablecoins, and its passage is a key priority of Trump’s financial policy agenda. However, Democrats have shown concerns that the revised proposal fails to adequately address issues such as money laundering and the broader risks to the financial system. GENIUS Act Hits a Snag as Both Parties Remain Far From Agreement These concerns have led to growing friction behind the scenes, with some Democrats backing away from their earlier support for the bill. Republicans, meanwhile, remain hopeful that they can win over enough Democratic support to move the bill forward. GOP aides are optimistic that further revisions could address some of the concerns raised by Democrats, though the clock is ticking with hopes of a floor vote by the end of the month. Despite this, the ongoing negotiations signal that reaching a consensus on this issue may take more time than initially anticipated. The post Sen.

The price is now trading below $2.20 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

While the broader crypto market is experiencing some selling pressure, XRP has managed to hold its key support levels — but its future direction remains uncertain. Short-term Price Analysis On the short-term chart, XRP appears to have formed a low around April 7th. However, all subsequent rallies from that point have been corrective, featuring messy, overlapping, three-wave moves rather than clean impulse waves. Support at $2.11 has held so far, with additional support at $2.08 and $2.14. Price briefly broke a minor Fibonacci support recently but recovered quickly without sustaining losses. The market continues to form higher highs and higher lows — a positive sign amid uncertainty. There’s a tentative Elliott Wave scenario where XRP might be forming a diagonal pattern to the upside, although it’s not a particularly reliable setup given the overlapping, jagged structure. A decisive breakout above the descending trendline from the April 30th low (around $2.12) could signal the start of an internal third wave higher. Key resistance levels to watch include $2.33 and $2.46. A clean break of these could spark fresh bullish momentum. Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion XRP: What Does It Mean? Ripple recently unlocked 1 billion XRP from escrow. While increased supply traditionally pressures price lower, there’s nuance to consider. The market reaction depends on how Ripple deploys these tokens. If used for strategic acquisitions — such as the rumored bid for Circle — it could be bullish for XRP, injecting real utility and revenue into the ecosystem.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-05 04:12:11
