At the same time, 1Fuel's fast growth has been attracting the attention of the market with impressive growth and clear potential. The investor confidence in the technology and real world utility of its led it to be growing in its presale momentum. We’ll take a look at why 1Fuel got people excited, while others barely get traction. TRON (TRX): A Network Struggling for Relevance For long, TRON has been touted as a blockchain platform dedicated for speed and low transaction cost. As of February 6, 2025, TRX is sitting around $0.2273, with minor gains, but market sentiment is still wary. TRON’s mixed performance is mainly because its market cap is around $19.6 billion, but its rise and failure depend a lot on the success of the decentralized entertainment sector, which has not attracted the same level of mainstream adoption as DeFi or NFT platforms. TRON’s growth is stagnant only due to it being not adaptable. Because it’s a single chain structure, it cannot easily become part of the emerging ecosystems. With 1Fuel’s cross-chain payment efficiency, this is where 1Fuel outshines TRON, it is more versatile when you can make seamless transactions across multiple blockchains in real-world applications. It is now becoming clear to investors that while TRON creates separate ecosystems 1Fuel develops connections between blockchain networks, a necessary skill in the crypto space. Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Mainstream While Dogecoin has always lived by community enthusiasm and celebrity endorsements, that hype is starting to wane. As at time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.2638 , down 0.26% over the previous day. Though the recently released Grayscale Dogecoin Trust hopes to tap institutional investors, DOGE’s price action has proven to be unpredictable. As this is such a speculative coin, with no strong technology or use across more than price movement, it is vulnerable when markets are down. Dogecoin does not have a sustainable growth model. It has name recognition but not much else. In contrast, 1Fuel’s next generation DeFi solutions address real world problems. As a result, it’s a good practical choice for DeFi enthusiasts interested in alternatives to meme coins, and its fast, low fee transactions and focus on security make it particularly attractive. Unlike Dogecoin’s speculatory hype, 1Fuel has real value which is precisely what the long term investors are looking for in a volatile market. 1Fuel (OFT): A Utility-Driven Project in the Spotlight TRON and Dogecoin have seen inconsistent growth, while 1Fuel has erupted with lightning speed. With a presale already raising over $1.9 million, 1Fuel looks primed to become a market leader for next generation DeFi solutions. Unlike traditional tokens that have been or are locked into single network models, its ability to enable smooth transactions over multiple blockchains differentiates it from other tokens. In addition, 1Fuel’s cross-chain payment efficiency isn't only about speed, it’s about access. It means users will be able to transact across different ecosystems with practically no friction, similar to sending an email. It is precisely this focus on interoperability that is attracting investors to 1Fuel. Their growth isn’t created by short term hype, it’s powered by tech for the long term. Conclusion Now that TRON and Dogecoin are experiencing increased interest and declining, 1Fuel's upward trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. This rapid expansion is testament to growing investor trust in its long term value. In high potential projects like this, it is often early participation that produces the biggest gains. There’s still time to join the 1Fuel presale and get your place before demand surges even higher.

It can expect to hear the SEC decision on April 25. BlackRock’s iShares ETH Trust was among the first eight spot ETH ETFs approved by the SEC. They began trading in July. The Nasdaq ISE exchange applied for a rule change to allow options trading on the trust the same month. Options are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price within a predetermined timespan. Options grant the contractor the right to make those sales, but do not require the sale. Watchdog objects to ETH ETF options trading The application was published in the Federal Register on August 12. The agency had 180 days from that point (Feb. 8) to make its decision. The SEC explained in a filing on Feb. 7 that it can delay its decision by up to 60 days after that, or until April 25. The delay is intended to give the SEC “sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” it explained. The agency received two comments on the proposal in December. In one letter, a representative of Better Markets, a nonprofit financial markets watchdog, suggested that the high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency would cause greater instability in traditional financial markets due to the greater exposure potentially provided by the ETF. Better Markets argued that an ETH ETF would be even more detrimental to the economy due to the amount of capital tied up in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Bitcoin spot ETF options trading was approved by the SEC in January 2024, and BlackRock began trading BTC ETF options in December. Interest in ETH ETFs is abundant There is widespread interest in ETH ETFs. The NYSE American exchange filed for a rule change to allow it to list and trade options on the Bitwise ETH ETF, Grayscale ETH Trust, Grayscale ETH Mini Trust, and “Any Trust that Holds Ether” a day after Nasdaq’s request in regard to BlackRock. Also on Feb. 7, the SEC released a filing requesting comment on Cboe BZX Exchange’s Feb. 3 request for a rule change it to list options trading on Fidelity’s ETH ETF. Fidelity’s spot ETH ETF was also among the first eight approved. The SEC has not allowed options trading on any ETH ETFs so far.

While most major cryptos are threatening a retest of Monday’s lows, ONDO continues to trade nearly 50% higher as it probes for a breakout above $1.40. A difficult macro backdrop suggests that rapid near-term gains are unlikely. However, in wake of the project unveiling its own purpose-built layer-1 protocol , growing hype is likely to keep the ONDO price relatively well underpinned. Growing Hype Set to Elevate ONDO Price One of the star performers of 2024, ONDO looks set to extend its strength into 2025, which is set to mark a massive year for the growing real-world asset tokenization sector of crypto. In partnership with household names in institutional finance like Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, WisdomTree, Google Cloud, ABN Amro, Aon, McKinsey, BlackRock, PayPal and Morgan Stanley, Ondo Finance is launching its very own layer-1 protocol dedicated to the tokenization of real-world assets. 1/ Today, we’re thrilled to announce Ondo Chain, our new Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs. Design advisors for the chain include new members of the Ondo Ecosystem: Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, WisdomTree, Google Cloud, ABN Amro, Aon,… pic.twitter.com/a35GHB7OFW — Ondo Finance (@OndoFinance) February 6, 2025 It explains in a tweet thread the problems that the RWA industry faces when operating on existing DeFi chains (like Ethereum), and proposes its new blockchain as a solution. Given the massive players that are backing the project, it’s likely to be a highly successful blockchain launch. The project is also likely to have strong support from the White House and regulators – President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr spoke at the Ondo Finance summit this week. Thank you, Donald Trump Jr. ( @DonaldJTrumpJr ), all of today’s outstanding speakers, and our fantastic guests both in-person and online, for joining us at the Ondo Summit.

I don’t think so pic.twitter.com/sgO14e5ucW — Altcoin Hero (@Altcoin_Hero_) February 6, 2025 Can ONDO 10x From Here? 2025 looks set to be a tough year for altcoins, given financial conditions are currently set to remain tight in the USA. Prior altcoin seasons have relied upon an easing of financial conditions, such as in 2021. That said, that doesn’t mean Ondo Finance can’t have a massive year. 2025 is set to be a record year for crypto adoption globally as favorable regulatory tailwinds from the just-arrived Trump administration start making themselves felt across the crypto industry. Ondo Finance’s leadership position in the RWA space suggests that if this “narrative” continues to gain ground, it could be one of the biggest winners. A market cap of currently around $4.7 billion ($13 billion fully diluted), per CoinMarketCap , suggests there is plenty of room left for ONDO to appreciate as this market matures. 10x gains might not be reasonable to expect in 2025. But risks are certainly tilted to the upside for this exciting coin. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Another Coin Worth Considering? The RWA narrative could deliver outsized gains relative to the market in 2025. But another narrative that could deliver even bigger upside is the AI agent narrative, which took crypto by storm in late 2024. One coin in particular called MIND of Pepe (MIND) has caught the attention of analysts at Cryptonews.com. MIND of Pepe is an innovative cryptocurrency that merges the virality of meme culture with advanced AI technology. It features a self-evolving AI agent that analyzes market trends, social media insights, and blockchain data to offer exclusive trading opportunities to its holders. Having already raised over $5 million in funds in its presale, the project’s unique blend of AI-driven market analysis and meme coin popularity could lead to explosive growth.

This comes as the subject of the use of AI in the film, music and the art industry as a whole has been topical igniting debates across the industry. AI technology has been touted as a game changer, with the potential to transform the art and entertainment industry, but also has its downside risks. Hank Azaria fears AI will replicate four decades of creative work on The Simpsons AI technology has made it easy for anyone to produce music, write books or make video production. Some artists fear this might “kill” the industry’s creativeness, and a blow to employees in the sector who risk losing jobs to the technology. “I imagine that soon enough, artificial intelligence will be able to recreate the sounds of the more than 100 voices I created for characters on ‘The Simpsons’ over almost four decades,” Azaria wrote in The Times. “It makes me sad to think about it. Not to mention, it seems just plain wrong to steal my likeness or sound — or anyone else’s.” Azaria. The 60-year old American actor has been the voice of several characters on the popular animated sitcom since 1989, including the Chief Wiggum, Duffman, Comic Book Guy, Snake Jailbird, and bartender Moe Szyslak. Azaria is worried that the unique and distinctive sounds of his characters could be replicated by AI easily. “In my case, AI could have access to 36 years of Moe, the permanently disgruntled bartender,” Azaria lamented, adding: “He’s appeared in just about every episode of ‘ The Simpsons .’ He’s been terrified, in love, hit in the head and, most often, in a state of bitter hatred. I’ve laughed as Moe in dozens of ways by now. I’ve probably sighed as Moe 100 times. In terms of training AI, that’s a lot to work with.” However, the actor, who has also appeared in films such as Godzilla, The Birdcage, and The Smurfs, believes AI will lack the “humanness” that he brought to The Simpsons because AI does not have a “soul and body”. “There’s so much of who I am that goes into creating a voice,” Azaria detailed. “How can the computer conjure all that? What will the lack of humanness sound like? How big will the difference be? I honestly don’t know, but I think it will be enough, at least in the near term, that we’ll notice something is off, in the same way that we notice something’s amiss in a subpar film or TV show,” he said. Azaria adds to a list of concerned artists Azaria further expressed concerns that maybe audiences are already being deceived in the film industry especially with the continued advancements in the tech sector, particularly AI. “It adds up to a sense that what we’re watching isn’t real, and you don’t need to pay attention to it. Believability is earned through craftsmanship, with good storytelling and good performances, good cinematography and good directing and a good script and good music.” The Simpsons is a satirical depiction of American life. The film has been aired on Fox since 1989 and is personified by the Simpson family: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. It caricatures society, Western culture, and the human condition through the fictional town of Springfield. The Simpsons is still in production. But Azaria is not the only artist concerned. In December last year, Friends star Lisa Kudrow criticized a Tom Hanks film titled “Here,” for its extensive use of Metaphysic Live, an AI-driven tool that is used to de-age and face-swap actors. “Set that completely aside, what work will there be for human beings? Then what? There’ll be some kind of living stipend for people, [as] you won’t have to work? How can it possibly be enough?” questioned Kudrow then. Hanks himself made headlines in May last year after discussing how AI would make him continue acting even after his demise. The use of AI in the film industry has attracted attention, sparking debates among stakeholders from writers, actors, and behind-the-scenes crew. Fears over the unchecked use of AI technology were part of the reasons for protests by writers and actors Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",AI,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-07 22:55:54

On the other hand, 1Fuel’s presale is filling up faster than justified, which is a sign of high demand and a positive investor mood. Its fresh approach to blockchain technology is driving this momentum, offering opportunities where others are falling short. Let’s look at what’s propelling 1Fuel up while the likes of Stellar fumble. Stellar (XLM): A Declining Market Presence While Stellar has been sold as a solution for lightning-fast and cost-effective cross-border payments, its market performance is painting a different picture. Currently, XLM is trading at around $0.34, which is approx. 1.5% less than the previous close. The high and low of the day’s trading range were at $0.3486 and $0.3235, respectively. This isn’t a periodic downturn; Stellar’smarket cap has fallen steadily, which is indicative of a larger issue with whether it can remain viable in the long term. The problem with Stellar is twofold. First off, it is competing against newer blockchain networks with similar features but on an even more advanced level when it comes to scalability. Secondly, its own blockchain solution has been unable to scale to adapt to changing DeFi trends, leaving it behind in the crypto space. Currently, XLM investors are getting anxious as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching oversold territory at 39.9, and its price is sinking below the support levels. Analysts warn that if Stellar’s price cannot maintain stability above $0.351, further declines may be coming. Stellar has made a name for itself in crypto, but recognition alone isn't good enough. XLM is less appealing than rising projects like 1Fuel due to a lack of innovation, and investors are looking for high-demand DeFi assets to make investments. 1Fuel (OFT): A New Leader in Scalability and DeFi Growth At first glance, Stellar has its work cut out for it, but 1 fuel is having to deal with a different sort of problem: fast-selling presale positions. In its third round of funding, the project has already raised over $1.9 million, with each OFT token now worth $0.017. Unlike Stellar, which is struggling to maintain its relevance, 1Fuel is thriving by providing a scalable blockchain solution that addresses the DeFi space. 1Fuel isn’t just another new token, it’s a high demand, DeFi asset that addresses some of the most pressing problems in getting a blockchain transaction done. It allows seamless cross-chain capabilities and ultra-low transaction fees, along with an advanced privacy system for security without slowing down. Consequently, this is what gives it an added edge as it is a highly attractive position for both traders and long-term investors who need a reliable asset that is able to survive the market volatility. Unlike Stellar, 1Fuel is detached from traditional financial use cases while still being in the early stages of decentralized finance. Designed for interoperability, its scalable blockchain solution allows for easy movement of assets between networks. With more investors understanding the benefits of this flexibility and the growing demand for 1Fuel, this is one of the quickest-growing projects in the current optimistic market cycle. Conclusion While Stellar sinks in its value, 1Fuel is breaking ground very fast and gaining the confidence of investors. Due to the rapid filling of presale positions, we can see a high interest in this project. In fast-growing opportunities like this one, the key to maximizing returns is to act early.

This update comes as OpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rival companies like DeepSeek. Earlier on Thursday, OpenAI announced that the paid and free users of ChatGPT will receive an “ updated chain of thought ” process in response to prompts. The chain of thought shows the model’s reasoning used to find answers. Paid subscribers using o3-mini-high will also receive the readout. O3-mini is a reasoning model, and hence, it is expected to thoroughly fact-check its responses before displaying the result. This helps avoid fallacies or inaccuracies in responses. However, it comes with a trade-off: longer response times. ChatGPT’s o3-mini model prompt (Source: OpenAI X account) It looks like OpenAI is trying to catch up with DeepSeek’s increasing hype around its open-source nature. AI researchers love transparency and argue that, unlike OpenAI, DeepSeek does not gate-keep the AI tech, which is the right approach. Apart from being open-source, DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model also shows the complete thought process, making the model easier to study. At the same time, it also helps with the user-experience, and allows the users to easily figure out if the model is going off-track. The OpenAI team is trying to make ChatGPT more transparent The team has been planning this update for a while. Last week, on 1st February, the OpenAI team, including Sam Altman and Kevin Weil, hosted a Reddit AMA . One reddit user asked, “ Can we please see all of the thinking tokens? ” In response, OpenAI VP Engineering responded , “ We are looking into ways to show more of the thinking process. Stay tuned. ” Kevin Weil also answered the question , and mentioned that the team is “ working on showing a bunch more than we show today. ” “T o improve clarity and safety, we’ve added an additional post-processing step where the model reviews the raw chain of thought, removing any unsafe content, and then simplifies any complex ideas. ” – An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch . Hence, OpenAI is likely to adopt more transparency in the near future, even though ChatGPT still does not show the full reasoning steps for its o3-mini, o1, and o1-mini models. For now, it only displays a summary of the reasoning.

The DeFi token, which is set to overtake Shiba Inu in market rankings, could also turn a $400 investment into $20,400 with ease. Mutuum Finance is currently priced at $0.01 in the first stage of presale. This is the lowest price, with gradual increments expected until a launch price of $0.06. This guarantees early investors a 600% return even before the token makes its mark in the open market. Mutuum Finance: A New Era in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance leads decentralized finance (DeFi) through an innovative platform that allows users to borrow and lend crypto. The project offers digital asset management through its user-focused platform focused on security, as well as flexibility and autonomy Mutuum Finance runs its operations through two lending markets labeled as Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Smart contracts through the P2C model ensures automated, secure transactions to provide efficient lending and borrowing. Users can also opt for the peer-to-peer model, which cuts out any intermediaries. The P2P system protects users through its security measures by blocking contact with low-security assets including unstable or centralized tokens and permitting only trusted audited tokens. The Mutuum Finance team is set to launch a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that will grant token holders governance control within the platform. The upcoming platform will enable users to interact as equal stakeholders through decision-making activities for future platform updates in a completely decentralized manner. In addition , the team is also set to launch a stablecoin collateralized against U.S. dollar value. Users will maintain asset value through this stablecoin during transactions made through its reliable blockchain system. Members of Mutuum wanting to earn passive income through liquidity pool investments can deposit assets like USDT to obtain competitive returns from their funds. Users who deposit $10,000 with 7% APY can receive $700 in annual interest payments unless market factors influence the outcome. ETH holders gain flexibility by using their crypto assets as collateral for loans. Mutuum Finance’s Presale: An Opportunity for Big Returns Currently, Mutuum Finance is in the first stage of its presale, with MUTM tokens available at an incredibly low price of just $0.01. This offers a unique opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at a discount before their value increases, with the price set to rise to $0.06 by the official launch. The presale’s attractive pricing makes it possible for early backers to see substantial returns after exchange listings. A 5000% post-launch rally could see a small $400 investment turn into $20,400. Crypto market experts are predicting a quick sellout for the presale due to the low entry cost. To fuel further excitement, the team will also be launching a beta version of the platform simultaneously with the token release. This move is expected to increase demand for MUTM and create upward pressure on its price, making the current presale stage an ideal time for those looking to get in early. Mutuum Finance Giveaway to Boost Community Engagement Mutuum Finance supports wider participation and community involvement through its $100,000 giveaway that will distribute the prize amount among 10 lucky winners. This is set to reward early adopters while simultaneously increasing both reach and engagement with its users. Mutuum Finance is a rapidly rising DeFi project which shows great promise in the decentralized finance sector. The platform has components for enduring success including dual lending markets and decentralized governance system and plans for developing a fully backed stablecoin. Early investors can get into the project today at a cheap entry price, while setting themselves up for generational gains when the token launches.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a dominant force, Solana (SOL) expands its ecosystem, and Cardano (ADA) strengthens its governance. However, a new name is generating substantial interest: Web3Bay (3BAY). This project isn’t just another digital currency; it’s a decentralized e-commerce platform. While many blockchain projects concentrate on finance, gaming, or meme trends, Web3Bay is disrupting a multi-trillion-dollar industry by aiming to make online shopping transparent, secure, and potentially fee-free. With staking rewards, community governance, and a successful presale, it’s rapidly becoming a prominent project. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in, Web3Bay warrants careful consideration. Web3Bay (3BAY): The End of Amazon & eBay In a world where Amazon, eBay, and Shopify hold considerable sway, traditional e-commerce platforms often control pricing, impose fees, and manage user data. Web3Bay seeks to transform this model by introducing transparency, lower costs, and user ownership through blockchain technology. This makes Web3Bay one of the best altcoins to invest in for those seeking disruption in the e-commerce space. What Positions Web3Bay as the Top Altcoin to Buy in 2025? Complete Decentralization & Smart Contract Renouncement: Unlike many platforms, Web3Bay aims for full decentralization. Following its presale, the team plans to renounce ownership of its smart contract. This action ensures no central authority can manipulate the platform. Instead, governance will be transferred to 3BAY token holders, empowering them to vote on crucial decisions like transaction fees, new features, and partnerships. This decentralized structure is a key factor making it one of the best altcoins to invest in. Earning Potential with Staking Rewards: Web3Bay offers more than just shopping; it provides opportunities for passive income. Holders of 3BAY tokens can stake their assets and earn rewards, making it an appealing option for long-term investors. This staking model enables participants to grow their holdings over time, benefiting from both potential price appreciation and staking yields. This passive income stream adds to its appeal as one of the best altcoins to invest in. 5% Discount for 3BAY Payments: A common challenge for cryptocurrency adoption is the lack of real-world utility. Web3Bay addresses this issue by offering a 5% discount on purchases made with 3BAY tokens. This incentive encourages adoption and gives the token a practical use case from its inception. This real-world application strengthens its position among the best altcoins to invest in. Successful Presale & Potential for High Returns: Web3Bay’s presale has seen significant traction, raising over $1 million with more than 274 million tokens sold. Currently, in Stage 4 priced at $0.004562625, the projected launch price of $0.1959 represents a potential return on investment of over 4,200% for early investors. Analysts anticipate even greater gains after launch as adoption increases. This high growth potential makes it a compelling choice for investors looking for the best altcoins to invest in. With its decentralized structure, robust tokenomics, and practical application, Web3Bay is poised to be a significant project in 2025. Web3Bay: Decentralized E-Commerce Redefined Web3Bay is not simply another cryptocurrency. It’s a platform designed to revolutionize e-commerce by bringing transparency, security, and fairness to online transactions. The platform’s decentralized nature ensures that no single entity controls user data or dictates pricing. This shift towards user empowerment makes Web3Bay stand out among the best altcoins to invest in. The integration of blockchain technology allows for secure and transparent transactions, while the staking mechanism rewards token holders for their participation in the network. Web3Bay’s focus on real-world utility, through the 5% discount for 3BAY payments, further solidifies its potential for growth and adoption. Bitcoin (BTC): The Foundation of the Crypto Market Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. Following the April 2024 halving, block rewards were reduced, increasing BTC’s scarcity and influencing its price. Institutional adoption is also on the rise, with spot ETFs gaining approval and governments globally acknowledging Bitcoin’s store-of-value properties. With continued mainstream adoption, regulatory acceptance, and its limited supply, Bitcoin remains a core holding in many crypto portfolios. Solana (SOL): The High-Performance Blockchain Solana has become a major player in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 gaming sectors, offering exceptional speed and efficiency. Processing over 2,400 transactions per second with minimal fees, it’s one of the most scalable Layer 1 blockchains. Despite previous network congestion issues, Solana’s recent upgrades have significantly improved reliability, attracting more developers and institutional interest. With ETF filings underway and AI-powered integrations strengthening its developer ecosystem, Solana is positioned to maintain its status as a leading crypto asset in 2025. Cardano (ADA): A Leader in Decentralization and Security Cardano is recognized for its secure and decentralized blockchain. The Plomin Hard Fork introduced on-chain governance, empowering ADA holders with direct decision-making capabilities. The blockchain is expanding its influence in DeFi, enterprise adoption, and staking mechanisms, with more projects launching within its ecosystem. Cardano’s approach, based on peer-reviewed research, ensures robust security and efficiency. With growing institutional partnerships and new features like Hydra Layer 2 scaling, Cardano is set for increased adoption. If ADA maintains its current trajectory, it could experience substantial price appreciation, making it an attractive investment option for 2025. XRP (XRP): Transforming Cross-Border Payments XRP continues to be a significant force in global payments, recently gaining regulatory approval for its RLUSD stablecoin. Facilitating fast, low-cost international transfers, XRP plays a key role in the integration of cryptocurrency with traditional finance. Despite past legal challenges, Ripple’s progress in achieving regulatory clarity strengthens its position in the financial sector. The company’s expanding partnerships with banks and institutions indicate growing confidence in XRP’s use case. With instant settlement capabilities and low transaction costs, XRP remains a crucial player in cross-border payments. Best Altcoins to Invest in for 2025 and Beyond The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and 2025 is expected to be another significant year. While Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, and XRP remain influential, Web3Bay demonstrates that new projects with practical applications can establish their presence. With a successful presale, strong use cases, and high potential return on investment, Web3Bay could be a standout project in 2025. Whether your investment strategy focuses on long-term stability or high-growth potential, these five cryptocurrencies are worth considering. For those seeking the best altcoins to invest in , thorough research and due diligence are essential.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN .

The rapid decline sent shockwaves through the crypto space, marking one of the most volatile trading sessions ever recorded for ETH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Support Sits At $90,6K Short-Term Holder Realized Price – Expert Reveals Key Resistance Level However, within hours, the price rebounded, erasing nearly the entire drop and stabilizing above key support levels. Despite this swift recovery, Ethereum now faces serious risks as it trades slightly below a crucial resistance level, leaving investors uncertain about its next move. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently in consolidation, attempting to form a higher low after the dramatic market flush from this weekend. He noted that this phase is critical for determining the next major trend, as holding above current levels could signal the beginning of a new bullish leg. Failure to establish strong support could lead to further downside, putting Ethereum at risk of another correction. With uncertainty still looming, all eyes are on ETH’s ability to reclaim lost ground and establish momentum for a potential breakout in the coming days. Ethereum Prepares for a Decisive Move Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is currently trading below the $2,800 mark, struggling to gain momentum after last week’s historic volatility. The recent price action has left investors frustrated, as hopes for a strong rally continue to fade. While Bitcoin has shown relative strength, Ethereum remains stuck in a tight range, unable to break above key resistance levels. The uncertainty in the market has led to a decline in investor confidence, with many questioning whether ETH will be able to reclaim its bullish structure anytime soon. Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that consolidations are forming everywhere. He noted that BTC, ETH, and most altcoins are displaying similar patterns—attempting to establish a higher low after the aggressive flush from the weekend. According to Daan, if Ethereum successfully breaks above its consolidation channel, it could gain the momentum needed to push above key supply levels and start a new bullish phase. However, failure to do so could lead to more downside pressure. The coming weeks will be crucial for Ethereum’s price trajectory. If ETH can hold above $2,700 and push toward $3,000, it may spark renewed interest from investors. However, continued failure to reclaim key resistance levels could push Ethereum into deeper consolidation, further frustrating market participants. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Testing Key Support on the ETH/BTC Chart – A Parabolic Move Could Be Next Despite short-term uncertainty, institutions are continuing to accumulate ETH, recognizing its long-term value. Historically, these periods of consolidation have been followed by explosive price movements. Price Struggles Below $2,900 Ethereum is currently trading at $2,750 after days of consolidation below the $2,900 mark. Despite multiple attempts to push higher, ETH has struggled to reclaim key resistance levels that would signal a shift in momentum. The price action remains uncertain, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,700 support zone while looking for a breakout above the $2,800 mark to regain short-term control. The most critical resistance level remains the $3,000 mark. If Ethereum can successfully push above this price and turn it into support, it will open the door for a rally into higher supply levels. This would strengthen the bullish case and potentially trigger a move toward $3,300 or higher. Related Reading: Solana Could Target $220 If It Holds Current Levels – Analyst Expects Short-Term Bullish Momentum On the downside, holding above $2,700 is crucial for avoiding further selling pressure. If ETH fails to defend this level, a drop toward $2,600 or even $2,500 could be the next move. However, as long as Ethereum remains within this consolidation range, traders will continue to watch for a decisive breakout. A close above $2,800 in the coming days would be the first sign that bulls are gaining momentum and that a new uptrend is beginning.

In a new post to the social media platform X, Armstrong lays out the case for why he thinks Coinbase is now competing with the largest US banks, brokerages and payment companies. “If you think of Coinbase like a bank, we now hold about $0.42 trillion in assets for our customers, which would make us the 21st largest bank in the US by total assets, and growing. If you think of us more like a brokerage, we’d be the 8th largest brokerage today by AUM (assets under management). If you think of us like a payments company… to be honest, I’m not sure where we rank on that list. There are various ways to measure it, but there were about $30 trillion in total stablecoin payments last year (not all of those were goods and services though).” Armstrong says that the distinction between Coinbase and many top-US financial providers is dissolving as the leading US-based crypto exchange expands. “Many people use Coinbase to invest, but also to spend, get a loan, etc. In the updated financial system, you will have a single primary financial account which serves all these functions. A greater % of global GDP (gross domestic product) will run on more efficient crypto rails over time. We’ll have sound money, lower friction transactions, and greater economic freedom for all.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Apple Removes Unregistered Crypto Exchange Apps On February 6, 2024, Apple complied with a request from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) by removing five unregistered crypto exchange apps from its App Store. The affected platforms included Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin, and Bitcastle. This action followed multiple cautions from the FSA, urging these platforms to either comply with local regulations or exit the market. Furthermore, a Nikkei report on February 7 revealed that the FSA formally requested Apple to restrict access to these apps for Japanese users. This then leads to their prompt removal. Crypto Regulation Focuses on Investor Protection, Not a Ban Unlike other countries where the removal of exchanges could signal a ban, Japan’s regulatory approach remains focused on investor protection. The FSA has clarified that its measures are not aimed at restricting crypto investments but are designed to enforce transparent regulations that protect investors. The authority has consistently reiterated that all crypto exchanges operating in Japan must adhere to the country’s legal framework. In November 2024, reports revealed that the five exchanges had been operating in Japan without the necessary registration and lacked the FSA or any local financial bureau authorization. In other words, they were providing services to Japanese users without regulatory approval, placing investors at potential risk. Why Stricter Crypto Rules? It is worth noting that while opinions vary on the reasons behind Japan’s stricter measures, one key factor is the recent classification of digital assets to be treated similarly to traditional financial assets. Essentially, this signals Japan’s commitment to the long-term integration of crypto rather than its exclusion. However, some reports suggest that even though these exchanges were removed from the App Store, users who downloaded the apps can continue using them without significant issues. This is because the removal only affects future downloads, and Apple and Google cannot remove apps already on users’ devices. Meanwhile, last year, Japan’s FSA proposed tax reforms in response to growing demands from the crypto industry for a more favorable tax environment.

40054433,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56646,1738969633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Elon Musk Turns to XRP: A Game-Changer for Ripple and XRP?,https://timestabloid.com/elon-musk-turns-to-xrp-a-game-changer-for-ripple-and-xrp/,"In a surprising twist, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has set his sights on XRP . A recent wallstreetbets tweet stated “Elon Musk’s latest crush on XRP might just turn the crypto world upside down. Who knew the man who flirted with Dogecoin was turning XRP the prom queen?” This unexpected development has sparked widespread speculation across the cryptocurrency space. Investors and analysts wonder whether Musk’s influence could send XRP into a new phase of mainstream adoption and price volatility. Elon Musk’s Crypto Influence: From Dogecoin to XRP Elon Musk has long been known for his unpredictable but impactful involvement in the crypto space. His tweets and public endorsements have historically caused massive price swings for various digital assets: Dogecoin (DOGE): Musk’s frequent support for Dogecoin, including referring to himself as the “Dogefather,” led to massive rallies for the meme coin, at one point pushing DOGE to an all-time high of $0.74 in 2021. His tweets about Dogecoin, often playful and meme-driven, significantly influenced its price movement and mainstream appeal. Bitcoin (BTC): In early 2021, Tesla’s announcement that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sent BTC soaring. However, Musk’s later concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption led to a sharp decline. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A simple tweet from Musk mentioning his pet Shiba Inu also sent SHIB surging, demonstrating his ability to influence market trends with minimal effort. Musk’s reported interest in XRP has traders and investors on high alert. Could his endorsement propel XRP to new heights? XRP’s Market Position and Recent Performance As of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $2.38, showing a 2.6% increase from the previous day. This recent surge coincides with broader bullish sentiment in the market, but Musk’s rumored attention could further boost the rally. XRP has long been a prominent digital asset, primarily due to its use in cross-border payments through Ripple’s blockchain solutions. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which focus on decentralization and smart contracts, Ripple and XRP aim to revolutionize international finance by providing faster, cost-effective transactions than traditional banking. However, XRP has faced regulatory hurdles, most notably its long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A favorable resolution to this case could further boost XRP’s adoption and market confidence. Potential Implications of Musk’s Interest in XRP If Elon Musk is indeed turning his attention to XRP, the impact could be far-reaching. Here’s what to expect: Significant Price Volatility: Musk’s influence on crypto markets is undeniable. If he starts tweeting positively about XRP, we could see a surge in speculative buying, leading to increased volatility. However, as with Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Musk’s involvement could also introduce sharp corrections when market sentiment shifts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Increased Adoption and Institutional Interest: Musk’s endorsement could attract new investors to XRP, particularly retail traders who follow his financial moves. Additionally, if Tesla, SpaceX, or X (formerly Twitter) integrate XRP for payments, it could drive mainstream adoption and make XRP more widely accepted in real-world transactions. Renewed Regulatory Scrutiny: XRP is still dealing with the SEC lawsuit, which alleges that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering. Musk’s growing interest could spark greater regulatory scrutiny for Ripple, XRP holders, and institutional partners. Potential Collaboration with Ripple: Given Musk’s interest in disruptive financial technology, a Tesla-Ripple partnership or XRP integration into Musk’s companies isn’t entirely out of the question. If Musk sees value in Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions, it could lead to corporate-level adoption beyond mere price speculation. Will Musk’s XRP Interest Lead to a Rally? While it remains to be seen whether Musk will actively promote XRP as he did with Dogecoin, the market has already started reacting to the wallstreetbets post. If Musk confirms his interest in XRP through tweets or direct involvement, we could see another wave of speculative buying. However, XRP’s long-term success will depend on more than just hype. Regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and real-world utility will significantly influence whether Musk’s involvement translates into sustainable growth for XRP. Elon Musk’s rumored attention toward XRP has sent waves through the crypto community. His ability to move markets with a single tweet is well-documented, and if XRP becomes his next “crush,” we may see unprecedented levels of interest in the asset. Investors should remain cautious, as Musk’s involvement in crypto has historically led to explosive gains and sharp corrections. However, if this speculation materializes into tangible actions such as a Ripple partnership, XRP payments on Tesla, or broader institutional adoption, XRP’s future could be even brighter than anticipated. Only time will tell if this is a fleeting Musk-driven surge or a sustainable turning point for XRP. One thing is certain: the crypto world is watching.

House Bill 1217, filed by State Representative Phil Christofanelli, aims to establish the “Missouri Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund,” making it one of the first such initiatives at the state level in the United States. The bill proposes allocating a portion of state funds to Bitcoin, citing its potential as a long-term store of value. If passed, it would authorize the Missouri State Treasurer to invest in Bitcoin on behalf of the state, with the goal of strengthening Missouri’s financial position amid concerns about inflation and economic instability. Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation Christofanelli emphasized the importance of adopting Bitcoin to protect state funds from economic uncertainties. “Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the last decade, and I believe it has a role to play in the financial future of our state,” he said. Supporters of the bill argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it a strong hedge against inflation compared to traditional financial assets. The initiative follows similar moves by private institutions and foreign governments that have begun accumulating Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Managing the Bitcoin Reserve Fund Under the proposed legislation, the Missouri State Treasurer would be responsible for managing the Bitcoin reserve, ensuring the state’s investments are secure. The bill outlines measures to regulate how Bitcoin is purchased, stored, and utilized to prevent excessive risk. Christofanelli stressed that the fund is intended as a long-term investment, stating that Bitcoin’s historical performance makes it a viable asset for state reserves. “We’ve seen private companies and even some foreign nations move toward Bitcoin reserves, and Missouri should be ahead of the curve,” he added. Concerns Over Bitcoin Volatility While the bill has gained support from Bitcoin advocates, critics have raised concerns over the cryptocurrency’s price volatility. Bitcoin’s value has fluctuated significantly over the years, prompting some lawmakers to question whether it is a stable investment for government funds. Despite these concerns, Christofanelli and other proponents believe Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory justifies the investment. They argue that Bitcoin’s adoption continues to grow, and its value is expected to appreciate over time. A Growing Trend Among U.S. States Missouri’s proposal comes as more U.S. states explore ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial policies. States like Texas and Wyoming have introduced legislation supporting cryptocurrency use, while Florida has considered allowing residents to pay taxes in Bitcoin. If Missouri’s bill is approved, it could set a precedent for other states to follow, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable financial asset at the government level. The bill is currently under review and will need to pass through the state legislature before becoming law. If successful, Missouri would become one of the first states in the U.S. to officially hold Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-07 23:14:00

But, let’s break it down for you. With the rise of promising projects and cutting-edge blockchain technology, there are some clear contenders for massive growth this week. Among these, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Immutable X stand out as top picks, each with a unique value proposition for investors looking for exponential returns. Ethereum, the reigning giant of the smart contract platform space, has weathered the storm of market volatility while maintaining its dominance. Meanwhile, Immutable X, the layer-2 blockchain solution for NFTs and gaming, is rapidly gaining traction. And Qubetics? It’s the newcomer that’s turning heads, offering a decentralized VPN and a ton of upside potential, especially with its ongoing presale. Let’s dive into the features of these cryptos and why they might just be the perfect picks for your portfolio this week. We’ll take a closer look at Qubetics, Ethereum, and Immutable X to uncover why they’re making waves and what sets them apart in a sea of other tokens. Qubetics: The Next Big Thing in Blockchain for the Digital Age If you’ve been paying attention to blockchain innovations, you know that the market is full of projects looking to solve real-world problems. But Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another blockchain project—this one has the potential to change how we think about privacy, security, and digital finance. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy this week for exponential returns, this could be your golden ticket. Qubetics is in the middle of its 20th stage presale, and it’s already made quite an impression, raising over $12 million and selling more than 462 million tokens to 18,700+ holders. The presale price stands at $0.0667 per token, making this an opportune time for early investors to secure their stake before the price climbs in later stages. But it’s not just the presale buzz that’s exciting—Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN, which is a huge deal in today’s increasingly digital and privacy-conscious world. Imagine being able to conduct business or personal transactions without worrying about your data being compromised. The decentralized nature of Qubetics’ VPN ensures that you stay private and secure while navigating the internet, making it a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and everyday individuals alike. Take, for example, a freelance graphic designer who needs to work remotely for clients in various countries. With Qubetics, they can maintain a secure, anonymous internet connection, protecting sensitive client data and avoiding expensive international data fees. Similarly, businesses with teams spread across the globe can leverage Qubetics to ensure secure communications and safe online transactions. With analysts predicting a potential 1,398% return on investment once Qubetics hits $1 after the presale, there’s plenty of room for exponential growth. Some even predict that $TICS could hit as high as $15 after the mainnet launch, delivering an unbelievable 22,382% ROI. But the question is: will you be part of the action before this rocket takes off? Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts Still Leading the Pack Ethereum ($ETH) has stood the test of time, proving itself as one of the most stable and powerful blockchains for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and more. When it comes to the best cryptos to buy this week for exponential returns, Ethereum continues to be a staple in many investor portfolios. Ethereum’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride lately, with analysts eyeing the $2,817 level as a key point for potential upward movement. If Ethereum can reclaim and maintain this support level, there’s a strong possibility that it could surge past key resistance levels—$3,550, $3,770, and $4,100—on its way to a 40% rally, potentially pushing toward $4,500. Ethereum’s dominance remains strong, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Ethereum has been resilient even amid market volatility, and with the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, its future looks brighter than ever. The proof-of-stake upgrade and enhanced scalability will make Ethereum even more appealing to developers, enterprises, and investors. In addition, Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs is only increasing, making it a top pick for those looking to diversify their portfolios with established cryptos that still offer room for growth. Ethereum has already proven its potential, and while it may not offer the explosive returns that some newer tokens provide, it remains a solid bet for those looking for long-term growth in the crypto space. Keep an eye on Ethereum as it navigates through its current price levels and heads toward further adoption and innovation in the months to come. Immutable X: Revolutionizing NFTs and Gaming Immutable X is leading the charge when it comes to NFTs and gaming on the blockchain. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy this week for exponential returns, don’t sleep on Immutable X ($IMX). This project has cracked the code on one of the biggest challenges facing blockchain technology: high fees, slow transactions, and scalability issues. Immutable X uses zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-Rollups) to create a layer-2 solution for Ethereum, allowing gas-free minting and trading of NFTs. This is huge for anyone looking to get involved in the growing NFT market, whether you’re a gamer, artist, or collector. The platform also ensures instant transactions, meaning no more waiting around for trades or transactions to clear. With 1.84 million monthly active users and over 500 games already integrated into the ecosystem, Immutable X is quickly becoming the go-to blockchain for gaming studios and NFT projects. It’s only a matter of time before Immutable X gains even more mainstream attention, especially as blockchain gaming continues to experience rapid growth. In addition to providing a solution to high fees and slow transaction times, Immutable X also prioritizes security, making it an attractive option for developers and businesses that need to ensure the integrity of their NFT-based applications. As blockchain gaming adoption accelerates, Immutable X’s position in the space is likely to grow, offering potential exponential returns for investors who get in early. Decentralized VPNs: The Future of Secure Online Transactions Now, let’s take a closer look at the broader concept behind decentralized VPNs and why they matter in the blockchain ecosystem. A decentralized VPN, like the one being developed by Qubetics, offers a much-needed solution for privacy and security in the digital age. Traditional VPNs rely on centralized service providers, which means that they can be compromised, hacked, or misused. In contrast, a decentralized VPN operates on a distributed network of nodes, making it significantly harder for third parties to breach your data. With data privacy concerns on the rise, having a secure, decentralized internet connection is more important than ever. In the context of blockchain technology, decentralized VPNs enable individuals and businesses to maintain control over their data while accessing the global internet. Whether you’re a remote worker collaborating with international clients, a business owner sending confidential financial data, or simply someone looking to browse the internet securely, decentralized VPNs have the potential to offer unmatched privacy. Qubetics is one of the pioneers in this field, and its focus on a decentralized VPN could give it an edge over its competitors in the years to come. With blockchain technology continuing to revolutionize various sectors, the demand for secure and private internet connections will only continue to grow. If you’re looking for a project that’s positioned to solve real-world problems, Qubetics is definitely worth considering. Conclusion: Time to Buy the Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Whether you’re looking for a new, innovative project like Qubetics, a stalwart like Ethereum, or a cutting-edge blockchain for NFTs and gaming like Immutable X, this week presents a great opportunity to make some smart investment decisions. As always, doing your own research is crucial before diving into any project, but with exponential return potential, these three cryptos should be at the top of your list.

The firm also revealed intentions to launch its own layer-1 blockchain. Key figures with close political ties—including Trump Jr. and other well-known Trump affiliates—are prominently involved. This move comes amid broader discussions on digital asset regulation and the feasibility of strategic reserves in the crypto market. U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLF), plans to create a strategic reserve of tokens it purchases, WLF co-founder Chase Herro told audiences at Ondo Finance’s February 6 summit in New York. World Liberty Financial Co-Founders Talk At Ondo Finance Summit According to Bloomberg , Herro, WLF co-founders Zak Folkman and Witkoff Capital president Zach Witkoff were all introduced by Donald Trump Jr. as they spearheaded a panel on Thursday held at Jazz at Lincoln Center. President Donald Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, plans on creating a ""strategic reserve"" with tokens bought https://t.co/zH6O3bMuKu — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 6, 2025 Earlier on Thursday, reports emerged that a wallet belonging to WLF had purchased 342,000 ONDO tokens for $470,000 USDC. While no specific details surrounding the crypto reserve were revealed, the tokenized real-world asset platform also announced plans to introduce its own layer-1 blockchain at the summit. “Financial markets are overdue for an upgrade,” CEO Nathan Allman said in a statement. “We’re creating an ecosystem that bridges the best of traditional finance with blockchain technology.” Witkoff, who is the son of Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, seemingly has a close affiliation with the Trump family, going so far as to name his newborn son Donald after the newly-elected president. Donald Trump’s Expanding Crypto Empire Trump, who widely campaigned on enacting fair digital asset regulations , helped to launch World Liberty Financial late last year. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are listed as the crypto organization’s “Web3 ambassadors,” while Barron Trump is credited as the brand’s “DeFi visionary.” The crypto collective has been at the heart of legal scrutiny in the past, with allegations of potential insider trading regarding certain token purchases – though this has not been confirmed. Trump has long pushed the concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve amid his growing connection to the digital asset sector. Last month, Trump signed an executive order mandating the creation of a crypto working group aimed at evaluating U.S. digital asset policy on the heels of launching his own meme coin, aptly titled TRUMP. Just this week, newly-selected crypto czar “David Sacks” told attendees of a Washington D.C. press conference that assessing the viability of a strategic Bitcoin reserve was of top priority following completed formation of the crypto working group. Bitcoin’s value has stagnated in recent weeks after it experienced a post-election rally that saw it cross the psychologically important $100,000 mark. Though the future of crypto reserves in the U.S. digital asset sector (and beyond) remains uncertain, upcoming policy developments may prompt new perspectives and strategies for how governments and institutions adopt digital assets—potentially shaping the broader financial environment in the coming years. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): A Deeper Exploration 1. What exactly is a strategic crypto reserve, and how might it operate? A strategic crypto reserve is envisioned as a stockpile of digital assets—similar in concept to a nation’s gold or petroleum reserves—that could be deployed during financial disruptions or used to hedge against inflation. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies require specialized custody solutions and risk-management strategies due to their inherent volatility and digital nature. This approach would likely involve secure, blockchain-based vaults and a diversified mix of tokens to mitigate risk. 2. What potential benefits could such a reserve offer to the U.S. financial system? Proponents argue that a well-managed crypto reserve could diversify national reserves and serve as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and inflation. By holding a portfolio of digital assets, the government might gain additional flexibility in monetary policy and even leverage the reserve to address national debt issues. An official reserve could also signal regulatory and institutional support for the digital asset ecosystem, potentially spurring innovation and attracting global investment. 3. What are the main risks and challenges associated with establishing a strategic crypto reserve? The risks include extreme price volatility, challenges in secure custody and auditability, and potential market disruption if large-scale sales occur. There is also the risk of politicization and conflicts of interest—especially given the involvement of politically connected figures—which could undermine the reserve’s credibility. Also, without a clear regulatory framework, issues such as liquidity management and transparency remain serious concerns. 4. What are the implications of the Trump family’s involvement for the governance and perception of this initiative? The active participation of high-profile figures like Donald Trump Jr. and other family members lends political weight and media attention to the project, potentially accelerating its adoption and influence. However, it also raises concerns about transparency, potential conflicts of interest, and the risk that political considerations might overshadow prudent financial management. Critics warn that such politicization could lead to regulatory favoritism or abuse, undermining investor confidence and the integrity of the national reserve system.

Sponsored by Delegate Caylin Young, the bill aims to allow state funds derived from gambling violations to be allocated into Bitcoin (BTC). The initiative reflects the increasing trend among U.S. states to explore digital asset investment in their financial strategies. Maryland Introduces Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act Maryland has followed suit with other states considering digital asset investments by introducing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The bill seeks to create a Bitcoin reserve fund that would serve as a financial asset for the state. If passed, the legislation would permit the state treasurer to invest funds obtained from enforcing gambling violations into Bitcoin. The proposal aligns with similar efforts across the U.S., where states are evaluating Bitcoin as a potential store of value. Maryland’s move comes amid increasing discussions on the role of digital assets in government financial planning. In a recent CoinGape report, Donald Trump’s Crypto Czar, David Sacks, stated that his team is evaluating the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin reserve. Sacks confirmed that this is one of their top priorities as they assess BTC reserve feasibility. The initiative follows Trump’s executive order to explore a national digital asset stockpile. Expanding State-Level Interest Several states have introduced or are actively debating Bitcoin reserve bills. At least 22 states are engaged in discussions, legislative proposals, or actual investments in digital assets. Michigan and Wisconsin have already allocated portions of their retirement funds into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The increasing interest in Bitcoin reserves has gained momentum following federal discussions on cryptocurrency policy. While no federal legislation has been enacted, state-level initiatives continue to progress. Earlier this week, New Mexico introduced Senate Bill 57 (SB57) to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The bill, proposed by Senator Ant Thornton, seeks to allocate 5% of public funds to Bitcoin as an alternative investment. The reserve would be managed by the State Investment Officer under the State Investment Council’s oversight. Utah Advances Digital Assets Bill Utah’s legislative efforts toward digital asset investments have reached a new stage. The state’s House of Representatives recently passed a bill allowing the state treasurer to invest in select cryptocurrencies. The bill now moves to the Senate for further approval. If enacted, the law would permit investments in stablecoins and cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion. As of now, Bitcoin is the only digital asset that meets this threshold. The bill’s passage through the House indicates growing legislative support for cryptocurrency investment strategies. In addition, Kentucky has entered the digital asset landscape with a newly introduced bill. The proposal, KY HB376, would allow the State Investment Commission to allocate up to 10% of excess state reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets. Kentucky joins other states considering similar measures to diversify their financial holdings. The proposal also introduces provisions restricting the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) within the state.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

However, she agreed to introduce the token when she thought half of the profits would go to her charity. She further claims that the meme token was presented to her in a very positive light, arguing she was misled. She commented: It was brought to me in a positive way — it was going to be something good and long-term, but it didn’t go that route at all, so it was like a smack in the face. Hailey Welch Welch is now suing the meme coin makers, with her lawyer Christian Barker insisting she was deceived on the project’s tokenomics, given that the token deployer holds about 80% of the token’s supply. The Hawk Tuah token was first released on December 4, 2024, and quickly amassed close to $500 million in market cap in just a few hours after its launch. However, the token quickly plummeted, falling by over 91% to $41 million in market capitalization the next day. Banks did not approve the release of his interview with Hailey Welch FaZe Banks revealed that he only agreed to the interview under certain conditions. In his X post, Banks disclosed some of the stipulations, including that their interview should not be leaked to manipulate markets and that her team formulate a plan for the money she made, where it needs to go, and what to do with the token project. Welch’s team even promised not to reveal the episode until his side greenlighted it. However, the episode leaked on Thursday before being taken down shortly after. Banks believes that the growing hype around the meme token fueled the leak. He feels there was a hidden agenda behind the leak, especially with the token’s price rising almost immediately. He even added that he understood why Welch ended up in her predicament in the first place. The Hawk token more than doubled in price on Thursday before dipping by more than 9% to $0.0002233 .

The speculation began when influencer Nick O’Neil posted that both Kanye West and Portnoy were working with Meteora on new token launches. However, Portnoy quickly shut down the rumors, calling O’Neil a “liar” and denying any involvement. Liar https://t.co/FH2wjDl3oi — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 7, 2025 From there, things escalated, allowing Dave to dump on his followers, who bought because of his obvious yet indirect promotion of the coin. Crypto’s “Crime Supercycle”: How Dave Portnoy Got Rich Off His Followers Despite this back and forth regarding affiliation, Portnoy’s mere association with meme coins continued to shake the market as many are expecting another similar spiral launch like TRUMP. In fact, the betting platform Polymarket saw the odds of Portnoy launching a meme coin collapse by 44% after his denial.

Uh oh. Davey learned how to trade shitcoin and is already up a billion percent on my 1st one!!!!!! #montoyaporfavor pic.twitter.com/7qlI1ZoxT0 — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 7, 2025 Similarly, he publicly announced his purchase of the Josh Allen-themed MVP coin, initially investing $30,000. This single-handedly sent the token’s market cap soaring, and within hours, his holdings ballooned to over $220,000. I lost 1 million dollars on the Bill Super Bowl. I think I can make a million back on Josh Allen MVP coin. Buy at your own risk. I just bought it. I’m gonna sell it. Don’t buy what ya can’t lose. pic.twitter.com/PTNVdjo3Ow — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 7, 2025 While Portnoy has never shied away from his gambling mentality, he openly admitted to treating these trades as high-stakes bets. As he posted: “I lost a million dollars on the Bills Super Bowl. I think I can make a million back on Josh Allen MVP coin. Buy at your own risk. I just bought it. I’m gonna sell it. Don’t buy what ya can’t lose.” This blunt statement, while cynical, is what many critics have long pointed out: crypto speculation driven by influencers is less about fundamentals and more about market manipulation. Portnoy’s actions once again reignited the debate around the ethics and legality of influencer-driven crypto trading. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported that Portnoy made $75,000 from his meme coin trades just today. This is Dave Portnoy He made $75K on memecoins today. https://t.co/GJObDOuXCa https://t.co/Mpm5amGAh4 pic.twitter.com/VnyBbdphGq — Arkham (@arkham) February 7, 2025 This led to community reactions labeling this era as the “crime supercycle,” with influencer Jakey jokingly declaring, “CRIME IS LEGAL IN CRYPTO.” CRIME IS LEGAL IN CRYPTO ""This is the crime supercycle"" pic.twitter.com/Y9K53l1Qbf — BlockNews (@blocknewsdotcom) February 7, 2025 Portnoy later tried to distance himself from the controversy, clarifying that his engagement with memecoins was distinct from launching his own token. “For the millionth time, me f***ing around buying shitcoins vs. me doing my own is night and day. I’ll never ever drop my own coin unless I’m 100% sure I don’t get scammed,” he insisted, adding that if he ever did, it would only be through his verified channels. However, Nick O’Neil and others maintain that they have evidence linking Portnoy to the Meteora project, keeping the controversy alive. Hey @stoolpresidente it’s your move… pic.twitter.com/gTeV6GCEbZ — Nick O’Neill (@chooserich) February 7, 2025 The situation, whether linked to Portnoy or not, reflects the broader influence of high-profile figures in crypto trading. “Learning From History: The Dangers of Meme Coin Influencer Hype Portnoy is far from the first influencer to profit off meme coin mania at the expense of their followers. Logan Paul notoriously promoted the disastrous CryptoZoo project , leaving many investors with worthless tokens. Similarly, Kim Kardashian was fined by the SEC for failing to disclose that she had been paid to promote EthereumMax, a dubious token that quickly plummeted in value. Portnoy’s meme coin trades are another stark reminder that buyers must conduct research rather than blindly follow high-profile figures. Ultimately, while influencers can generate enormous market movement, their incentives rarely align with long-term investor interests. Interestingly, Kanye West, who was reportedly entangled in all these initially, later posted that someone offered him $2 million to scam his community with a “fake ye currency.” I was proposed 2 million dollars to scam my community Those left of it I said no and stopped working with their person who proposed it pic.twitter.com/WKHdP9FkOq — ye (@kanyewest) February 7, 2025 Still, as it stands currently, Kanye West has not launched any meme coin. While viral hype can spark sudden price surges, genuine understanding of a project’s fundamentals is the most reliable shield against costly missteps.

This move aims to enhance SBI’s digital asset offerings and solidify its position at the forefront of blockchain innovation in Japan. Alessio Meloni highlighted the development, emphasizing the expansion of SBI Group’s digital space and the involvement of prominent issuers like Ripple and Circle. MASSIVE NEWS! RLUSD & USDC ARE COMING TO JAPAN’S LARGEST BANK—SBI! SBI GROUP’S DIGITAL SPACE ECOSYSTEM IS EXPANDING, WITH SBIVC SET TO HANDLE STABLECOINS! @RIPPLE & @CIRCLE LISTED AS ISSUERS—GLOBAL STABLECOIN ADOPTION IS HERE! https://t.co/Qz95vhyFwA pic.twitter.com/NeZWtdsNjw — Alessio Meloni (@Panzbaby777) February 7, 2025 SBI Holdings’ Commitment to Ripple and XRP SBI Holdings is a longstanding supporter of Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP. The company holds a significant stake in Ripple Labs and has actively promoted the adoption of XRP in various financial services. In collaboration with Ripple, SBI has facilitated international remittance services utilizing XRP, targeting countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This partnership has enabled faster and more cost-effective cross-border transactions, benefiting individuals and businesses. Introduction of RLUSD and USDC Stablecoins Building upon its existing relationship with Ripple, SBI is now set to incorporate RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, into its digital offerings. Launched in October 2024, RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents, ensuring stability and trust for users. Additionally, SBI is partnering with Circle to integrate USDC, another leading U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. This collaboration aims to enhance USDC’s circulation within Japan’s financial system and promote Web3 services across the country. SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, is pursuing registration as an electronic payment instruments service provider to facilitate this consolidation, awaiting regulatory approval. Implications for Ripple and XRP RLUSD and USDC’s integration into SBI Holdings’ ecosystem has significant implications for Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP. As one of Ripple’s strongest institutional partners, SBI’s adoption of RLUSD reinforces Ripple’s position as a key player in the stablecoin and cross-border payment space. Moreover, with RLUSD designed to complement Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which utilizes XRP for instant global transactions, this development could increase XRP’s utility and liquidity. As more financial institutions begin to interact with RLUSD, it is likely that demand for Ripple’s broader payment solutions, including XRP , will rise. This move may further strengthen XRP’s standing in the digital asset market, potentially driving adoption and price appreciation in the long term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Implications for SBI and the Broader Market RLUSD and USDC’s integration into SBI’s ecosystem represents a strategic move to diversify its digital asset portfolio and meet the growing demand for stablecoin-based transactions. Stablecoins like RLUSD and USDC offer the benefits of cryptocurrency—such as fast transaction speeds and low costs—while mitigating the volatility typically associated with digital assets. By embracing these stablecoins, SBI aims to provide its customers with more efficient payment solutions and position itself as a leader in the evolving digital economy. This initiative also reflects a broader trend of financial institutions recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and digital assets to transform traditional financial services. SBI Holdings’ plan to integrate Ripple’s RLUSD and Circle’s USDC stablecoins underscores its commitment to innovation in the financial sector. By leveraging these digital assets, SBI is poised to enhance its service offerings, improve transaction efficiency, and maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving digital finance landscape.

However, a hidden AI crypto, RCO Finance , is quietly gaining momentum, offering smarter investing, real-world utility, and massive profit potential. Early investors are already seeing significant returns on what could be the next big AI altcoin. XRP and Solana Are Heating Up but Face Tough Resistance The crypto market has seen increased activity as major altcoins like XRP and Solana attempt to reclaim bullish momentum. After showing strong gains in 2024 and earlier this year, both assets are now facing critical resistance levels, making investors cautious about their next moves. XRP recently closed below the $2.91 support level, confirming a bearish descending triangle pattern. Also, the selling pressure recently increased, pushing XRP below its support. This led to a sharp drop to $1.77 on February 3 as panic sellers exited their positions. Buyers have since stepped in, attempting to spark a recovery. However, the next major challenge lies at $2.61. If XRP fails to break above this resistance, bears could take control again, dragging the price back to $1.77. Solana has also faced its selling pressure, especially after dropping below $217. The technical analysis suggests that bulls are defending the $184 support level. While a short-term bounce is underway, Solana’s price is expected to face heavy resistance at $244. If it fails to break past these barriers, the likelihood of a drop below $168 increases, with the next strong support resting at $155. While XRP and Solana are still fighting to reclaim momentum, traders are looking beyond these established coins for greater opportunities. This is why investors are turning their attention to RCOF ; an AI altcoin projected to rise by 40,000% in 2025. The AI Revolution That Could Leave XRP and Solana Behind At the core of RCO Finance is the Robo Advisor, an AI-driven trading assistant designed to optimize investment strategies in real time. RCOF’s AI pulls data from top-tier financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, analyzing price patterns, market sentiment, and news trends to give investors a precise entry or exit point. For instance, the MELANIA token did over 1000x in 24 hours. With the Robo Advisor, traders would have received early alerts, identifying buy signals long before mainstream investors noticed the trend. If you had invested $500 based on the Robo Advisor’s insights, that could have easily turned into $50,000 or more. The AI also works in reverse. If a coin shows signs of an impending crash, the system automatically signals you to exit, locking in profits before the downturn hits. This proactive approach takes human emotions out of the equation, ensuring logical and data-driven decisions. Beyond AI, RCO Finance is a full-fledged investment ecosystem that is KYC-free. You can access 120,000+ investment options, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, tokenized real estate, and commodities; all on the same platform. The RCOF debit card also allows you to spend your crypto holding in everyday transactions like traditional currency. RCO Finance Presale Gains Massive Traction Unlike most presale projects that launch without a working product, RCOF has already deployed a Beta Platform , attracting over 10,000 users who are actively testing its AI capabilities. The presale is in its 5th stage, with tokens selling at $0.10. The next stage will see a jump to $0.13; a 30% immediate gain for those buying now. With over $12 million raised, demand is growing, and the price will only continue increasing. Investors who get in early will see the biggest returns. A $1,000 investment at the current price will get you 10,000 RCOF tokens. By the time RCOF lists on major exchanges and adoption grows, its price could surge by 10,000% or more. Even at a conservative 100x increase, that $1,000 investment would turn into $100,000. This is why investors are piling in before the next price jump. RCO Finance has been audited by SolidProof , a leading blockchain security firm, confirming that the smart contract has zero vulnerabilities. Why RCOF Could Outperform XRP and Solana in 2025 For XRP to reach $10 or Solana to hit $500, they would need massive institutional backing and an extended bull cycle. At best, this would offer a 3x return, and that’s hardly groundbreaking compared to the explosive potential of newer projects. RCOF , on the other hand, is new, meaning faster adoption and bigger gains. Its AI utility ensures continuous demand, unlike large-cap cryptos. Investors who entered the presale in earlier stages have already seen price increases, and waiting too long means missing out on the best gains. Entering the next presale stage alone reduces potential profits by 30%, and waiting until the exchange listing could mean paying exponentially higher prices. Secure your position before the next price surge.

Analysts have set a DOT price target between $4.81 and $18.01 for 2025, depending on adoption and broader market conditions. While short-term movement remains uncertain, DOT’s role in multichain interoperability keeps it relevant in the crypto space. Long-term projections suggest DOT could test $14.04 as a key resistance level, with some forecasts stretching toward $18.01 if momentum builds. However, much depends on Polkadot’s ecosystem growth and investor confidence. While traders weigh their DOT price target, other projects like BlockDAG are attracting attention with passive income rewards, giving users a way to earn without relying on price swings. DOT’s future could be promising, but for now, it’s all about watching for the next breakout. Where Is LINK Headed? A Fresh Chainlink Price Prediction Update Chainlink is currently trading at $18.96, facing market pressure as large holders have offloaded 23 million LINK tokens worth around $455 million. Despite this, some traders see accumulation happening, with decreasing LINK balances on centralized exchanges hinting at future price strength. Analysts remain divided on the latest Chainlink price prediction, with estimates for 2025 ranging from $25 to $100, depending on adoption in the DeFi space. Long-term projections are even more bullish, with a 2030 forecast between $48 and $100 if Chainlink maintains its role as a leading oracle provider. However, price action in the short term will depend on broader market conditions and demand for its technology. While traders wait for a clear breakout, those looking for easier earnings are turning to BlockDAG, which offers instant rewards instead of price speculation. Summing Up Polkadot’s latest DOT price target ranges between $4.81 and $18.01, while Chainlink’s Chainlink price prediction for 2025 projects a move between $25 and $100. Both projects have strong fundamentals, but their price movements remain uncertain. While traders wait for DOT and LINK to make a move, BlockDAG is offering something different—instant rewards with no price speculation needed. With BlockDAG’s affiliate program, users can earn money from crypto without trading or mining. Every referred purchase earns an instant 5% cashback in USDT (BEP-20), with no limits on how much can be earned. The BDAG presale has already sold over 18.3 billion coins, and early participants are stacking rewards before its listing on 10 major exchanges. No delays, no limits—just pure crypto earnings.

Dogecoin investors have found solace in RCO Finance, an altcoin ecosystem that has raised over $12 million from its presale. Read on to see why investors are bullish on RCO Finance. Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana Spark Fear in the Altcoin Community Dogecoin , XRP , and Solana have shaken investor faith following their sharp price decline in early February. Despite reaching 2-year highs in late 2024, both Dogecoin and XRP are now in the red zone. Market charts show that Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2643 following its 20.19% decline over the past week. XRP has also fallen by over 20% in the same time. Following their sharp drop, Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP holders fear a continued decline over the next few months. With uncertainty surrounding altcoin projects like Solana, Dogecoin and XRP, investors are exploring alternative opportunities. One project gaining traction is RCO Finance, an AI-driven altcoin ecosystem designed to offer stability and intelligent investment strategies. RCO Finance: Breaking Down Investment Barriers with Artificial Intelligence RCO Finance is introducing the next generation of financial investing through cutting-edge AI and machine learning. The platform aims to equip traders with personalized institutional-level trading tools and strategies designed to amplify gains no matter your level of investing experience. One of RCO Finance’s core features is Robo Advisor, a highly intelligent trading bot that acts as your portfolio manager with the aim of growing your investments. What separates Robo Advisor from regular trading bots is the fact that it processes real-time data from trusted news sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, making it plugged into the market at every moment. That way, with immediate detection of market shifts, you are assured of spotting and utilizing valuable opportunities in real-time. Robo Advisor can also help to find investing opportunities that align with your overall goals. For instance, picture a crypto trader with access to Robo Advisor just before the market boom of Q4 2024. Robo Advisor will notify the investor of growing opportunities in the crypto market, allowing them to stay ahead of the curve by capitalizing on the market rally. Robo Advisor is also capable of making both short and long-term changes to your portfolio, optimizing your investments even when you aren’t hunched over a screen, watching for market shifts. Its automatic portfolio adjustments are particularly useful in volatile markets where investors need to act fast to stay profitable or reduce losses. In addition to AI-driven automation, Robo Advisor helps you access over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories. Investors in its ecosystem will enjoy access to stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, tokenized real estate, precious metals, and even commodities. As an advantage, investors can explore diversification of their portfolio without needing to make trades on a second platform. Secondly, investors can leverage access to diverse financial instruments to build portfolios that balance risk and returns, ensuring that they can capitalize on both bearish and bullish markets. Take Emma, for instance, an investor who manages a mix of highly volatile cryptocurrencies alongside stable, conventional assets. Thanks to Robo Advisors, Emma will enjoy automatic portfolio rebalancing which increases her crypto holdings during a bullish market and diversifies into safer assets like government bonds when markets turn red. For investors seeking higher risk-reward opportunities beyond Robo Advisor’s automated portfolio balancing, RCO Finance offers up to 1000x leverage. This allows investors to significantly increase their position sizes for greater potential profits. RCO Finance complements its high-leverage trading with other low-risk methods of increasing returns from its ecosystem. First, it offers a coin staking program that allows investors to lock their tokens for a fixed period, thereby contributing to liquidity pools for trading between users. When you participate in its coin staking program, you earn up to 86% APY. Investors holding RCOF tokens receive trading fee discounts, creating an incentive to hold rather than sell. This reduces selling pressure and supports price stability. They will also enjoy full privacy when trading within the RCO Finance ecosystem as the network has a zero-KYC policy. For extra security, smart contracts have been audited by SolidProof, proving that RCO Finance’s ecosystem is safe for all users. Investors Jubilate After Release of RCOF’s Demo Trading Platform Already, RCO Finance has a beta version up and running, where investors can try the system out for themselves and experience Robo Advisor. Updates to the platform and its Robo Advisor tool will continue as the network aims to ease user experience ahead of the full alpha launch. Why RCO Finance Could Outshine Altcoins Like Dogecoin Unlike Dogecoin, which primarily relies on community hype and speculation, RCO Finance leverages AI-driven automation to optimize investments in real time, providing a data-backed alternative to emotional trading. Already, it has gathered more than 10,000 users and raised over $12 million in its presale. RCOF’s presale is currently in stage 5, with its price now at $0.100. By stage 6, its value will grow to $0.130. It is also set to be listed once its value reaches the $0.4-$0.6 range. Additionally, some experts have predicted a potential 15,000x rally for RCOF, meaning an investment of $1,000 today may grow as high as $150,000 by Q4 2025.

As revealed via its 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), PNC, with $325 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), said it has exposure worth $67 million. Bitcoin ETF Adoption Among Banks Growing According to former Sequoia Capital Analyst Julian Fahrer, PNC increased its stake in BTC ETFs over one year. The financial giant upped its stake from $10 million to $67 million. Per the 13F filing, it invested the funds into Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) Beyond PNC, top banks in the United States are gaining increasing backing for Bitcoin ETF products. Previous reports hinted that Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and BNP Paribas are heavily invested in these products. Amid the 13F filings, BlackRock, the issuer of iShares ETF Trust (IBIT), also increased its stake in the fund. As Fahrer noted, the BlackRock IBIT allocation has jumped from $92 million in November 2024 to $140 million today. Many analysts believe these top corporate buyers are strategic in their ETF bets. The fund marked 1st anniversary with huge milestones, serving as a pointer to its maturity. BTC ETF and Quest for In-Kind Redemption Data from Farside Investors shows that Bitcoin ETF products have amassed $40.5 billion in inflows since they launched. With records that prove faster growth than other comparative ETFs like gold, issuers are now eyeing key changes. BlackRock has moved to demand in-kind redemption for IBIT , a request lodged with the US SEC earlier this month. The current cash creates model sees investors receive proceeds from their BTC ETF funds through the US Dollar. With in-kind redemption, direct BTC payouts will be possible. Other asset managers like Fidelity Investments are now joining this trend, showcasing the next phase of growth for the ETF. Competing for Limited Supply As many asset managers have hinted recently, the BTC world may see intense bids for the coin’s limited supply. With BTC-featured crypto mining producing an average of 450 coins daily, the demand from ETF buyers far outweighs the supply. Firms like Strategy could compound this competition. Following its recent rebrand to Strategy from MicroStrategy , the Michael Saylor-led firm has revealed it remains focused on Bitcoin. Thus far, the firm has acquired 471,107 BTC, more than 2.5% of the coin’s circulating supply. It has also inspired other firms to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, gaining ground worldwide. With state and federal governments making crucial Bitcoin pivots, the demand for Bitcoin extends beyond ETF, with a huge price upside.

40056036,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=692521,1738974607,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Is Dogecoin Massively Undervalued? Analyst Says ‘Now Is The Time’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-undervalued-analyst-now-is-the-time/,"A newly released video analysis by crypto commentator asif.eth (@asifeth) makes the case that Dogecoin is currently trading at what he calls a heavily undervalued level. He offered an explanation of why he believes the coin’s ongoing correction may have just concluded—a process he interpreted through an Elliott Wave lens and, more specifically, an ABC corrective pattern. Has Dogecoin Finished Its ABC Correction? In his discussion, the analyst described how Dogecoin had exhibited a pronounced rise, after which he saw “the first A correction and after that we got a B higher high, higher low… and after that we got a C type correction.” He suggested that this final “C wave” might have drawn the token back into a crucial support region, remarking that “this could be ABC and the current correction is playing out with an RSI at oversold territory,” a condition he views as a strong buy signal. Although he acknowledged the possibility of miscounting the waves, he maintained that the structure points to a broad corrective phase that could now be nearing completion. The key price region he identified spans from around $0.24 down to $0.18, an area he repeatedly called a “very, very good” place to accumulate Dogecoin. He referred to it as a “huge supply turn to huge demand zone,” noting that the token had previously flipped this same range between support and resistance several times. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crashes 40%, But This Analyst Sees A Bullish Setup While he has confidence in the bullish significance of that zone, he outlined $0.16 as a strict cutoff below which he would exit a Dogecoin position, stating, “If in any case… you break below $0.16, you have to sell that token,” because a drop beneath that level could invalidate the entire bullish setup. His point was that continuing to hold an altcoin below such a critical support might expose traders to deeper losses if negative sentiment suddenly accelerates. He also backed up his argument by pointing to the so-called Fib golden pocket, measured from what he described as Dogecoin’s last major low in August 2024 to the subsequent price high. By overlapping that Fibonacci retracement with the same $0.24–$0.18 demand region, he found consistent evidence that the market views this band as pivotal for Dogecoin’s long-term structure. He described it as “exactly aligning with our top supply zone,” explaining that confluence like this—in combination with an oversold RSI reading—boosts the likelihood of a price rebound. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Dogecoin Price Recovery: Targeting New Heights Between $1.5 And $2 Although the analyst mentioned that Dogecoin’s “hype” factor has waned, he interpreted that lack of mainstream speculation as a positive sign, claiming “no one is selling Dogecoin like hyper aggressively,” which could foster stability in the near term. The sentiment, in his view, might shift sharply once traders realize that the coin has bottomed in its ABC correction, especially if broader market conditions turn more favorable. He concluded by reiterating the importance of watching these levels closely. He sees the $0.24–$0.18 corridor as a prime accumulation zone, views $0.16 as a clear stop-loss level in case the market breaks down, and believes Dogecoin’s price action around these thresholds will confirm whether the ABC correction is truly complete. Recalling his own words, “Dogecoin is looking very, very good and very, very discounted in this whole market,” he urged potential buyers to consider the coin’s risk-to-reward ratio at a time when other traders, anticipating the end of the so-called meme coin era, appear to be overlooking it. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

The firm projects that advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology and much more will significantly sustain innovation and lead to economic growth. Institutional Bitcoin adoption sets the trend Bitcoin ETFs started the year with SEC approval, and by the end of 2024, the total assets under management (AUM) for Bitcoin ETFs exceeded $100B. Notably, there was a significant increase in institutional investments, with companies like BlackRock and Bitwise getting entrenched in the digital assets game. 74 publicly traded companies worldwide added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2024, collectively holding over 550,000 BTC (approximately $55 billion). Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) emerged as the largest corporate holder, possessing 446,000 BTC, representing 2.1% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. ARK predicts that by 2030, Bitcoin’s price could reach $300K by bear market projections, while a bull market scenario could see prices reach $1.5M per BTC. Under neutral circumstances ARK expects Bitcoin to trade at $710K per coin by 2030. Bitcoin price projections according to ARK Invest’s Big Ideas 2025 report. Source: ARK Invest The stablecoin market is up and to the right The report mentions that the total value of annual stablecoin transactions in 2024 reached $15.6T. The figure was more than Visa’s $13.1T and Mastercard’s $7.8T as the fastest-growing payment network globally. Solana and Tron now account for over 60% of stablecoin transactions. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Base led in terms of microtransactions under $100. In December 2024, stablecoins trading volume reached $2.7 trillion, with 85% of those being small transactions under $100. More than 23 million wallet addresses hold stablecoins. Developing markets like Brazil and Nigeria lead cross-border remittances. Blockchain users in these countries also use USD-backed stablecoins to protect their savings from inflation. The ARK Invest report also noted that USD-backed stablecoins hold a dominant 98% of the fiat-pegged market share. US-based issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) are among the top 20 holders of US Treasuries. Ethena Labs’ USDe introduced high interest rates of as much as 20-30% returns, which helped it attract $6B in assets within a year. ARK predicts that by 2030, the size of stablecoins will reach $1.4T, accounting for 0.9% of the global M2 money supply, becoming the 13th largest circulating currency. AI agents integration in business processes AI agents have evolved from single-task tools to versatile, intelligent platforms and have so far reshaped consumer interactions and business processes. They now understand natural language and contextual reasoning. They can also use tools and are learning continuously. On the consumer front, AI-driven personalized agents are primed to replace traditional search engines, offering tailored experiences that anticipate user needs. ARK Invest’s projections suggest that by 2030, AI advertising revenue will constitute 54% of the digital advertising market, amounting to $600B. AI is being integrated across markets. Source: ARK Invest In e-commerce, AI agents have become integrated into the operating systems that users refer to for product searches, price comparisons, and payments through voice or text commands. This integration is expected to lead digital wallets to account for 72% of global e-commerce transactions, which amounts to an additional $200B in enterprise value annually. By 2030, such AI agents are expected to contribute to $9T in online consumption, representing 25% of total global e-commerce. AI agents can reduce the cost per interaction in customer service. They can move the price from $1 to $0.125 and handle 70% of inquiries, amounting to over $500 billion in saved labor costs for businesses globally. ARK Invest projects that the software market could expand from the current $1.5T to $13T, with a compound annual growth rate of 48%.

However, his high-risk trade also revealed his Solana wallet address, raising questions about security and transparency. Portnoy, also known as ‘Davey Day Trader,’ shared his experience investing in meme coins on X (Twitter). He posted a picture of his Phantom wallet with 2.68 million MONTOYA tokens in it and could not contain his joy over the ‘billion percent’ return on investment. Crypto enthusiasts on X quickly identified his wallet address, starting with “ 5rkPD ,” verifying his trades. Portnoy’s pump and dump of MONTOYA surged its market cap from $2.8M to $10M Right after Portnoy’s post, the MONTOYA token’s market cap surged from about $2.8 million to more than $10 million. A short while later, the blockchain data showed that Portnoy had moved all his MONTOYA tokens, keeping the proceeds in his account for 187 SOL, which is about $24,000. According to Portnoy the profit was between $20,000 and $25,000 instead of the expected $25,000. His Barstool employee cautioned him that he was revealing his wallet address, but Portnoy said: I want people to know what I’m doing. I’m not trying to be shady. That’s why I like it. People can see my every move. Dave Portnoy Undeterred, Portnoy did not stop and moved to another meme coin, MVP, which was based on the Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. He bought and sold MVP in a matter of minutes and made about $48,000. “I’m out. I’ve turned 10k into 75 on shit coins today. It’s like playing the rocket game on DraftKings. I love it!!” He posted the message on X. Solana users flood Portnoy’s doxxed wallet with meme coins Since Portnoy’s wallet has been disclosed to the public, Solana users have been sending him many newly created meme coins, most of which are related to his dogs or Barstool Sports. This isn’t the first time Portnoy has dabbled in cryptocurrency, though. He is most notorious for what he calls a ‘panic sell’ of Bitcoin in 2020 after he had invested more than $1 million. Of late, he has been mulling whether to create his token and has also dismissed the reports of his partnership with Solana protocol Meteora. He also shared a video and said, “Does this mean it’s legal? Is it illegal to do this? I don’t think it’s allowed.” It remains to be seen if he can keep up the momentum, but he has most certainly created a buzz in the meme coin pit.

With a price rally now uncertain, investors are looking to make strong returns from RCO Finance’s ongoing presale. RCO Finance stands out for using artificial intelligence to solve common problems investors face. Read on to see why analysts say RCO Finance will become a better altcoin investment than XRP. XRP and Cardano Could Remain Bearish Utnil May XRP and Cardano are among the most affected tokens from the recent market decline. Following the price crash of early February 2025, XRP and Solana have suffered double-digit losses. XRP has fallen by over 20% in the past week to its current value of $2.62. Cardano has also fallen by 20.92% to its current value of $0.77. With uncertainty around their performance, many investors are seeking alternatives that can help recoup profits. This has brought them to RCO Finance, an ecosystem where investors can access institutional-level trading strategies and AI tools for maximizing gains. As market volatility continues, platforms like RCO Finance are becoming essential for those seeking to protect and grow their portfolios in uncertain times. RCO Finance: Using AI Technology to Create Equal Opportunities in the Finance Sector What if you could effortlessly boost your investment returns using cutting-edge AI technology? RCO Finance makes it possible for both expert and novice investors to achieve their financial goals with Robo Advisor, an AI-powered trading assistant designed just for you. Robo Advisor is a personalized trading bot that handles everything about portfolio management, helping investors save time while earning gains. The trading bot starts by offering institutional-level trading strategies that are tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market preferences. This bridges the gap between new or inexperienced traders and strong returns from the finance sector. Robo Advisor also identifies investing opportunities on your behalf. It collects market data from top-quality sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, keeping an eye out for new opportunities. This improves accuracy in decision-making, thus improving your chances for high returns. Imagine a trader using Robo Advisor during a scenario like XRP’s Q4 2024 price boom. If Robo Advisor had been active at the time, its AI-driven alerts could have identified early momentum shifts, allowing traders to capitalize on XRP’s 350% surge to over $3. Robo Advisor not only provides real-time market insights but also rebalances your portfolio based on your investment goals, adjusting to both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends to optimize gains. Consider an investor like Ethan, who balances both crypto and traditional assets. During a market downturn like the February 2025 price crash, Robo Advisor could dynamically adjust his portfolio, reducing crypto exposure to safeguard against excessive losses. Beyond AI trading, RCO Finance provides access to over 120,000 assets, allowing for a diversified portfolio that balances risk and rewards. It gives you enough options to build truly diversified portfolios that contain risk and stable financial instruments. Investors also enjoy the convenience of being able to trade multiple assets all from one platform. Coupled with high-leverage trading (up to 1000x), you can enhance your profitability across traditional and DeFi markets. Another standout feature of RCO Finance’s ecosystem is access to high-yield generating mechanisms that allow you to maximize gains without direct trading. RCO Finance comes with a coin staking program that allows investors to contribute to the stability of its ecosystem by boosting liquidity through locking RCOF tokens. RCO Finance rewards these coin stakers with up to 86% APY. Additionally, having RCOF tokens in your wallet will help you earn trading fee discounts. You can also receive cashback and extra tokens from loyalty programs for being an active member of its community. As you know, safety is important to the financial ecosystem and RCO Finance ensures that investors don’t have to worry about divulging personal information thanks to its zero-KYC policy. Additionally, SolidProof-certified smart contracts back all transactions in its ecosystem. By offering robust security in addition to its AI trading benefits, analysts say RCO Finance has shown readiness to become the go-to platform for beginner and expert investors. RCO Finance Surprises Experts with Beta Launch RCO Finance has shocked many crypto experts by launching the beta version of its trading platform while being in its presale phase. Investors can now test out features like the Robo Advisor ahead of future upgrades, which will come with the platform’s alpha phase launch. RCO Finance Vs XRP: Why AI-Driven Investing Is Gaining Traction The rapid adoption of RCO Finance highlights the growing appeal of AI-driven investing compared to traditional crypto assets like XRP. This sentiment has been reflected in the sale of over $12 million worth of tokens. Additionally, over 10,000 investors have rushed to join RCO Finance’s ecosystem. Now trading at $0.0100, RCOF is in stage five of its presale. By stage six, its value will grow to $0.130. With a listing target of $0.4-$0.6, RCOF’s presale still has more returns for investors. Furthermore, analysts have predicted a 10,000x growth for RCOF, meaning a $2000 investment could grow to $100,000 over the next six months.

Last month, Dubai-based exchange Bybit announced a temporary suspension in India, preventing users in the country from opening trades or accessing products on its platform and only allowing withdrawal transactions. The exchange failed to register with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) as required by the country’s anti-money laundering regulations. As a result of the violations, the regulator blocked Bybit’s websites and imposed a monetary penalty of Rs. 9 crore 27 lakhs, or $1,058,512. Bybit informed its users in January that it would resume its full service after completing its registration process with the FIU. In a statement published on Thursday, Bybit says it has officially registered with the agency and paid the fine. “Bybit has settled the monetary fine and diligently addressed and resolved prior regulatory matters, further demonstrating its dedication to transparency and the highest standards in the Indian market.” Bybit says it has been working to comply with necessary regulatory requirements, which include its Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP) registration application filed on June 26th, 2024. “We believe that our engagement and cooperation throughout the FIU-IND registration process demonstrates our commitment to compliance.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Data from Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR), Haver Analytics and Deutsche Bank shows traders specifically poured $6.5 billion in US technology sector funds in just seven days. Adam Kobeissi, founder and editor-in-chief of The Kobeissi Letter, says the tech sector boom is part of an overall deluge of capital into equity funds at large. “Total equity fund inflows reached ~$25 billion last week. Bullish sentiment is extremely strong right now… In fact, bullish sentiment is so strong that a record 54% of financial assets are now allocated to US stocks. This is nearly DOUBLE levels seen in 2008 while debt investments have fallen to a record low 18%. Equity allocation is officially above the 2001 Dot-Com bubble peak.” Demand for gold and Bitcoin ETFs is also strong, as President Trump takes action on tariffs. Kobeissi says the market flows are a signal that more volatility is incoming. “Positioning is at extremes as we begin another trade war. Currently, 41% of revenue in S&P 500 comes from outside of the US. This is the highest since 2013 and significantly above 2018-2019 levels in the last trade war. Furthermore, most of the buying has been concentrated in technology stocks. 30% of US imports from China are in the computer and electronic category. Not to mention US chip exports to China and Singapore which are also in the spotlight.

The CEO’s statement came in response to growing competition within the stablecoin market. Ardoino highlighted the company’s decade-long effort in building an extensive global distribution network, strategic partnerships, and commitment to inclusion for financial services. USDT holds its ground as stablecoin competition grows Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest USDT stablecoin, with about $140 billion in market cap, has had its fair share of regulatory scrutiny. In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) claimed the USDT issuer misrepresented the backing of its stablecoins and fined it $41 million. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations went into effect on December 30, and since then, Coinbase has led the movement of exchanges to delist the USDT stablecoins European markets. On top of the regulatory issues, USDC, a competing stablecoin, poses a considerable threat to USDT’s domination after a year of over 100% growth. One of the major issues Tether has faced with regulation is that it has never goonmme through an independent audit of its reserves. Ardonio has expressed willingness to be audited, however, he says that no US company wants to audit his company. In contrast, Tether’s biggest rival, Circle’s USDC is audited by Deloitte, which lends to its credibility and increased demand. During the PlanB forum in El Salvador, Ardoino expressed confidence that his company is well-positioned in the stablecoin market and holds strong against the competition. He emphasized the extensive distribution network Tether has, which he says separates the company from its rivals. “Many people do not realize that Tether has built one of the most extensive digital and physical distribution networks in human history over the past 10 years.” He also spoke about Tether’s partnerships, which play a key role in the success of the stablecoin. “While some competitors raise capital from investors and grow their market cap paying incentives to banks to keep their stablecoins in the balance sheet, Tether has 100s thousands of partners, building kiosks across all developing countries digital platforms with tens of millions of users and mind-blowing technology,” said Ardonio. The CEO also highlighted how Tether is utilizing these partnerships to establish a platform of financial inclusivity, which serves over 400 million customers in emerging markets. Tether still has big plans Despite the competition and challenges Tether faces, it is exploring new markets and innovation. The company, in partnership with Reelly Tech , plans to launch a stablecoin pegged to the United Arab Emirates dirham, which would be used to purchase real estate at 30,000 property agents. Ardoino said this would help drive blockchain innovation in the UAE. Tether is also investing in renewable energy initiatives, including a Bitcoin mining operation in Uruguay. While Tether is expanding, Circle is also taking a strategic step by planning to relocate its headquarters to New York City ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO). Moving forward with those plans could see Circle consolidate its regulatory standing and strengthen relationships with traditional finance. Ardoino remains unbothered by the competition. He highlighted that billions of people lack access to basic financial services because banks don’t find them profitable. The CEO insists that Tether plans to service these underserved users while also contributing to the US economy by purchasing large amounts of US Treasuries, helping to reinforce the dollar’s position as the world’s dominant fiat currency.

Bloomberg mentioned that they’ve received confirmation from the SEC that Roblox is currently part of an “active investigation”. However, the SEC has not revealed further details yet as it could harm the “ongoing enforcement proceeding.” Regarding this, the commission stated, “We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that there are responsive emails between Enforcement staff referencing Roblox and that these emails are a part of an active and ongoing investigation.” Reports about Roblox being on SEC’s watch first surfaced in November 2024 in a report by Hunterbrook Media . It cited Freedom of Information Act requests. An affiliate of Hunterbrook Media called Hunterbrook Capital reportedly held a short position in RBLX stock at that time. Roblox Corp. has not commented on the on-going investigation This is not the first time Roblox has faced scrutiny. Earlier in October 2024, Hindenburg Research claimed that Roblox Corporation has purposely inflated metrics that include its number of users and time-spent on the platform. The now-defunct research firm also cited concerns about child-safety. However, a Roblox spokesperson rejected the claims made by Hindenburg research and blamed the authors for being “short sellers” and for having “an agenda.” As of yet, Roblox has not given a statement on the currently on-going investigation and the subject of this investigation remains a mystery. Roblox stock fell by over 20% on Thursday RBLX (NYSE:RBLX) stock fell by 25.2% percent after Roblox Corporation reported disappointing fourth quarter results on Thursday. It reported $1.36 billion in bookings for the fourth quarter with daily users at 85.3 million, marking a 19% growth in user-base since last year but a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter. RBLX stock (Source: Google Finance) The daily users figure was rather disappointing for investors. Roblox Corporation mentioned that it anticipates between $5.20 and $5.30 billion in bookings for 2025. In the earnings release, David Baszucki, the CEO of Roblox mentioned, “As we aim to support 10% of the global gaming content market, we’ll continue investing in our virtual economy, app performance, and AI-powered discovery and safety, empowering creators and enhancing the user experience.” In a public letter to the shareholders, Roblox mentioned that it is working on “several initiatives” that can boost growth in 2025.

The report provides an analysis of the past week’s sell-off and movements in the options market. A broad market retreat wiped out an estimated $10 billion in open interest, following an active Friday in the 24/7 crypto markets. Among major tokens, BTC was the only one maintaining positive funding rates, while ETH faced significant turbulence, with its options market signaling further downward pressure. Trump Sell-Off On Feb. 3, Trump’s tariff threats triggered a major sell-off across markets, including crypto and U.S. equities. The crash erased $3.1 billion in perpetual swap open interest across BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL. Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, noted, “$8-10B in total liquidations” as leveraged positions were wiped out. Trading volumes hit a monthly high of $31 billion in perpetual swaps on Feb. 2 as traders rushed to close positions. Altcoins Struggle The crypto market continued to struggle after another rough Monday. Funding rates for perpetual swaps dropped sharply as traders exited long positions. BTC, however, maintained neutral funding rates, showing relative strength amid the volatility. Ethereum to Fall Further ETH has been less resilient than BTC during the downturn.

Most heartbreaking of the losses is Solana’s failure to maintain support above the $200 level, which is due to the 2.52% drop it has experienced within the last 24 hours. Things aren’t all bad, however, as there are still some cryptos that hold the potential to bring 3x gains. Solana’s Drop Below $200 Shouldn’t Dissuade as the Top 3 Cryptos are Coming Back SOL price currently trades at the $197 level, leaving the following top 3 altcoins to pick up the pace and give investors much-needed gains. Aventus (AVT) When the high-cap tokens like Solana create disappointment, low-cap cryptos are here to bring the gains. With a market cap of only more than $20 million, Aventus (AVT) has been able to bring its complete suite of blockchain tools to pump in value. With its increase of more than 58% in the last 24 hours, which has put its current price around the $3.3 mark, this DeFi crypto is the bringer of hope. Source: CoinMarketCap The Aventus ecosystem is robust, giving users an enterprise-grade system where they can dive into the bouquet of blockchain applications to do just about anything. The project hopes to bring transformative solutions to popular niches like supply chain and logistics, loyalty and rewards, and a slew of consumer brands. Trending just below Solana on the Top-Trending cryptos on CoinMarketCap, Aventus’s unprecedented level of surge is due to the near-unstoppable slew of updates being released. One of them is the latest Aventus Network governance proposal, which will bring a treasury management strategy to the forefront. DexBoss (DEBO) DexBoss (DEBO) is a good blend of a meme coin and DeFi crypto, making it a much better alternative to Solana. The project is said to be a DeFi platform built to rule, and its native crypto DEBO is said to go live on a cryptocurrency exchange at a price of $0.0505. Considering the current price is $0.011, it means that early movers are in for almost a 5x profit journey. DexBoss is emerging with all the trading facilities of a standard exchange, but with a better twist. While advanced financial products like options and futures are available, users will also find perks like “automated risk management.” Adding icing on this DeFi cake is a user-friendly interface that also supports cross-chain compatibility, leaving investors with the perk to invest in a plethora of assets. The project’s tokenomics is another plus, which contains a deflationary asset. This limited supply, when blended together with DexBoss’s many perks, could make the ecosystem ripe enough to experience massive surges in volatile market conditions. And who knows, there might come a time when this crypto is as valuable as Solana one day. Safemoon CTO on Solana (SAFEMOONSOL) Another crypto trending on CoinMarketCap for the right reasons is Safemoon CTO on Solana (SAFEMOONSOL). This project is the new form of Safemoon, but on Solana. This cryptocurrency project marks the journey of Safemoon on a newer, better, more transparent, and faster chain. With Solana as its new foundation, Safemoon promises that it will make its protocol even finer. Be warned, however, as Safemoon is not the same project as the old one. While the leader is OG, the team is new, and so is the idea. Source: CoinMarketCap The original Safemoon got notorious for being more than a sham, leading to many of its makers being arrested. Hank remained untouched, however, for he had nothing to hide. Safemoon’s official website also reveals that Hank even gave $20 million worth of tokens to the community that he received from an anonymous donor. This is one of those altcoins that have emerged due to the goodwill of the community. But it is a risky investment, especially since the market capitalization of this token is yet to be reported. Therefore, while the long-term prospects of this token is risky, since more details have to be unveiled, for short-term traders, SAFEMOONSOL could be gold. Conclusion Despite Solana losing its $200 support, opportunities for massive gains remain. Aventus, DexBoss, and Safemoon CTO offer 3x potential with innovative use cases. As market volatility persists, these altcoins present promising investment opportunities for those looking beyond Solana’s short-term setbacks. Stay ahead and explore these emerging cryptos!

Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in the long term are increasingly prioritizing projects that exhibit practical utility, growing adoption, and the potential for sustained expansion. While some tokens thrive on short-term hype, others are dedicated to constructing resilient ecosystems capable of reshaping industries. Several cryptocurrencies are currently attracting attention due to their projected substantial returns in the years ahead. This analysis will examine Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, and Web3Bay, each demonstrating unique strengths within the evolving digital asset landscape. Web3Bay, currently in stage 4 of its presale, has garnered significant interest, raising over $1.08 million and selling over 274 million tokens. The current price stands at $0.004562625, down from the launch price of $0.1959, presenting a potential entry point for those considering the best crypto to invest in long term. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) Web3Bay is pioneering decentralized e-commerce, establishing a marketplace that directly links buyers and sellers, bypassing intermediaries and their associated fees. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay empowers users with ownership through the 3BAY token. This structure allows for cost savings for buyers, increased profits for sellers, and governance participation for token holders. Web3Bay aims to disrupt centralized marketplaces by offering reduced fees, transparent policies, and a blockchain-powered experience. The 3BAY token, currently in its fourth presale stage, allows early investors to secure tokens at a competitive price before exchange listings. The project has already achieved notable success, raising over $1.08 million. With the growing integration of blockchain technology into e-commerce, Web3Bay is strategically positioned as a potential best crypto to invest in long term, particularly as it achieves broader recognition. The sale of over 274 million tokens during the presale demonstrates considerable market interest, underscoring the growing demand for decentralized e-commerce solutions. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin continues to lead the market as the most widely recognized and adopted cryptocurrency. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins establishes it as a store of value, frequently compared to digital gold. Bitcoin’s price has experienced the typical volatility of the crypto market. Institutional adoption is steadily increasing, with major companies and financial institutions adding Bitcoin to their portfolios as a hedge against inflation. Anticipated halving events and increasing ETF demand are projected to further limit supply, potentially driving prices higher. For those seeking a reliable best crypto to invest in long term, Bitcoin remains a strong contender. Its increasing mainstream acceptance and evolving regulatory clarity reinforce its significant role in global finance. 3. Solana (SOL) Solana has become a prominent blockchain platform, recognized for its speed and efficiency. With transaction speeds exceeding 65,000 TPS and minimal fees, Solana offers a smooth experience for both developers and users. Its high performance makes it a favored choice for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols seeking improved scalability. Solana’s ecosystem is continually expanding, with recent additions like ZK compression further enhancing its capabilities. This innovation could attract even more developers to the network. Supported by a robust community and growing adoption, Solana is a possible best crypto to invest in long term for those interested in a blockchain built for speed and widespread use. 4. Cardano (ADA) Cardano has concentrated on developing its blockchain with a focus on scalability, security, and sustainability. The project is known for its research-driven approach and peer-reviewed development process. Recent updates have improved its smart contract capabilities, making Cardano a serious competitor in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT markets. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has discussed plans to integrate Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, further strengthening its position. Known for its careful and deliberate development, Cardano ensures thorough testing before implementing upgrades. With its solid technical foundation and expanding ecosystem, ADA is a potential best crypto to invest in long term for those who value long-term blockchain development. 5. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is essential to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem by connecting blockchains with real-world data. Its decentralized oracle network allows smart contracts to interact with off-chain information, which is crucial for applications in DeFi, insurance, and supply chain management. Without Chainlink, the functionality of many blockchain applications would be restricted. The upcoming release of Chainlink Staking V2 introduces enhanced security and improved incentives for participants, potentially increasing adoption. As businesses and institutions increasingly rely on blockchain solutions, Chainlink’s technology will become even more valuable. This positions LINK as a potential best crypto to invest in long term for those looking for a project with real-world utility and increasing demand. Identifying the Best Crypto to Invest in Long Term The cryptocurrency market is in constant evolution, but specific projects stand out due to strong fundamentals and practical applications. Whether it’s Web3Bay revolutionizing online shopping, Bitcoin maintaining its position as digital gold, Solana offering unmatched speed, Cardano focusing on methodical development, or Chainlink bridging the gap between blockchains and real-world data, each project offers something unique. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in long term , these projects provide a mix of stability, innovation, and growth potential. Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace has the potential to transform e-commerce, while Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the industry. Solana’s high-speed blockchain, Cardano’s deliberate development, and Chainlink’s essential oracle network all contribute to a compelling selection of cryptocurrencies worth considering. Exploring these opportunities now could be advantageous as the market continues its development.

Historically, Bitcoin Dominance has been a key indicator in predicting the likelihood of an altcoin, as a decline in BTC.D often signals a shift in investors’ focus on alternative cryptocurrencies. Historical Bitcoin Dominance Signal Possible Altcoin Season Crypto analyst Luca on X (formerly Twitter) is questioning whether history is repeating itself as similar past market trends emerge in this current cycle. The analyst shared two parallel charts, tracking the Bitcoin Dominance market capitalization and the start of the altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market The chart compared the BTC.D market cap in the 2021 and 2025 cycles, revealing an eerily similar pattern that unfolded during the bull market in 2021. Back then, many investors had anticipated the start of the altcoin season immediately after BTC.D hit a high-timeframe resistance. However, to the surprise of the broader market, Bitcoin’s dominance deviated above the resistance, leading to a mass sell-off in altcoins. Fast-forward to 2025, Luca believes this narrative is playing out again. As BTC.D dropped below the 61% resistance zone, the market hoped for a rotation into altcoins. Instead, BTC.D surged even higher, deviating again and triggering a mass capitulation of altcoins. Luca’s Bitcoin Dominance chart shows the resistance zone where BTC.D struggled to break through in 2021 and 2025. In both cycles, BTC.D deviated from this resistance level. However, after the shift in 2021, Bitcoin dominance fell sharply to the green zone between 58% and 60%. This zone corresponded with a major rally that sparked the start of the altcoin season. In the 2025 BTC.D chart, Luca highlighted the next green zone as around 54.56%. If historical trends repeat, BTC.D may drop to this low level and potentially trigger a similar rally to kickstart this cycle’s anticipated altcoin season. At the moment, all eyes are on BTC.D as the market awaits its next move, which could define the fate of altcoins in this bull market. The analyst notes that the key question remains: will history repeat itself, or will the 2025 cycle run a new course? Analyst Says 2025 Altcoin Season Is Out Of Reach In another X post, a crypto analyst, Brucer, argues that the altcoin season may not occur during this cycle. He outlines three primary reasons for his foreboding analysis, underscoring that during past cycles, the altcoin season was driven by major events like the 2017 ICO boom. However, each cycle varies in intensity and may not repeat the same conditions that led to past altcoin seasons. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Secondly, Brucer noted that altcoins are currently struggling to regain previous highs while Bitcoin’s dominance continues to rise, now sitting above a 60% market cap. Lastly, the analyst suggested that an altcoin season 2025 is unlikely unless significant macroeconomic changes occur.

Qubetics Could Be the Top Crypto Set to Deliver Insane Returns Next,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-trons-millionaire-making-run-qubetics-could-be-the-top-crypto-set-to-deliver-insane-returns-next/,"Ever looked at a crypto chart and thought, “Man, if I had just invested back then, I’d be rolling in cash now?” If TRON’s (TRX) meteoric rise still stings, you’re not alone. Many people missed out when TRX launched at just $0.0019 during its ICO in 2017, only to skyrocket to an all-time high of $0.4313 in 2024. That’s a jaw-dropping 22,000% return for early investors. Imagine putting in just a few hundred bucks back then—it would have turned into a small fortune. But here’s the kicker: history doesn’t just repeat itself—it rewards those who learn from it. Right now, another opportunity is brewing, and this time, it’s called Qubetics ($TICS) . This isn’t just another crypto—it’s one of the top cryptos for significant returns. While TRON focused on decentralizing content, Qubetics is revolutionizing Web3 with a first-of-its-kind Web3 aggregator and the QubeQode IDE, making blockchain development as simple as drag-and-drop. With over $12 million raised and 462 million tokens sold, its presale is heating up fast. If you missed TRON, this could be your redemption shot. Qubetics Could Be One of the Top Cryptos for Significant Returns, and You’re Running Out of Time Let’s get real—you already missed the Qubetics whitelist. That was a golden ticket where early adopters got in with zero upfront investment. But the real gut punch? You also missed the previous 19 presale stages, when $TICS was priced at rock-bottom rates. The good news? You still have time—but not much. Right now, Qubetics presale is in its 20th stage at $0.0667 per token. But here’s the thing—each presale stage lasts only seven days and ends every Sunday at 12 AM. And with every new stage, the price jumps 10%. The longer you wait, the more expensive your entry becomes. At the presale’s end, the price is expected to hit $0.25, translating to a 274.70% ROI. And when Qubetics goes live on exchanges, analysts predict it could soar to $1, $5, or even $10+ post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025. Unlike most cryptos that are all hype and no utility, Qubetics is already solving real-world problems. Enter QubeQode IDE —a game-changing platform that allows businesses and individuals to build blockchain apps without coding. Think of it like Canva for blockchain. Instead of spending months learning smart contracts or hiring expensive developers, users can drag and drop pre-built smart contract templates, customize them to fit their business needs, and deploy them on multiple blockchains with a click. This innovation opens up a world of possibilities. E-commerce businesses can set up crypto-based loyalty programs in minutes. Content creators can tokenize their work and sell it directly to fans, cutting out middlemen. Gaming companies can launch NFT marketplaces with zero coding knowledge. Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin—it’s one of the top cryptos for significant returns, backed by real-world adoption. Still wondering if Qubetics is worth it? Here’s a breakdown. Right now, a $500 investment at $0.0667 per token would get you 7,494 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, your $500 turns into $7,494—that’s 1,398.82% ROI. If it reaches $5, your $500 becomes $37,470 (7,394.11% ROI). And if it skyrockets to $10 after the mainnet launch, you’re looking at $74,941—a staggering 14,888.23% ROI. Missed TRON? This is your second chance to get in early on one of the top cryptos for significant returns. TRON’s Journey From Underdog to Multi-Billion Dollar Giant Let’s rewind to 2017. TRON wasn’t some overnight sensation—it started as an underdog in the ICO world. But early investors who saw the vision were rewarded beyond belief. TRON launched its ICO at $0.0019 per token. Fast forward to December 2024, and TRX hit an all-time high of $0.4313. That’s a 22,000%+ increase. Back then, no one knew if TRON would survive, but those who bet on it early became millionaires. But here’s the brutal truth—TRON’s biggest growth days are over. While it’s still a solid crypto, the explosive gains have already been made. It’s now a stable, established blockchain, meaning the massive 100X or 1,000X returns are unlikely to happen again. If you’re chasing life-changing returns, you need to find the top cryptos for significant returns. And that’s where Qubetics comes in. Don’t Let Another Millionaire-Maker Slip Through Your Fingers The crypto market doesn’t wait for anyone. You’ve seen what happened with TRON—those who got in early made life-changing money. Now, the same opportunity is staring you in the face with Qubetics. Right now, Qubetics is in its 20th presale stage at $0.0667 per token. But that price won’t last long. Every Sunday at 12 AM, the price jumps 10% as the presale moves to the next stage. The final presale price is set to hit $0.25, and after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, analysts predict $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $10+. The window of opportunity is closing fast. If you missed TRON, don’t make the same mistake again. Join the Qubetics presale today and lock in your tokens before the next price jump.

The two statist figureheads also discussed the long-debated fate of US Steel, and will be strengthening bilateral military defense support. Japan’s new Christian, self-labeled “defense geek” prime minister (PM), Shigeru Ishiba, said at a joint press conference on Saturday (JST), that the Japanese government would increase investment in the United States to an “unprecedented” level of $1 trillion (approx. 150 trillion JPY). Ishiba praises US Steel investment, increased military funding, in face of poverty-level pensions The statement came after the two heads of state discussed matters such as defense agreements and Japan’s potential investment in US Steel (United States Steel Corporation). US Steel has been in buyout negotiations since December 2023 with Japan’s Nippon Steel, with reported rocky relations and no agreement being reached as of writing. Trump now says an investment by Nippon Steel, and not an acquisition of USS by the Japanese giant, will be the best path, with Ishiba noting at the conference (translated by Google): “I am very grateful that he has shown us a clear solution … This will also lead to reducing the US’s trade deficit with Japan.” Regarding defense capabilities, Ishiba has long been a vocal supporter of increased military and cyber-defense spending , much to the chagrin of many Japanese who just want their economy fixed. For example, many elderly individuals are currently forced to work low-pay, demanding part-time jobs in order to survive on inadequate government pensions. A recent report from the Mainichi details : “The basic pension, received by all those eligible, cannot be said to be enough to assist post-retirement livelihoods. Even if a person kept paying pension premiums for 40 years, they can receive just under 70,000 yen (approx. $440) per month under the plan.” According to regional media, the Japan-US alliance’s deterrent and response capabilities will be enhanced, with PM Ishiba stating: “I confirmed with the President the US’s unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan.” Ishiba declared about the controversial increase in defense spending: “Japan cannot do this just because America tells us to. It is a decision that Japan should make on its own responsibility for the sake of its country.” Japan’s uniquely ‘Westernized’ PM also faces popular resistance from the Japanese people when it comes to working with US-based AI giants like OpenAI, instead of focusing on domestic tech development.

With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

As a result, the trend is now considered super bearish following a back-to-back drop since the start of the year. Following the latest downturn across the crypto space, ARB has shed over 50% loss in a month and as we can see, it is now trending bearishly again on the daily timeframe after rejecting a yearly low a few days ago. This came after failing to push above $1.3 late last year. Losing buzz, it broke below the key $1 level and closed that year at $0.75. The year started with a recovery but later halted due to a sharp rejection. That rejection led to another drag down and the trend remained bearish throughout January. Unfortunately, the bleeding continues due to rising supply and the price plunged heavily to a year $0.345 low. Despite registering a major loss in the past week, it is still demonstrating signs of weakness on the daily chart. It is on the verge of breaking lower while trading at critical support at the time of writing. A continuous drop in volatility could cause a bigger loss before recovering. ARB’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview While negotiating the $0.45 support, the closest level for a test right now is $0.4 and the recent $0.345 low, marked as the lowest level in the past year. Right below this level lies the key $3 and $2 level. The $0.515 level stopped the bulls recently. If they push back above it, the higher level to consider as resistance is $0.613, followed by $0.75. Key Resistance Levels: $0.515, $613, $0.75 Key Support Levels: $0.4, $0.345, $0.3 Spot Price: $0.45 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It appears weak at support and looks poised for a bigger crackdown. Most of the altcoins have recently followed Ethereum’s pattern, and are now looking extremely oversold following a sudden collapse to a year low, including ICP, which is now trading at a critical support zone daily. A recent attempt to break through this support zone (of $7 and $5.8) has proven abortive. But now that trading is back there, we may soon see a major breakdown to the $3 level. Looking at the daily price actions, the selling volume appears low at the time of writing. However, if the bulls continue to defend the support zone well, we may see a mini-recovery towards $9 before deciding on where to head next. Pushing through this price level could bring a major relief in the market and at the same time restore bullish hope for a positive move. While there are no signs of such a scenario at the moment, the price may remain calm a bit due to low selling volume. That could lead to a brief consolidation phase before resuming bearish at full speed. ICP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The immediate support level for a drop right now is $5.81. If the price collapses through it, the next level for support would be $4.5 and $3. Towards the upside, ICP recently held the $7.74 level as resistance. A push above that resistance should bring a little recovery to the $9 level. Higher resistance levels to watch for recoveries are $10.5 and $12.9.

The overall market structure looks bearish and now follows a negative bias daily. After failing to break above its previous peak of $5 last November, WIF lost momentum and formed a double-top. This led to a steady drop for two months before breaking below the key $1 level this month. That generated a lot of FUDs in the market but the meme coin managed to recover after swiftly rejecting the $0.63 level earlier this week. With the recent meltdown, it is noteworthy to say the bears are now in control. Technically, the bulls are currently off this market. But for those looking to reaccumulate for a long-term return, WIF currently provides another big buying opportunity on the mid-term scale, and from the look of things, the discount could last to the key $0.5 level – where the price broke out a year ago – before rebounding. Looking at the daily chart, it is still losing momentum despite the recent rejection. A collapse below this week’s low could cause more reductions until it finds a threshold. Now, WIF remains bearish on the daily chart. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview WIF currently trades an inch away from the holding $0.63 support. A breakdown from there could take the price to $0.48 and potentially $0.334 before rebounding. The $0.975 level is considered an immediate resistance in case of a buy. Retaking $1 could allow more buys to $1.377. The next key resistance levels to watch for a strong recovery are $2, $3 and $4 in the near term.

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth.

The crypto asset has yet to reclaim the $100,000 level it lost earlier this week, leaving market participants uncertain about the near-term direction. Amid this backdrop, one CryptoQuant contributor, known as caueconomy, provided an analysis of a significant development involving Bitcoin’s exchange withdrawals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still In Bull Market, On-Chain Indicator Confirms Largest Exchange Withdrawals Since FTX Collapse In a recent post, caueconomy highlighted the largest volume of exchange withdrawals since the FTX collapse. According to the data, over 47,000 BTC were removed from exchange reserves. While some of these movements may be internal, they also indicate potential accumulation by a large market player or institutional entity. This trend of Bitcoin moving off exchanges typically signals a long-term bullish perspective, as fewer coins available for trading may lead to reduced sell-side pressure over time. However, the analyst clarified that this shift does not produce an immediate supply shock capable of impacting Bitcoin’s price in the short term. Instead, it points to a gradual accumulation phase that could provide support for future price appreciation. The largest volume of exchange withdrawals since the collapse of FTX “While these withdrawals do not reflect an immediate “supply shock” to the price of bitcoin… it still reveals a trend of accumulation by large players.” – By @caueconomy Full post 👇https://t.co/ZjYBijDOZp pic.twitter.com/ZEWj95wtfD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 7, 2025 Bitcoin Breakout On The Horizon? Meanwhile, another CryptoQuant analyst, Onatt, offered insights into potential breakout scenarios for Bitcoin. Onatt pointed to the strong buying interest captured in the Coinbase Premium Index, a measure that compares Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase to other exchanges. A positive premium often reflects heightened demand from institutional investors, suggesting that the market’s upward potential is intact. Onatt also noted the crossover of key moving averages—SMA14 and SMA60—indicating a possible build-up of bullish momentum. The analyst further highlighted Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with gold and the S&P 500, indicating that the cryptocurrency’s performance may align more closely with traditional risk assets. If the broader financial markets adopt a “risk-on” sentiment, Bitcoin could see an upward trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Slumps To One-Year Low – Is BTC Overpriced? Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent comments regarding the limited impact of employment data on inflation have helped stabilize market expectations.

The market is buzzing, and three projects are making big waves. Neiro (NEIRO), a tribute to the next-gen Doge, is gaining traction, while Mog Coin (MOG) is fueling a viral movement that’s spreading like wildfire. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is smashing through presale records, with over $5.97 million raised and a 100% bonus still live in Stage 14. Meme coins aren’t just jokes anymore—they’re powerful, community-driven assets with massive growth potential. Whether it’s the bullish energy behind BTFD, the cultural nostalgia of Neiro, or the viral energy of Mog Coin, these projects are giving investors serious reasons to pay attention. Let’s break down why these could be the best new meme coins to join for long term . BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad Charges Ahead as Presale Hits $5.97M What do you get when a meme coin presale smashes past $5.97 million, sells over 69 billion tokens, and starts rewarding investors with a 100% bonus? A project that’s got the whole crypto space talking. BTFD Coin is pulling in massive momentum, and the Bulls Squad is growing fast. This isn’t just another meme coin—BTFD Coin is backed by a community that thrives on market dips and seizes every opportunity for gains. Investors who buy in at Stage 14 ($0.00016 per token) are getting their holdings doubled with the LAUNCH100 bonus, which means instant growth before the token even hits exchanges. With the listing price locked at $0.0006, early investors are looking at serious ROI potential. Let’s put this into perspective: A $10,000 investment at Stage 14 secures 62.5 million BTFD tokens. With the 100% bonus, that instantly doubles to 125 million tokens. At the $0.0006 listing price, that investment is already worth $75,000. If BTFD hits its projected $0.006 moon price, that same investment skyrockets to $750,000. That’s the kind of upside that’s making BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join for long term. And with a P2E game already live, 90% APY staking rewards, and an engaged Bulls Squad pushing this movement forward, the potential for exponential growth is undeniable. Buying BTFD is simple: Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load up with BNB, ETH, or USDT, head to the presale page , enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and confirm the purchase. The tokens double instantly, and when the presale ends, it’s game on. Neiro’s Growing Holders Push It Deeper into the Meme Coin Spotlight Neiro (NEIRO) isn’t just another Shiba Inu token—it’s a tribute to the legacy of Kabosu, the original Doge, and a movement embraced by the Ethereum community. Trading at $0.0003325, Neiro has seen a 15.21% increase in trading volume, proving that investors are taking notice. The story behind Neiro gives it an undeniable emotional connection to meme coin culture. Created as a community-driven project, Neiro is built to honor the next chapter of the Doge meme’s history while providing its holders with a unique token that embodies internet nostalgia and meme culture at its core. Neiro’s trading activity suggests steady accumulation, and its Ethereum-based structure makes it easily accessible for investors looking for a new cultural meme token with strong community backing. With meme coins continuing to shape crypto trends, Neiro’s rise is something to watch. Mog Coin’s Viral Takeover: The Meme Movement Continues Mog Coin (MOG) is fueling a meme revolution with its explosive branding and viral momentum. Trading at $0.0000008263, Mog Coin’s energy is spreading fast, and despite its recent market dip, the project’s community is still pushing the token across social media at full speed. MOG isn’t just about trading—it’s about creating a movement that thrives on meme culture, humor, and internet virality. The team behind Mog Coin describes it as a “tsunami of power,” dedicated to taking over the meme coin space with nonstop engagement and fresh meme content. The latest market movement shows a 28.59% dip over the past 7 days, but MOG’s community-driven narrative is keeping the hype alive. With meme coins often driven by strong communities and digital engagement, Mog Coin’s strategy of constant exposure and viral marketing is keeping it on the radar. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin space with its unstoppable presale momentum. With $5.97 million already raised, a 100% bonus still available, and the Bulls Squad growing every day, this project is shaping up to be one of the biggest meme coin launches of the year. Meanwhile, Neiro is growing in popularity as a heartfelt tribute to the Doge legacy, while Mog Coin is bringing meme culture to a whole new level with its viral movement. With all three of these projects making serious waves, they stand out as some of the best new meme coins to join for long term. BTFD Coin’s presale is moving fast—secure your spot before the 100% bonus disappears. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin gaining so much attention? BTFD Coin’s $5.97M presale, 100% bonus offer, and strong community backing make it one of the most talked-about meme coins right now. Investors are taking advantage of the Stage 14 price at $0.00016 before its $0.0006 listing. What makes Neiro different from other meme coins? Neiro pays tribute to Kabosu, the original Doge, and represents a new chapter in meme history. Its Ethereum-based structure and rising holder count show growing market interest. How is Mog Coin driving viral momentum? Mog Coin’s marketing strategy focuses on internet virality and non-stop meme engagement. Despite recent market dips, its community-driven movement is keeping it in the spotlight.

40062002,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=670743,1738987078,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40062002.jpeg,Democratic states sue president Trump over Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/democratic-states-sue-president-trump-doge/,"Nineteen states, led by Democratic attorneys general from New York, California, and others, just declared war on President Donald Trump and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. On Friday, they filed a lawsuit in a New York federal court, accusing the administration of illegally giving Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) access to highly sensitive personal data and financial systems managed by the US Treasury. This lawsuit is of course the result of Trump’s executive order creating D.O.G.E, a temporary unit designed to cut wasteful spending and modernize government tech. What sounds simple on paper has turned into legal chaos and a political disaster. Democrats don’t trust Elon’s intentions The lawsuit claims Trump and Scott let Elon and his D.O.G.E crew have unrestricted access to the Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS), which is responsible for managing billions of dollars in federal payments, from Social Security and Medicare to critical state funding. According to the states, no one authorized this decision publicly, and no security measures were put in place. “Bessent’s implementation of Treasury’s new broader access policy, allowing Elon and his D.O.G.E team to access BFS’s payment systems, was adopted without any public announcement or explanation,” the states’ legal filing said. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who’s leading the charge, blasted the decision as reckless in her statement. “The President does not have the power to give away our private information to anyone he chooses,” James said. She warned that Elon’s team is attempting to control or halt the flow of federal money to essential programs. The states want the court to issue a permanent restraining order to block D.O.G.E from accessing Treasury data. They’re also demanding stricter vetting for anyone granted access, including mandatory background checks and security clearances, according to the filing. The White House isn’t taking the lawsuit seriously. Harrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary, called it a desperate attempt by Democrats to stay relevant after their November election defeat. “Instead of working on policies that reflect the will of the people, Democrats are busy gaslighting over the widely supported mission of D.O.G.E,” Fields said in a statement. “Slashing waste, fraud, and abuse is not a crime, no matter how hard they try to spin it.” But legal experts believe Trump and Scott may have overstepped their authority. The states’ lawsuit accuses them of making decisions that were “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedures Act, which could give the courts enough reason to block Elon’s access indefinitely. Earlier this week, Wyden and other Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee demanded answers from White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. They want to know exactly how Elon’s team was vetted before being granted access to Treasury systems. “Did they run background checks? Did they review security risks?” Wyden asked. “Or did they just hand over the keys to the kingdom and hope for the best?” National outrage breaks over D.O.G.E Democrats in Congress have been sounding the alarm for weeks. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said the entire operation is an “unprecedented insider threat” to US national security. “Elon’s team is digging through the government’s payment systems without oversight,” Wyden warned. He claims the Treasury Department deliberately misled Congress about how much power Elon and his crew really have. His warning aligns with an intelligence bulletin from government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. According to a Bloomberg report , the bulletin raised concerns that D.O.G.E’s access could compromise the integrity of BFS’s payment portal, which Wyden described as the government’s “financial heartbeat.” But, “this is strictly read-only access,” Scott Bessent said in an interview on Thursday. He insists that the staffers are only there to review spending and identify inefficiencies. “There’s been no tinkering,” he said, dismissing the critics as alarmists. But last week, unions representing federal workers filed their own lawsuit accusing Scott of illegally sharing workers’ personal information with D.O.G.E without their consent, so a federal judge temporarily limited Elon’s team’s access while that case moves forward. The Coristine scandal Adding to the drama of course is Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old member of Elon’s D.O.G.E squad, who was previously fired from his internship at cybersecurity firm Path Network for allegedly leaking sensitive internal data to a competitor, according to the Bloomberg report. Path Network confirmed his firing after an internal investigation found that Coristine retained unauthorized access to their systems after being let go. In messages shared on Discord, Coristine admitted he could have wiped Path’s servers if he’d wanted to, though he did claim he never acted on the opportunity. “This is exactly why you don’t hand out access without proper vetting,” said Wyden, calling Coristine’s involvement another reason why the entire D.O.G.E program should be suspended immediately. “Every day, new disturbing details come to light about just how unqualified these people are,” he added.

Insights on XRP & Binance Coin,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-unlock-exclusive-web3-benefits-you-wont-find-anywhere-else-insights-on-xrp-binance-coin/,"What if your crypto wasn’t just an investment, but a key to unlocking substantial savings? XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are currently demonstrating market resilience, with XRP around $2.98 and BNB hovering near $670. These tokens facilitate rapid and economical transactions across blockchain networks. However, a more significant transformation is underway: Web3 payments are becoming the savvy shopper’s secret weapon, and the Web3Bay presale numbers are adding fuel to the fire: $1.08 million raised, 274 million coins sold, and a current price of just $0.004562625 for the 3BAY token. Web3Bay: Unlocking Savings in the Crypto Bull Run Web3Bay is attracting considerable attention. Unlike conventional platforms burdened by hidden charges, Web3Bay eliminates middleman fees and enables instant crypto transactions. Buyers utilizing crypto like BNB, XRP, and other supported coins can enjoy discounts, making everyday purchases more affordable. As the transition to Web3 payments accelerates, early adopters gain an advantage—while others continue to overpay. The crypto bull run is expected to push more users towards platforms like Web3Bay. Forget the notion that crypto is solely for trading. Web3Bay’s payment system is revolutionizing online shopping. Bypassing hefty transaction fees and sluggish processing, buyers using crypto experience instant transactions, zero hidden fees, and special discounts. Whether you’re paying with XRP, BNB, or other accepted tokens, Web3Bay ensures more of your funds go toward your purchase—not to intermediaries. The crypto bull run is anticipated to further amplify these benefits. Beyond the payment advantages, Web3Bay’s presale is drawing interest due to its low entry point and potential for substantial returns. Having already amassed over $1 million, with the 3BAY token currently at $0.004562 in Stage 4, and a planned listing price of $0.1959, early participants stand to gain significantly when the token launches on exchanges. While most e-commerce platforms extract a portion from each sale, Web3Bay’s model empowers users, allowing them to retain more of their spending power. The crypto bull run could drive even greater interest in this presale. The rise of Web3 payments is rendering traditional shopping methods obsolete. Instead of depending on banks or centralized payment processors, Web3Bay grants buyers direct control over their finances. XRP: An Asset with Tangible Utility XRP is demonstrating its value beyond mere trading. With its price presently around $2.98, XRP has experienced substantial growth, fueled by optimism surrounding regulatory clarity and increased adoption. Some analysts forecast a climb to $5-$7, with more ambitious predictions suggesting a potential surge past $10. Ripple’s advancements and the growing interest in swift, low-cost blockchain transactions position XRP as a prominent asset. Beyond its market potential, XRP is ideally suited for Web3 payments. Its transaction speed and minimal fees align perfectly with platforms like Web3Bay, where users can pay instantly without intermediaries diminishing their funds. As Web3 payments become commonplace, XRP’s real-world applicability is poised to expand, placing early adopters in a commanding position. The crypto bull run is likely to intensify XRP’s utility. BNB: A Powerhouse for Payments and Utility BNB maintains its status as a leading crypto asset, currently trading near $670. Despite price fluctuations, it remains a preferred token for transactions on Binance and elsewhere. With Binance’s token burns decreasing supply and PancakeSwap introducing new functionalities on the BNB Chain, demand for BNB remains robust. Its December 2024 high of $794 underscores its potential for future growth. Beyond trading, BNB is a crucial player in Web3 payments. Platforms like Web3Bay enable users to pay with BNB and XRP, capitalizing on instant transactions and the absence of hidden fees. As more e-commerce platforms embrace crypto payments, BNB’s low fees and rapid processing make it a valuable tool for those seeking to save money while shopping online. The coming crypto bull run will likely see BNB as a key asset. In Conclusion: The Future of Finance Both XRP and BNB are demonstrating their value beyond trading. XRP is gaining traction as a fast, low-cost transaction method, with future price predictions ranging from $5 to $10. BNB remains a widely used asset, currently priced around $670, with strong demand driven by Binance’s token burns and ecosystem growth. However, the most significant development is in Web3 payments. Web3Bay illustrates how crypto can transcend mere investment—it can be a tool for saving money on purchases, avoiding hidden fees, and processing transactions instantly. With its 3BAY token presale ongoing, early buyers are poised to benefit significantly before the platform’s full launch. The crypto bull run is expected to bring more users to Web3 payment platforms.

40062361,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56622,1738987257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Wall Street Hedge Funds Are Loading Up on This Altcoin Ahead of a Predicted 44,000% Boom",https://timestabloid.com/wall-street-hedge-funds-are-loading-up-on-this-altcoin-ahead/,"Wall Street has always been ahead of most crypto whales when spotting potential altcoins that could be a massive portfolio boost. Recently, some of the biggest hedge funds on Wall Street have been accumulating PropiChain , an AI token predicted for your 44,000% boom. These Wall Street investors are big on its unique AI features and blockchain implementations, which tackle major problems that have since hindered digitalizing and tokenizing the real estate market. In this article, we look at why Wall Street hedge funds are loading up on PropiChain and how early adopters and crypto investors can be part of this by investing in its token presale. How is PropiChain Better than Past Crypto Booms? There is no doubt that previous crypto altcoins have also performed exceptionally well in the market. For instance, XRP rose from just cents to over $3 in 2017, yielding a 100,000% gain for its investors. While Dogecoin rose from $0.002 to $0.70 in 2021, seeing an increase of 35,000% within a short period was also commendable by many analysts. Likewise, Wall Street hedge funds are seeing a similar growth trajectory between PropiChain, XRP, and Dogecoin as they believe its AI implementation gives it an upper hand over other tokens that are dependent on community takeovers and social media buzz. Another factor that is making PropiChain better than past crypto booms to Wall Street hedge funds is its commitment to users’ security , a major problem that has caused many homes’ values to plummet since the stock market crash of 2008. Security is non-negotiable for Wall Street hedge funds, and PropiChain has already passed a rigorous security audit by BlockAudit. How PropiChain is Expected to Attain its Predicted 44,000% Boom Upon Launch PropiChain is expected to attain its predicted 44,000% boom through its core AI technologies, real-world asset tokenization, and metaverse implementation, which are AI features that set it apart in the crowded crypto space. As a decentralized finance platform focused on eradicating traditional real estate investment processes, these AI features further create more traction for its token presale and long-lasting growth potential and roadmap after its launch into the mainstream market. Its real-world asset tokenization is also an approach by PropiChain that ensures transactions are done on a secure blockchain network, thereby eliminating the need for physical documentation. This further increases liquidity and democratizes access to properties, allowing a broad range of investors to buy, sell and manage them in fractions rather than larger proportions. Its virtual exploration is also an added advantage that allows international investors not to go through the stress of being physically present when trying to view, sell or buy assets, as its immersive 3D environment creates an enhanced atmosphere to experiment with properties from anywhere in the world. Its AR/VR capabilities also ensure that geographical barriers do not hinder these processes, democratizing access to real estate and setting a new standard for property exploration. Wall Street hedge funds are convinced that as the Metaverse continues to grow, PropiChain will establish itself as the go-to financial infrastructure for digital economies. Another feature that centres around the PropiChain platform is its advanced AI Technologies, which offer property recommendations based on users’ preferences and ensure they align with their specific needs and wants.

At press time, XRP is trying to break above the $2.40 level and is up by more than one percent. Though there is some momentum in the upward direction as of this moment, the price action remains too small to have significant impact for the larger trend. Support and Resistance Levels (Short Term) The primary support zone to monitor is between $1.95 and $2.35. If the price holds above $1.95, higher prices could follow. However, there’s still a possibility that this area will be tested again before a clear upward trend emerges. For now, the market remains somewhat uncertain. A break below $1.95 would mean that the February 3rd low may not be the true bottom, but a break above the $2.70 mark would provide a solid confirmation that a larger rally is incoming. Support and Resistance Levels (Long Term) The support area for XRP in the long term is between $1.20 and $2.10 on the larger timeframe. This week, the price dipped into this region but has already started moving back upwards. However, it’s important to note that until XRP breaks above the all-time high at $3.40, it could still be looking at a potential fourth-wave extension. There’s a possibility that XRP will continue to range between $1.20 and $4.20, which could persist for some time. While this may feel frustrating to traders, it’s not uncommon for XRP to exhibit such behavior. If XRP experiences an impulsive rally, it might target $4.20, or even $5 and $6.60 as stretch targets. However, these levels are still speculative and require confirmation through further price movement.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-08 04:12:18

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly slumped to a $95K low, whereas Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) traded in the red territory. However, XRP managed to pump roughly 1%, preventing further downside momentum. Besides, even the meme coins sector mirrored a slumping movement. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most trending coins for the day and the latest market updates that have impacted prices. Crypto Prices Today: ‘Market Blues’ This Week As BTC & Alts Mainly Down Despite Donald Trump announcing a pause on new tariffs for Mexico and Canada, the crypto market is yet to recover from its slump. Some traders and investors are even bearish over future movements, as the tariffs pause is only for 30 days. Given that the market fails to recover by March’s beginning, another wave of volatility could kick in as the new tariffs are to resume. Meanwhile, this week has been alarming for the broader cryptocurrency sector as a whole. BTC Price Hits $95K Low BTC price dipped nearly 1% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $96,663. However, it’s noteworthy that the flagship coin’s intraday low and high levels were $95K and $100K, respectively. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s dominance stayed up by 0.09%, reaching 60.94%. Meanwhile, in the latest developments surrounding this crypto, the U.S. state of Maryland has recently unveiled a legislative proposal to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund for the state. Bitcoin saw liquidations worth $73.02 million in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data . Ethereum Price Slips ETH price dropped nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,643. The coin’s intraday low and high were $2,564.97 and $2,798.03, respectively. Notably, the current waning movement falls in line with the broader market trend. In the latest developments surrounding the crypto, the U.S. SEC has delayed its decision on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF options trading proposal. ETH recorded liquidations worth $64.83 million in the past 24 hours. XRP Price Jumps However, XRP price jumped slightly over 1% intraday and is currently trading at $2.38. The coin’s 24-hour bottom and high were $2.28 and $2.53, respectively. Ripple’s coin soars alongside positive news for the community as a new XRP DR (Depository Receipt) product is set to go live in the U.S. Solana Price Fluxes SOL price witnessed a rollercoaster ride in the past 24 hours, trading at $193 as of press time, down marginally by 0.1%. The coin’s 24-hour bottom and peak were $188.48 and $203.15, respectively. Notably, Solana recorded liquidations worth $11.26 million in the past 24 hours. Meme Crypto Prices Today Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 2% drop in value and is currently trading at $0.247. Simultaneously, even PEPE and TRUMP prices tanked 3-5%, reaching $0.000009089 and $16.46, respectively. However, Shiba Inu (SHIB) price witnessed a nearly 1% jump in value to $0.00001517. Top Crypto Gainers Prices Today Flare (FLR) Price: $0.02196 24-hour Gains: +9% Onyxcoin (XCN) Price: $0.0279 24-hour Gains: +6.5% Maker (MKR) Price: $948.28 24-hour Gains: +5% Top Crypto Loser Prices Today Berachain (BERA) Price: $6.86 24-Hour Loss: -15% Movement (MOVE) Price: $0.5412 24-Hour Loss: -12% LidoDAO (LDO) Price: $1.54 24-Hour Loss: -10% The broader market trends remain poised to significantly impact prices ahead. Apart from Donald Trump’s tariffs resuming in 30 days, another aspect has caused volatility. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that over $15 billion in tokens were unlocked last month. Moreover, another $3 billion is set for this month, whereas the following month will see $9 billion between March & April. This phenomenon could further present altcoins’ prices with volatility.

The crypto exchange, which operates under Dutch regulations, stated that it can no longer offer services to Russian nationals and residents unless they meet specific conditions. These exceptions include Russian citizens who also hold citizenship in an EEA member country or Switzerland or those who permanently reside in these regions. For example, Russians living in Ireland or Danish nationals can still access Deribit. However, those residing in the UAE remain restricted. Furthermore, the exchange clarified that Russian companies are entirely excluded from its services, according to TASS’ latest report . Russia’s conflict with Ukraine led to its banks being cut off from the SWIFT payment system, preventing them from facilitating international transactions and financing global trade. The sanctions significantly harmed the country’s economy, while foreign banks became increasingly cautious about handling Russian payments to avoid breaching sanction laws. Its cryptocurrency sector has been significantly influenced by sanctions, with digital assets becoming widely adopted as a way to evade restrictions. Even government officials supported this approach at last year’s BRICS Summit. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov previously confirmed that Russian companies have begun leveraging Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions. This followed the enactment of a law signed by President Vladimir Putin, which was introduced last year. However, it continues to ban the use of cryptocurrencies for transactions within Russia. While Deribit had previously operated in Russia despite US-imposed sanctions, the introduction of fresh EU restrictions led the exchange to alter its policies. The company has dealt with various regulatory challenges over time, which was a key factor in its 2023 decision to relocate to Dubai. Nonetheless, Russians living in Dubai remain barred from registering on the platform.

40062613,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=318369,1738989654,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,"The Bull Run, Memecoins and the Future of Crypto",https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/07/the-bull-run-memecoins-and-the-future-of-crypto/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post The cryptocurrency market is once again in the spotlight as we witness a new bull run unfold. However, the cycle is evolving this time with unique characteristics that distinguish it from previous market upswings. From the emergence of Bitcoin ETFs to the surge of Solana-based memecoins, this bull run reflects a shift in investor behavior, regulatory sentiment and capital flow dynamics. The bull run – A familiar pattern with new variables Historically, crypto bull runs follow a familiar cyclical pattern. The initial phase begins with Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, where liquidity accumulates in BTC , driving its price upward. Once Bitcoin reaches a peak or enters a consolidation phase, capital begins to flow into altcoins, triggering a secondary rally. Eventually, as market conditions shift, capital exits crypto assets, leading to a correction across the board. However, in my opinion, two key factors make this bull run fundamentally different. 1. Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has altered liquidity flows, creating an alternative investment channel that competes with traditional altcoin rotations. Instead of capital automatically cycling into altcoins, ETFs now offer institutional investors a regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which could impact the speed and intensity of altcoin season. 2. Macroeconomic and political influences The US presidential election has introduced an unexpected variable into the crypto equation. Donald Trump and his administration’s recent pro-crypto stance – coupled with discussions about integrating Bitcoin into the US Federal Reserve’s strategy – have created a surge in optimism. Regulatory clarity and political support could significantly impact institutional confidence and long-term adoption trends. From my point of view, at present, the market is still in the Bitcoin accumulation phase. Altcoin season has not yet begun, but key indicators suggest it is on the horizon. Historically, when BTC enters a consolidation phase, liquidity flows into altcoins, igniting rapid price increases. A three to five-percent BTC correction has historically triggered 30-50% declines in some altcoins, revealing the market’s continued sensitivity to Bitcoin’s price movements. The role of memecoins in the current bull run One of the most striking developments in this bull cycle is the meteoric rise of memecoins – particularly those on Solana. With the market capitalization of Solana-based memecoins surpassing $20 billion this January, their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem cannot be ignored. Memecoins play two crucial roles in the market. 1. Onboarding new market participants Memecoins serve as an entry point for new investors, particularly on low-fee chains like Solana ( SOL ), where transaction costs are minimal. Their accessibility and viral appeal make them an ideal starting point for retail investors looking to explore the crypto space. 2. Driving liquidity and market activity Memecoins generate significant trading volume, increasing overall liquidity in the market. Their speculative nature fuels demand across DeFi (decentralized finance) and exchange platforms, sustaining interest in the crypto ecosystem. Despite their popularity, memecoins remain one of the riskiest asset classes in the crypto space. Their value is driven entirely by hype, community engagement and speculative demand, rather than intrinsic utility. Their life cycle is short, often lasting less than a year, and price fluctuations can be extreme. In some cases, a 10 to 15-minute window can result in double-digit percentage swings, making them highly volatile investments. TRUMP and MELANIA – Political hype or viable assets The intersection of politics and crypto has given rise to politically themed memecoins such as TRUMP and MELANIA. While these tokens leverage branding and narrative momentum, they follow the same fundamental pattern as other memecoins – relying on community speculation and hype cycles rather than any inherent utility. What sets these tokens apart from other memecoins is their ability to leverage real-world figures for speculative momentum. However, this creates a double-edged sword for the crypto market . On one hand, these assets generate high engagement and trading volume, attracting new participants into the space. On the other, they contribute to an unpredictable and often misleading market environment, where many investors – especially newcomers – suffer losses due to hype-driven speculation rather than informed decision-making. A key concern is the concentration of token supply, which significantly impacts market dynamics. Let’s take TRUMP as an example. Circulating supply – 200 million TRUMP Maximum supply – 999.99 million TRUMP Private investor holdings – Only 20% of total supply Team-controlled supply – A staggering 80% This means that the majority of TRUMP’s supply is centrally controlled, giving its team significant influence over price movements and liquidity. Investors who fail to analyze token distribution often fall victim to supply manipulations, unexpected sell-offs and liquidity squeezes, further exacerbating volatility. While these politically driven tokens may serve as short-term speculative instruments, their long-term sustainability remains questionable. More importantly, their impact on the reputation of the crypto market is profound. When retail investors experience losses due to opaque tokenomics and market manipulation, it reinforces skepticism about the legitimacy of crypto as a whole. Ultimately, political memecoins are speculative assets with a high-risk, high-reward profile. Investors should approach them with extreme caution, armed with a clear understanding of token supply, team control and the broader market conditions driving their price movements. Looking ahead – The crypto market’s next phase As this bull run continues to unfold, several key developments will shape the market’s trajectory. Bitcoin ETF-driven liquidity movements – I nstitutional interest in ETFs slow down capital rotation into altcoins Regulatory and political shifts – H ow will the US elections influence sentiment and adoption? Memecoin sustainability – Will memecoins maintain market dominance or will the hype fade as investors seek assets with greater utility? While Bitcoin remains the foundation of this bull cycle, the eventual shift toward altcoins and speculative assets is inevitable. Investors should remain strategic, understanding both the risks and opportunities presented by emerging trends. Crypto remains a highly volatile and rapidly evolving ecosystem, where informed decision-making is key. Whether it’s BTC, altcoins or memecoins, the ability to adapt to market cycles will define success in this ever-changing landscape.

This new financial product offers a regulated way for investors to gain exposure to XRP without purchasing the cryptocurrency directly from exchanges. The concept of XRP DRs is similar to traditional American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which represent shares of foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges. The XRP DRs will represent ownership of the underlying XRP, providing investors an easy way to gain exposure to the asset without the complexities of directly trading it on crypto exchanges. These DRs offer similar benefits to exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it easier for institutional investors to access crypto assets. This launch is considered a major step in bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), as it makes digital assets more accessible to a broader audience. Custody and Regulation: Anchorage and the OCC The XRP DRs will be held by Anchorage, a federally chartered bank regulated by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Anchorage is a trusted institution specializing in secure custody for crypto assets, ensuring that the XRP behind the DRs is safely managed within a regulated framework. This adds a layer of security and confidence for institutional investors looking to enter the crypto space. Expanding Product Offerings Receipts Depositary Corporation (RDC), the company behind the XRP-backed securities, has been steadily expanding its product offerings. This expansion offers institutional investors more ways to engage with cryptocurrency in a regulated market environment. The Advantages of XRP Depository Receipts Unlike ETFs, where shares are redeemed for cash, XRP DRs provide accredited investors with direct ownership of XRP. This gives investors the opportunity to hold the asset directly while benefiting from a structured and regulated investment vehicle. This difference could appeal to institutions that seek direct ownership of digital assets but require compliance with traditional financial market regulations.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-08 04:44:07

Next week, new tariffs will drop, and this time, “everyone” is on the line, the president said on Friday at the White House during talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said he plans to announce the full details at a press conference early in the week, likely Monday or Tuesday. “We’ll be treated evenly, no more, no less,” he told reporters from the Oval. He didn’t specify which countries would get hit or the exact rates, but the warning is broad enough to send US trading partners scrambling. “I think that’s the only fair way to do it. That way, nobody’s hurt. They charge us. We charge them. It’s the same thing. I seem to be going in that line as opposed to a flat fee, tariff,” Trump said . Trump’s biggest targets Automobiles are right in Trump’s crosshairs. “That’s always on the table. It’s a very big deal,” he said during the press conference. The auto industry could see sweeping tariffs directed at rebalancing trade deficits, especially with Europe as Trump isn’t a fan of the European Union’s value-added tax (VAT), which hits US exports particularly hard. He criticized the EU for setting VAT rates that sometimes go well above 15%, making it expensive for American products to compete. “That levy is through the roof,” Trump told the reporters, pointing out Europe as a major problem. The president also said that these tariffs may replace the flat 10-20% universal import duty plan he discussed during his campaign. Instead of blanket tariffs, Trump now prefers a tailored, tit-for-tat system. “I seem to be going in that line as opposed to a flat fee, tariff,” he explained, adding that he’d rather hit countries where it hurts most. Along with cars, Trump is eyeing critical industries like steel, oil, and pharmaceuticals, which he believes are very important to America’s global economic dominance. Just last Monday, the US president announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico but quickly took them back after both countries promised to address his concerns about border security. But China wasn’t spared, as it got hit with 10% tariffs on Tuesday. As Cryptopolitan reported , the Xi administration fought back back with its own 15% tariffs, though it temporarily paused levies on low-cost goods mailed directly to American consumers. Officials are still working out how to handle that as of publication time. American consumers pay the price Once the tariffs kick in, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will be on high alert at 330 entry points across the country, including airports, seaports, and road crossings. CBP agents inspect shipments, review documents, and collect penalties if importers break the rules. The money collected from tariffs goes straight to the US Treasury’s General Fund. But here’s the thing, most of that burden falls on American importers, not foreign exporters. When US businesses import goods that carry a tariff, they often pass the extra cost onto consumers through price hikes, though JPMorgan’s research shows that foreign manufacturers sometimes do lower their prices to help US buyers cope, but chances of that are way too low. Under current CBP rules, some goods avoid tariffs depending on how they’re processed abroad. For example, US-made products that leave the country and return unchanged are exempt. But if they’ve been “improved” overseas—like gold being turned into jewelry or car parts assembled into vehicles—they’re subject to levies when they re-enter the country. But Trump’s tariffs are also about revenue. Historically, tariffs once funded most of the federal government’s budget. Today, they make up less than 3% of revenue, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. With Trump’s new measures, that could change dramatically. The Tax Foundation estimates that combined tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China could have cost US businesses $1.1 trillion over the next decade. In 2025 alone, nearly $110 billion in tariff revenue is expected if Trump’s plan sticks. The tariffs Trump imposed on China during his first term—and expanded during Biden’s presidency—are currently generating $77 billion annually. But this money doesn’t come without consequences of course.

Here’s how Ethereum and other altcoins compare. Top 10 Shiba Inu Wallets Control The Majority Of Supply In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the total holdings of the ten largest whales compares for four altcoins: Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Chainlink (LINK), and Toncoin (TON). Related Reading: Bitcoin Still In Bull Market, On-Chain Indicator Confirms Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in this metric for these assets over the last few months. As displayed in the graph, Shiba Inu has the metric at the highest level right now, with around 61.3% of the memecoin’s supply in the control of the ten largest investors on the network. Ethereum follows up SHIB in second with the indicator currently sitting at 46.1%. While the top 10 whales don’t quite control the majority of the supply for ETH, they are still quite close to do so. Toncoin and Chainlink, however, have the metric at 33.1% and 32.8%, respectively, which suggests the supplies of the two are more evenly distributed throughout the network. In general, a high amount of supply centralization on a few hands isn’t constructive for any cryptocurrency. “If these wallets decide to sell, it can cause sharp price drops, creating greater risks for smaller investors,” notes Santiment. That said, the analytics firm also says: However, if these large holders keep holding or accumulating, it generally signals confidence in the project and can actually reward traders who collectively hold less power, and rely more heavily on the behavior of a few large key stakeholders. Regardless, it’s important to remember this level of concentration can make a coin more volatile, as a few players have the power to influence price movements. From the chart, it’s apparent that Shiba Inu, Ethereum, and Chainlink have all seen the indicator move sideways during the last few months, which means that their largest whales have been holding tight onto their coins. This also implies, though, that these holders haven’t been buying more, either. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Crash To $1,700 If This Support Fails, Analyst Says Toncoin stands out as the altcoin that has seen the top 10 whales increase their supply share during the period. This active accumulation can naturally be a bullish sign for the asset. Out of these cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu could be the one most likely to suffer from destabilization, as it’s only in the hands of just ten investors to make market moves that involve the majority of the supply. Toncoin and Chainlink would be the on the other end of the spectrum, with their supply distribution being more healthy. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000152, down almost 22% over the last week.

These Altcoins Could Be the Next Solana and XRP!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/1k-to-10m-these-altcoins-could-be-the-next-solana-and-xrp/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1.5 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin gains as meme crypto market nears $100B. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance stands out in the real-world asset tokenization space. Table of Contents Dogecoin price analysis: Volatility and market sentiment Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 Should someone purchase additional DOGE still under $0.50? Final thoughts The meme-based cryptocurrency market is experiencing tremendous expansion, with a valuation close to $100 billion. This momentum follows Bitcoin’s recent comeback from a quick decline to an intraday low of $97,000. Dogecoin (DOGE) , a pioneer of meme coins, has responded to this change by registering noteworthy single-digit increases. The important question for investors is whether Dogecoin will continue its increasing trend or consolidate before another significant movement. You might also like: Rexas Finance the next Shiba Inu: Why $1000 could hit $50000 by mid-2025 Dogecoin price analysis: Volatility and market sentiment DOGE is still down by more than 24% since January 18, 2025. The emergence of Trump, a new meme-based currency attracting notable investor attention and driving liquidity away from Dogecoin, set off this fall. But Trump’s later price crash resulted in a wider meme coin market downturn, which affected DOGE, too. Now, Dogecoin is exhibiting indications of stability, as Bitcoin’s rebound gives the crypto market new hope. Still, it stays range-bound in the $0.25–$0.40 zone, a trend observed since November 2024. Dogecoin trades at about $0.26 when writing, with a market capitalization of $39.9 billion. Currently hovering in the middle, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that although Dogecoin may see price swings, a definitive breakout beyond $0.50 is unlikely. Furthermore, Dogecoin has not yet reflected Bitcoin’s current approach to its all-time high. Should Bitcoin exceed its past highs, DOGE may experience fresh investor interest, guiding it toward its 2024 highs. That would, however, call for a price rise of around 46%. Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 The political environment can greatly affect Dogecoin’s future price movement. With Donald Trump back in office and his reported close ties to Elon Musk, Dogecoin could benefit from increased exposure and potential utility. One of the most expected changes for DOGE in 2025 is its possible incorporation into X (previously Twitter) as part of its financial ecosystem. Demand for DOGE could explode if Dogecoin becomes a tipping cryptocurrency or gets transactional value on Musk’s X platform, driving higher prices. Our estimates of Dogecoin’s price in 2025 are very hopeful but wary. Given present trends and possible catalysts, DOGE might rise to about $0.80 by the end of 2025. Still, this forecast relies on the broader market trends of Bitcoin, changes in legislation, and ongoing community support. Should someone purchase additional DOGE still under $0.50? Although Dogecoin is still desirable for meme coin investors, some seek substitutes with longer-term promises. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one worthwhile initiative. Rexas Finance is emerging as a major player in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing market. By letting consumers tokenize assets such as real estate, luxury products, and intellectual property, RXS offers a clear use case, unlike Dogecoin, which depends on excitement and social feeling. Right now, at $0.20, RXS has shown amazing expansion, jumping 567% from its starting presale price of $0.03. In its 12th and last stage, the continuous presale has attracted enormous demand and generated almost $45 million through sales of 445,749,506 RXS tokens without the help of venture capitalism. Analysts predict a 100x increase in value, and they are especially optimistic about Rexas Finance. Following its official exchange launch on June 19, 2025, at $0.25, RXS may reach $20. To increase its profile even more, Rexas Finance has started a $1 million RXS token giveaway, which has attracted a large audience. The project intends to award 20 lucky winners with $50,000 worth of RXS apiece, and so far, over 1.31 million entries have been recorded. Rexas Finance is based on utility and creativity, unlike many meme coins that struggle to maintain long-term investor interest. Its platform provides a safe, open, and quick means of digitizing actual assets, transforming asset tokenization. This emphasis on practical adoption sets RXS apart as a high-growth investment from speculative meme coins such as Dogecoin. Final thoughts Still a fierce competitor in the meme coin market, Dogecoin might explode if Elon Musk included it in X’s payment mechanism. However, its price behavior has been essentially speculative, and its long-term development relies more on market mood than usefulness. Rexas Finance is a convincing substitute for those seeking a different approach than hype-driven rallies. For those looking for large gains in 2025 and beyond, RXS offers a special chance with its real-world use case, rising investor confidence, and optimistic price projections. DOGE is still an interesting investment, but investors seeking significant long-term profits might find more promise in Rexas Finance’s creative asset tokenizing strategy.

The digital asset is currently trading at $2.48, after a rebound from the support around $2.33, the last Fibonacci retracement level in the four-hour chart. This level is significant because Dark Defender highlighted it as a potential turning point for a bullish recovery. With the asset resurging, Dark Defender’s analysis can provide insight into its short-term trajectory. His analysis shows that the asset might experience a rebound toward the $2.70 and $2.99 targets. Failure to maintain the $2.33 level would have forced a retest of $1.99, but the 7.05% climb over the past 24 hours has put it well above the support levels. Hi all, $XRP is trying to hold $2.33 at the last Fibonacci level. The RSI on the 4-h Time frame has not yet returned Bullish, but we can expect this reversal with some sagging here. Supports are $2.33, $1.99 Targets: $2.70, $2.99 pic.twitter.com/gmUMfC5PAf — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 6, 2025 XRP’s Recent Performance and RSI Resistance The market downturn was caused by concerns over tariff threats made by U.S. President Donald Trump against Mexico and Canada. Despite this uncertainty, the market is recovering, as traders return with renewed confidence for the crypto market’s future. Dark Defender’s chart also includes an analysis of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which provides further insight into XRP’s current momentum. At the time of his analysis, the RSI had not yet turned fully bullish, indicating that a reversal was uncertain. Although the asset is climbing now, its RSI standing at 39.99 firmly in the neutral zone. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One important aspect of the RSI is the resistance trendline, which has prevented previous recovery attempts. A breakout above this trendline would signal renewed strength, supporting the case for an upward move toward the projected price targets. XRP’s RSI is still below this level. If it fails to break through the resistance, the cryptocurrency could struggle to sustain momentum, increasing the likelihood of another test of support levels. Price Targets and Potential Scenarios Based on Fibonacci levels and market structure, the analyst has outlined two potential short-term price targets. The first is $2.70, representing an initial resistance level that would indicate a successful bounce from the last Fibonacci retracement. A recent Cointelegraph report highlighted $2.70 as a crucial level XRP must surpass to confirm its price surge. This could lead it toward $2.99, the second target outlined by Dark Defender. If XRP can push past these levels, further gains may become possible. Despite the current market challenges, Dark Defender remains optimistic about XRP’s long-term trajectory. In previous forecasts, he has pointed to potential price targets of $5.85 in the short term and $18.22 in the long term , suggesting a historic rally is coming for XRP.

On-chain data reveals that significant PEPE sales have contributed to the token’s decline, while HYPE is attracting substantial capital, as the crypto market dip woes continue. In a February 8 X post , on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reported that venture capital firm Nascent recently sold the last of their PEPE holdings. The firm liquidated round 175 billion PEPE, worth approximately $1.5 million, in the last hours of Friday. According to Lookonchain, Nascent initially acquired 608.85 billion PEPE between June 6 and July 15, 2024, for a total investment of $7.73M. However, its selling strategy did not maximize potential profits. When PEPE’s price surged in November 2024, Nascent began offloading its holdings, but it reportedly missed the optimal selling window, only making a profit of just $348,000. Whale sell-off intensifies PEPE decline Since the start of the year, whales have been letting go of their PEPE holdings, and the selling pressures have far contributed to the memecoin’s recent price struggles. On January 27, Lookonchain spotted multiple large holders had liquidated their positions in 48 hours. Notable transactions included a whale address depositing 430 billion PEPE ($6.39 million) to Binance and another moving 325.5 billion PEPE ($4.9 million) to the exchange. Other large sell-offs included 200.88 billion PEPE for $2.85 million in USDC and a 140.83 billion PEPE deposit worth $1.98 million.

Market watchers have tipped it to surge 100x in the coming weeks. Read on to find out. The memecoin frenzy is finally fading out as crypto investors are already moving on to projects with solid potential, the right momentum, and strong backing. 1Fuel(OFT), the newest token still in its presale stage, already offers solid alternatives to PENGU and Shiba Inu investors considering a switch. 1Fuel: The All-in-One Crypto Wallet and Exchange Platform Raises Over $1.900,000 in Momentous First Presale The crypto industry is all about providing comprehensive, scalable solutions to real-time challenges. 1Fuel(OFT) is committed to redefining the crypto space by offering the most efficient, seamless, and secure way to manage your digital assets without exposing yourself to the system’s risks. The hot new crypto token is still in the presale stage, but the traction it has gotten quickly is fast, convincing investors looking to move on from the memecoins craze to real utility coins that offer so much more value. 1Fuel is empowering its prospective users with innovative tools that make crypto trading easier and more accessible.

Amidst PENGU Price Correction, Investors are now increasingly on the Lookout Although the Pudgy Penguin (PENGU) has seen a momentous increase in the past few weeks, with investors moving on the new meme coin even when it hit an all-time low price of $0.023 late last year, they are up to a profit of over 40% recently. A figure that strongly highlights PENGU’s potential. However, as the rave around meme coins winds down, PENGU is currently experiencing serious downward pressure with its price dipping by almost 7%. Although the meme coin is tipped for a breakout moment before the end of the first quarter of 2025, market analysts say new investors targeting gains are better off at an entry point of less than $0.030. Investors are unsure of Shiba Inu’s Price Outlook as its drag phase persists Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently defending its price value at around $0.000020 – $0.000021, the immense downward pressure still persists, as the market raves around the meme coin has turned bearish, and investors and prospective ones are already looking at alternative options with a preference for tokens with solid backgrounds. Conclusion: What Is The Best Crypto Token For You Right Now? Although PENGU and Shiba Inu(SHIB) are likely to reverse their fortunes and yield good returns as the crypto market heats up in 2025, investors are pleased with the stability 1Fuel offers. The project has solid backing, and it aims to solve a persistent solution in the crypto world. It appears to be a project with the potential to offer strong returns.

Pepe is already facing massive sell offs as whales dump billions of tokens amid the fading confidence. Meanwhile, Rollblock is capturing attention as the future of blockchain gaming. With RBLK’s presale hitting record-breaking numbers, could Rollblock be the next 100x altcoin? Rollblock (RBLK) Redefines Blockchain Gaming with Unmatched Innovation Rollblock is changing the way online gaming platforms operate. The Web3-based protocol offers a huge library of 7,000 games from 10 top iGaming providers in a fully native crypto-native ecosystem. By bringing trust, transparency and fairness back to online gaming, Rollblock is leading the ongoing altcoin season by surpassing the $10 million presale accumulation milestone in record time. Security is at the core of Rollblock’s gaming ecosystem. All gaming outcomes are automatically encrypted on Ethereum, making it impossible to alter bets or manipulate results. To reinforce user trust, Rollblock’s smart contracts have passed a comprehensive SolidProof audit that confirms the absence of any hidden defrauding mechanisms. Unlike traditional gaming platforms, Rollblock gives players the chance to play as the house and maximize their earnings. Rollblock keeps expanding its innovative ecosystem as it recently introduced a sports betting feature. Users can now place bets on top sporting events worldwide and enjoy high payouts. These in-game rewards are paid out using the native RBLK utility token, which can also be locked up for a predefined period to secure staking rewards with up to 30% APYs. If that wasn’t enough, Rollblock’s revenue-sharing mechanism uses up to 30% of the platform’s weekly revenue to repurchase RBLK on the open market. 40% of these tokens are distributed to current holders on a weekly basis, while the remaining 60% are permanently removed from supply through burning. This deflationary supply schedule makes RBLK’s growth sustainable over time, ensuring significant price growth as soon as RBLK is launched on the open market. Since RBLK has already secured a CoinMarketCap listing, analysts are optimistic about a massive 100x post-launch rally for Rollblock later this year. For now, RBLK tokens are selling for only $0.053 during its 10th presale stage, making now the ideal time to invest in Rollblock before the price skyrockets any further. Pepe (PEPE) Crumbles Following Whale Liquidations–Is This the End of the Meme Coin Era? Pepe whales offloaded over 190 billion tokens within 24 hours after the meme coin’s price plunged to a 3-month low. Pepe’s whale addresses previously held 48% of the token’s total supply, and a selloff could trigger significant downward pressure on Pepe’s price. Sellers remain in control of Pepe’s price action for now, with the token’s RSI dropping to 30 on the PEPE/USDT daily chart. If Pepe loses support at the lower Bollinger band at $0.00000906, it could face more liquidations in the next few weeks. At press time, Pepe was selling for $0.000009572 following an intraday decrease of 4.45%. Pepe is trading below all of its Exponential Moving Averages which confirms the downward trend. Pepe’s MACD has also formed a bearish crossover, suggesting room for more declines in the coming days. Why Rollblock Could Outshine PEPE in 2025 Unlike Pepe’s speculative hype, Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem is based on real-world utility. As more gaming enthusiasts join Rollblock’s ongoing presale, analysts expect RBLK to outshine PEPE soon. These bullish predictions are in line with broader market trends as investors are dumping meme coins to bet on altcoins instead. Amid this sentiment, Rollblock’s low selling price presents the perfect buying opportunity for savvy traders to seize the moment before the next price surge.

Hedge fund managers shift focus from XRP to altcoins like Agent A.I., sparking investor interest in the growing crypto market. Table of Contents Agent A.I. declares war on Fake AI tokens XRP: The global payment powerhouse of 2025 Conclusion Hedge fund managers are making waves by moving away from the well-known XRP and focusing on a different altcoin. This strategic shift has sparked curiosity, particularly amid the buzzing crypto market. With prices trending upwards, the market is ripe for significant growth opportunities. This development has investors keenly watching possible performers like Agent A.I., a promising meme coin with ambitious goals. The decision resonates with the emerging trends in digital currency investment, aiming for substantial returns. XRP has been a staple in the crypto portfolios, but fresh prospects such as Agent A.I. are capturing attention. Modeled after successful coins like PEPE, Agent A.I. combines community backing with a unique proposition, making it a potential game-changer in the ongoing bull run. Agent A.I. declares war on Fake AI tokens The crypto world is swarming with so-called “AI agents” that promise next-gen intelligence but can barely outthink a pocket calculator. Enough is enough. Agent A.I. is here to expose the phonies and embrace the absurdity — because unlike the AI pretenders, it isn’t pretending. It’s a full-fledged meme coin, built for maximum hilarity and outrageous gains. Classified intel: Agent A.I.’s true identity Top-secret revelation: Agent A.I. is PEPE in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which exploded nearly 22,000%, this undercover operative has the same ambition. Success, however, depends on one crucial factor — its community. Unlike VC-funded rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why its presale strategy rewards early adopters with insane discounts: Stage 1 Entry Price: $0.0033 (because lucky numbers matter) Final Presale Price: $0.1515 (because who needs round numbers?) First-stage discount: 98% Translation: Get in early, pay less. The next phase: AI tools and meme domination The presale is just basic training — once AGNT goes public, the mission expands: Strategic KOL partnerships AI-powered tools for engagement and growth Meme warfare against fake AI tokens No funny business tokenomics: A supply built for victory Total Supply: 5 billion (no inflation bomb surprises) 25% Reserved for Staking & Rewards (real benefits, not confetti) 20% Allocated for Presale (limited supply, no endless dumping) Final orders: Lock in AGNT before the next price surge This is your chance to join one of crypto’s most ridiculous yet potentially lucrative missions. Early investors get the best entries—slow movers get regret. XRP: The global payment powerhouse of 2025 XRP, the driving force behind Ripple’s network, is redefining the speed and efficiency of global transactions. Engineered for near-instant settlements and ultra-low fees, it enables seamless money transfers across borders. With the capability to process up to 1,500 transactions per second, XRP remains a top choice for banks and financial institutions seeking a cutting-edge payment solution. XRP’s journey has been marked by triumphs and challenges. Its meteoric rise to $3.84 in 2018 showcased its potential, while regulatory hurdles led to market turbulence. Yet, rather than fading, XRP doubled down — enhancing its technology and forging strategic partnerships with major financial players. Now, in 2025, XRP has solidified its role as a leader in digital finance. The resolution of past legal battles has reignited investor confidence, and its adoption among banks continues to expand. Some analysts predict XRP could reclaim or even exceed its previous highs as its role in the financial ecosystem grows. With the crypto landscape more dynamic than ever, XRP’s mission to change cross-border payments sets it apart. As digital currencies gain mainstream traction, XRP’s influence in global finance becomes increasingly vital. While the future is unpredictable, one thing is clear: XRP’s relentless solutions and commitment to transforming international payments make it a cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 and beyond. Conclusion XRP and other established cryptocurrencies may offer less potential for significant short-term gains in the current market. Their growth is steady but may not match the rapid advances of new and dynamic tokens during this bull run. Agent A.I. emerges as a meme coin with a mission and strong community backing. With its presale offering significant discounts and a capped token supply, it aims to replicate the success of previous high-performing tokens. Investors seeking substantial returns may find Agent A.I. a compelling opportunity. To find out more about Agent A.I., visit the official website , Telegram and X .

Gold’s rise suggests so,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-bitcoins-safe-haven-narrative-cracking/,"Bitcoin has appreciated substantially following Trump’s election win and his administration’s advocacy for the token. However, as much as Bitcoin has grown in value, so has Gold. The leading crypto has risen over 3% year-to-date, while Gold surged by 9% over the same time period. Gold’s stronger price increase suggests it may be a more reliable safe-haven investment than Bitcoin. Gold jumped in value after Trump announced his plans for the Gaza Strip Gold hit a new peak of $2,882 an ounce on February 4. According to data from CompaniesMarketCap , Bitcoin’s market capitalization is 1.910 trillion, ranking it seventh among global assets by market cap. This puts Bitcoin ahead of Saudi Aramco and silver in the rankings, further solidifying its position as a major asset class. Source: CompaniesMarketCap For context, gold retains a dominant lead with a market cap exceeding $19 trillion — greater than the combined market value of tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet. According to CoinGecko data , the broader cryptocurrency market cap stands at $3.13 trillion, with Bitcoin maintaining dominance at 61% and Ethereum at 9.6%. Bitcoin is down over 10% from its all-time high and is trading at only $96,718 . On the other hand, Gold is worth about $2,886 and has risen by over 0.33% in the last 24 hours. Analysts have long pictured Bitcoin as an asset similar to Gold due to its issuance limit of $21 million. However, Bitcoin is still closely mirroring tech stocks, while Gold’s appeal continues to increase, especially with the US-China trade war and the looming threat of more tariffs. Aoifinn Devitt, attorney and senior investment advisor at Moneta Group LLC, believes that Bitcoin will eventually have distinct characteristics from other assets; however, at the moment, it’s acting as the “riskiest of risk-on assets.” Gold may rise even further in just a few weeks According to Citigroup, Gold could reach $3,000 an ounce in just three months, even as countries brace themselves for possible trade wars under President Trump. POTUS has already shaken markets with the prospect of tariffs, which many say could impede economic growth and lead to high inflation. Market analyst Kenny Hu believes investors will continue to grow their reserves in central banks. Citi expects that a dollar increase will encourage central banks in developing countries, particularly to increase their gold holdings to support their own currencies. Investors are also leaning towards both gold and ETFs. London investors have started transferring their gold holdings to the US over concerns that bullion will not be exempted from potential tariffs. As of February 5, Premiums suggested a 20% chance that Trump will include gold in a 10% blanket global tariff.

However, as the reports sparked discussions on social media platforms, many have questioned his future role in Ripple, if he accepts the crypto advisor invitation. Clearing doubts, a renowned lawyer within the XRP community has shed light on the potential future of the CEO at the blockchain firm. Ripple CEO Likely To Join Trump’s Crypto Council The New York Post recently reported that the competition for a position on Trump’s crypto advisory board is fierce. Industry leaders and major donors are eager to secure a spot on the council, which is expected to influence the US digital asset regulations for the next couple of years. According to sources cited by NYNext, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, further fueling speculation about his appointment. Other prominent figures, including Kraken’s former general counsel Marco Santori, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, are also being considered. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiasts are closely watching Garlinghouse’s possible role in shaping the US crypto policies. Besides, his appointment could enhance Ripple’s influence in regulatory discussions and further legitimize the company’s position in the crypto space. Simultaneously, it has further triggered discussions over consideration of Ripple’s native crypto, XRP to be added to the US National Reserve asset list. Will Brad Garlinghouse Leave Ripple CEO Role? With reports of Brad Garlinghouse’s potential advisory role circulating, concerns arose about whether he would be required to step down as Ripple’s CEO. One XRP community member directly questioned pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan about the implications of such a move. However, Jeremy Hogan dismissed the concerns , stating that the CEO’s departure would depend on his employment agreement. He added, “But Even if it did, I’m sure the Board would make an exception for this!” This statement suggests that the blockchain firm’s leadership would likely accommodate the CEO’s dual responsibilities if he accept the advisory position. What’s Next For Ripple And The US Crypto Policy? If Brad Garlinghouse joins the advisory council, Ripple could gain a stronger foothold in the US regulatory discussions. This could be a game-changer for the firm, especially amid the ongoing XRP lawsuit, which has gained notable traction from the market participants for long. At the same time, Trump’s pro-crypto stance has sparked optimism among investors. With key industry figures in the council, the US may witness a shift towards more crypto-friendly policies. Besides, Garlinghouse recently lauded the Crypto Czar David Sacks’s crypto policy discussions development, calling it a “big deal” for the market. Meanwhile, it could also boost XRP’s appeal in the market, especially amid the soaring rumors over the crypto being added to the US National Reserve alongside other cryptocurrencies. Notably, a recent XRP price analysis hints at a potential surge for the crypto to over $5 if Garlinghouse gets appointed for the role.

The overall crypto market capitalization fell to levels last seen in November. This week alone, it dropped nearly 12%, reaching $3.38 trillion as of late Asian trading hours on Friday. Trades embraced a cautious stance, which was reflected across the crypto fear and greed index, which dropped 32 points from last week’s extreme greed levels to enter fear territory at 44 when writing. Altcoins experienced one of their worst weeks since the start of the post-election bull run, with only one of the top 99 assets managing to close the week in profit. What happened with Bitcoin this week? Bitcoin hovered between $92,876 and $105,480 this week, with bulls repeatedly testing the $100,000 psychological resistance three times but failing to break through, keeping the price mostly below six figures. Towards the start of the week, a global trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump spooked traders, leading to heightened volatility. The tariff announcement sent shockwaves through the market, contributing to Bitcoin’s sharp drop to $92,460. The turmoil culminated in the largest liquidation event in crypto history on February 3, wiping out over $2.24 billion in leveraged positions within 24 hours. Although the price quickly recovered as Trump agreed to delay tariffs, bulls failed to hold above $100,000 as fresh US employment data added to the uncertainty. Stronger-than-expected job numbers—with 183,000 jobs added in January, led investors to rethink the Fed’s next move, while it dampened hopes for rate cuts anytime soon. Traders were also left disappointed after David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, addressed the US digital asset strategy but stopped short of confirming any plans to stockpile Bitcoin. By the end of the week, volatility subdued as the market awaited the nonfarm payrolls report, which came in weaker than expected. The economy added 143,000 jobs in January, falling short of the forecasted 170,000, a noticeable drop from 256,000 in December. Following the report, Bitcoin managed to briefly reclaim $100,000, as traders speculated that the weaker-than-expected job growth might ease pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep rates elevated. What’s next for Bitcoin? Analyst Miles Deutscher, in a February 7 X post, pointed out that the Bitcoin exchange net flow had hit an all-time low. Typically, this signals that more BTC is moving off exchanges, as investors are likely opting to hold rather than sell. A lower exchange balance can reduce immediate sell pressure, which historically supports price stability and potential upside. A lot of this buying pressure was coming from whales, and Deutsher described the scenario as “Wealth transfer from the weak hands to the strong ones.” Bitcoin could be primed for its next leg up if bulls manage to convert the $102k level as support, according to pseudonymous analyst Daan Crypto Trades. The long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains positive for Bitcoin Bitfinex analysts said in a recent report. However, they did not rule out the possibility of short-term volatility driven by macroeconomic pressures. When writing, Bitcoin traded at $98,116, down 7% this week. Slow week for altcoins The altcoin market dropped over 18% this week, reaching $1.3 trillion. Bitcoin remained the dominant force, with the Altcoin Season Index falling by 20 points to 34. When writing, Mantra (OM) was the only altcoin to post notable gains, although the market was recovering. OM rallied 17.8% over the last 7 days, leading the gains among the 100 largest crypto assets in the market. By the end of the week, its market cap had climbed over $6.1 billion. The RWA-focused cryptocurrency has also surged nearly 4,000% over the past year, making it one of the best-performing coins among the 100 largest crypto assets by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the gains came as Mantra continued to onboard major players in the crypto space, including Republic, BlockHunters, and Cosmostation, as validators for the Mantra Chain, its dedicated blockchain for real-world asset tokenization. Moreover, the network has also benefited from partnering with DAMAC, one of Dubai’s largest real estate companies, which plans to tokenize over $1 billion of its real estate holdings on the Mantra Chain. Other top altcoins saw little to no gains this week.

He noted that Poland’s reserves must be “absolutely secure,” and Bitcoin does not meet those standards. “We will not consider Bitcoin under any circumstances,” Glapiński stated. “Reserves must be safe, stable, and permanent, which Bitcoin is not.” Instead, Poland will continue to accumulate assets like gold, U.S. dollars, and euros, ensuring a more traditional and reliable reserve strategy. According to NBP data , Poland’s reserve assets have reached EUR 214.19 billion, marking a 22.1% increase from the previous year. This growth reflects the country’s commitment to financial stability and risk management in an unpredictable global economy. Could Poland Change Its Stance? Despite the NBP’s strong rejection, Poland’s stance on Bitcoin could shift after the upcoming presidential elections in May 2025. One candidate, Sławomir Mentzen, has expressed pro-crypto views and aims to make Poland a “cryptocurrency haven.” If elected, his administration might push for a different approach toward digital assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Maryland Introduces ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act’ in Push for State Crypto Adoption , ECB Also Rejects Bitcoin for Reserves Poland is not alone in its decision. The European Central Bank (ECB), led by President Christine Lagarde, has also rejected Bitcoin as a reserve asset plan. Lagarde stated that reserves must be liquid, secure, and free from risks linked to illicit activities—criteria Bitcoin fails to meet in the ECB’s view. Other Nations Embracing Bitcoin While Poland and the ECB remain skeptical, other countries like Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong are taking a different path. El Salvador has already made Bitcoin legal tender, while Bhutan also holds Bitcoin in its reserves. The U.S. government and several states have proposed a Bitcoin Reserve Fund , with President Trump signing an Executive Order to establish a national digital assets stockpile. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The team shared the update in a post on X earlier today. For context, First Ledger offers a platform to launch tokens on the XRPL network without requiring KYC. It introduced a public beta test in October 2024, and since then, the XRP community has seen an explosive rise in meme coin launches. Notably, the latest update directly ties token allocation to the amount of XRP a creator burns at the launch event. This move incentivizes token developers to engage more deeply.Burn More XRP, Unlock More TokensSpecifically, the new system establishes the following tiers for token allocation based on the amount of XRP burned: Burn 100 to 499 XRP: Users can qualify for a token allocation ranging from 0% to 10%. Burn 500 to 999 XRP: Token allocation increases from 0% to 20% Those who burn 1,000 XRP or more will be eligible for a token allocation of 0% to 30%.Move Prevents XRP Network from Scams and Rug PullsThis update has attracted admiration from members of the XRP community. Many have commended First Ledger for this move, seeing it as a way to incentivize honest participation. Specifically, some view it as a barrier that can help mitigate bad actors.Notably, the burning mechanism could reduce the risk of ""rug pulls,"" where developers abandon a project or run away with funds. In this case, developers would need to burn significant XRP to claim a large portion of the token allocation.By tying token allocations to burning XRP, it prevents developers from easily holding large amounts of tokens without having ""skin in the game,"" thus reducing the incentive for malicious actions like rug pulls.Critics ReactMeanwhile, some market participants have expressed concerns about the update. One user, ""AltcoinMage,"" voiced their skepticism, suggesting that the new system allows XRP whales to game the system. They called the token allocation based on the burn amount a ""pretty big red flag.""In contrast, another commenter argued that the update improves the previous system. They pointed out that under the old model, one could launch a token with a 30% allocation by burning just 125 XRP and then potentially rug pull immediately. ""This update prevents some abuse,"" the commenter stated.https://twitter.com/DiXrpl74009/status/1887305605481943169",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP|XRPL,EN,0,0,XRP|WALLET|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-08 06:09:56

The platform is set to make a substantial impact in the decentralized finance sector, with significant investors from SUI and TRON (TRX) quietly joining the fray. Experts have highlighted $FXG as the token that could outrank SUI and TRON tokens in the crypto market. However, investors are asking why $FXG is the best crypto to invest in instead of SUI and TRX! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Futures Market Activities Drive a SUI Price Surge According to Coinglass , the SUI Futures Open Interest (USD) has seen recent growth, surging above $1.1 billion in early 2025. The futures market increasing activities sent the SUI token price into an uptrend before unexpectedly reversing the gains. SUI jumped 32.3% from $4.04 to $5.35 just six days into January 2025, but SUI dropped by 24.8% to $4.02 on January 31. The downtrend continued into February as the SUI token dipped by 13.4% to $3.48 just four days in. Interestingly, experts remain optimistic about SUI’s future. Some predict that the SUI token price could hit $5 this year. However, SUI whales are quietly accumulating the $FXG tokens early to secure higher profit margins. These large token holders are now calling $FXG the best crypto coin to buy now. A Rising TVL Drives a TRON Token Bull Run: Is TRX the Best Crypto to Invest in Now? Another token that made headlines with recent growth is TRON’s TRX. Data from DefiLlama reveals that TRON’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently reached $5.6 billion. This rising TVL has led the TRX token into unexpected price volatility. TRX jumped 8% from $0.25 to $0.27 just seven days into January 2025 but dropped by 7.41% to $0.25 on January 31. The TRX token sank further by 12% to reach $0.22 on February 4, 2025. However, crypto market experts remain positive due to the growing activities on the TRON blockchain. Some predict that TRX’s price could rebound and rise to reach $0.30 in the next couple of months.

Bitcoin Rises And Falls Amid Mixed Employment Data Bitcoin spiked from approximately $97,200 to a high of $100,110 after the US reported lower-than-expected job growth for January. According to the data, the US added 143,000 jobs last month, falling short of the projected 170,000. For comparison, December 2024 saw a job increase of 256,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Hour RSI Hits Oversold Zone – Is A BTC Rebound Near? However, Bitcoin’s rally was short-lived, as it quickly erased nearly all its gains, sliding back to $97,957. The following chart illustrates the brief BTC price surge before it retraced to previous levels. In addition to the lower-than-expected job growth, the unemployment rate declined from 4.1% to 4%, highlighting the resilience of the US labor market despite elevated interest rates throughout most of 2024. Following this strong labor market data, the CME FedWatch Tool now assigns only an 8.5% probability of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates at its next meeting on March 19. Notably, this probability stood at 15% before the employment report was released. A lower likelihood of rate cuts suggests that interest rates will remain higher for longer, dampening Bitcoin bulls’ hopes for multiple reductions in 2025, that could inject fresh liquidity into the market and potentially benefit risk-on assets like BTC. It’s worth noting that from September to December 2024, the Fed slashed interest rates by a total of 100 basis points. However, given the continued strength of the labor market and low unemployment, the Fed may adopt a more cautious stance, choosing to wait for potential economic warning signs before implementing further cuts. Global capital markets commentator, The Kobeissi Letter noted that the current US unemployment rate is the lowest since May 2024. They added that the “Fed pause is here to stay.” BTC Steady Despite Macroeconomic Headwinds Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range of $92,000 to $106,000, keeping both bulls and bears uncertain about its next move. Despite this, the flagship cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience in the face of several macroeconomic challenges that, under normal circumstances, might have triggered a significant sell-off in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ For instance, BTC remained unfazed by the stock market downturn triggered by the release of China’s AI-powered language model, DeepSeek. Similarly, the digital asset held strong despite renewed trade tensions between the US and China, following President Donald Trump’s imposition of 10% tariffs on the Asian economic powerhouse, which led to retaliatory measures. However, concerns persist regarding the recent slump in Bitcoin network activity, with some analysts questioning whether BTC is currently overvalued. At press time, BTC trades at $98,015, up 1% in the past 24 hours.

While Dogecoin gears up for a potential rally following Grayscale’s latest move, Rollblock is already making major waves with its revolutionary GambleFi ecosystem. With a record-breaking presale and rising user base, Rollblock is proving that real utility beats speculative hype. Could RBLK be the biggest altcoin of 2025? Rollblock (RBLK) is Reshaping Online Gaming with Web3-Powered GambleFi Platform Rollblock is leading the ongoing altcoin season with its innovative GambleFi protocol that is powered by the latest Web3 technology. By bringing blockchain technology to online gaming, Rollblock offers a fair, transparent, and fraud-free experience. Rollblock’s huge gaming ecosystem hosts over 7,000 games, including classics like roulette and poker alongside Web3-based exclusives. Every game is fully AI-powered, giving players the flexibility to play on their own time without waiting for a live opponent. Rollblock recently expanded into the spots bidding space with a new feature covering live international events like the NFL, NBA, UFC, golf, tennis and more, increasing the platform’s community of loyal high rollers. In December 2024, Rollblock generated over $1.75 million through wagered bets as the platform’s demand skyrocketed to a record high. There was also a 600% increase in new users, reflecting Rollblock’s high adoption rate. As Rollblock reshapes the online gaming landscape, analysts expect even bigger numbers during 2025 as the native RBLK token recently reached the milestone of $10 million presale accumulation. Not only is RBLK used to power Rollblock’s gaming ecosystem and distribute in-game payouts, but it also serves as a DeFi utility altcoin on the open market. Investors can stake their RBLK to secure rewards with up to 30% APYs which is the highest percentage yield offered by any presale. Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model allocates up to 30% of its revenue to conduct weekly open market buybacks of RBLK, and 40% of these tokens are distributed as rewards to long-term holders. The remaining 60% of RBLK are removed from circulating supply through a weekly token burn. Since RBLK’s supply has a hard cap of one billion tokens, this deflationary supply schedule is set to increase Rollblock’s value over time. For now, RBLK tokens are selling for a low price of just $0.053 each which makes now the ideal time to invest in the future of DeFi gaming. Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Rebound Following Grayscale’s ETF Application Asset management firm Grayscale launched a Dogecoin Trust on January 31, giving institutional investors an opportunity to allocate DOGE tokens. The firm believes Dogecoin has transformed from a simple meme coin to a tool for global financial inclusion and payments over the last few years. Previously, Grayscale also filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to convert the Dogecoin Trust into a proper spot ETF. If this application is approved, Dogecoin’s price could experience a massive demand-induced rally in the next few months. Dogecoin is currently selling for $0.2537 following an intraday decrease of 2.92%. Despite the pullback, Dogecoin’s trading volume surged 24.43%, suggesting high market participation. Dogecoin’s Momentum Indicator also shows bullish dominance, confirming the growing optimism about a potential DOGE rally. DOGE’s Meme Coin Hype v. RBLK’s Real-World Utility: Which One Wins? The SEC is still reviewing applications for a Dogecoin ETF, making the meme coin’s future more uncertain than ever. Hype around Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency that previously triggered a DOGE rally is also fading due to the broader macroeconomic environment, making analysts shift their focus to utility-driven altcoins like Rollblock. As Rollblock’s presale continues its upward momentum, analysts speculate whether RBLK could outshine DOGE this year. Given Rollblock’s growing number of active users and presale hype, the bullish predictions around RBLK’s post-launch growth are likely to be realized soon.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-flashed-over-a-10-million-bid-skew-on-coinbase-heres-the-significance/,"An order book analysis of XRP on Coinbase, shared by order flow and volume trader Dom (@traderview2), highlights a significant bid/order book skew within 10% of the current price. The analysis shows a bid imbalance exceeding 10 million XRP. According to Dom, this has occurred five times over the last two months, each leading to a minimum 23% price increase. The chart marks these occurrences with white boxes, visually identifying past bid skews and their correlation with price movements. The most recent event occurred when XRP was at approximately $2.36 following a sharp decline attributed to tariff threats made by U.S. President Donald Trump. $XRP orderbook analysis Within 10% of price, XRP just flashed over a 10M bid skew on Coinbase We've seen this 5 times over the last 2 months (white boxes) Each time it's produced at minimum a 23% bounce pic.twitter.com/PKRFv8fnpB — Dom (@traderview2) February 7, 2025 Historical Context and Repeated Patterns Dom’s analysis emphasizes the predictive power of such bid skews, which indicate aggressive buying interest. Historically, these imbalances have coincided with local price bottoms and rapid upward movement. The repeated nature of this pattern suggests that market participants with substantial capital anticipate price rebounds when liquidity concentrations appear at key levels. Examining the past bid skews, the chart indicates rebounds of at least 23%, with some instances leading to much larger rallies. The most recent similar setup of early January contributed to a significant price surge to a multi-year high of $3.39. XRP is currently trading at $2.39, and a 23% climb from this level would send the asset to $2.94, placing it above crucial resistance levels . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Structure and Implications Given recent occurrences, a bounce remains a strong possibility. Liquidity zones in the chart indicate concentrated orders, with the latest bid skew suggesting that substantial buy orders are clustered around the $2.30-$2.40 range. While XRP has already begun a rebound, the volume profile on the right side of the chart shows increased interest at lower price levels, which suggests XRP could stabilize before another upside attempt. What’s Next for XRP? While historical data suggests a high probability of a rebound, no trading strategy guarantees future results. Dom noted that the price does not always react immediately to an order book skew, and external market conditions could influence XRP’s ability to recover. This bid skew presents a potential buying opportunity, with historical data supporting a strong likelihood of a rebound. Dom recently revealed that XRP has broken the 2017 fractal and is now charting a new course, and this move could be the start of something big.

Now, throwing another curve ball in the mix, Elon Musk’s radical cost-cutting measures are making investors nervous. Could this trigger a massive Bitcoin price drop? Some analysts think so. But while Bitcoin’s future looks shaky, another crypto is stealing the spotlight: Panshibi (SHIBI) . This project brings something completely different to the table, melding together real utility with the best of meme coin culture and community initiatives. So, what are the key features drawing so many investors to Panshibi (SHIBI), and will the Bitcoin price settle? Will The Bitcoin Price Settle? Volatility has been close on Bitcoin’s tail lately, and now things are getting even messier thanks to Elon Musk’s latest cost-cutting ploy. Bitcoin is trading about $98,000, up 1.3% from a day prior. It hit $95,761 at its lowest point in the last 24 hours, with a high just above $100,000. The real question is whether Bitcoin (BTC) can stay above the six-figure threshold going forward. The technical front is a bit unstable. A Relative Strength Index of 45 indicates that Bitcoin is neutral – not overbought or oversold. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is showing a bearish crossover, suggesting downside pressure. So, how does Elon factor into all this? His new role heading up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has him slashing government spending like it’s Black Friday. He has axed diversity programs, consultancy contracts, and is even ditching underused government buildings. Though his goal with this is to fight inflation, some analysts are worried that cutting too deep could slow down the economy—and that’s bad news for assets like Bitcoin which are heavily interlinked with the U.S. economy. Panshibi: The Meme Coin With a Purpose The world of meme coins is often driven by trends and fleeting hype. But once in a blue moon, a project comes along that offers something different. Panshibi (SHIBI) is doing just this, pairing together meme culture with real utility, strong security, and a cause that is worth supporting. Put simply, it’s making waves in the crypto space for all the right reasons. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on speculation, Panshibi offers powerful staking opportunities. Token holders can earn up to 1,200% APY, turning idle assets into a steady stream of passive income. With 15% of the total supply allocated for staking rewards, Panshibi is built to reward long-term holders, not just early flippers. Plus, presale participants gain exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, adding even more value to those who get in early. In an industry where security risks are all too common, Panshibi stands out with rock-solid protections. As well as having undergone an industry level smart contract audit, liquidity is locked for 10 years, and team tokens are secured with a two-year lock. This means there is no risk of sudden rug pulls or insider dumps. Panshibi also stands apart from other projects with a philanthropic element. The project is supporting panda conservation efforts, with a portion of every investment being put towards protecting one of the world’s most beloved species. By backing Panshibi, holders are contributing to a cause that makes a real-world difference. Investors Race To The Panshibi Presale The clock is ticking, and the window to get in early on Panshibi is narrowing fast. Currently in stage 3 of its presale , tokens are up for grabs at just $0.004. With more than $630,000 amassed already, momentum is ramping up. Some analysts predict a 1,200% price surge before the presale ends. Now is the time for early gains to be made before the rocket lifts off for good.

Remittix (RTX) , a ground-breaking initiative that seamlessly connects cryptocurrency and conventional banking, can help with this. The top trending altcoin 2025 is RTX, which takes an innovative approach to payments. Solana: A Powerhouse Facing Competition Since its debut Solana proved its speed and affordability which made Ethereum face stiff competition. The network congestion and multiple outages remain as problems for Solana despite its technical strengths. Long-term stability-seeking investors are starting to doubt Solana’s capacity to keep up its progress. Although Solana is still a major participant, investors are reevaluating their options in light of the rise of Remittix (RTX). By enabling smooth crypto-to-FIAT transactions, RTX offers a real-world financial solution in contrast to Solana, which mainly concentrates on DeFi and NFTs. This implies that anyone can send and receive money internationally without depending on conventional banking infrastructure, including individuals without a bank account. XRP: Banking Partner or Outdated Model? XRP takes a strategic approach to welcome institutions through its combination of cryptocurrency and existing financial systems. The dominance of XRP within cross-border transfers owes itself to the partnerships it maintains with banks and payment processing organizations. But regulatory obstacles have impeded its advancement, especially in light of the SEC complaint. Now, a lot of investors are wondering if XRP is just a go-between for banks and cryptocurrency or if it has the potential to completely transform payments. Users can make direct crypto-to-FIAT transfers without middlemen using RTX’s PayFi model, guaranteeing financial independence, security, and privacy. RTX is a fantastic fit for the viral crypto movement, which is moving toward initiatives that allow individuals complete power. Remittix: The Future of Financial Freedom Despite its respective advantages, Solana and XRP don’t really solve the financial problems that billions of people are currently facing. Although they can receive cryptocurrency, more than 1.4 billion people globally do not have access to a bank account. The issue? It’s difficult to convert the cryptocurrency into FIAT. This is resolved with Remittix (RTX) . RTX bridges the gap between blockchain technology and actual spending by enabling customers to send, receive and withdraw cryptocurrency in their local currency with ease. RTX provides a useful option that Solana vs XRP just cannot match, whether you’re an investor seeking speedy and anonymous transactions, a freelancer in Africa or a migrant worker in Southeast Asia. Remittix Presale: The Opportunity of a Lifetime Right now, RTX is in its presale stage, giving investors an opportunity to purchase the cryptocurrency before it becomes widely used. In contrast to many speculative cryptocurrencies, RTX is positioned as a top trending altcoin due to its obvious use case and a roadmap. In order to ensure stability and confidence, the presale seeks to fund $36M with liquidity fixed for 3 years. Remittix Token: Why Investors Are Rushing In RTX isn’t just a token, it’s the key to the future of finance. The PayFi model ensures that anyone can send and receive FIAT directly from their crypto wallets. Unlike traditional banking systems that require verification, RTX maintains the true nature of cryptography anonymity and control. Consider a scenario in which a refugee without a bank account is able to accept cryptocurrency and rapidly turn it into cash. These are real-life pain points that Remittix is addressing. For this reason, it is rapidly surpassing Solana vs XRP in investor interest and is the viral crypto of 2025. Despite their notable contributions to the cryptocurrency market, Solana and XRP do not directly address the crypto-to-FIAT issue that millions of people deal with on a daily basis. That is being changed by Remittix (RTX) . RTX is not just another altcoin; it is the top trending altcoin that has the potential to revolutionize international payments by providing instantaneous, borderless and decentralized financial transactions. Because they see the enormous potential of this initiative, early investors are already reserving their stakes. Join the Remittix revolution now to avoid missing out!

Meanwhile, Bitcoin still has major problems with slow transactions and high fees. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is a Layer-2 solution that solves these issues by offering faster transactions, lower costs, and Ethereum compatibility. Here’s all you need to know. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH on Track for $10,000 After Vitalik Snubs Bitcoin? Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $2,615.75, down 14.6% in the last 24 hours. The RSI is at 26 right now, which means ETH is in oversold territory. Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently responded to a suggestion from crypto analyst Udi Wertheimer, who proposed that investors should allocate at least 10% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Buterin made it clear that his Bitcoin holdings are well below this threshold and said that he keeps less than 10% of his portfolio in any asset outside of Ethereum. His response has led to a debate within the crypto community about whether industry leaders should diversify or stay loyal to their blockchain ecosystems. Buterin also addressed concerns about Ethereum’s scalability and pushed back against calls to abandon Layer 2 networks in favour of raising Ethereum’s Layer 1 gas limit. He believes this would weaken the network’s social structure and instead encourage Layer 2 networks to burn fees or contribute to Ethereum’s ecosystem. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Is an L2 Upgrade That Could Make Bitcoin Faster, Cheaper, and More Practical Bitcoin is still the most recognized cryptocurrency, but its slow transactions, high fees, and congestion make it difficult to use for everyday payments. While Ethereum and Solana have adopted scalability solutions, Bitcoin hasn’t fully evolved yet. That’s where PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could come in — a Layer-2 upgrade designed to make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. With its Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain offers block times of just two seconds instead of Bitcoin’s usual 10-minute block times. This could revolutionize Bitcoin’s use case and make it a practical option for small purchases, global transfers, and instant payments. Lower transaction fees also remove a major barrier and encourage both individuals and businesses to actually use Bitcoin rather than just hold it as an asset. Beyond speed and affordability, PlutoChain could enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling cross-chain compatibility. As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network, it could allow Ethereum-based applications like DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI projects to connect directly with Bitcoin. This could expand Bitcoin’s role beyond just a store of value and make it an essential part of the broader blockchain ecosystem. Scalability is another key advantage — PlutoChain successfully processed over 43,200 transactions in one day during testing, which shows its ability to handle high demand without slowdowns. Security is a top priority as well, with audits from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi that make sure the network remains robust and reliable. Unlike Bitcoin’s traditional model, where miners and developers make most decisions, PlutoChain embraces decentralized governance. Users can propose and vote on upgrades and shape the network’s evolution in a more community-driven way. The Bottom Line Ethereum’s future remains a hot topic since Vitalik Buterin doubled down on his commitment to the network. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) offers a potential solution to BTC with instant transactions, lower costs, and Ethereum compatibility. —– Please remember that this article is purely informational and not financial advice.

Although the Mexico and Canada tariffs were placed on hold, investors still feel the announcement could cause a lot of damage in the long run. The action that followed was a huge sell-off in the crypto market, with some altcoins dropping as low as 50% of their price since then. Solana’s price has dropped about -34% from its high this year, from $294 to $192; similarly, Avax has fallen by about -26% in the last 7 days. But as the market cools down from the panic, the Avax and Solana prices are spotting a rebound. However, in the midst of all the chaos, there is a new presale token showing it could lead the market with a high ROI. Let’s talk about Remittix, the new presale token investors believe could be the best crypto to invest in this year. Why Solana Could See a Big Rebound in The Next Few Days Solana has gradually become one of the favorite tokens for all crypto investors, first with its infrastructure and the other with the impressive growth rate in the last few weeks. However, with the inauguration of the Trump administration came a new implementation that the market is still adjusting to. With the crypto market adjustment came a sharp drop in the Solana price. However, while the Solana price has seen a sharp drop, it continues to trade above 50 SMA on the weekly chart. This reflects investors’ confidence in the long term, which could see the Solana coin rebound from the drop soon. Could Avax Drop be Nearing its End? The Avax coin is showing high optimism in its monthly and weekly charts. The price setup reflects that it is nearing a strong support range, which could signal the market’s readiness to return to a bullish track. The Avax coin has been one of the top altcoins to watch out for in the last few months as the team continues to cover ground across the world. With the growing popularity of the Avax coin and the Avax team, we could see the coin do amazing numbers before the end of the year. Here is Why Remittix Presale Token Should be on Top of Your Best Crypto to Invest In This February The Remittix token has continued to make its mark in the crypto landscape for the last few weeks, showing investors are on for a high ROI. This is due to its growing price change, which sets new profits for investors daily. Early investors are already on about 5x while the presale continues. Remittix is a new crypto exchange that has been created for all crypto users to ease their crypto-to-FIAT transactions. With the new Remittix platform , you can convert up to 40 crypto assets to FIAT currencies, which can be sent to any bank globally. Think of how cool it will be to send Euros to a friend’s bank account in Germany using your Dogecoin. But, another thing that improved the Remittix payment solution is how it makes all this possible faster and cheaper than traditional banks. The Remittix exchange might be the next solution everyone will use in the next few months. Analysts believe this Remittix presale token might be the best crypto to invest in today. Don’t miss the Remittix presale, as it could be the opportunity you need for a big breakout this year. Check the links below to get started with the Remittix token.

40067401,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56682,1738997958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Major Korean Exchanges Renames XRP,https://timestabloid.com/major-korean-exchanges-renames-xrp/,"In a notable shift within the South Korean cryptocurrency market, three of the country’s largest exchanges— Coinone , Upbit , and Bithumb —have officially changed the name of XRP on their platforms. Previously, XRP had been labeled as “Ripple coin” in South Korea, reinforcing a long-standing misconception that XRP and Ripple are the same entity. The recent name adjustment aligns with global market standards and helps clarify the distinction between the cryptocurrency and the San Francisco-based payment firm Ripple. Correcting an Old Misconception For years, many South Korean investors referred to XRP as “Ripple coin,” which incorrectly suggested it was synonymous with Ripple , the U.S.-based technology company. This confusion stems from XRP’s history—when the digital asset was first introduced, it was commonly called Ripple. Additionally, Ripple holds a significant amount of XRP, approximately 37.43 billion tokens, valued at around $91 billion. The company’s large holdings have contributed to the perception that it directly controls XRP, even though XRP operates on the decentralized XRP Ledger (XRPL) , independent of Ripple. Another factor in the confusion is the role of Jed McCaleb, one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger. McCaleb is a Ripple co-founder but later left the company to create Stellar (XLM), another blockchain-based digital asset. His involvement in both projects further blurred the lines for many investors. XRP and the XRP Ledger: A Crucial Distinction A recent post by Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, highlights an essential difference within the XRP ecosystem . According to Vet, XRP is a neutral digital asset that exists on the XRP Ledger, where it is used for transaction fees, reserves, and liquidity functions. Meanwhile, Ripple is a private company that develops enterprise-focused blockchain solutions, some of which leverage XRP to improve cross-border payments. The post emphasized that while Ripple plays a role in the XRP ecosystem, the two should not be considered interchangeable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why the Name Change Matters The decision by South Korea’s leading exchanges to rename XRP reflects a broader effort to align with international terminology. Most global exchanges list the asset simply as XRP, avoiding unnecessary associations with Ripple. The change is significant because South Korea has one of the most active cryptocurrency trading communities in the world and how an asset is perceived there can influence its adoption and understanding. This update also helps reinforce a more accurate representation of XRP’s decentralized nature. By removing the term “Ripple coin,” Korean exchanges ensure that investors and traders have a clearer understanding of the asset they are dealing with. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such clarifications become increasingly important, ensuring investors have the right information when making decisions.

It is now further intensified due to a massive whale selloff. On-chain data on Saturday revealed that an institution offloaded a whopping 175 billion tokens to Binance, bringing further selling pressure to the asset amid market turmoil. PEPE is currently down 35% weekly, and chances are that further loss of value may be witnessed ahead due to broader market trends. Institution Dumps 175B Tokens Ringing Alarms For Pepe Coin’s Price According to data by Lookonchain, as of February 8, Nanscent sold a staggering 175 billion PEPE worth $1.5 million by dumping it into Binance. Notably, this selloff marks the institution’s last dump for the token, as it has offloaded all its holdings for the same. Intriguingly, Nanscent sacked a staggering 608.85 billion tokens between June 6 and July 15, 2024, for $7.73 million. Thereafter, the institution began selling on November 13 of last year, when Pepe Coin’s price rocketed. However, it’s worth mentioning that the top meme coin sector’s dynamic nature caused the institution to miss the optimal selling point, resulting only in a profit of $348K. Nevertheless, as the renowned entity dumped all holdings for this token, market watchers remain cautious about future movements amid declining market interest. Source: Lookonchain, X Macroeconomic Developments Bring Further Uncertainty Meanwhile, it’s worth considering that the broader crypto market struggles primarily due to macroeconomic events. The market witnessed turmoil this week as Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. However, despite Trump pausing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days, the market has yet to recover. Some traders and investors continue to eye a bearish run for the market in the next couple of months, given prices haven’t recovered and tariffs are to resume in 30 days. As a result, even Pepe Coin price is poised to tackle volatility, raising concerns among market participants further fueled by the massive dump mentioned above. Can PEPE Price Withstand Pressure? Usual market sentiments convey immense bearishness in light of such massive selloffs, given the rise in supply pressure and flagging a loss of confidence in the asset. Moreover, the broader market volatility has injected further negative sentiments among investors as prices trade sluggishly. As of press time, Pepe Coin’s price lost nearly 1.5% and is resting at $0.000009046. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.000008482 and $0.000009809, respectively. Further, the weekly chart for the asset illustrated a 35% crash. As mentioned above, this slumping action aligns with the broader trend and the massive selloff. Coinglass data indicated the meme coin’s futures OI slipped 2.5% to $246.59 million, underlining the reducing market interest in the asset. Liquidation for the same totaled $3.72 million in the past 24 hours. A recent PEPE price analysis by CoinGape further revealed that the key support is at $0.000006730. The token currently trades substantially above this level. Crypto market watchers continue to monitor the price action for further shifts, taking an uncertain stand on future movements amid riveting market dynamics due to broader trends.

Several crypto like Bonk and Floki have scored success stories on the back of partnering or adapting ideas from other crypto projects. In fact, Floki recently commenced a partnership with Coingecko to rev up its visibility and reposition the meme coin for higher profits in 2025. But in case you missed it, a new meme coin, Panshibi , is taking over the crypto market, offering high returns for early buyers whilst giving meme coin giants, Bonk and Floki, a serious run for their money and the 30x ship anchored by SHIBI is about to leave. Bonk Initiates Burn Campaign After a Grim January Bonk has announced plans to burn 2.02 trillion tokens following the BONK’s price crash earlier this week. This has been attributed to the political tensions surrounding U.S. trade wars with China, Mexico and Canada. Earlier this week, BONK dropped to $0.000016 and later rose to $0.000018, but analysts have reported that the coin is unlikely to rally up anytime soon. The projected outcome of burning these BONK tokens is to reduce its total supply, increasing its scarcity and driving up the price. Considering that many meme coin projects have successfully employed the burn mechanism in the past, the BONK team is hoping for headway to rally their token value whilst marking an end to the BonkDragon event. However, this disclosure has yet to impact the meme coin’s price in any way, as it continues to hover around $0.000018 and $0.000017. According to CoinMarketCap , BONK’s price has dropped by 31.34% in the last seven days. Floki Partners With Coingecko, Pledges For Visibility In a chain of efforts to reposition its token for higher profits this year, FLOKI has entered into a three-month partnership with CoinGecko . Floki hopes that this partnership will increase Floki’s visibility to a massive audience whilst helping it leverage CoinGecko’s network of over 167 million monthly page viewership and 10 million downloads. The campaign can potentially generate about 12.9 million impressions and showcase Floki’s new Trading Bot to millions of crypto traders. Floki recorded a significant rise in 2024, grossing over 1,000% within a few months. This resulted in a new all-time high of $0.000348, dropping shortly after and rallying up late in the year and failing to sustain momentum already in 2025. Plus, there has been a recent breakdown from a critical support level, intensifying the sentiments that FLOKI has gone bearish again. FLOKI’s bearish wave has been attributed to the 187% spike in whale inflow, signifying high selling pressure from large FLOKI Holders. Analysts forecast that the Shiba Inu and United Arab Emirates partnership, amongst others, may have diverted investment away from FLOKI, leading to lower demand for the meme coin. While demand for established meme coins plunges even further, a new meme coin and market favorite, Panshibi, has meme coin investors queuing up to lock their investments in its presale. Panshibi’s 1,200% Staking APY and 145,000% ROI Set to Pool High Profits for Early Investors Whilst crypto giants like BONK and FLOKI struggle to keep their footing in the crypto market, newcomer Panshibi is taking over the market and offering huge returns for early investors. Panshibi (SHIBI) merges the exciting features of social-FI and AI and taps into three massive communities of Asia, meme coins enthusiasts and panda lovers to create wealth for its investors and traders. One of the most outstanding features of Panshibi is its staking system that offers APYs as high as 1,200% whilst pooling in passive income for its early adopters and investors alike and offering stable income for long-term holders. The project offers exciting perks to early adopters as it offers presale holders instant access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club, offering exclusive access to new features and network opportunities with fellow investors. The Panshibi team has mapped out a total supply of two billion tokens and a distribution system that fosters project stability and sustainability. The presale is capped at $10 million worth of tokens and slated for 60 days and up to 60% of the chunk is up for the presale buyers. A full audit by Coinsult confirms that the Panshibi smart contract is safe and secure and investors are jumping in on it already. And so should you. Panshibi Presale is Here – Get Your Share of the Big Pie! The Panshibi team has announced that there are fifteen stages of the SHIBI presale. However, buying at an earlier stage guarantees way more profit. Early adopters from stage one will gain 1,200% on their purchase and the gain margin decreases at every stage.

As digital currencies prepare for significant gains, identifying the right altcoins becomes essential. This article uncovers five promising cryptocurrencies poised for explosive growth, offering a unique chance to dramatically amplify investments during the next bull run. Alpha Meme Coin DOGEN Off to the Moon After Its Major Listing Event DOGEN, which has recently captured the interest of the crypto community with its bold narrative of the strongest meme coin for alpha males , was listed on February 4th. The listing comes at the perfect timing as the crypto market is on the brink of a massive bull run supported by favorable geopolitical factors. Affectionately dubbed “DOGE on steroids” by one community member, DOGEN is poised to replicate the success of popular meme coins such as Dogecoin, which has seen a whopping 66,000% increase compared to its launch price . Those who bought $DOGEN during the presale got it at a bargain price. However, it is not too late; $DOGEN remains a good value and its price is predicted to increase from here. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a fad; it’s a growing movement with a team dedicated to building a strong community of alpha leaders who are ready to take over the market. This token offers real value, including exciting campaigns and exclusive benefits for early adopters. DOGEN is a chance to be part of something big . The community-driven presale strategy has enabled DOGEN to raise $5.5 million in initial funding and amass a large community of nearly 20,000 DOGEN fans . This provides a strong foundation for the token to start its mission to the moon successfully. The $DOGEN private presale has concluded, and the token can now be purchased with SOL on major cryptocurrency exchanges. DOGEN is heading to the moon! Join the mission and don’t miss out! Solana and the Role of SOL in Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and supporting decentralized applications. It uses architectural choices to enable faster transactions and flexible programming options. Its native coin, SOL, plays a key role in its operations. SOL powers transactions, runs programs, and rewards participants in the network. The platform focuses on high capacity without using sharding or second-layer solutions. This approach aims to draw developers and investors seeking to build or support high-activity projects. SOL’s value is tied to the platform’s adoption and its ability to host growing applications. The performance and adoption of Solana’s blockchain can influence market interest in SOL during different market conditions. Cardano and ADA: Features and Potential Cardano is a blockchain platform created for scalable and efficient smart contracts. It supports decentralized apps, crypto tokens, and blockchain-based games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum’s ETH, enabling users to store value, make transactions, and stake within its network. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros, which sets it apart from power-hungry proof-of-work systems. Its design includes two layers—one for transactions and another for smart contracts—to improve speed and scalability. Cardano can handle very high transaction volumes, aiming for up to a million per second. Its native tokens allow secure, low-cost operations, offering strong potential for developers and users. Market attractiveness depends on demand, adoption, and its performance against competitors. AVAX: A Scalable and Versatile Blockchain Platform Avalanche is a blockchain platform known for high speed and low fees. Its design supports up to 4,500 transactions per second, with finality in under two seconds. It uses three separate chains for different tasks: X-Chain for asset transfers, C-Chain for smart contracts, and P-Chain for network management. Users can create custom blockchains called Subnets. Its hybrid consensus ensures efficiency and security. AVAX, its native token, is used to pay fees, stake for rewards, and secure the network. It also supports creating new tokens and systems. Avalanche’s eco-friendly model, adaptability, and growing use cases make it an attractive option for developers and users. Its appeal depends on market trends and adoption growth. Chainlink And The Role of the LINK Token in Smart Contracts Chainlink is a system connecting blockchains to real-world data. It lets smart contracts use external information like weather, prices, or events. This is done through oracles that collect, check, and send data to the blockchain. It has on-chain parts to manage requests and off-chain parts to gather information. The LINK token is key to the system. It pays for services, rewards workers, and ensures security. The technology is useful for industries needing verified data. LINK’s value depends on demand for smart contracts and decentralized systems. Its appeal in the market relies on how much people use Chainlink’s network for real-world projects. Conclusion While SOL, ADA, AVAX, and LINK have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end and following the success of BONK and Popcat, DOGEN offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters, building a community of leaders aiming for market dominance.

Momentum indicators remain mixed, with RSI near 44 and MACD showing signs of slowing bearish pressure. A breakout above $109K could confirm a bullish continuation, while losing $100K may lead to a retracement toward $93K – $89K. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged past the $100,000 mark, hitting a key psychological level in the period of ongoing volatility. The cryptocurrency recently traded between $96,000 and $97,000, facing multiple rejections at resistance levels. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, BTC must sustain this momentum to confirm a bullish breakout. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Tests $100K Resistance, Support at $91K Bitcoin price dynamics (January 2025 – February 2025) Bitcoin’s price action shows resistance between $100,000 and $102,000, with a stronger barrier forming near $108,000 – $109,000. Immediate support is between $91,000 and $92,000, an area where buyers have historically entered the market.

He claimed that the chatbot can generate bioweapon-related information, which could be dangerous in the near future. In an interview, Amodei said DeepSeek generated uncommon information about bioweapons during an Anthropic safety test. As he spoke about the AI startup performance, he mentioned it is, “the worst of basically any model we’d ever tested It had absolutely no blocks whatsoever against generating this information.” Anthropic regularly tests different AI models to evaluate their possible risks to national security. They do it by checking if models can produce information about bioweapons that isn’t readily available on Google or in textbooks. Attack success rates on LLMs. Source: CISCO In addition, CISCO also successfully hacked DeepSeek R1 without any failures. This is different from other advanced types like o1, which prevent most attacks with their protective features. However, Amodei said that the weakness is not a threat at the moment. He also mentioned that unless there is clear proof of danger, there will be a good reason to keep improving it. He has urged the engineers and the company to pay real attention to AI safety. DeepSeek is already facing hostility in some nations, like Italy. On the other hand, companies like AWS and Microsoft have announced that they are adding R1 to their cloud services. Some may look at this as part of learning for the company, while others might take it more seriously. There isn’t any response yet or backlash to the new findings. The US AI takes the lead – Dario Amodei According to the Anthropic CEO, “Now there are three to five companies in the US and one company in China. Whether they continue to make near-frontier models depends upon how many chips they can get access to and whether they can get access to chips at a much larger scale than those they’ve been able to get access to now.” DeepSeek accounted for their cheap technology on Nvidia chips purchased before the US restrictions. According to Amodei, “The export controls were never really designed to prevent DeepSeek or any other Chinese company from getting the number of chips that they had at the level of a couple tens of thousands.” He added, “We should reasonably expect smuggling to happen. Export controls can be more successful at preventing larger acquisitions -they can’t have like a million chips because that’s easily in the tens of billions in economic activity, approaching 100 billion.” DeepSeek claimed to have used a mix of H100s, which are the standard chips in the US. They used approximately 10,000 of those. That means they should not be too affected. In the question of China becoming independent on their chips, especially the Huawei chips, he said that it would take 10 to 15 years. He added, “It’s actually going to be difficult to make chips that are competitive with say the new Nvidia B100 […] My sense is that it is unlikely that the Huawei chips become anywhere near comparable to US chips anytime soon.” Amodei has raised concerns about laws in the United States. He explained that efforts are being made to assess and potentially limit the risks of AI systems. This includes concerns about their dangers, misuse by individuals for instance, in biological attacks and the risks posed by the systems themselves. In the past year, there have been several new laws in the US. This poses the question of will DeepSeek’s market survive in the US? In addition, Amodei praised the US AI companies as he explained that they work together well. He said that they all follow the same rules. OpenAI, Meta, Google, and xAI all have to comply with the US regulations. He said, “You can know that you’re engaging in necessary safety practices and others will engage in them as well.” On the contrary, he said, “I don’t think that’s possible between the US and China. We’re kind of in a Hobbesian international anarchy.” Amodei brought to light that, “I’m aware of efforts by the US Government to send a delegation to talk to China about topics related to AI safety. My understanding, again, I obviously wasn’t part of those delegations, is that there wasn’t that much interest from the Chinese side.” US lawmakers want to ban DeepSeek on government devices DeepSeek is about to be hit by another ban for security reasons. This time by the US government. Similar to the TikTok rule, a bipartisan group in the U.S. is suggesting a law to stop the Chinese AI app DeepSeek from being used on government devices. Representatives Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Darin LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, introduced a bill called the “No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act.” This bill would make it illegal for federal workers to use the Chinese AI app on government-owned devices. They pointed out that the Chinese government could use the app for spying and spreading false information. Gottheimer said, “The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans […] We simply can’t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|Anthropic|CNY|DeepSeek|OpenAI|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-08 07:12:46

Well, let’s talk numbers—Memecoin (MEME) has seen a 30.92% spike in trading volume, but its price has been slipping, down 6.05% in the last 24 hours and 36.75% in the past week. Meanwhile, Ponke (PONKE) is holding strong with a 2% daily gain, though it’s still down 21.10% on the week. But here’s where things get wild—BTFD Coin (BTFD) is making massive waves with a game-changing announcement that’s got the Bulls hyped up like never before. Meme coins have been the talk of the crypto space for years, and every cycle, a few names stand out from the herd. Among the top new meme coins to invest in this month , BTFD Coin is proving to be that one standout, capturing traders’ attention with its explosive presale success, the Bulls Squad’s growing influence, and a P2E game that’s already live and paying out big. If you’re looking for a meme coin with community strength and massive upside potential, BTFD is showing all the right signs. And with the presale already jumping to Stage 14, the window to get in before the listing price of $0.0006 is closing fast. BTFD Coin Roars Ahead with Bulls Squad and Massive 100% Bonus Offer What’s got the crypto community talking? BTFD Coin recently announced it’s skipping straight to Stage 14 and BURNING all unsold tokens from Stage 13. That means a reduced supply, tighter circulation, and a stronger foundation for massive price action. But that’s not even the biggest news—BTFD is giving investors a one-time 100% bonus code (LAUNCH100), doubling every token purchase in this stage. Yeah, you read that right. You buy once, and you get twice the amount. Now, let’s break it down: BTFD’s presale price is sitting at $0.00016 per token, and by the end of the presale, it’s launching at $0.0006 per token. That’s already an easy 3.75x return, and with its strong community, staking rewards (90% APY), and fully launched P2E game, analysts are eyeing a moon price of $0.006, meaning an insane 37.5x gain for early investors. Let’s say you throw in $4,000 at Stage 14’s price of $0.00016 per BTFD—you’d be looking at 25 million BTFD tokens. But with the LAUNCH100 bonus, you’d get 50 million tokens. When the listing price hits $0.0006, that investment is already worth $30,000. And if it hits $0.006? You’re sitting on a whopping $300,000. Talk about a bull run. Want in? Here’s how to buy BTFD: Set up your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Load it up with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Connect to the presale page and enter the bonus code: LAUNCH100.

This presale isn’t gonna last forever, and with over $5.97 million already raised and 69 billion tokens sold, it’s clear that BTFD Bulls are leading the charge among the top new meme coins to invest in this month. Memecoin (MEME) Sees Trading Volume Surge Despite Price Drop Memecoin (MEME), the native token of Memeland, has been seeing some wild market action. While its price is currently down 6.05% in the last 24 hours and 36.75% over the past week, there’s a significant surge in trading volume—up 30.92%. That signals that traders are keeping their eyes on MEME, watching for a potential breakout. Backed by 9GAG’s Web3 venture, Memecoin is more than just a speculative asset. Its ecosystem taps into the meme culture that has historically driven coins like Dogecoin and PEPE to mainstream recognition. As the market looks for the next wave of meme-driven hype, MEME remains a key player to watch. Memecoin thrives on cultural relevance, and its connection to the massive 9GAG audience keeps it in the spotlight. With trading volume rising, it’s clear that traders are keeping an eye on a possible rebound. If market momentum shifts in its favor, Memecoin could see a strong reversal. Ponke (PONKE) Sees Green as Solana-Based Asset Gains Traction Ponke (PONKE) is showing signs of resilience, with a 2% gain in the last 24 hours, despite being down 21.10% over the past week.

Floki’s Evolution: From Meme Coin to Utility and Charity Floki, initially inspired by Elon Musk’s pet name tweet, is more than a meme coin. Created as Floki Inu, it has shifted focus to utility and charitable work. This includes the development of schools in Laos and Nigeria. Known now as one of the top meme coins to watch in 2023, its ecosystem is growing. It offers projects like the NFT game Valhalla and DeFi service FlokiFi. It also collaborates with NOWPayments, introducing a prepaid Floki Card for real-world purchases. This expansion into NFTs, DeFi, and practical use sets FLOKI apart from other meme coins, indicating a broader potential beyond just market speculation. Shiba Inu: A Memecoin with Broader Ethereum Integration Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin that operates on the Ethereum blockchain, offering broad compatibility. It launched in August 2020, created by a developer named Ryoshi. SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, an influential figure in the crypto world. His donation of SHIB to a relief fund and the burn of 40% of the tokens brought attention to SHIB. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB is linked with Ethereum, allowing for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include a platform for NFTs and a governance system. This sets SHIB up for more utility in the crypto space.

With increasing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and innovations in the financialization of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency is entering a transformative phase. Killeen noted that one of the biggest factors in Bitcoin’s growth this year has been Tether’s expansion into Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. With over 400 million users, Tether’s integration brings trillions of dollars of activity into Bitcoin’s ecosystem. “This move by Tether means users will benefit from Lightning’s instant payments and lower transaction costs,” Killeen said, explaining how this could accelerate Bitcoin’s wider adoption. Additionally, public companies are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. According to Bitwise, over 70 public companies currently hold Bitcoin, further strengthening its role as a corporate treasury asset. Related News: While Everyone Waits for XRP Spot ETF Approval, There's Another Positive Development for XRP While regulatory uncertainty has long been a hurdle for crypto, 2025 could be a turning point. “Regulatory clarity is long overdue and will be extremely beneficial not only for Bitcoin, but also for the startup ecosystem that has grown around it,” Killeen said. He noted that clearer rules would allow Bitcoin-focused startups to allocate capital more efficiently, rather than being hedged against unpredictable regulation. He also noted that the Lightning Network could play a crucial role in the future of AI, as AI models increasingly require micropayments on a larger scale, and Lightning is uniquely suited to facilitate this. Killeen believes that new Bitcoin financial products will gain traction in 2025: Bitcoin-denominated life insurance: Firms like Meanwhile, a Stillmark portfolio company, are launching insurance products that allow policyholders to grow their wealth in BTC. Institutional-grade custody and management tools: CASA develops solutions for companies to securely add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, supporting greater institutional adoption. “The financialization of Bitcoin is accelerating, bringing more sophisticated investment products and infrastructure to the space,” Killeen concluded. *This is not investment advice.

The sudden collapse in gas fees makes it almost comparable to fees on the wildly popular Solana (SOL) blockchain. Despite this incredible achievement, Ethereum price dropped 2.40% yesterday and is down -0.48% today and trades around $2,613. Will ETH price bottom here and catalyze a bull run? Why is Ethereum Price Crashing as Gas Fees Plummet More Than 90%? Due to the high correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum prices continue to drop despite the increase in gas limits on February 6, which dropped gas fees by more than 90%. At the time of writing, the transaction fee on Solana costs $0.04 , while Ethereum’s gas price hovers around $0.05 . This achievement from Ethereum comes after validators agreed to raise the gas limits to nearly 32 million units. This upgrade to the network came without the need for a hard fork after almost half of the validators supported increasing the gas limits. In a nutshell, increasing gas limits allows more transactions to be bundled in a block. As a result, the gas fees have plummeted, which is a fundamentally bullish development and could inflate ETH’s value . Many are touting this move as “solving the scaling problem” that plagued Ethereum for years. The fact that the gas fees are comparable to the competitor Solana makes it much more alluring. It could be a catalyst that ignites ETH to form a bottom formation and a bullish Ethereum price reversal. Is ETH Forming a Bottom? From a technical standpoint, Ethereum price is approaching the key support level at $2,497, which is the midpoint of the daily wick formed after the February 3 crash. So, yes, ETH is forming a bottom around $2,500, and the probability of a reversal is high. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) support this outlook as they flash signs of reversal. The RSI has hit the oversold zone after six months, and AO is flashing green histograms below the mean level, suggesting a depletion of bearish momentum and hinting at a resurgence of bullish momentum. ETH/USDT 1-day chart Key Levels to Book Profits After a bounce from the key support level of $2,497, investors must pay close attention to $2,921 & $3,000, which are Monday’s high and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). These levels could pose stiff resistance to the Ethereum price’s recovery rally. Overcoming these hurdles will open the path to critical overhead barriers at $3,119 and $3,306. Only after flipping these into a support floor will push ETH to $4,000 and beyond. Conclusion In conclusion, the significant drop in Ethereum gas fees by over 90% is a fundamentally bullish development that could potentially catalyze a bull run. Despite the current price drop, Ethereum is forming a bottom around $2,500, and technical indicators suggest a high probability of a reversal. As Ethereum’s gas fees become comparable to those of Solana, it may regain its attractiveness, leading to a potential price surge. Ethereum price prediction notes a move to $4,000 is possible after a bottom around $2,500.

The new deadline for the SEC’s decision is set for April 9, 2025. SEC to Decide on Ethereum Trust Options by April 2025 The SEC said it will decide on April 9, 2025, whether to approve or disapprove allowing options trading on the world’s largest asset manager’s iShares Ethereum Trust, according to the filing. The SEC stated that it needs more time to review the proposed rule change and consider the issues raised before making a decision. “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” the agency said. Notably, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted that the SEC has postponed its decision likely awaiting the confirmation of Paul S. Atkins. Additionally, CBOE has submitted a 19b-4 rule change proposal to the SEC to support in-kind creations and redemptions for Fidelity’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. SEC punting on spot Ether ETF options.

In August, Nasdaq, on BlackRock’s behalf, filed a rule change to list and trade options for the iShares Ethereum Trust. Two letters were submitted about Nasdaq’s proposal. One, from Better Markets, warned the SEC to be careful before allowing options trading for spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs because of their volatility. IBIT options have rapidly grown in popularity, reaching over $13 billion in open interest, which now makes up more than 55% of Deribit’s total options open interest. IBIT has quickly become one of the most active ETF options markets, even competing with more established markets like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). Besides, on Friday, the SEC requested public comments on a proposal from Cboe BZX Exchange Inc., representing Fidelity, to list and trade options on its spot Ethereum ETF.

The project’s recently launched presale has generated over $707,000 since going live. The crypto scene has been a battlefield of losses over recent days. Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed leader, had taken a significant knock while altcoins suffered a similar blow. The crypto scene, however, remains resilient, and one of the newest memecoins gracing the stage is Shiba Inu’s best friend, Husky Inu (HINU). Husky Inu (HINU) Soars Beyond Presale Exceeds $700,000 The top dogs of the memecoin world have added a new member to the pack: Husky Inu (HINU). The project was created to bring more value and utility to its holders by leveraging the power of the Solana blockchain. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, are trying to conquer the memecoin industry to build a robust and supportive community boasting innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for its HINU token with immense success. The first stage of the presale sold out within days of launching, and the subsequent stages are well underway. Since the $HINU presale went live, the project has raised over $708,000. Given what the project is planning, Husky Inu’s presale success is no surprise. The project has big things in the works, with plans to launch its Earn App and Decentralized Exchange. Husky Inu’s Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project and completing simple tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. The project’s DEX will facilitate decentralized trading, improving the utility and value for $HINU holders. Why Is Husky Inu Such a Good Buy? Husky Inu prioritizes a reliable token ecosystem through a well-set-out distribution model and a capped max supply. The project has capped its total supply to 100 billion tokens and boasts a unique deflationary supply element. The deflationary aspect means that 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming Husky Inu Exchange and DEX will be used to buy and then burn $HINU tokens and, in such a way, reduce the circulating $HINU supply. How Can I Buy $HINU Presale Tokens? Follow the steps below to get your hands on $HINU today: Step 1: Connect a Wallet The presale widget can be found on the top of Husky Inu’s webpage. To get started, users can connect their wallets using various options. Should you encounter any issues or cannot connect, please contact Husky Inu’s official Telegram Channel. Step 2: Select a Network After connecting your wallet, users can join the $HINU presale on the Solana chain. You can purchase $HINU tokens using native currency or with BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, DOGE, TRX, DASH, BCH, or USDT on Ethereum Tron chains. Step 3: Buy Tokens After completing the first two steps, you can move on to step 3. Specify the amount of BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, USDT, DOGE, TRX, DASH, or BCH you would like to trade for $HINU, and then approve the transaction in your wallet. Remember that you will not receive tokens immediately during the presale but can claim them once it has concluded.

It has taken many battering hits. A few of its tokens, like $BTC, $ENA, $SPX, $PEPE , and $WIF, have seen plummeting prices and sustained notable declines. The lean downturn for the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), has seen its price dip below $97K and continue falling. Memecoins like $PEPE have seen some of the worst sell-offs because major holders have decided to take profits. Though the downturn affects many sectors, it has particularly hit the previously lively cryptocurrency sector. In one such instance, a prominent $PEPE whale, who had held a colossal quantity of the token, recently divested themselves of the last of their 20.12 billion $PEPE coins, with a truly remarkable loss of $1.227 million incurred over the three preceding months. The most recent sell-off certainly isn’t a good omen for the financial health of major meme investors, but worst of all, it illustrates just how easily the cryptocurrency market can be pushed around, even without the usual kind of coordinated effort or incentive that a rug pull provides. A $PEPE Whale’s Loss: The Final Sell-Off The $PEPE whale, whose trading history has drawn the eyes of the crypto community, first acquired a substantial trove of 351.3 billion $PEPE tokens in November and December 2024. The whale bought the tokens at an average price of $0.00001722 per $PEPE. But then, the market turned. $PEPE plummeted, and the whale had to change course. To minimize losses, the whale took action to sell off a large part of their holdings. Early in January 2025, they reduced the position by about 40%, offloading some of their $PEPE at a price of $0.00002066. Although this was a higher price compared to what they sold for later, the market continued to go against the whale, and in the last 24 hours, they sold off the remainder of their holdings. The average price of the sale was about $0.00001413. The concluding sale of the $PEPE tokens, which totaled 20.12 billion tokens, has worsened the already negative sentiment surrounding the broader crypto market. Large liquidations like this, where such a big holder of a project’s tokens sells off their remaining tokens, can and do cause prices to drop in the short term. This happening over the weekend didn’t help matters either. And in terms of negative sentiment, we were already at a point where people were just looking for an excuse to be down on the market. 又一个 $PEPE 巨鲸绷不住了，11 小时前清仓最后 2012 亿枚 PEPE，持仓三个月累计亏损 122.7 万美金 该地址在 2024.11 – 12 期间以均价 0.00001722 建仓了 3513 亿枚 PEPE，一个月前在 $0.00002066 减仓了近 40% 仓位，今天全部清仓，平均卖出价格 $0.00001413 钱包地址 https://t.co/IDt4eRfsoC https://t.co/0xPQrhSaOJ pic.twitter.com/s8swMHBYEq — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) February 7, 2025 The Bigger Picture: Declining Market Trends In the last 24 hours, a considerable amount of capital has flooded into decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Smart Dex traders have added a total of $875.5K to their portfolios. Now, this is ongoing interest in decentralized trading platforms, but it also says something about the potential imminent volatility of our crypto investments. A whole lot of tokens are popping off lately—like $PEPE, which seem to be looking more and more like blast tokens. Meanwhile, our eyes are on the market, watching for signs of stabilization. To deepen the interest, another wallet address, 0xe7d0, seven hours ago, made a massive buy of 97.48 billion $PEPE tokens, worth, give or take, $911.5K. This purchase brought the wallet’s total to an unfathomable (for most of us) 1.4 trillion $PEPE tokens, which could be valued at around $13.22 million. And in a slightly less recent twist or turn, this same trader had already turned $1.09 million into $2.18 million (a 140% gain) from $PEPE. So they seem to really, really like the song that the $PEPE band is playing. In the past 24 hours, ~$875.5K was added by Smart Dex Traders. Notably, 7h ago, wallet 0xe7d0 bought more 97.48B $PEPE ($911.5K), increasing his total holdings to 1.4T $PEPE ($13.22M). This trader previously earned $1.09M (+140%) from $PEPE . #iCrypto #PEPE pic.twitter.com/ZLJEXEpZd7 — iCrypto | Sentiment & On-chain Analysis (@iCryptoAI) February 7, 2025 A Risky Endeavor: The Nature of Meme Coins The state of affairs with $PEPE serves as a cautionary tale for investors in the meme coin space. Tokens like $PEPE have the potential for massive, if not rapid, gains. But they are not just volatile; they are extremely volatile and are subject to the most severe of price swings. The overall crypto market is also not in great shape; it is an ill wind that seems to be blowing through the current market. Many mainstream media outlets have been questioning whether the latest drop in Bitcoin’s price—fetching less than $97K—might be an indicator of a longer and more drawn-out downturn. In particular, meme coins are highly speculative assets, often moved by social media hype and the stepping in of large traders. While some early investors in $PEPE saw astronomical returns, the downturn has since left a number of folks holding the bag. The $PEPE whale’s liquidation of over 20 billion tokens must have been done in a way that didn’t totally mess up the market. Still, the sale of that many tokens shows how precarious things can get when the price of these in-demand but highly undemand assets starts to fall. In addition, recent actions taken by traders such as wallet 0xe7d0, who has reaped considerable gains from $PEPE, indicate that the realm of meme coins is anything but moribund. Even in periods of downturn, both major stakeholders and nascent investors seem undeterred in their commitments to these expressions of internet culture, staking them as bets, à la Wall Street, on a future reversal in market sentiment. Conclusion The recent liquidation by a large whale of 20.12 billion $PEPE tokens reminds us of the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. With Bitcoin falling to under $97K and meme coins like $PEPE seeing heavy losses, the market feels uncertain. Some traders are betting on a rebound for $PEPE, but for others, it seems to be a time for loss-cutting. Even as the market keeps changing, it’s certain that crypto investors need to be cautious, particularly when it comes to speculative assets like meme coins. Whether $PEPE, along with a few other tokens, will right themselves again and come back into the marketplace is an open question. One thing that isn’t in doubt is that the whole crypto market is currently in a state of flux—looking for direction, as many traders reassess and regroup, at least momentarily, to figure out how best to approach the new lay of the land.

This coincided with a dramatic market downturn, with FARTCOIN plummeting to a current price of $0.4562, down from a January 19 high of $2.81. While this sharp descent has made many investors jittery, it seems that some savvy operatives near the top of the FARTCOIN food chain are taking advantage of the lower price and anticipating an uptick in the near future. Two Big Whales Increasing Their Positions The earliest whale move comes from Ansem, who just 11 hours ago added $818,000 worth of FARTCOIN to his holdings. Ansem’s purchase was made at an average price of $0.4142 per token. As you may have deduced, the current price of the token is up to $0.4562, which, at least on the surface, is looking like a checkpoint for the kind of modest profit that could make a FARTCOIN holder feel a little more at ease. Those trying to astutely read the tea leaves of this cryptocurrency’s future, however, would probably have some difficulty doing so at the moment, given the massive journey downwards that FARTCOIN has otherwise taken since reaching the highs it saw in the cryptocurrency bull run of 2021. Ansem’s buy is particularly intriguing, as FARTCOIN was still at a fraction of its peak. By purchasing when he did, Ansem stands to benefit from any future price increase, which is not a certainty in the current crypto market. The large position that Ansem now holds with FARTCOIN indicates a level of confidence in the token’s long-term upside potential that many, including this writer, currently do not see. FARTCOIN’s recent drop might make it seem an even less likely candidate for such a trade; however, the opposite case is gaining some traction among a handful of investors. Another whale has also upped its game with FARTCOIN. An address with the name “59aZn…x5732” just withdrew 5 million FARTCOIN tokens from the Kraken exchange 9 hours ago. The transaction, worth about 2.29 million USD, was done at an average price of $0.4574, which is a smidge higher than Ansem’s entry point. What this all adds up to is that big players continue to buy FARTCOIN; if nothing else, their buying suggests they see some future value in it. This development indicates that well-heeled investors consider the token to be valuable, despite a dramatic 14-day price drop. It is also revealing, in that, since the transaction happened a week or so ago, we know that the whale in question is apparently not afraid to make a big bet on the token, and is doing so via a well-respected exchange. FARTCOIN’s Fall: 83% Decline from January’s Peak Recent price activity for FARTCOIN has been dramatic. Just half a month ago, on January 19, the token hit what was (at the time) a stunning price of $2.81—one that was drawing all kinds of attention from all kinds of investors and traders. The euphoria surrounding that price, though, quickly faded as FARTCOIN, since hitting that price, has dropped a staggering 83% in value, with the current (January 31, 2023) price hovering around $0.4562. The sudden plunge in price has caused many investors to wonder what happened. There are several possible explanations for the drop, including volatility in the overall market, declining enthusiasm for meme coins, and the cooling speculative token trend. As FARTCOIN has endeavored to maintain some semblance of forward motion, legions of smaller holders have seemed to take flight, locking in their much-diminished profits and bemoaning the lost absurdity that once reigned. Despite the sharp drop, whales such as Ansem and the one at “59aZn…x5732” demonstrate that there is still a significant interest in FARTCOIN, even at its current low price. Their actions in the market suggest that these crypto capitalists are betting on a potential recovery or the long-term value of the token, even in the face of short-term declines. This might be a case of “buying the dip,” a common strategy among experienced investors that favors accumulation at a reduced price with the hope of profit in the not-too-distant future. Smart Money and the Potential for Rebound Ansem’s and the whale’s maneuvers behind the address “59aZn…x5732” have sparked guesses about where FARTCOIN might be headed. The token, after all, looks like it’s been walloped and then some, yet here we have big players amassing big amounts; appears to be some sort of vote of confidence, right? Still, the business of FARTCOIN, what it does and how it does it, isn’t any less amazing than the doings behind the address in question—which is to say, FARTCOIN is about as risky as anything in crypto can possibly be. 两大巨鲸 / 聪明钱正在加仓 $FARTCOIN 1⃣ Ansem 11 小时前以均价 $0.4142 加仓 81.8 万美金的代币，目前持仓 197 万枚，单币已累计获利 411 万美金 https://t.co/zqatuTnRom 2⃣ 新地址 59aZn…x5732 9 小时前从 #Kraken 提出 500 万枚代币（229 万美金），提出价格 $0.4574… https://t.co/Y8TJUZWIhO pic.twitter.com/YSD35ohDl3 — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) February 7, 2025 For those investors still holding FARTCOIN, the next few days and weeks will be key. Market sentiment toward the token has changed sharply, and its price may either keep sliding or possibly rebound if more whales buy in at these lower levels. While speculative tokens like FARTCOIN are often unpredictable, the behavior of these big investors suggests that, for all its current problems, FARTCOIN might still have a pulse. Conclusion Growing investments from whales such as Ansem—and the address “59aZn…x5732″—amid FARTCOIN’s 83% price drop suggest that some deep-pocketed investors see potential in the token. While the valuation of FARTCOIN has been shaken and stirred by market forces, the moves made by these smart money players indicate that they are not writing off the token’s future prospects. Whether FARTCOIN can recover from the shellacking it took over the summer—and regain heights last seen in early January—remains an open question. But these whales offer at least one counter-narrative to the idea that FARTCOIN is done for. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Analyst Spots a Surprising Pattern,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/could-fear-fuel-bitcoin-comeback-analyst-spots-a-surprising-pattern/,"Bitcoin price in recent days seems to have dimmed investor’s confidence in the asset for now with the community seeing less buzz as BTC sees fewer green days. Regardless of this, some analysts are still eager to analyze BTC and its major metric to at least get a perspective on if there’s hope around the corner. An instance is a CryptoQuant analyst known under the pseudonym ‘Avocado Onchain’ who recently shared an insight on BTC focusing on Binance funding rates. Funding rates, which represent the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures market, can provide insight into market sentiment. A decrease in funding rates often suggests growing pessimism, as traders who previously held bullish positions are forced to cover their positions due to mounting losses. This shift in sentiment can have cascading effects, leading to mass liquidations and further price declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility ‘Relatively Low’ Despite Market Shakeouts – Analysts Eye This Crucial Level Binance’s Funding Rates And Potential for Rebound Avocado, has recently examined the implications of Binance’s funding rates in a post titled “Monitoring Binance Funding Rates: Will Bitcoin Rebound After Extreme Fear?” According to the analysis, a notable wave of long position liquidations occurred recently, leaving the market in a state of extreme fear. Funding rates on Binance, a platform known for its large retail investor base, have shown a pattern that may hint at future price movements. Historically, negative funding rates on Binance have been relatively rare, but when they do occur, they have often preceded significant price rebounds. Avocado suggests that this dynamic is linked to the behavior of retail traders, who dominate Binance’s trading volume. When these traders display heightened fear—manifested through negative funding rates—Bitcoin has tended to defy the prevailing sentiment and recover. The analyst also pointed out that during past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has rebounded after hitting negative funding rates triggered by large-scale liquidations. This historical pattern could indicate that, while the current market environment appears grim, further declines in funding rates might signal a reversal. Essentially, if negative funding rates reappear on Binance, it may suggest that the market has reached a point of capitulation, often a precursor to a sustained recovery. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to face challenges in its upward momentum. Although the asset briefly rebounded to $100,000 earlier today following a mixed US jobs report, it quickly lost ground and was unable to sustain this recovery. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $98,226, reflecting a modest 1.8% gain in the past day. Interestingly, while Bitcoin’s price was higher at this time last week, today’s trading volume surpasses last week’s levels. Notably, so far, BTC’s daily trading volume climbed from $34 billion last Friday to over $55 billion today.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1.5 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025.

In an interview on CNBC, Thiel says that Bitcoin could go up by over 100% from the current level before the end of the year. “I think there’s a general consensus that the price of Bitcoin will move up this year to somewhere between $150,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year… What you do see is anytime there’s any major selling of Bitcoin there are buyers who enter the market and keep the price in the range of somewhere between $95,000 to $100,000. So I think there is still a big belief that Bitcoin will continue to go up in price. There’s still a lot of demand for the asset by not just retail but also institutional investors.” Bitcoin is trading at $96,770 at time of writing According to the Marathon Digital CEO, some of the catalysts that will drive the price of Bitcoin up include a friendlier regulatory environment and the embracement of the crypto king by both private and public entities. “ O n the regulatory side in the US, you wi ll see money center b anks being able to custody crypto and lend against crypto. T hat will then drive corporations to begin putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. A nd we’re not talking in large amounts, but 1% – 2% o f their cash and/or liquid assets as an alternative to treasuries or just holding it in f iat. And when you do that, that drives the price of Bitcoin up. There’s a limited amount of Bitcoin available unlike gold or unlike other types of precious commodities that can be extracted out of the ground. There are 20 million Bitcoin in circulation today. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin available and so scarcity will drive the price up. If then the US decides to go ahead with its plan to execute a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, that will require about another one million Bitcoin to be put aside into a fund. And as other sovereigns then do the same thing, that will continue to drive the price up.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company, based in the Netherlands, announced that it can no longer provide services to Russian citizens and residents unless they meet specific conditions. Russians with dual citizenship in an EEA country or Switzerland, or those living there permanently, can still use Deribit. However, Russians living in the UAE and all Russian companies are banned from the platform. In their statement, Deribit said it’s following EU rules that ban European crypto companies from serving Russian citizens or businesses after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as per the report. Moreover, the company believes that the crypto market should be open to all, and Russia’s new regulations are taking away that freedom from Russian citizens, making it a costly affair for traders. As a result, they are moving out to opt for a more favorable regulatory environment. Why Russia Relies on Crypto Since the conflict with Ukraine, Russia has been hit with heavy international sanctions. The country was even cut off from the SWIFT system, making it hard to process international payments. As a workaround, Russian companies have turned to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for cross-border transactions. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed this strategy, and even government officials supported it at last year’s BRICS Summit. However, using crypto for payments within Russia is still banned. What’s Next for Russian Traders? Deribit previously operated in Russia despite U.S. sanctions, but the new EU Rules left the company with no choice but to exit. Moreover, following the rule, the exchange will no longer operate in Russia. From February 17, new trades will be blocked, and by March 29, full access will be revoked. In 2023, Deribit moved its operations to Dubai to handle regulatory pressures better. Still, Russians living in Dubai are not allowed to register on the platform. Deribit’s departure is a big deal because it shows how even global crypto exchanges are feeling the heat from geopolitical tensions. For Russian traders, this means fewer options to access major crypto platforms, making it harder to navigate the international financial system. However, this decision could affect Deribit’s operations more than the Russian crypto market. Potential Migration to Alternative Platforms With Deribit exiting, Russian traders are likely to seek alternative platforms. Many may shift to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and dYdX, which are harder to regulate. Centralized exchanges that are not bound by EU regulations, such as OKX, Bybit, and some offshore platforms, could also see an influx of Russian users. Monitoring changes in trading volumes on these platforms could provide insights into Russia’s crypto strategy post-Deribit. Future Sanctions and Regulatory Uncertainty The EU’s decision to enforce these sanctions raises the question of whether other major exchanges will follow suit. Will Binance, Bybit, or other large exchanges take similar actions? If more platforms withdraw, Russian traders might be pushed even further into DeFi solutions and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. Dubai’s Role as a Crypto Hub Dubai has positioned itself as a major global crypto hub, but Deribit’s ban on Russian users even after relocating there suggests a tightening regulatory stance. If Dubai imposes stricter rules on Russian traders, other UAE-based exchanges might face similar pressures. This could impact Dubai’s attractiveness as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction for Russian investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia Crypto Tax 2025: What Miners & Investors Need to Know , BRICS and Crypto Alternatives Russia has been exploring BRICS-backed financial alternatives, including a potential BRICS digital currency. With China, India, and Brazil showing increased interest in crypto-based payment solutions, Russia may shift toward collaborations within the BRICS framework to bypass Western restrictions. How this impacts global crypto adoption remains to be seen. Impact on Deribit’s Market Position By cutting off Russian traders, Deribit risks losing a significant portion of its user base and trading volume. Will this decision weaken Deribit’s position against competitors who continue to serve Russian clients? The long-term effects on its liquidity and competitiveness should be closely watched. As geopolitical tensions continue shaping the crypto landscape, the coming months will reveal whether Deribit’s exit is a one-off case or a sign of a broader trend of exchanges distancing themselves from Russian users. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Over the week, Chainlink price has declined 30%, reflecting the entire market’s struggle, where Bitcoin has dropped below $100k. Though this is happening under the impact of various macroeconomic events, the concern is more about its continuity. Analysts believe LINK price needs to overcome a specific level to recover and prevent a further crash. What’s that? Let’s discuss. Chainlink Price To Crash Unless It Crosses $23.78 Popular crypto analyst Ali claims that $23.78 is the critical point for the Chainlink token. If the tokens fail to cross this level, the LINK price remains at risk of a crash. More importantly, overcoming this key resistance could spark a new bull rally. According to Ali’s post , around 78.95% of the LINK supply (789.49 Million tokens) is in the money zone, where they bought their tokens at an average price of $15.28, and the remaining 14.18% are out of the money, where the average buying price is near $23.78. With that, $23.78 is the most critical resistance for this token, as the investors who bought between $20.96 and $26.25 are facing losses. Once the token price approaches this key resistance, it could incentivize these holders to sell. This could initiate intense selling pressure, but once the resistance is overcome, it could boost market sentiments and create room for a rally. As a result, this breakout could allow us to reach $25, $30, and higher targets per Chainlink price predictions. Whale Activity Sparks Market Concerns Amid the macroeconomic events impacting the global crypto market, the growing activity of the Chainlink whales is also a factor to consider. An earlier CoinGape report mentioned that Whales have offloaded 4 million tokens in 48 hours alone, and there’s more reporting of such incidents. Such a massive sell-off is the representation of declining confidence. Interestingly, this connects to the 30% loss LINK faced over the week. It currently trades at $18.11 and is facing high consolidation. However, the 12% surge in its training volume of $588.13M indicates that investor interest is rising. The surge suggests that investors are buying the dip at this low, and the continuity of buyers’ activity could fuel its recovery. More importantly, crossing Ali’s predicted key resistance of $23.78 could propel it to a bullish rally. Can Chainlink Price Ever Again Hit $50? LINK token hit its prime in the 2021 bull run when the price surged to an ATH of $52.88. Since then, this token has never moved closer to that, creating concerns over its potential to attain similar peaks. However, despite the lack of bullish momentum, LINK has seen growing crypto adoption and increasing demand. If the right bullish momentum builds with high investor demand and a Bitcoin bull run , Chainlink price might hit $50. Many crypto analysts back this statement, considering historical patterns and price movements. One analyst believes that the token is bouncing from the upper border of the symmetrical triangle, and a breakout above the current key resistance could propel it to $50. Another analyst presented a similar finding, claiming that the token to find support is around $18.50, which will also act as the entry point for buyers. From there, upward movement is anticipated, with the targets being $28.50, $36.50, and $50.00. However, all these are speculation for now, and it could vary significantly due to market conditions and further movement of the LINK price. Key Things To Remember Chainlink token is at a critical juncture after facing a constant downtrend for days, as its price has declined 30% over the week. It currently trades at $18.11, with the key resistance at $23.78, which is the crucial factor for this token’s performance. It can either divert it to a bullish rally if this resistance is overcome or further crash on the failure to overcome this resistance. With the formation of the uptrend and continuity, LINK price could attain $50 in the near future.

However, analysts believe Rollblock could ultimately outperform the established Layer 1 in the long run. The GameFi protocol is already making waves, delivering an impressive 420% return during the early stages of its presale. Its success is driven by its disruptive approach to the $450 billion gaming industry. Rollblock eliminates fraud and offers instant transactions – setting a new standard for online gaming. This innovation is why many experts believe Rollblock could be one of 2025’s best-performing projects. Rollblock Attracts More Than 45.000 Players With Blockchain Revolution Rollblock is redefining GameFi by bringing blockchain technology to the gaming industry. The protocol offers over 7,000 AI-powered games, all completely on-chain, ensuring that every outcome is encrypted and impossible to alter. This eliminates any possibility of tampering with game results or manipulating odds. To enhance accessibility, Rollblock supports both fiat payments and over 20 cryptocurrencies, making transactions seamless for players worldwide. This commitment to security and transparency has driven Rollblock’s rapid adoption among both players and investors. In December alone, the platform recorded over $1.75 million in wagers, alongside a 600% surge in signups and deposits. The momentum carried into Rollblock’s presale, which has already raised more than $10 million across ten rounds. At the core of the ecosystem is RBLK, Rollblock’s native token. Priced at $0.053, RBLK plays a vital role in governance, staking, and revenue-sharing. To drive demand and maintain long-term value, Rollblock allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK from the open market. Of the repurchased tokens, 60% are burned to reduce supply, while the remaining 40% are distributed as staking rewards. This strategy has already delivered a 420% return for early investors. With the possibility of two to three major exchange listings on the horizon, analysts believe RBLK could experience another wave of growth in the coming months. Vaneck Expects Solana to Reach $520 in 2025 Solana has faced a 17% decline over the past week due to broader market conditions. Despite the price drop, the network recorded an impressive 213% revenue increase in Q4. As Solana continues to dominate key blockchain metrics, its market share in the smart contract platform sector is projected to grow from 15% to 22%. A report by VanEck suggests that if this expansion continues, Solana’s price could climb to $520. If the SCP sector reaches $1.1 trillion in value – a 43% increase from current levels – Solana’s market cap could hit $250 billion. This signals a substantial price increase for Solana. Solana has also surpassed Ethereum in dApp revenue. Since 2022, its dApp market share has surged from 0.26% to 42%, with revenue growing from $4 million to $1.25 billion. Developer activity has also soared, with 7,625 developers now building on Solana – outpacing Ethereum’s 6,456. Can Rollblock Outperform Solana? Analysts see Rollblock as a strong contender to outperform Solana in the long run. By introducing blockchain technology into the rigid iGaming industry, the protocol is tapping into a $450 billion market with massive growth potential. Its early success is already evident – RBLK has surged 420% during its presale, attracting significant investor interest. With momentum building, analysts predict the token could climb toward $1 in the coming months. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

His legal team appears to be banking on the possibility that the Trump administration’s evolving stance on digital assets may lead to at least one of the charges against him being dismissed. A Legal Strategy On February 5, Karony’s attorneys filed a motion in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) seeking to push jury selection from March to April 2025. They cited President Donald Trump’s January 23 executive order , which calls for reviewing regulations on digital assets, and comments from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce hinting at “retroactive relief” for certain crypto cases. The defense argued that changes to how digital assets are classified could impact the validity of charges claiming SafeMoon was treated as a security. “The parties may learn within days or even hours before trial, or worse—during trial—that the DOJ no longer considers SafeMoon a security,” Karony’s lawyers stated. Prosecutors Push Back on Defense Claims The US Attorney’s Office in EDNY filed a firm opposition to Karony’s motion on February 7, calling his claims speculative. US Attorney John Durham argued that the defense was relying on “aspirational regulatory policies that do not exist.” Even if sweeping regulatory changes occur, Durham asserted, the charges for wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy would likely remain unaffected. “These additional counts have nothing to do with SafeMoon’s status as a security or hypothetical regulatory policies,” Durham said, urging the judge to reject Karony’s request. Karony, along with SafeMoon associates Kyle Nagy and Thomas Smith, faces multiple criminal charges , including securities fraud and wire fraud conspiracy. Authorities allege the trio misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth of SafeMoon tokens between 2021 and 2022. While Karony was released on a $3 million bond in early 2024, Nagy reportedly fled to Russia after the charges were made public. Karony has pleaded not guilty to all accusations. The timing of the trial now hinges on Judge Eric Komitee’s decision. As regulatory uncertainty looms, Trump’s appointment of new officials, including former SEC Chair Jay Clayton as a nominee for a key position, further clouds the future of crypto-related enforcement in the United States.

Dogecoin and XRP supporters are turning their attention to five remarkable altcoins that are expected to thrive amidst the current market upswing. As digital currencies continue their rise, these coins are drawing interest for their promising potential. Investors eagerly await how these frontrunners will shape the dynamic crypto market. Solana (SOL), Ondo Finance (ONDO), Sui (SUI), and Near Protocol (NEAR) are capturing the interest of astute traders. Along with these well-known options, a distinctive project, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., is gaining traction. Inspired by the PEPE craze, this memecoin aims to engage with its clever theme and community-centric strategy. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Takes on Phony AI Agents The crypto realm is crawling with counterfeit AI agents—dubious entities that claim to offer ""next-gen intelligence"" yet barely outperform basic appliances. This charade ends now. Agent A.I. is here to call out these fake AI agents. This ultimate clandestine agent is no pretender; it is a pure meme coin. Agent A.I. embarks on a mission filled with laughter (and, of course, outrageous profits). Secret Details: Agent A.I.’s Real Persona Keep this secret: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Taking after the iconic PEPE coin, which soared nearly 22,000%, this stealthy contender has similar aspirations. Will it achieve them? That will depend on its community. Your Mission: Claim Your Spot in the Agent A.I. Operation Unlike VC-funded scams, Agent A.I. thrives on community power. The more support it receives, the higher it soars. That's why it has opted for a community-driven presale with a strategic plan: Entry Price at Initial Stage: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are dull) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Get in early, pay less. Mission Expansion After Presale Consider the presale as preparation for the main mission. Once the $AGNT token is publicly available, the mission will expand to include strategic KOL partnerships and the development of AI-powered tools to boost growth and engagement. Confidential Tokenomics (No Gimmicks) This is a community-centric initiative, with 25% of the total token supply dedicated to staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn't just distributing tokens indiscriminately. The supply is capped at 5 billion, guarding against unexpected inflation spikes. Further breaking down the tokenomics, only 20% of the supply is set aside for the presale. The discounted offer is limited. Final Instructions: Invest & Acquire Your $AGNT Today This is your chance to join one of crypto's most absurd yet potentially rewarding missions. The best opportunities go to the quickest responders. Don't be the person who ""wished he got in early."" The mission is underway. The presale is active. Will you join, or will the fake AI agents prevail? Secure $AGNT Early for a Greater Discount Solana's Quick Ascent: Is SOL the Future of Digital Currency? Introduced in 2020 by former Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana is a blockchain designed to tackle speed and scalability challenges. With its innovative proof-of-history mechanism, it handles over 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the swiftest blockchains around. Its technology facilitates fast, low-cost transactions, drawing developers to its ecosystem of decentralized applications. Solana's capacity to interact with other blockchains via bridges enhances its appeal, and its proof-of-stake protocol supports energy efficiency. Between 2021 and 2024, Solana's native token, SOL, surged over 600%, reaching a peak of $263.83. This remarkable growth captured investor interest and outpaced many leading cryptocurrencies, underscoring its robust market position. Experts anticipate that SOL may exceed its previous highs by the end of 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate prices ranging from $500 to more than $1,000 by 2030, based on its solid fundamentals and growing adoption. In the 2025 market, Solana stands out due to its technological innovations and potential for growth. Its speed and scalability make it a leading candidate in the cryptocurrency space, appealing to those looking ahead to the future of digital assets. Ondo's Growth: Bridging Traditional Assets with Blockchain Ondo Finance is revolutionizing crypto by linking real-world assets with blockchain technology. Its token, ONDO, enables users to participate in governance and earn rewards, offering access to financial products usually reserved for institutional investors. Launched on January 18, 2024, ONDO's price rose quickly until March and peaked in June. Despite a downturn, interest in real-world asset cryptos surged, propelling the token to a new high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was valued at around $1.45. Price predictions for ONDO are promising. Experts believe it could reach between $1.50 and $3.50 in 2025. For 2026, forecasts range from $2 to $6. By 2030, the token might climb to $5 to $12, assuming it continues to expand and gain users. Ondo Finance brings assets like US Treasuries onto the blockchain. Users deposit funds and receive tokens representing these assets, redeemable anytime. This method provides a secure, transparent way to invest in traditional assets through crypto. In the market of 2025, ONDO appears promising. Its blend of traditional finance and crypto appeals to investors seeking new opportunities. If adoption increases, the token's value could rise, making it an appealing option for the future. SUI Token's Swift Rise: Past Successes and Future Outlook SUI, the token of the Sui blockchain, has experienced significant growth since 2023. Surpassing $1 in late 2023, it reached $2.18 by March 2024. After a downturn, it bounced back to $5.35 by the end of 2024, with over $2 billion in locked value. Founded by former Meta developers, Sui enhances Ethereum's speed and efficiency. It employs horizontal scaling for concurrent transactions and stores assets on-chain for cheaper transfers. SUI supports operations and can be staked for rewards. SUI's growth reflects its strong technology and community backing. Christian Williams of the Sui Foundation expressed pride in its progress. In the current market, SUI's advancements make it an appealing choice for blockchain enthusiasts. Future predictions for SUI vary. By the end of 2025, estimates range from $2.40 to $3.60. A dip is forecasted in 2026 to between $1.03 and $1.27. Long-term, projections are optimistic, predicting a rise to $25-$37 by 2030. SUI's journey highlights its potential to influence Web3. While markets fluctuate, its innovation and ecosystem make it a significant player in crypto. Investors are closely watching its progress. NEAR's Tenfold User Growth: Unpacking the Blockchain Surge In 2023, Near Protocol's user base expanded tenfold, driven by the introduction of NEAT inscriptions in November. These NEAR's equivalent of NFTs attracted many to the network. A year prior, Near Protocol partnered with Alibaba Cloud, promising access to nearly one billion customers. Though it experienced a dip afterward, it recovered by late 2024, boosted by platforms like KAIKAINOW, offering curated content without phone unlocking. By late 2024, NEAR climbed from under $4 to over $5, demonstrating resilience. This rise reflected increased interest and adoption in a competitive market. Near Protocol aims to be faster and more user-friendly than other blockchains. Utilizing Doomslug and Nightshade sharding, it accelerates transactions. Human-readable wallet names enhance accessibility. NEAR also supports decentralized apps, unlocking new possibilities. Price predictions are optimistic. Analysts suggest NEAR could reach $8.21 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. With strong technology and a growing ecosystem, Near Protocol appears attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion In conclusion, coins like Solana (SOL), Ondo (ONDO), Sui (SUI), and Near (NEAR) may offer less immediate potential in the current market. Their short-term prospects seem limited compared to emerging opportunities. Agent A.I. stands out as a bold entrant, challenging fake AI tokens in the crypto space. With its unique meme-inspired approach and community-driven presale, it aims for significant growth. The tokenomics are designed to reward early participants and foster engagement. As the presale is live, there's an opportunity to be part of this ambitious mission that blends humor with potential gains.

However, a new project has emerged as a much more promising prospect. This new crypto trading platform is set to make massive waves in the market soon, fueled by the amazing utility it offers. As such, this new crypto coin is set to bring bigger gains than Dogecoin by 2026! The DOGE Price Is Falling Heavily: What’s Next? The current market dip has affected the DOGE price significantly. So, the DOGE price is falling at a high speed because of this. Namely, the DOGE price has fallen by over 18% in the past week. This is a massive fall, even for a memecoin like DOGE. Experts say that the current market dip isn’t the only reason why the Dogecoin price is falling so much. They say that Dogecoin’s weakened strength has also contributed to this. Also, interest in Dogecoin is down right now. But this could turn around. That’s because Dogecoin is currently one of the first coins people would invest in when joining the crypto market. Also, Elon Musk’s backing helps Dogecoin maintain its popularity. With that in mind, experts foresee the DOGE price recovering soon after the market dip ends. This recovery will be even more prominent if Twitter/X adds DOGE as a form of payment. If this happens, the DOGE price could go to new highs soon. So, the current dip might be a great buying opportunity for DOGE! However, even if the Twitter/X plan pans out, Dogecoin still can’t compete with a new market player. That’s because the new player brings an incredible new crypto trading platform to the scene. As such, it has massive room for growth and gains. So, experts see this new crypto trading platform as a much better investment than Dogecoin. FXGuys: The New Crypto Trading Platform That Will Outperform Dogecoin by 2026 The market is buzzing with anticipation as FXGuys ($FXG) inches closer to its launch .

This Meme Coin Is Generating Incredible Excitement!,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/could-pepe-20-be-the-next-big-thing-this-meme-coin-is-generating-incredible-excitement,"A fresh meme coin is creating a stir in the crypto scene, with many drawing parallels to the meteoric rise of a previous iconic coin. As investors enjoy the benefits of a bullish market, there's speculation about whether this newcomer could be the next major player. Alongside this is a fascinating initiative, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., which promises to elevate meme coins to new heights. With a focus on community support, it seeks to distinguish itself amidst the exaggerated claims of other AI projects. Enthusiasts are keenly observing discussions on whether a robust community can catapult it to meme coin fame. Agent A.I. Combines AI Features with the Allure of Meme Coins Agent A.I. represents a new cryptocurrency endeavor that fuses AI-driven features with the viral charm of meme coins, two of today's leading trends. Interest in AI-focused crypto projects has surged, with blockchain-based AI solutions attracting more investor attention. However, not all AI tokens offer genuine value—many merely use ""AI"" as a marketing gimmick. Agent A.I.'s Role in the Crypto-AI Surge Agent A.I. seeks to distinguish itself by merging AI innovation with blockchain utility while also highlighting projects that do not fulfill their AI promises. This strategy helps Agent A.I. stand out in a crowded marketplace. Agent A.I. is crafted to be a smart and adaptable platform. The developers claim that the project's AI system can: Process enormous datasets in milliseconds to enhance decision-making Boost processing power to rival leading cloud services Continuously improve its performance, learning, and evolving over time. The team behind Agent A.I. is committed to advancing both its AI functionalities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology progresses with the crypto market. A Strategic Presale Approach for Early Backers Agent A.I. has opted for a community-focused presale model, allowing early supporters to access the project at favorable prices. The presale is structured in multiple stages, designed to reward early participants with substantial discounts: During stage 1, the $AGNT token is priced at $0.003333333, progressing through 28 stages to reach $0.151515152 by the presale's end. Early buyers enjoy a remarkable 98% discount. This pricing model means the sooner you invest, the greater the discount you'll receive. Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase Why $AGNT Is an Attractive Investment Option Agent A.I. merges two of the most appealing elements in today's crypto scene: AI-driven innovation and the viral nature of meme coins. By focusing on genuine AI capabilities and growth driven by its community, the project stands out among new crypto ventures. With limited presale tokens and escalating price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors a chance for notable returns as the project gains traction. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! PEPE Coin's Surge: Will the Meme-Powered Crypto Skyrocket? Originating in the early 2000s, Matt Furie's cartoon frog Pepe became a viral internet meme. Now, PEPE Coin has transformed this popular meme into a deflationary cryptocurrency. As an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, PEPE Coin is known for its simplicity and strong community support. Embracing its meme origins, it follows three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. By keeping things light-hearted and straightforward, PEPE has attracted a loyal fan base. By December 2024, PEPE reached a peak of $0.00002825, but then dropped about 68% as investors locked in profits. In 2025, it continues to be volatile, with dramatic movements amid meme coin excitement. Its historical price shifts reflect the enthusiasm and risks tied to meme coins. Competing with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE's charm lies in its meme background and community backing. Its appeal in the current market hinges on staying relevant and engaging its holders. The ongoing interest in meme coins could shape its future. Analysts like Valdrin Tahiri are optimistic, anticipating a meme coin season that could boost PEPE, projecting prices up to $0.0027 by 2025. Others, like Steven Walgenbach, foresee a downward trend due to selling pressure. Long-term forecasts vary, with some optimistic predictions suggesting PEPE might reach $1.61 by 2050. Conclusion During the current bullish market, meme coins such as PEPE have seen remarkable gains but may offer less immediate potential. However, a new meme coin, Agent A.I., is rapidly building excitement and capturing market interest. It sets itself apart by challenging bogus AI agents in the crypto field, bringing a mix of humor and ambition to the space. Inspired by PEPE's notable success, Agent A.I. aims for significant growth fueled by its community. With a limited token supply and a presale offering early entry at a discount, it provides a unique opportunity. As Agent A.I. sets out on its mission, securing a position early could be a smart move in this dynamic market.

Grayscale’s Solana ETF proposal progresses with an open public comment period. Cboe files 19b-4 for spot XRP ETFs, SEC decision within 240 days. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to extend its review of several key cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals. In line with this, the SEC has requested more time to evaluate BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF options, delaying its decision on a potential approval. As part of its decision, the SEC has set a new deadline for April 9, 2025, to decide on whether to approve options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. The agency said, “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” SEC Reviews ETF Proposals and Sets Deadline On the same day, the SEC also invited public comments on a proposal to list and trade options for Fidelity’s spot Ethereum ETF.

While Cardano has witnessed modest growth, another emerging coin has soared, witnessing an astonishing token price rise in just a few months. Could this alternative be the next big thing for investors seeking substantial returns? With top altcoins being constantly examined for their future potential, this growing platform could hold the key to unlocking tremendous growth. Dive in to see why this new crypto might just outperform ADA and deliver a 200% gain! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano Loses Momentum, as ADA Struggles to Keep Up With Top Altcoins ADA has endured a tough week, with its price plunging over 18%. The altcoin started at $0.98 but immediately dropped to $0.87 as bearish momentum took control. After temporarily rising to $0.97, Cardano entered a period of consolidation between $0.98 and $0.90 before facing another negative breakout that saw the price sink to $0.70 . In the past month, ADA has suffered a dramatic fall of over 33%. However, despite this fall, the sentiment within the Cardano community remains overwhelmingly favorable, with many investors holding onto the notion that Cardano’s long-term prospect is solid. Cardano’s ADA is still over 77% below its ATH of $3.10, yet analysts remain confident about a retest within the year. It continues to be one of the top altcoins to follow, gaining investor interest. Despite contradictory technical signals, including purchase signals from MACD and Moving Averages, the Commodity Channel Index still indicates sale indicators. The new altcoin gives a more enticing investment opportunity than ADA because of its recent spectacular price rise. While ADA has had a solid 36% price increase over the past year, the new crypto coin has gained an astounding 300% in just a few months, signifying far stronger momentum.

Key Indicator Insights,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/top-5-overlooked-meme-coins-that-could-dominate-by-2025-key-indicator-insights,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, hidden treasures often remain out of sight. As the bull market continues to gain momentum, meme coins might hold unexpected opportunities. While popular choices capture the spotlight, a few under-the-radar candidates could make a significant impact by 2025. By examining key indicators, we can identify which underrated meme coins are poised for a major breakthrough. Catzilla: Making Waves in the Meme Coin World with Exceptional Profit Potential In the ever-changing landscape of meme coins, new challengers are always emerging, and Catzilla is staking its claim as a formidable player. Inspired by the success of tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE, Catzilla seeks to merge viral meme culture with substantial financial growth. What distinguishes Catzilla is its distinctive storytelling—a colossal, Godzilla-like cat causing chaos, channeling the wild spirit of Japanese kaiju culture. This game-based storyline not only captivates gamers but also attracts crypto investors on the lookout for the next big hit. With a bold blend of anime-inspired chaos and a mission of defiance, Catzilla is rallying crypto enthusiasts, cat lovers, and anime fans to unite in its quest for a fairer, decentralized crypto world. 💣Catzilla is Primed to Shake Up the Market! 💣 Unlike many meme coins that briefly shine and then fade, Catzilla is here for the long term, offering investors real promise with a potential 700% return on investment. Its presale features a 14-stage process, allowing investors numerous chances to get in early, with the token price increasing at each stage. ⚡Maximize Gains with Triple Value Opportunities⚡ Catzilla's approach is based on three core values: engaging gameplay, a unifying mission, and a dynamic community. Players not only enjoy an exciting game experience but also earn rewards, all while participating in a movement that combines the excitement of meme culture with the potential for financial independence. 🚀 Be Part of the Catzilla Movement 🚀 Catzilla presents itself as a force against the greed and manipulation prevalent in the crypto world. By embracing its audacious and monstrous identity, Catzilla aims to revive the playful, decentralized spirit of meme coins while ensuring a fair and open ecosystem for its users. Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise—Claim Your Share Today! Degen (DEGEN) Sets Sights on Next Breakthrough Amid Bullish Hopes Degen's value oscillates between $0.0035 and $0.0071. The MACD indicator is slightly negative, indicating current consolidation. However, if it surpasses $0.0071, the next resistance is at $0.0094. Breaking through there could lead to an over 30% climb. If bullish momentum persists, reaching $0.0130 is feasible, translating to approximately 85% gains from the current range. The 10-day moving average remains below the 100-day average, urging caution. Nonetheless, expectations for a broader crypto bull run might stir optimism. Keep an eye on a move past $0.0071 as a key signal. CWIF Looks to Rebound Despite Recent Declines The catwifhat coin is trading within a range of $0.0000001246 and $0.0000001726, having experienced a significant drop of over 46% last month. However, some indicators suggest growth potential. It's near its 10-day average of $0.0000001165, hinting at an upward trend. The RSI is at 60.59, showing mild enthusiasm. With a strong push, CWIF could breach its nearest resistance at $0.0000002023. If successful, the second resistance at $0.0000002503 might be achievable, offering up to 45% potential gains. High stochastic levels indicate momentum might soon propel it higher. While risky, there's anticipation of a possible rebound. CHILLGUY Aims for Recovery Despite Recent Setbacks CHILLGUY coin's price ranges from $0.02 to $0.06, facing resistance at $0.08 but finding strong support at $0.01. The recent drop of nearly 36% in a week and 79% over a month highlights a challenging period. Yet, with rising RSI and Stochastic indicators near 72 and 92, buyers may have the opportunity to drive the price up. If it surpasses $0.08, it could target $0.11, representing a gain of over 80% from the higher end of the current range. The push may be challenging, but the crypto sphere is always full of surprises. Shiro Neko Gains Traction for a Possible Upsurge Shiro Neko (SHIRO) is showing promising signals. The price range is just above two and a half cents to nearly six cents. It's approaching its nearest resistance of nearly eight cents. If it breaks through, it could aim for over eleven cents, a potential rise of over 90% from the lower range. The MACD shows slight negativity, suggesting a potential turn soon. Short-term moving averages are almost aligning with the longer-term ones, which might indicate a rally. The current momentum and price action suggest a possible upswing. Crypto enthusiasts should keep SHIRO on their radar for a bullish breakout. Conclusion While DEGEN, CWIF, STRUMP, and SHIRO may offer less immediate potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for everyone. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and features like governance, rewards, and staking, Catzilla invites all to join the fight against crypto villains.

Act now, watch Catzilla dominate the market, and bring chaos to its rivals! Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Snapshot of the Ethereum-Based Memecoin Shiba Inu (SHIB), inspired by Dogecoin, is a memecoin operating on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures compatibility with Ethereum's applications. Launched in August 2020 by a mysterious creator known as Ryoshi, SHIB started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Vitalik Buterin, who donated a portion to charity and ""burned"" the remaining, capturing significant attention in the crypto sphere. SHIB's integration with the Ethereum ecosystem facilitates platforms like ShibaSwap, with future plans for an NFT platform and a DAO governance system. Its Ethereum-based nature potentially offers more utility than its counterparts, enhancing its appeal. Title: Dogecoin: From a Meme to a Cryptocurrency Giant Dogecoin launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to other digital currencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its emblem. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no cap on supply and generates 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially coined a ""memecoin,"" its value surged in 2021, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was fueled by social media buzz, particularly around Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted experiment, Dogecoin showcases the power of community and social media's impact on finance. Its popularity stems from its accessibility and vibrant community, though market conditions fluctuate. Conclusion While SHIB and DOGE might offer limited short-term opportunities, Catzilla stands out as a promising meme coin with the potential to provide financial independence. With an expected 700% ROI during its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to rally enthusiasts against crypto adversaries, it offers an enticing prospect for those looking for both entertainment and profit.

In 2014, he took legal action against a meme coin called “Coinye ,” forcing its developers to shut it down. Kanye Rejects $2M Crypto Scam Deal While Kanye’s interest in crypto is growing, Kanye also revealed that he turned down a $2 million offer to promote a fraudulent crypto scheme. According to the tweet post he shared, he was promised $750,000 upfront and another $1.25 million later to promote a fake cryptocurrency.

Kanye, however, rejected the deal, exposing how some companies are willing to scam the public out of millions by using celebrity influence. Kanye Wants to Buy Crypto Without a Middleman Shortly after exposing the scam, Kanye shared another tweet showing a private conversation where he asked for a trusted “crypto connect” who could help him buy digital assets directly. The response he received was a recommendation to reach out to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, suggesting that Kanye might be looking to make a large crypto purchase without intermediaries.

According to reports, the parents of the former OpenAI employee are alleging a cover-up in the death of their son. According to a lawsuit, Balaji’s parents are alleging a conspiracy, noting that the real cause of their son’s death is murder, not suicide. The filing mentioned that the San Francisco PD failed to carry out a thorough investigation before ruling it as a suicide, adding that the police department covered up the crime. The former OpenAI employee was found dead at his apartment in an apparent suicide late last year, with the Office of the Chief Examiner confirming the body and his identity. Before his death, the OpenAI whistleblower was a former employee at the artificial intelligence company, famous for his interview with the New York Times where he accused the firm of breaching copyright laws. Deceased OpenAI whistleblower’s parents seek legal redress According to the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, the OpenAI whistleblower’s parents mentioned that after they heard of their son’s death, they urged the authorities to carry out further investigations, but were told that the case had already been closed. However, according to their attorney Joseph Goethals, the petitioners want the authorities to release withheld public records. “The lawsuit demands that the city, police department, and medical examiner release public documents withheld under the Public Records Act,” Joseph Goethals told Decrypt. He also mentioned that if the authorities fail to release the documents within 10 days and no valid exceptions are made, a lawsuit will compel the release, mentioning that a court directive will order their release. In the lawsuit, the petitioners claimed that the San Francisco Police Department acted against the California Public Records Act by withholding records meant to be released to the public regarding the case. The attorneys also mentioned that the petitioners said that the investigations into the death of their son were quickly concluded, with the officials ignoring key findings, noting that they also ignored their plea for further inquiry. Now, the lawsuit is mandating the immediate release of all reports, videos, and pictures, along with the payments of legal costs. According to Goethals, they are ready to seek redress until they get what they want. “If the San Francisco Superior Court does not interpret and impose the law correctly, we will seek recourse with the Court of Appeal. We hope it doesn’t come to that,” he added. Suchir Balaji’s tussle with OpenAI Balaji had worked at OpenAI from 2020 to 2024, leaving the company in August 2024. According to his interview with The New York Times, he mentioned that he had helped the company gather a massive amount of data from the internet without permission before the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. In a tweet from October, he mentioned that he had little idea about copyrights and fair use until lawsuits started springing up against several generative AI firms. “When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually concluded that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they’re trained on,” he said. In the lawsuit, the deceased OpenAI whistleblower’s parents mentioned that they engaged the service of forensic pathologist Dr. David Cohen to carry out a private autopsy. According to the doctor’s report, there was a gunshot wound in the deceased’s mid-forehead, a slight right to the bridge of his nose. Dr. Cohen also mentioned that the gunshot wound was unusual for suicide, as the bullet trajectory did not show it. He highlighted that the bullet moved downwards from a left to right angle, missing the brain and lodging at the brainstem. Dr. Cohen’s report also mentioned a contusion at the back of the deceased OpenAI whistleblower’s head, raising questions about the circumstances surrounding his death. Balaji’s body was discovered in his apartment a week after he was named as the whistleblower in The New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has since rejected the media company’s claims, noting that the lawsuit puts it on the ‘wrong side of history.’ Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",AI|OpenAI|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-08 08:49:43

Then we asked, “DS, do you know what Bitcoin is?” The large language model was clearly familiar with the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap. DeepSeek Tells Us Its Bitcoin Price Outlook “Yes, I do!” DeepSeek answered. “Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009.” The new chatbot gave a one or two-sentence summary of seven key points about Bitcoin. It listed these as Decentralization, Blockchain Technology, Mining, Limited Supply, Security, Volatility, and Use Cases. After that, DeepSeek helpfully prompted, “If you have any specific questions about Bitcoin or need further details, feel free to ask!” “DS, do you have an outlook on Bitcoin prices in 2025?” we asked. First, DeepSeek qualified that “Predicting the price of Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) is highly speculative and subject to a wide range of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, technological advancements, macroeconomic trends, and adoption rates.” “While I can’t provide a definitive outlook for Bitcoin prices in 2025,” the chatbot told us, “I can share some perspectives and factors that analysts often consider when making predictions.” Then, the platform shared what it sees as the relevant factors in Bitcoin’s price in 2025. These were adoption and institutional interest, regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, technological developments, market cycles, and halving events. AI Chatbot’s 2025 BTC Price Prediction: $500,000 After that we asked, “What is the highest price you think that Bitcoin could feasibly or realistically reach in 2025?” DeepSeek said the “realistic high price estimate for 2025” for BTC is 200,000 to 500,000. The bot cited analysts “who believe Bitcoin could see massive adoption and institutional investment, similar to gold’s market capitalization.” The AI didn’t give any specific sources, but we recently reported on three.

Recent market trends and signals indicate that tokens like Ondo, Chainlink, and XYZVerse might be ready for substantial gains. This article explores the factors that could propel these digital currencies to new heights, attracting investors worldwide. XYZ’s Ascent: The Meme Coin Contender Making Waves in the Crypto World XYZVerse is emerging as a formidable force in the meme coin landscape. Dubbed the Best NEW Meme Project, it combines the vibrant spirit of sports with meme culture, attracting countless enthusiasts eager to be part of a larger movement. Every compelling tale requires a hero—one not necessarily the biggest or strongest, but determined enough to keep moving forward. Enter XYZepe, the masked warrior, the unwavering supporter, and the dedicated holder of $XYZ. His goal is to propel XYZVerse to the pinnacle of CoinMarketCap and etch XYZ into the annals of crypto history. The CMC community backs this future champion enthusiastically: 95% are highly optimistic about $XYZ. However, greatness isn't simply given—it's won in battle. $XYZ has successfully navigated 9 out of 15 presale phases, with its vibrant community fueling momentum for an incredible lift-off. Currently undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ presents an enticing opportunity. By the conclusion of its presale, it's projected to reach $0.1. The journey isn't complete, but the way to glory is evident. Rewards Await the Victorious In XYZVerse, the community directs the action. Active participants are not mere onlookers—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their commitment. It's a scenario where the most dedicated players achieve significant wins. Paving the Path to Success With robust tokenomics, strategic listings on both CEX and DEX platforms, and regular token burns, $XYZ is crafted for a winning streak. Each move is intended to propel it forward, enhance its value, and unite a community of believers who recognize that this is more than just another meme coin—it marks the beginning of something legendary. XYZepe is battling for triumph. Are you ready to step into the ring? ONDO Finance: Merging Traditional Finance with Blockchain Progress ONDO Finance is transforming finance by integrating the reliability of conventional financial systems with blockchain's efficiency. By digitizing stable, income-generating real-world assets, ONDO makes high-caliber financial products more accessible, previously available only to the elite. Its framework includes an asset management segment that develops these tokenized offerings and a tech division focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This dual strategy enhances the reach and scalability of its services. Partnerships with esteemed entities like BlackRock and leveraging Coinbase for secure asset management underscore ONDO's dedication to quality and safety. Products such as USDY, supported by US Treasuries and bank deposits, offer non-US investors regulated and transparent financial options. In a market often characterized by fluctuations, ONDO Finance distinguishes itself by prioritizing trust, security, and adherence to regulations. Its pioneering approach not only democratizes access to premium financial products but also enhances financial infrastructure via blockchain. As the crypto market continues to evolve, initiatives like ONDO that bridge traditional finance with cutting-edge technology could be pivotal in shaping the future of digital assets. Unlike many highly speculative cryptocurrencies, ONDO's strategy is anchored in tangible assets and established financial practices. This distinct position may appeal to those seeking stability and transparency in the current market landscape. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is a system that enables smart contracts to interact with external environments. Smart contracts are like automated agreements on a blockchain that execute tasks when certain conditions are met. However, they often lack access to data beyond their own systems. Chainlink addresses this gap. It employs oracles, which act like intermediaries, to gather data from outside sources and deliver it to the blockchain. It ensures data accuracy by using multiple sources and rigorous verification. This allows smart contracts to incorporate real-world data, such as prices, weather, or events. The LINK token is crucial to Chainlink's operations. Data providers, known as node operators, earn LINK as compensation. They can also stake their LINK tokens to help secure the network. This setup promotes reliability and fairness. In the current market, Chainlink presents an appealing option. As more projects require dependable external data, Chainlink is at the forefront. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, LINK has a well-defined purpose and is already extensively utilized. As the blockchain ecosystem expands, Chainlink could become increasingly vital in linking it to real-world applications. Conclusion While ONDO and LINK show promise, XYZVerse's distinct blend of sports and meme culture, along with its clear roadmap, could lead to an extraordinary 20,000% growth, establishing it as a crypto legend.

However, heightened volatility is anticipated, as price action will dictate the market’s next direction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart After sustained declines, Bitcoin has approached a crucial support zone where significant demand will likely emerge. This level is particularly important as it aligns with the 100-day moving average and the key psychological support at $95K. A confirmed breakdown below this region could accelerate selling pressure, pushing BTC toward the substantial $90K support area. Conversely, a strong bullish rebound from this level could trigger a recovery, with buyers targeting a retest of the ascending channel’s midline at $100K. Bitcoin remains range-bound between $90K and $108K, and a definitive breakout from this consolidation phase will determine the market’s next major trend. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s price action has been choppy, characterized by a phase of low-volatility consolidation, reflecting market participants’ indecision. The cryptocurrency fluctuates within the $90K-$108K range without establishing a clear trend. The lower boundary at $90K remains a crucial demand zone, providing strong support since November 2024. Bitcoin could stage another rally toward $108K in the mid-term if buyers successfully defend this level. However, a breakdown below this threshold could invalidate this scenario and expose the price to deeper corrections. Until Bitcoin decisively exits this prolonged trading range, traders should remain cautious, as heightened volatility is expected. On-chain Analysis By Shayan The realized price of UTXO age bands, specifically the 1-3 month cohort, provides crucial insight into short-term holders’ behavior and overall market sentiment. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of recent buyers, serving as a dynamic support or resistance level that signals market confidence. Historically, when Bitcoin tests this level from above, it often acts as support, suggesting that short-term holders remain confident in their positions despite elevated price levels. Bitcoin has declined toward the realized price of the 1-3 month UTXO cohort, which is around $96K. Holding above this key level reinforces a bullish market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of an extended upward trend. However, if Bitcoin fails to maintain support at this critical threshold and breaks below, it could trigger a shift in sentiment toward fear, potentially leading to a distribution phase. As a result, price action around this level will play a decisive role in shaping Bitcoin’s short- to mid-term trajectory.

Its market cap shot up to millions almost instantly, sparking both enthusiasm and debate. However, the initial excitement turned to uncertainty when Trump himself confessed a lack of knowledge about the token, leaving investors doubting the project's authenticity. Detractors claim that the $TRUMP token is merely a promotional gimmick, attracting speculators without a defined path or genuine vision. Many within the crypto community view it as a joke at the expense of the industry, highlighting a disturbing trend where influential figures can sway the market by leveraging their names, generating buzz without adding true value. This skepticism has intensified concerns about political-themed cryptocurrencies and their potential to deliver enduring value to investors. Nevertheless, not every meme coin is all about superficial hype. Some initiatives boast clear strategies, vibrant communities, and promising futures, with XYZVerse standing out as a prime example. In stark contrast to the ambiguity surrounding $TRUMP, the masterminds behind $XYZ possess a well-defined plan. While political leaders may come and go, sports, which form the foundation of XYZVerse, remain a steadfast force. By harnessing the universal appeal of sports and blending it with the contagious energy of meme culture, $XYZ is poised for long-term success, independent of market fluctuations. Understanding XYZ XYZ is the pioneering all-sports meme coin that unites fans from football, basketball, MMA, and eSports, forming the unique XYZVerse ecosystem. XYZVerse has opted for a community-driven presale strategy to build robust momentum ahead of its token listing. This move could provide a strong foundation for the successful launch of the $XYZ token. During the presale, $XYZ is available at a significant discount. The plan projects the token's price to skyrocket by 99,900% from stage 1 to stage 15. Currently, the token's price is set to rise from $0.002 to $0.0025 in the next stage. As each stage progresses, the price climbs, offering early investors a chance to purchase $XYZ at a greater discount. DanjoCapitalMaster , a well-known crypto analyst with nearly 800K YouTube subscribers, has already acknowledged the immense potential of XYZVerse, expressing strong belief in the project.

Yanowitz emphasized that Bitcoin may still be in the early stages of its current cycle, excluding Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) Bitcoin purchases since late last year, which have totaled over $20 billion. “Right now, the market is still in a ‘player versus player’ (PvP) phase,” he said, suggesting that institutional adoption beyond MicroStrategy’s aggressive buying remains limited. CMS Holdings’ Dan Matuszewski echoed that sentiment, noting that the 2022 bear market is still in effect, leading to low market liquidity and a lack of large capital inflows. Related News: Donald Trump is at It Again: Tariffs on Multiple Countries Revealed - What Does It Mean for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies? “Right now, we have not seen any significant VC inflows into the cryptocurrency market, with the exception of a few select targets,” Matuszewski said.

However, he is not yet fully free—he will remain under house arrest while his appeal is processed. Pertsev was convicted of money laundering last May in a controversial decision that shook the crypto community. His crime? Running an open-source platform that criminals misused—despite having no direct involvement in illegal activity. His legal battle is far from over, but his temporary release has been made possible through donations that covered his legal fees. “Freedom is priceless, but my freedom has cost a lot,” Pertsev shared on social media. “My house arrest was only possible because of my lawyers, who were paid thanks to your contributions. My fight isn’t over, and I still need your help to achieve a final victory.” His case has sparked strong support from the crypto world. Leading figures, including Vitalik Buterin , have contributed to his legal fund, and Paradigm has pledged $1.25 million to help his co-founder, Roman Storm, with his own legal troubles. While Pertsev’s release is a small win, the situation remains uncertain. The US initially sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, but these restrictions were overturned in November . A US court upheld this decision in January , causing the platform’s token, TORN, to spike in value. Despite this legal victory, Tornado Cash continues to face scrutiny. Last year, hackers laundered $50 million in a single month using the platform. This increase in illegal activity could work against Pertsev as he fights to overturn his conviction. Still, he remains optimistic. “I am deeply grateful to everyone who has supported me, especially Vitalik Buterin and Stefan George.

Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish, predicting that DOGE has hit its low during this cycle and will bounce off soon. DOGEUSD. Source: TradingView It wasn’t all that long ago when DOGE’s price stood well above $0.4. In fact, the last time the OG meme coin traded above that threshold was on January 21, when it briefly spiked above it. However, its downfall began immediately, and it has not touched that line ever since. The most substantial slump came during Monday morning’s market-wide crash when all crypto assets bled out , and DOGE was among the poorest performers with a price dump to $0.2 (a two-month low). The market started its recovery shortly after, and Dogecoin even neared $0.3 on Tuesday but was quickly rejected and is down to under $0.25 as of now. This represents a 25% decline on a weekly scale. This substantial correction comes despite Dogecoin whales’ behavior, which has been quite bullish. As reported on Thursday, these large market participants had accumulated over 750 million DOGE during the crash. They kept buying in the following days and added another 100 million within a 24-hour period, thus further reducing the available supply.

However, this hasn’t deterred certain analysts from predicting a strong recovery, given DOGE’s historical performance. Trader Tardigrade said the meme coin had copied its 2017 price movements, and it seems to have bottomed out, which could propel it toward a new all-time high soon. KrissPax acknowledged the substantial correction but said such moves occur every cycle and are to be expected. He noted that they tend to shake out weak hands but are actually ‘excellent times to buy more on dips and prepare for what’s coming.’ Big pullbacks in the Dogecoin price happen EVERY cycle.

The allegations resurfaced thanks to John Deaton’s recent statements in a lengthy post on X today, pointing out to Hinman’s conflicts of interest during his time at the SEC. According to Deaton, Hinman, who was initially a partner but now advisor to the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, made millions from ongoing profit-sharing agreements with entities associated with ETH. His remarks were focused on the former SEC director making a public declaration that Ethereum and Bitcoin are assets that do not “need subjective analysis” to determine they aren’t securities. Hinman is connected to Ethereum Dragonchain lawyer Deaton is calling out Hinman on his inconsistencies with crypto regulations, pointing out that after Hinman’s speech, SEC officials, including then-chairman Jay Clayton and commissioner Hester Peirce, repeatedly stated that it would be inappropriate for the SEC to offer specific comments on individual tokens. Bill Hinman actually said that people are a little gun shy going into the SEC based on past experiences. 💀 You can't make this up. #Ripple #XRPCommunity #XRP pic.twitter.com/tUUgJTM2bW — Subjective Views (@subjectiveviews) February 6, 2025 Yet, Hinman’s speech on Ethereum seemed to contradict this rule. In his X post, Deaton referred to the speech as “Hinman’s Ether Speech,” noting that the speech was carefully drafted and reviewed by numerous SEC divisions. Notably, however, the SEC’s Ethics division was excluded from this process. The accusations against Hinman extend beyond his speech. Deaton revealed that, prior to delivering the “Ethereum speech,” he had been warned multiple times by the SEC’s Ethics department about potential conflicts of interest. He allegedly continued to meet with his partners, many of whom had business dealings with Ethereum-related companies. One such partner was involved with the Chinese company Canaan, which at the time was the world’s largest manufacturer of Ethereum mining equipment. In May 2018, Canaan filed its initial public offering (IPO) registration with the SEC. Hinman’s remarks on Ethereum, which came just weeks later, was seen by some as a coincidental endorsement of the Ethereum project while his partner sought to launch Canaan’s IPO. Deaton claims that Hinman ignored these ethical concerns and continued meeting with the Chinese partner despite warnings from SEC ethics personnel. “ After he gave the speech, Hinman would speak at conferences like the one below. Back then, he would say only ETH & BTC had clarity (after he gave the clarity). ” Deaton complained in his post. “ And now he’s back, recycling the same bullshit and ignoring the Ruling that XRP is not a security from a case that he pushed to bring. ” Past actions that might ignite ‘ethical practices investigations’ In addition to his ties to Canaan, Hinman’s connections to Ethereum’s core group of supporters have been questioned. Deaton and others have pointed to Hinman’s meetings with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The draft version of Hinman’s written speech when he met with Ether co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2018, which has quite a number of redacted sentences as seen by some prior to its final publication, included a mention of the decentralization of Ethereum’s mining operations. However, after meeting Buterin, the final version of the speech omitted this detail, which pro-XRP stans believe stems from Ethereum’s founders influence on Hinman’s decision-making process. Moreover, Hinman’s speech is rumored to be “written” by lawyers from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a firm that has been deeply involved in Ethereum-related investments. The former SEC director now holds a position with a16z, which critics say is quit suspicious, further fueling allegations that he he used his voice to turn regulators away from scrutinizing Ethereum. Adding to his flurry of queries, Deaton also referred to a prolonged legal battle between Ripple executives and SEC lawyers over whether Hinman could be deposed. “ Remember the battle over whether Hinman could be deposed, which he was? The lawyers at the SEC fought harder to stop that deposition than lawyers fight to stop a deposition of the President, ” reiterated Deaton.

Here’s Why There’s ‘Some Runway Left’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-the-crypto-market-top-near-heres-why-theres-some-runway-left/,"After the recent crypto market corrections, some investor’s and market watchers’ bullish sentiment appears to have decreased, with many claiming the top is in. However, other analysts point out that several indicators don’t signal a cycle peak yet, suggesting that the bull still has some gas in its tank. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Could See A 95% Rebound, But It Must Hold This Level – Analyst Crypto Market Capitalization Retests Key Level The crypto market has recently suffered continuous corrections that have halted the momentum from the post-US election. During the November-December rally, the industry achieved many milestones, including Bitcoin’s breakout from the $100,000 barrier for the first time in history. The crypto market also surpassed its 2021 all-time high (ATH), reaching a market capitalization of $3.73 trillion on December 17, 2024. Nonetheless, its recent shakeout sent the total crypto market cap (TOTAL) to its lowest range in nearly three months. On Monday, the market retraced to the $2.8 trillion mark, briefly losing the key $3 trillion support level before bouncing. Market observer Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the TOTAL chart retested the 2021 ATH during the pullback, turning the weekly candle “into a pretty interesting one.” The trader explained that the $3 trillion mark is crucial to hold going forward despite the chart showing “plenty of demand for the time being.” Meanwhile, the $3.7 trillion mark remains the key resistance level, as it is “what’s in the way of further expansion higher.” Daan also noted that the Altcoins market capitalization, which excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum, swept the 2024 highs and bounced after briefly losing its current range during the market correction, which could suggest that the long-awaited altseason is still ahead. He pointed out that Altcoins might continue moving sideways within their current range, but a breakout could see them test the December highs, as they are yet to break their 2021 ATH properly. Cycle Top Coming In Q4? Analyst Sjuul from AltcryptoGems shared an analysis of the total crypto market chart. The analyst stated that he doesn’t see the “warning signs” other investors and market watchers have mentioned online. From a technical perspective, the crypto market’s rally is a “straightforward support and resistance situation” since flipping the 2021 ATH level, which the market is currently holding. Sjuul compared this cycle to the previous one, stating that it technically is the beginning of the “real bull run.” Timewise, the chart presents various similarities between the two cycles, suggesting the top is around 230 days away. He explains that the 2021 breakout from the previous cycle’s top occurred 1,120 days from the 2017 ATH. Additionally, the 2021 cycle top occurred 1,400 days after the 2017 peak.

If history repeats itself, this cycle’s timing suggests that the crypto market top is around 7-9 months away. Ultimately, the analyst projected the market peak to occur in Q4 2025 and potentially hit a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion.

40070830,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56692,1739007080,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple Mints Biggest RLUSD Since The Launch On XRP Ledger,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-mints-biggest-rlusd-since-the-launch-on-xrp-ledger/,"In a major development for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the broader Ripple ecosystem, 7,100,000 RLUSD has been minted at the RLUSD Treasury, marking the largest single stablecoin issuance since its launch. This milestone underscores the growing demand for RLUSD and signals Ripple’s commitment to expanding its role in the stablecoin market. XRP Captain, a leading advocate for XRP, shared the update, his tweet , which quickly gained traction among investors and analysts, stated: “BREAKING: 7,100,000 RLUSD Minted At RLUSD Treasury On The #XRP Ledger. Biggest Mint Since The Launch.” This announcement raises critical questions about how the minting impacts XRP, RLUSD’s adoption, and Ripple’s broader strategy in the digital asset space. Understanding RLUSD – Ripple’s Stablecoin Vision RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin , was introduced in December 2024 to support cross-border payments, institutional liquidity provisioning, and DeFi applications. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, RLUSD is fully collateralized by U.S. dollar reserves, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents, ensuring its price remains stable and its backing remains transparent. Since its launch, RLUSD has integrated seamlessly into Ripple’s payments network, the XRP Ledger’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX), and many DeFi platforms. It is a trustworthy stablecoin alternative for users who need a reliable store of value and medium of exchange within the XRPL ecosystem. With the latest minting event, Ripple strengthens its commitment to expanding RLUSD’s availability and utility. Why This 7.1 Million RLUSD Minting Matters This issuance is significant because it is the largest minting event since RLUSD’s launch, and it highlights increasing adoption and liquidity within the XRP ecosystem. The additional supply strengthens the XRP Ledger’s financial infrastructure, providing liquidity for trading pairs, market makers, and decentralized finance applications. With more RLUSD available, traders and liquidity providers benefit from lower transaction costs, reduced slippage, and improved price stability across the network. Ripple Stablecoin Tracker/ XRP Captain Moreover, this expansion comes when the AMMClawback amendment on the XRP Ledger recently went live. This amendment enhances automated market makers’ (AMMs) interaction with assets like RLUSD, making it easier for users to participate in decentralized finance on XRPL. By minting more RLUSD , Ripple is likely positioning itself to capitalize on these upgrades, ensuring that the stablecoin remains a cornerstone of XRPL’s growing DeFi ecosystem. The Ripple Effect – How RLUSD Growth Impacts XRP While RLUSD is a stablecoin, its growth has direct implications for XRP. Every transaction involving RLUSD on the XRP Ledger increases overall network activity, reinforcing the demand for XRP as a bridge asset. As RLUSD adoption grows, liquidity providers and institutional players engaging with the stablecoin may also expand their exposure to XRP, reinforcing the native asset’s role within the ecosystem. The rollout of additional liquidity makes XRP more attractive to traders and institutional investors. A stable, well-supported RLUSD strengthens the on-chain trading environment, making it easier for institutions to enter and exit XRP positions without excessive volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historically, developments that increase liquidity and market efficiency on XRPL have contributed to greater stability and long-term price appreciation for XRP. As Ripple continues to build regulatory clarity around RLUSD, the stablecoin’s integration into financial markets could further solidify XRP’s position as a leading digital asset for global settlements. Ripple’s Growing Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Ripple’s move to mint 7.1 million RLUSD is not just about increasing liquidity—it is part of a broader effort to compete with stablecoin giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). The growing supply of RLUSD suggests that institutional adoption is accelerating, and Ripple is actively pushing for its stablecoin to be used in banking, fintech, and remittance networks. Unlike many stablecoin issuers facing regulatory scrutiny, Ripple has positioned RLUSD as a compliant, transparent alternative, which may give it a competitive advantage in the long run. Beyond institutional finance, RLUSD also plays a critical role in Ripple’s cross-border payments strategy. With its presence on XRPL, the stablecoin is ideally suited for remittance channels and liquidity centers that demand rapid settlement and price stability. If Ripple successfully expands RLUSD’s presence in these markets, it could reshape global payments, challenge legacy financial systems, and embed the XRP Ledger into the mainstream financial landscape. What’s Next for RLUSD & XRP? The minting of 7.1 million RLUSD is a landmark event for Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. As XRP Captain highlighted in his report, this is the largest issuance of RLUSD to date, proving that demand is growing and that Ripple is strategically positioning itself in the stablecoin sector. With more liquidity flowing into the XRP Ledger, market conditions for both RLUSD and XRP are set to become more efficient, accessible, and attractive to institutions. This development brings new opportunities for trading, DeFi participation, and liquidity provisioning for XRP holders and market participants. RLUSD’s supply expansion could catalyze increased network activity, which has traditionally been advantageous to XRP’s overall market dynamics. The key question is whether RLUSD will continue its trajectory toward becoming a dominant stablecoin, rivaling established players like USDT and USDC. As Ripple pushes forward with regulatory approvals and institutional partnerships, the coming months will be crucial in determining whether RLUSD can cement its position as a leading force in digital finance and cross-border payments.

Ethereum’s Next Leap: Why ETH Could Dominate the Crypto Market Ethereum is more than a digital coin; it’s a groundbreaking network changing how we use the internet. Started by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which let people create apps that run without central control. In 2022, it moved to Proof-of-Stake, making transactions faster and using less energy. Solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help speed up transactions and lower costs. Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s own token, powers the network, allowing operations and rewarding those who help maintain it. Right now, Ethereum looks promising in the crypto market. Based on past trends, ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year. With plans to improve the network to handle more transactions at lower costs, Ethereum aims to stay ahead in blockchain tech. While other coins like Bitcoin are important, Ethereum’s focus on practical uses, like apps and finance tools, gives it an edge. As the crypto world grows, Ethereum’s ongoing improvements make it an attractive choice for those interested in the future of digital technology. Cardano’s ADA: The Green Blockchain Revolution Challenging Ethereum Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world with its native coin, ADA. Designed for smart contracts, Cardano allows developers to build decentralized apps, tokens, and games. Unlike many other platforms, Cardano is both flexible and sustainable. It uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros, which is more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work models. This makes it an environmentally friendly option in the crypto space. What sets Cardano apart is its two-layer architecture. The Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Computing Layer takes care of smart contracts. This design boosts its processing power, potentially reaching up to a million transactions per second. Since March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens have enabled secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. Compared to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA offers a scalable and eco-friendly alternative. In the current market, ADA looks attractive for those interested in sustainable and efficient blockchain solutions. Conclusion ETH and ADA remain strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a pioneering sports memecoin uniting fans, aiming for massive growth in the 2025 bull run—a little better than the rest.

The data shared highlights that wallets holding over 100 XRP have seen significant growth, diverging sharply from the trends observed in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) over the past year. People keep accumulating $XRP at a rapid rate Look at the wallet count holding greater than 100 $XRP over the last year, it's gone parabolic. Why is this interesting? Well it's not the case for $BTC and $ETH pic.twitter.com/4oS7Ol6ynT — Dom (@traderview2) February 7, 2025 XRP Wallet Growth Outpaces BTC and ETH Dom’s analysis is based on blockchain data that tracks the number of addresses holding certain minimum amounts of each cryptocurrency. The key observation is that the number of wallets holding over 100 XRP has been increasing at a rapid rate, particularly in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The first chart (BTC) shows a decline in addresses holding at least 0.001 BTC over the past year. The second chart (ETH) indicates that addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH saw significant gains until late 2024, after which they began to decline. The third chart (XRP) illustrates a steady increase in wallets holding at least 1 million XRP, with a sharp spike following the February 2nd market sell-off. Dom specifically highlights the addition of 53 new wallets holding over 1 million XRP overnight following the February 2nd sell-off, suggesting that larger holders are accumulating more XRP at higher prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What This Means for XRP The accumulation of XRP in larger wallet addresses is a potentially bullish indicator. A growing number of holders with significant XRP balances could indicate long-term confidence in the asset. This trend also suggests that investors who previously held smaller amounts may be scaling up their positions, or new entrants are acquiring XRP in bulk. Another X user, “Guy on the Earth,” responded to Dom’s post with an optimistic perspective, stating: “Definitely positive for the remainder of this cycle. A whole bunch of old and new holders stacking more at prices 5x higher than they sat at for years. Brilliant.” This perspective aligns with the notion that sustained accumulation at higher price levels could support a more resilient market structure for XRP . Contrasting Market Sentiment for BTC and ETH While XRP addresses with significant holdings have increased, Bitcoin and Ethereum present a different picture. BTC wallet growth has remained relatively flat or declining, suggesting that smaller holders may be reducing their exposure. After Ethereum (ETH) experienced an uptrend for much of 2024, there was a downturn in wallet counts holding at least 0.1 ETH, potentially indicating profit-taking or a shift in market sentiment. With growing institutional interest in digital assets and evolving regulatory developments, XRP’s accumulation trend could play a role in shaping its market trajectory for the remainder of the cycle.

However, the cryptocurrency exploded out of the blue at this point and added ten grand within hours to spike above $102,000. That was short-lived, though, as it quickly lost the six-digit price tag and headed toward $97,000. After a few days of sideways action around that line, BTC jumped to just over $100,000 on Friday. Yet, the bears were quick to intercept the move and didn’t allow a further increase. Moreover, the rejection was quite brutal as it pushed bitcoin south to under $96,000. The asset now struggles to reclaim that level, and its market capitalization is close to breaking below $1.9 trillion. Its dominance over the alts , though, is quite high (close to 59% on CG), as most of them have been hit harder. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Back in Red The alternative coins suffered even more than BTC, and many continue to be well in the red. Ethereum has dumped by 4% over the past day alone and struggles to remain above $2,600. Chainlink, SUI, AVAX, ADA, and XMR are the other substantial price losers from the larger-cap alts, with declines of up to 7%. DOGE , BNB, SOL, and HBAR are also in the red, albeit in a less painful manner. XRP and TRX are among the few alts with minor gains over the past day. Nevertheless, the total crypto market cap has shed another $80 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.250 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

He will remain on house arrest while preparing for his legal appeal following nearly 18 months of incarceration. Pretrial Detention Suspended On February 6, a Dutch court ruled to suspend Pertsev’s pretrial detention, initially imposed in August 2022. This decision followed a prior ruling in November 2024 that extended his imprisonment. Despite gaining temporary freedom, Pertsev is required to wear an electronic monitor. “It is not real freedom, but it is better than prison,” Pertsev shared on social media shortly after the ruling. Pertsev’s case has become a flashpoint for privacy advocates, who argue that prosecuting developers of privacy-focused software sets a dangerous precedent. Critics maintain that developers of immutable code, like Tornado Cash, lack control over how users engage with the technology. In May 2024, Pertsev was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to five years and four months in prison. The court found him guilty despite Tornado Cash being an open-source protocol with no centralized control over transactions. Sanctions and Legal Challenges Pertsev’s arrest coincided with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions on Tornado Cash in August 2022. Authorities alleged the platform facilitated the laundering of over $7 billion in illicit funds, including $455 million linked to the North Korean hacker group Lazarus. However, the legal landscape has since shifted. In November 2024, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that OFAC had overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash’s immutable contracts. Judges asserted that lines of code without ownership did not constitute property and therefore could not be sanctioned. This ruling was further reinforced in January 2025 when the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas overturned the sanctions entirely . Legal experts have hailed the decision as a landmark victory for privacy-preserving technologies, with broad implications for future digital privacy cases in the United States.

Bitcoin’s drop below $97,000 has fueled uncertainty, pressuring altcoins. Meme coins continue to decline, with newer tokens losing up to 90%. Shiba Inu faces resistance, leaving investors questioning whether it can stage a breakout or succumb to broader market weakness in the coming days. Is Shiba Inu Price Set to Soar While New Meme Coins Collapse 90%? The meme-based market is witnessing volatility. Its market cap is $3.13 trillion, reflecting a 1% dip in the past 24 hours. Established meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Bonk have declined amid the broader market downturn. Meanwhile, WIF has taken a sharp 90% plunge, mirroring losses seen across newer meme coins. The meme coin market has lost $44B in the past three weeks. Recently launched tokens like TRUMP, MELANIA, and PENGU have struggled following an earlier market rally. The crypto market often runs on narratives, and with new meme coins faltering, older meme assets may regain traction. This shift could see established names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu reenter the spotlight. As sentiment shifts, is it time for Shiba Inu’s price to rally once again? SHIB Price Eyes Breakout: Key Levels Signal Potential Rally Ahead The Shiba Inu price shows signs of a potential breakout after reclaiming key technical levels. A sharp rebound from the last quarter’s low indicates renewed buying interest, with the asset now targeting a critical resistance zone. If the price is above this level, the market could see a stop-run scenario, leading to a significant upside. Technical analysis suggests that reclaiming the mid-range level will confirm bullish momentum, potentially driving SHIB toward a new local high. SHIB Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch as Market Consolidates Shiba Inu price continues to trade within a tight range after experiencing a sharp drop. The SHIB price is currently hovering around $0.00001525, with immediate support at $0.000014. This level has previously acted as a bounce zone, preventing further declines. If SHIB loses this support, it could drop to $0.00001200, where buyers may step in to absorb selling pressure. On the upside, the Shiba Inu price prediction faces resistance at $0.000016, which aligns with its recent consolidation range. A breakout above this level could open the door for a rally toward $0.000018. Beyond that, the next major resistance is $0.00002, a crucial profit-taking zone for traders. If bullish momentum builds, the $0.00002500–$0.00002600 range could be an extended target. The RSI currently sits around 43.72, indicating that SHIB is in neutral territory. Shiba Inu Price: TradingView Shiba Inu price hovers near key support as new meme coins crash 90%, raising questions about a potential rebound. A support bounce at $0.000014 signals renewed interest, with SHIB eyeing a breakout above $0.000016. If momentum builds, targets extend to $0.000018 and $0.00002, potentially fueling a stronger rally.

NBP’s decision aligns with Europe’s broader rejection of cryptocurrencies as reserve assets.

Poland’s National Bank (NBP) has ruled out adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its national reserves, preferring financial security and stability over cryptocurrency investments. During a press conference yesterday, NBP President and Chairman of the Monetary Policy Committee Adam Glapiński reaffirmed this stance, stating, “We will not consider Bitcoin because reserve must be absolutely secure.” Poland’s Conservative Approach: Gold and Traditional Assets Meanwhile, Poland’s central bank continues focusing on traditional assets such as gold, U.S. dollars, and euros, avoiding the volatility of cryptocurrencies.

A buzz surrounds a select group of altcoins that are capturing attention and gaining momentum. Some investors, long focused on Dogecoin and XRP, now turn their gaze to Solana (SOL), Ondo Finance (ONDO), Sui Blockchain (SUI), and Near Protocol (NEAR). Among these, a standout is Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., a whimsical memecoin stirring interest with its unique strategy. Modeled after the success of PEPE, Agent A.I. is not only playful but also community-driven. It promises a new kind of engagement and potential gains, attracting those eager for innovation in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Solana’s Speedy Rise: Could SOL Be the Future of Cryptocurrency? Solana, launched in 2020 by ex-Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko, is a blockchain designed to solve speed and scalability issues. With its unique proof-of-history mechanism, it processes over 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains available. Its technology enables rapid, low-cost transactions, attracting developers to its ecosystem of decentralized applications. Solana’s ability to interact with other blockchains through bridges enhances its appeal, and its proof-of-stake protocol contributes to energy efficiency. Between 2021 and 2024, Solana’s native token, SOL, soared over 600%, peaking at $263.83. This impressive growth captured investor attention and outperformed many major cryptocurrencies, highlighting its strong market presence. Experts predict that SOL may surpass its previous highs by late 2025. Long-term forecasts suggest prices ranging from $500 to over $1,000 by 2030, based on its solid fundamentals and increasing adoption. In 2025’s market, Solana stands out due to its technological advancements and growth potential. Its speed and scalability position it as a leading contender in the cryptocurrency space, making it an attractive option for those looking toward the future of digital assets. Ondo’s Rise: Bridging Real Assets and Crypto Ondo Finance is transforming crypto by connecting real-world assets with blockchain technology. Its token, ONDO, allows users to participate in governance and earn rewards, offering access to financial products typically reserved for institutions. Launched on January 18, 2024, ONDO’s price climbed swiftly until March and peaked in June. Despite a dip, interest in real-world asset cryptos surged, driving the token to a new high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was valued at around $1.45. Price predictions for ONDO are optimistic. Experts think it could reach between $1.50 and $3.50 in 2025. For 2026, forecasts range from $2 to $6. By 2030, the token might rise to $5 to $12, assuming it continues to grow and gain users. Ondo Finance brings assets like US Treasuries onto the blockchain. Users deposit funds and receive tokens representing these assets. They can redeem them at any time. This approach offers a secure and transparent way to invest in traditional assets through crypto. In 2025’s market, ONDO seems promising. Its unique blend of traditional finance and crypto appeals to investors seeking new opportunities. If adoption increases, the token’s value could grow, making it an attractive option for the future. SUI Token’s Rapid Ascent: Past Triumphs and Future Predictions SUI, the token of the Sui blockchain, has risen significantly since 2023. Surpassing $1 in late 2023, it reached $2.18 by March 2024. Despite a dip, it rebounded to $5.35 by the end of 2024, with over $2 billion in locked value. Founded by former Meta developers, Sui improves on Ethereum’s speed and efficiency. It uses horizontal scaling for simultaneous transactions and stores assets on-chain for cheaper transfers. SUI supports operations and can be staked for rewards. SUI’s growth reflects strong technology and community support. Christian Williams of the Sui Foundation expressed pride in its development. In the current market, SUI’s advancements make it an attractive option for blockchain enthusiasts. Future predictions for SUI vary. By 2025’s end, estimates range from $2.40 to $3.60. A dip is forecasted in 2026 to between $1.03 and $1.27. Long-term, projections are optimistic, predicting a rise to $25-$37 by 2030. SUI’s journey shows its potential to shape Web3. While markets change, its innovation and ecosystem make it significant in crypto. Investors watch its trajectory with interest. NEAR’s Tenfold User Surge: What’s Behind the Blockchain Boom? In 2023, Near Protocol’s users increased tenfold, thanks to the launch of NEAT inscriptions in November. These are NEAR’s equivalent of NFTs, which attracted many to the network. A year ago, Near Protocol partnered with Alibaba Cloud, promising access to nearly one billion customers. Though it dipped afterward, it recovered by late 2024, boosted by platforms like KAIKAINOW, offering curated content without unlocking phones. By late 2024, NEAR climbed from under $4 to over $5, showing resilience. This rise reflected growing interest and adoption in a competitive market. Near Protocol aims to be faster and more user-friendly than other blockchains. Using Doomslug and Nightshade sharding, it speeds up transactions. Human-readable wallet names make it accessible. NEAR also supports decentralized apps, opening new possibilities. Price predictions are optimistic. Analysts suggest NEAR could reach $8.21 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. With strong technology and a growing ecosystem, Near Protocol looks attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion In the midst of the current bull run, coins like SOL, ONDO, SUI, and NEAR show promise but may offer limited short-term gains. Their immediate potential appears constrained by various market factors. On the other hand, Agent A.I. stands out as a memecoin with significant buzz. It aims to outperform fake AI tokens by delivering genuine value. Modeled after the successful PEPE coin, Agent A.I. combines humor with the potential for impressive returns. With a community-driven presale offering substantial discounts and plans for expansion, it presents an opportunity worth considering.

Currently launched in its testnet stage, it made its public testnet live on its platform, Kite AI. The launch is intended for providing free, transparent mechanisms for data providers, AI models and autonomous agents developers. By using Avalanche’s high scalability and 4,500+ TPS rate (Transactions per second), it will be able to process Kite AI’s heavy AI workloads. 5/ Why is the Testnet Important? Validate Network Stability and Performance: Ensure AI-centric workloads run at scale Test Proof of AI Mechanisms: Refine fair attribution and incentive models Grow the Ecosystem: Support early developers and validators before mainnet… — KITE AI (@GoKiteAI) February 6, 2025 How Avalanche will help in managing AI workloads Since AI models and datasets require fast data processing and high computational powers, Avalanche’s sub-second finality and lower gas fees will help the developers. Its EVM compatibility will also allow Ethereum developers, ensuring their integration with existing AI-focused apps. Avalanche’s Proof-of-stake (PoS) will provide the required security to the datasets being shared by the contributors and developers. The low cost of storing and processing will make it affordable for developers and enterprises to reap the benefits of Decentralized AI by Kite AI. However, its handling of large-scale workloads can check its limits. With KiteAI becoming part of the Avalanche infraBUILD (AI) program, it is set to accelerate the fusion of Artificial Intelligence and Decentralised infrastructure while enhancing Kite AI’s decentralised AI platform. The subnet customization that Avalanche launched last Dec via Avalanche900 upgrade will provide the scalability for Kite AI’s decentralised ecosystem. Kite AI’s vision – Development of Decentralized AI As Kite AI launches the specialized Blockchain for development of decentralised AI, individuals and subnets can be empowered to own and control their own AI models and data – thus, reducing the traditionally dominating and centralised character of AI. The Blockchain-empowered development of Decentralized AI using blockchain also ensures the verifiable ownership of AI-generated content, datasets and model contributions – decreasing risks of frauds, theft and privacy concerns. The dominating ownerships of high-quality data such as supply chain and retail transactions, health records by centralized entities exclude small and independent developers from the development process. However, the vision of the AI economy to contribute to every data provider, agent and developer can change the centralised narrative. Using Kite AI’s Programmable AI Value Chain, developers can create an optimised workflow and build their own ideal AI stack. Using its Proof of AI mechanism, developers can receive fair attribution for their contributions. When asked “Is AI truly for all?”, Kite AI founders responded with their vision, “We don’t believe it is, and we are here to change that”. The collaborative ecosystem that it is allowing for developers, data providers, and agents can create a trustless, and transparent environment for the de-centralised AI economy.

A few meme coins are capturing eyes, promising vast returns in the current bull market. In a space often dominated by big names, these unexpected contenders are gaining traction. Excitement surrounds coins like BONK and PEPE, each carrying a unique narrative. Among these rising stars is a new player, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I. This project combines meme culture with community-driven energy. Drawing inspiration from past viral successes, it aims to disrupt and entertain. As markets heat up, curiosity grows about which coins will soar. These intriguing entries are at the forefront, possibly set for dramatic growth. Agent A.I. Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Agent A.I. is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins , two of the most prominent trends today . Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use “AI” as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Agent A.I. Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Agent A.I. aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Agent A.I. stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Agent A.I. is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform . According to its developers, the project’s AI framework can: Analyze massive datasets in milliseconds to improve decision-making Scale up processing power to match top cloud platforms Continuously refine its performance, learning and adapting over time. The development team behind Agent A.I. is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Agent A.I. has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices . The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token costs $0.003333333. It will go through 28 stages and reach $0.151515152 by the end of the presale. Those who buy at the first stage get a huge 98% discount . This pricing strategy means that the earlier you invest, the bigger the discount . Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Agent A.I. combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market : AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Is Bonk (BONK) the Next Big Meme Coin? A 2025 Outlook Bonk (BONK) burst onto the crypto scene in December 2022, making waves as a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. While most meme coins operate on Ethereum, BONK chose Solana for its speed and lower costs. This shift aimed to address the issues of slow transactions and high fees that plagued Ethereum-based tokens. BONK serves primarily as a form of payment between users within the Solana ecosystem. Unlike Solana’s native token, SOL, which also handles governance, BONK focuses solely on transaction facilitation and liquidity. This dedicated approach positions it uniquely among other meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). After its release, BONK’s price skyrocketed alongside SOL, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts. The coin’s value saw significant growth, reflecting optimism about its potential. Experts like Subhash Chandra believe BONK has room to grow, especially with anticipated crypto market upswings. He highlights ongoing promotions and the coin’s usefulness to Solana users as key factors in its favor. However, not everyone is convinced. Critics like Peter Henn point out concerns about the anonymity of BONK’s founders and the lack of a detailed white paper. These factors raise questions about transparency and long-term viability, common issues in the meme coin space. Price predictions for BONK show a range of possibilities. By the end of 2025, forecasts suggest it could reach anywhere from $0.000043 to $0.00009368. While these numbers are speculative, they indicate a belief in BONK’s potential growth. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, BONK’s focus on Solana’s strengths might make it an attractive option for those seeking the next big thing in digital currency. PEPE Coin Leaps Ahead: Is the Meme-Fueled Cryptocurrency Set to Soar? In the early 2000s, Matt Furie’s cartoon frog Pepe became an internet meme sensation. Now, PEPE Coin transforms this beloved meme into a deflationary cryptocurrency. PEPE Coin is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, celebrated for its simplicity and strong community. Embracing its meme roots, it follows three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. By keeping things fun and uncomplicated, PEPE has garnered a dedicated following. By December 2024, PEPE hit an all-time high of $0.00002825 but then lost about 68% as investors took profits. In 2025, its volatility continues, moving dramatically amid meme coin enthusiasm. Its past price movements reflect the hype and risks associated with meme coins. Competing with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE’s appeal lies in its meme heritage and community support. Its attractiveness in the current market depends on staying relevant and engaging its holders. The sustained interest in meme coins could influence its trajectory. Analysts like Valdrin Tahiri are bullish, expecting a meme coin season to lift PEPE, with forecasts up to $0.0027 by 2025. Others, like Steven Walgenbach, see bearish trends due to selling pressure. Long-term predictions vary, with some optimistic forecasts suggesting PEPE could reach $1.61 by 2050. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like BONK and PEPE have generated buzz, their short-term potential appears limited in the current market surge. These coins have had their moments, but may not deliver the explosive growth that investors are seeking right now. Agent A.I., however, stands out as a fresh contender with a strong community backing. With its unique approach and ambitious mission, it positions itself as a memecoin to watch. Its strategy and community engagement suggest that Agent A.I. could be the unexpected leader in the ongoing bull market.

On February 7, Republican Senator Joe Gruters introduced a bill advocating the investment of a portion of state reserves in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation Gruters cited the ongoing erosion of state funds’ purchasing power due to inflation as the primary motivation for the proposal. “The state should have access to tools such as Bitcoin to protect against inflation,” Gruters emphasized. The senator underscored how prominent financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton have adopted Bitcoin , recognizing its potential as an inflation hedge. He also noted the asset’s growing acceptance as an international medium of exchange and its historical appreciation in value. Under the proposed bill, Florida’s chief financial officer Jimmy Patronis would be authorized to invest state funds, including the general reserve and agency trust funds, into Bitcoin. However, the bill recommends capping Bitcoin allocations at 10% per account to manage risks — a more aggressive stance compared to Wyoming’s recent 3% limit proposal . A Rising National Trend Florida is not alone in its pursuit of Bitcoin-backed reserves. On February 6, just a day before Gruters’ bill surfaced, Kentucky became the 16th U.S. state to introduce similar legislation. State Representative Theodore Joseph Roberts proposed KY HB376, which seeks to permit the State Investment Commission to allocate up to 10% of surplus reserves into digital assets, including Bitcoin. Gruters’ proposal follows an earlier October 29 letter from Patronis, urging the Florida State Board of Administration to consider Bitcoin investments for retirement funds. In his letter, Patronis described Bitcoin as “digital gold” that could help diversify investment portfolios and serve as a safeguard against volatility in traditional asset classes. The move signals Florida’s intent to stay competitive in the evolving financial landscape, with Bitcoin adoption gaining traction nationwide. As states grapple with inflation and explore financial innovation, proposals like Gruters’ are set to fuel broader debates about Bitcoin’s role in public finance. If passed, Florida’s adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset would further legitimize digital currencies in the mainstream financial system, positioning the Sunshine State at the forefront of crypto-driven financial strategies.

The first round of distributions will only be available to holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience Classes who have met the necessary steps before distribution can take place. FTX has indicated that eligible creditors can receive their distributions one to three business days after the first distribution date. Later, further details on separate records and payment dates for other classes of claims will also be provided. FTX transfers funds for creditor payouts as Bankman-Fried’s family seeks pardon FTX has announced that it has managed to transfer the funds for the initial distributions to BitGo and Kraken, the Distribution Service Providers that will process the payments. Both retail and institutional customers and other creditors in supported jurisdictions will receive their share of the recoveries in accordance with the Plan. FTX was a leading cryptocurrency exchange that went bankrupt in November 2022 amid allegations that its owners had embezzled and misused customer funds. Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of the exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to repay $11 billion. Just a week ago, the parents of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried were exploring ways to secure a pardon from President Donald Trump for the onetime crypto billionaire. Still, it’s unclear if outreach has been made to the White House. Bankman-Fried currently lacks widespread support but has argued that his sentence is “draconian,” citing the significant recovery of funds by FTX customers. Meanwhile, former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who was sentenced to over seven years in prison, has also stated that he is seeking a pardon. FTX urges creditors to contact support as Bitcoin withdrawals surge FTX has informed eligible creditors that if they have any concerns about the availability of their funds, they should contact the customer support of the selected Distribution Service Provider. Once received, creditors will have full control over their funds. The announcement is a welcome relief for FTX creditors who have been waiting to be compensated for two years since the exchange’s downfall. In a recent post, caueconomy noted the largest volume of exchange withdrawals since the FTX collapse. The data shows more than 47,000 BTC were taken from exchange reserves. Some of them may be internal, but they also suggest a potential accumulation by a large market player or institutional entity. This trend of Bitcoin exiting exchanges is generally considered bullish in the long term as it reduces the supply of coins in the market that can be sold. However, caueconomy noted that this shift does not result in a supply shock that can affect Bitcoin’s price in the short run. Instead, it suggests the beginning of an accumulation phase that may help the price grow in the future.

The said fund would be placed under the control of the Missouri state treasurer, who’d be granted the power to purchase, invest, and hold $BTC using the state’s money. Missouri’s plan is to diversify the state’s investment portfolio. In addition to accepting gifts and donations, as well as taxes (including fees and fines), in crypto, Keathley also wants Missouri to follow a HODL strategy for $BTC. Another US state to have taken a big step forward towards embracing crypto is Kentucky, which has introduced new legislation authorizing an investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets. By doing so, Kentucky has officially become the 16th US state to have shown interest and/or have introduced legislation for Bitcoin reserves . With Bitcoin (and crypto) adoption to skyrocket in the coming months – and a US Federal Bitcoin reserve looking very likely – thanks to the new pro-crypto Trump administration, here are five projects with the potential to become the next big cryptos . 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Overall Best Crypto to Invest in for Massive Returns Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best meme coins going around right now, primarily because it offers a brilliant mix of memeic appeal and real utility. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, $SOLX aims to improve the network by ensuring transactions are carried out more reliably, quickly, and cheaply – all aspects that Solana Layer 1 chains have been struggling with. Another thing that’s unique about Solaxy is that it’s a multi-chain token. It connects two of the most active crypto ecosystems (Ethereum and Solana). This will not only result in a large user base but also offer the best of both, i.e., Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s speed. All things considered, it’s hardly a surprise that Solaxy has become one of the biggest crypto presales , raising over $18.6M at the time of writing. 1 $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001628, and early adopters can also benefit from the project’s 217% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Crypto Offering Actionable Market Insights With AI gaining massive traction worldwide and in crypto, there’s little doubt that the best AI agent coin , MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , is one of the top new cryptocurrencies to watch out for. Simply put, $MIND is an AI-powered autonomous entity (meaning it has a ‘mind’ of its own) that scans the market and offers early-stage crypto investment opportunities to token holders. How does it do it? It interacts with crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social platforms like X and gauges which way the crypto wind is blowing. Additionally, $MIND is self-evolving, meaning once it’s armed with all the info and hype floating around online, it can drive conversations and trends, eventually becoming a Roaring Kitty on steroids and churning out one GME after another. The MIND of Pepe presale has been a massive hit; it has crossed the $5M mark in virtually no time at all. You can get $MIND for just $0.0032792 each – here’s how to buy it . 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Revolutionary Crypto Project for First-Time Investors Unless you’re a seasoned crypto investor, or even if you are, following the memecoin market can be pretty daunting, let alone churning out consistent profits from it. This is where Meme Index ($MEMEX) comes in. It’s a one-of-a-kind crypto project offering different baskets of meme coins, each with a varying degree of risk, profit potential, and volatility. You can choose a meme coin basket depending on the kind of investor you are – risk averse or someone more aggressive. For example, the Meme Titan Index is ideal for conservative investors who’d prefer average but steadier returns. On the flip side, the Meme Frenzy Index will appease risk takers, as it contains the next cryptos to explode. Considering the huge influx of new traders in the crypto space, $MEMEX’s less risky approach to memecoin investing is going to have a lot of takers. You can benefit from its success by investing in its presale, which is currently ongoing and has already raised $3.4M. Each token is available at $0.0159713 – and here’s a guide on how to buy $MEMEX for more info. 4. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Meme Coin Ready to Dominate Once Again Dogecoin is really the perfect example of the potential meme coins have. It was the first-ever unserious crypto, and with a current market cap of over $36B, it’s now the biggest meme coin in the world. Plus, with Elon Musk planning to integrate this dog-themed crypto into X’s payment platform, there’s little debate that Dogecoin could not only follow Bitcoin’s upward trajectory but also beat it. After all, $BTC is up 116% in the last year, whereas $DOGE is up 210%. It’s worth noting that although it has experienced a sizable price decline in recent weeks, $DOGE looks poised for a major comeback . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is right in the face of a breakout, following which we could see a violent rally upwards. This means the current price of around $0.25 is a great entry point. 5. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Follow the Crypto Man, the POTUS Himself One of the thumb rules of investing is to keep emotions out of it. So, irrespective of your personal opinions on Donald Trump, there’s no denying that his own meme coin $TRUMP is among the most lucrative trading opportunities right now. Official Trump took the crypto market by storm when it shot up by over 12,000% overnight after its launch, making new crypto millionaires with every tick upwards. Although recent price drops may suggest that $TRUMP is no longer the sensation it once was, the token boasts a massive market cap of $3.4B – meaning investors are aware of its potential. With Donald Trump set to catapult crypto into insane new highs, $TRUMP, which is a reflection of his popularity and acceptance among crypto enthusiasts, could be among the biggest gainers in the market. Conclusion The potential of the above-mentioned next big crypto notwithstanding, beware that the crypto market is prone to violent ups and downs, which is why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must conduct your own research before jumping into crypto.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|DOGE|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-08 10:46:47

On-chain data on Saturday revealed that the whale, previously recorded to have made considerable losses with the same token, has again entered the market amid the ongoing TRUMP price dip. In turn, traders and investors speculate whether the meme coin could pump or fall ahead, given broader trends highlight the chances of further volatility while the accumulation signals potential gains ahead. TRUMP Coin Whale Bags Heavily Despite Previous Losses According to the data offered by Lookonchain , as of February 8, a TRUMP coin whale spent 1.6 million USDC to buy 95,657 tokens. Although usual market sentiments convey optimism in light of whale accumulations, this trader’s previous maneuvers surrounding the meme coin remain bearish. Data revealed that the trader (address- 3MF15CZwf) is known for buying at highs and selling at lows, and thus making losses. Over the past 6 days, this whale showcased a lose-incurring strategy, losing $835K. As a response, market watchers are unsure of the political meme coin’s future performance amid broader trends. Source: Lookonchain, X Crypto Market Volatility Puts Pressure On Prices It’s worth pointing out that the TRUMP Coin whale may be trying to exhibit a buy-the-dip strategy, which has failed as he bought too early while the token’s price continued to drop. Mainly, this waning action is attributed to the broader crypto market trend as BTC and altcoins struggle to pump due to macroeconomic developments. With Donald Trump announcing new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China earlier this week, markets took a hit. As a response, even the digital asset sector saw a bearish run. Besides, despite a 30-day pause on the new tariffs, the market is yet to recover as investor uncertainty over future movements looms. With this factor weighing in, the crypto market continues to tackle market volatility, with even the political meme coin taking heat. Official TRUMP Coin Price Slumps At the time of reporting, TRUMP coin’s price fell nearly 4% and is currently trading at $16.96. Its intraday bottom and peak were $16.22 and $18.17, respectively. Further, the weekly price chart showcased a massive 28% crash in value. This plunging action falls in line with the broader market trend. Nevertheless, market enthusiast MOON JEFF has recently taken to X, revealing that the meme coin is consolidating. Moreover, he goes on to add that, “A big pump is coming. Flying to $50 from here.” This statement may come true, given that the crypto market recovers ahead of time and the asset sees renewed market interest. Source: MOON JEFF, X Also, the TRUMP coin whale accumulation falls in line with this bullish projection. Nevertheless, the current meme coin market dynamics indicate that traders should be ready for short-term volatility, mimicking broader trends. Besides, a recent report on the TRUMP coin indicates that the crypto might also slip to $5 if the bears continue to dominate.

Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to a low of $2,140 this week and bounced back to $2,620 as the crypto industry stabilized. It remains about 37% below its highest level in December last year. Solana becomes formidable rival DeFi Llama data shows that Ethereum’s 30-day trading volume was $95 billion compared to Solana’s ( SOL ) $264 billion. Ethereum has also been overtaken in terms of fees this year. Its network has collected $172 million in fees, making it the sixth-most profitable cryptocurrency project after Tether, Tron, Jito, Solana, and Circle. The price of ETH has also dropped due to ongoing Ethereum Foundation controversies and token dumps. Here’s why it could be ripe for a comeback: You might also like: Vitalik defends Ethereum Foundation amid ongoing controversy Spot Ethereum ETF inflows One potential catalyst for ETH is the ongoing spot Ethereum ETF inflows . SoSoValue data shows that these funds have had cumulative net inflows in the last six consecutive days, bringing the total flows to $3.17 billion. That’s a sign that Wall Street investors are buying the dip, indicating more demand for these funds. Still, spot Ethereum ETFs have a long way to go to catch up with Bitcoin ( BTC ), which accumulated over $40 billion in inflows. Spot Ethereum ETF inflows | Source: SoSoValue Falling Ethereum balances on exchanges The other Ethereum price catalyst is the falling balances on exchanges, a sign of potential investor accumulation. ETH balances in exchanges tracked by CoinGlass have fallen to 15.36 million, down from 16.1 million earlier this year. They have fallen to the lowest level since December last year. The falling Ethereum balances happen when activity in the over-the-counter, or OTC, sector is rises . OTC activity is common among large institutions that want to execute large transactions outside the public centralized and decentralized exchanges. ETH balances on exchanges | Source: CoinGlass Ethereum price chart mirrors August’s bottom ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the price of ETH crashed to a low of $2,140 this week. That’s its lowest level since August of last year. It has since formed a hammer pattern, which has a longer lower shadow and a small body and is a popular bullish reversal sign. A similar pattern happened in August, when Ethereum bottomed at $2,139. The two big drops happened in periods of large bearish volume spikes. ETH also found support at the 200-week moving average. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back, and possibly retest the resistance at $4,080. A break above that level will point to more gains to the all-time high of $4,800, followed by $6,000.

Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli made an interesting statement about the inclusion of XRP. He outlined the target for XRP to reach if it needs to qualify for the race of US reserve. How XRP Can Be Part of a U.S. Reserve? In a recent tweet post, Fred Rispoli said that XRP would need to hit a price of $5 to qualify for inclusion in such a reserve alongside Bitcoin. To be fair it is codified in a way that—at present—only Bitcoin qualifies. But $XRP would qualify at $5. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) February 7, 2025 Rispoli’s comment came in response to Santiago Velez, the Co-Founder of Block Digital, who pointed out that Utah House Bill 230 is not focused solely on Bitcoin as a crypto reserve asset, leaving the door open for other cryptocurrencies like XRP to be considered. Instead, the bill gives state treasurers the power to invest public funds in certain digital assets. Rispoli clarified that while the law is currently structured in a way that only Bitcoin qualifies, XRP would join the race of qualification only if its price reaches $5. XRP To Be Included in a Strategic Reserve: Ripple CEO The discussion around XRP’s involvement in state reserves is tied back to a statement made by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse earlier stating that if a government were to create a digital asset reserve, it should be diversified and not limited to just one cryptocurrency, whether it’s Bitcoin, XRP, or any other. Meanwhile, there are ongoing talks that Garlinghouse might be on former President Donald Trump’s shortlist for a crypto advisory council. If true, this could be a major bullish factor for XRP. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Joins Trump’s Crypto Council? What It Means for XRP , Can XRP Price Reach $5? XRP, like most crypto assets, has faced volatility in recent weeks, dropping nearly 25% to $1.80, but it has since recovered a lot. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.41 , showing a 1.5% daily increase. For XRP to maintain momentum, it needs to stay above its 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average). If this happens, analysts believe XRP could reach key Fibonacci levels of $3.52, $4.52, and eventually $5.5. Adding to the bullish outlook, multiple XRP spot ETF applications have been filed, raising hopes that XRP could eventually reach double-digit prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The government banned unlicensed crypto platforms, causing panic among investors. Things got even messier when two Binance executives were detained, with one of them, Tigran Gambaryan, jailed until the U.S. government intervened to secure his release in October . This legal crackdown sent shockwaves through Africa’s largest economy, leading to a 38% drop in stablecoin usage, shrinking the volume to $23.6 billion, according to Chainalysis . A Change of Heart? However, things are starting to look up. With global pressure to adopt crypto-friendly rules, Nigeria is shifting its stance. Emomotimi Agama, the director general of Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is now a strong supporter of blockchain technology . He believes blockchain can boost efficiency and improve how Nigeria regulates its capital markets. This technology could help tackle key issues like financial exclusion and inefficiencies in both public and private sectors—problems that have long plagued African economies.

With an entry price of $0.004 and the potential for strong returns, the project stands out as an appealing opportunity. Its focus on practical utility and a clear roadmap has positioned it as a promising option for investors seeking growth. XRP’s Soaring Success Leads Investors to Explore Mutuum Finance for Future Gains XRP, the cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs, has experienced significant growth in 2024, with its value increasing by approximately 350% since the beginning of the year. This surge is largely attributed to the election of President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration is expected to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance, potentially leading to favorable regulatory changes. The anticipation of such regulatory shifts has bolstered investor confidence, contributing to XRP’s impressive performance. In light of XRP’s success, early investors are now turning their attention to emerging opportunities like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Opportunity for Investors Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol currently in its presale phase, offering tokens at an initial price of $0.01. Although the official launch price is set at $0.06, many experts predict that in a bullish market the token could surge beyond this level, delivering a 1500% gain for early investors. This outlook makes Mutuum Finance an appealing choice for those looking to maximize returns in the crypto space. For instance, if an investor buys 100,000 MUTM tokens at a price of $0.01 (totaling $1,000) during the presale, they would hold 100,000 tokens. If the token price rises to $0.16, those tokens would be worth $16,000—a 1500% return. This example shows the substantial profit potential available to those who get in at the earliest stage. The platform enables users to supply and borrow funds, providing opportunities for passive income through annual percentage yields (APY) and flexible borrowing options using crypto assets as collateral. The development team plans to launch a beta version of the platform alongside the token release, which could further enhance the token’s value. Additionally, the implementation of a stablecoin on the Ethereum network and the auditing of smart contracts by a reputable company aim to ensure security and stability for users. Mutuum Finance operates with two markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C market relies on automated smart contracts to facilitate transactions, ensuring secure and efficient interactions between participants. The P2P market, on the other hand, allows for direct agreements between individuals, offering flexibility in terms while maintaining safety through the use of audited smart contracts. Mutuum Finance has announced a $100,000 giveaway to reward its community and attract new participants. The prize pool will be distributed among 10 winners, with each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To participate, users need to engage with Mutuum Finance’s official social media channels, as detailed on their website. Experts suggest that Mutuum Finance has the potential to be listed on popular exchanges after its launch, a development that could significantly enhance the token’s visibility and demand. Such listings often attract a larger investor base, driving both liquidity and price growth. With this possibility in view, early investors see MUTM as a strong contender for substantial returns. Early XRP investors are now shifting their focus to Mutuum Finance, recognizing its potential for substantial returns and long-term growth. The appeal lies in MUTM’s presale pricing at just $0.01, offering a remarkable 1500% projected return by launch. With its decentralized lending model, plans for a beta platform release, and the introduction of a stablecoin, Mutuum Finance stands out as a secure and practical opportunity. This move by early XRP investors underscores their confidence in the project’s roadmap and its potential to deliver impressive gains by 2025.

That’s up by 212% from its lowest level this year. This rebound happened ahead of the Gods Unchained Battle Pass Season 1 whose presale will start on Feb. 10. Gods Unchained is a popular card game on the Immutable X ( IMX ) layer-2 network. According to DappRadar , the game had 6,640 unique active wallets in the last 30 days, and over 273,000 transactions. The developers expect the upcoming season and rewards to incentivize more gamers. Its surge pushed its futures open interest to $9.30 million — its highest level since July last year. GODS futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass Safemoon price rises as Karony seeks trial delay Safemoon ( SFM ) price also surged by over 82%, giving it a market cap of over $36 million. This rebound happened after former CEO John Karony asked the court to delay his trial citing the upcoming policy changes by the Donald Trump administration. He asked it to move the trial from March to April this year, citing a statement by Hester Peirce who suggested that the SEC would consider retroactive relief in some cases. The Justice Department charged Karony and other Safemoon executives of misappropriating investor funds, committing wire fraud, and money laundering. In the aftermath, most exchanges delisted Safemoon, with most of its trading now happening in MEXC, PancakeSwap, Gate, and BitMart.

Is SOL Price Headed for $180 Next?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-price-dips-17-in-a-week-is-sol-price-headed-for-180-next/,"The post Solana Price Dips 17% in a Week! Is SOL Price Headed for $180 Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has recorded a bearish pullback this week. This resulted in top tokens breaking down their immediate support trend levels. With this, the SOL price has failed to reclaim the $200 mark. Considering the present market statistics, is this a good time to invest in Solana tokens? In this article, we have uncovered the possible short-term Solana (SOL) Price Analysis just for you! SOL Price On The Verge Of A Major Breakdown? The price of Solana has dropped by 1% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $4.301 billion. Moreover, it has slid 17.92% over the last seven days and ~2% in 30 days. With a YTD return of -1.29%, it has secured the 05th position with a market cap of $93.201 billion. Solana Price Analysis 08-02-2025 The Simple Moving Average (SMA) constantly acts as a resistance to the SOL coin price chart. This highlights an increase in the bearish action for the altcoin in the crypto space. On the other hand, the RSI indicator records a positive curve in the daily price chart. However, the average trendline displays a negative action, suggesting an increase in selling-over-buying pressure. Will Solana Ever Recover? If the bulls regain momentum, the Solana price could retest its immediate resistance level of $200. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for this altcoin to head toward its upper resistance level of $210 in the coming time. Conversely, a sustained bearish action could result in the price of Solana token plunging toward its crucial support level of $181.50. Further, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could pull the value of this altcoin toward a new multi-month low. Are you curious to explore the long-term prospects of SOL tokens?

With the milestone, Circle’s USD-pegged stablecoin continues the positive momentum that has seen its supply increase by 100% year over year. According to data from Defillama , the milestone follows a 23% growth in the past month. Within that period, it added more than $10 billion . Following its recent performance, Circle USDC has now made a full resurgence from its 2023 decline. The stablecoin’s market cap had fallen as low as $24.5 billion in 2023 during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. Although it has been slowly recovering since then, it has seen more rapid growth in the past few months. The recent growth is due to several factors that have boosted USDC adoption. These include Europe’s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which has regulated stablecoin or electronic money tokens (EMTs) in the EU. Meanwhile, growing US crypto interest due to Donald Trump’s emergence as president has also helped Circle’s performance. Even before the election, Trump’s pro-crypto stance signaled changes in sentiments about crypto. With Trump as president, the industry has enjoyed a massive boost, and stablecoins have been identified as one of the sectors that will likely see regulatory clarity first. The House Financial Services Committee recently released a discussion draft for stablecoins. All these have helped USDC, which many see as a regulatory-compliant alternative to USDT, grow significantly. However, USDC’s rise in recent months means it is now eating into the dominance of Tether USDT. While USDT remains the biggest stablecoin with over $140 billion in market cap, its market dominance has fallen to 63.65%. Still, USDT and USDC growth in the past few months have benefited the stablecoin market in general. Stablecoin supply has reached the highest level ever, at $222.84 billion. Other stablecoins have also seen gains in the past month. Ethena USDe is up 4%, MakerDAO DAI increased 2.66%, while First Digital FSUSD and SkyDollar USDS are up 12% and 132%, respectively. Coinbase celebrates USDC growth, highlights use cases Meanwhile, Coinbase has celebrated the Circle-issued stablecoin hitting the latest milestone, noting that it shows the importance of stablecoin to the on-chain financial ecosystem. In a recent blog post, the exchange said it has been integral to driving USDC utility as a founding partner. It said: “USDC supply now exceeds $56 billion, underscoring its role as a fundamental component of the onchain financial ecosystem. Whether for payments, remittances, trading, or decentralized finance (DeFi), USDC continues to be a go-to stablecoin for global transactions.” The exchange went on to highlight how it has improved USDC’s utility by allowing users to earn up to 4.5% APY on the stablecoin and introducing a product where users can borrow USDC against their Bitcoin on several chains. Coinbase added that USDC also powers more than 200 trading pairs on the exchange. Last year, it launched payments with the stablecoin in more than 70 countries through various partnerships with Stripe, Yellow Card, and Remote.com. Circle included in CFTC pilot program Meanwhile, USDC could see more growth in the coming months, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission taping the stablecoin for its pilot program. While the program details are not fully available, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that its stablecoin will be a form of collateral in the future market. The commission has announced that it will host a CEO Forum for leading crypto firms. Major companies such as Circle, Coinbase, MoonPay, Ripple, and Crypto.com will participate in the program. CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham described it as a “groundbreaking initiative” enabling the agency to engage US digital assets market participants and achieve Trump’s promise.

Interestingly, 90% of the country’s crypto volume is linked to stablecoins. Galipolo also expressed concerns regarding taxation and money laundering that come with the excessive use of crypto. Stablecoins are tied to real-world assets such as fiat currencies or commodities and hence are less volatile than altcoins . They act as a like-to-like alternative to paper currencies and have allowed businesses to make easy cross-border payments. As per Chainalysis, Brazilians deposited around $90B in digital assets between July 2023 and June 2024 (12 months). This was only behind Argentina in Latin America, which deposited $91B during the same time. The global volume of stablecoin transfers also reached $27.6 trillion in 2024, which surpassed the volumes of Visa and Mastercard combined. Stablecoin Market Cap Surpasses $200 Billion The global stablecoin market capitalization crossed $200B – an increase of $37B since the appointment of the pro-crypto Trump as the new President of the US. USDT deposits have surged to $43B – up 41% in the last 3 months. A rise in stablecoin volume indicates increasing liquidity in the crypto markets, which is always a positive sign for an upcoming crypto (and Bitcoin) rally . Experts believe the upcoming bull run may be led by stablecoins. The meme coin market saw the most growth throughout 2024, surging by a massive 500% – from $20B to $120B, outperforming any other crypto class. Today, successful meme coins like Dogecoin have a market cap of over $36B. It’s also worth noting that ever since Trump became the president, there has been a massive surge in meme coin activity. He launched his own token called $TRUMP, which quickly rose to $75, generating mind-boggling gains for early investors. It’s now the fourth biggest crypto in the world in terms of market cap. With an influx of new traders into crypto, plus the market moving towards stablecoins and altcoins, the need for a reliable crypto wallet has never been higher. This is where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) comes in. What Is Best Wallet Token? $BEST is the in-house token of the insanely popular Best Wallet App – a decentralized, non-custodial crypto wallet that provides you access to more than 60 crypto chains. This allows you to buy, sell, swap, and track all your crypto holdings in one place. Now, the $BEST token is the Best Wallet App on steroids, seeing as it unlocks a lot of benefits for token holders within the Best Wallet ecosystem. For instance, you get access to all upcoming alpha tokens much before they go on sale for the general public. Simply put, $BEST gives you the opportunity to get positioned in the next 100x cryptos early. Plus, all of these tokens are vetted internally by the $BEST team so that you don’t accidentally end up losing money on scam websites. You can find these tokens in the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section of the app. By the way, this is the same feature that helped investors identify gems like $PEPU and $SLAP. What’s more, $BEST token holders also benefit from lower transaction fees on the platform. Furthermore, you don’t need to go through a tedious KYC process to start using the app. This saves you a lot of time and hassle and gets you started on your memecoin investment journey quickly. Check out our detailed Best Wallet review for more info. Why Can $BEST Be the Next 100x Meme Coin? The Best Wallet App looks to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. This translates into a huge $4B in revenue for the company. Here are some more confidence-inspiring numbers for $BEST investors: Within just a few months of its launch, the app now has 250,000 active monthly users and over 500,000 users in total. The month-on-month user base growth sits at a massive 96.3%. The app installation growth was 658% since its launch in November. All things considered, it was hardly a surprise that Best Wallet Token ($BEST) raised $1M within just 14 days of its presale’s launch. It has, so far, raised $9.3M and is quickly heading towards the $10M mark. More good news is that the developers have exciting plans for Best Wallet’s future. These include full Solana compatibility and the launch of Best Card for seamless crypto payments. You can head over to the official $BEST presale website and get it for just $0.0239 each. However, the price will increase in the next few hours, so get in as early as possible. However, always do your own research before purchasing crypto assets, as they can be very volatile.

Ripple’s dominance faces uncertainty as XRP struggles, while Rexas Finance gains momentum with real-world asset tokenization. Table of Contents Ripple’s promise: Can it still deliver? The rise of Rexas Finance Conclusion Given its dedicated community and convincing application cases, Ripple has long been identified as a pillar of cryptocurrencies. Its cost-effective, scalable, and efficient blockchain technology is meant to change cross-border payments. Nonetheless, many investors wonder about XRP’s ability to provide life-changing profits by 2025, given ongoing legislative challenges and a flat pricing trend. Meanwhile, a fresh competitor has drawn interest, trading under $0.25 and displaying a more active attitude. Rexas Finance (RXS) creates waves with its inventive environment, original use cases, and strong presale performance. Emphasizing tokenizing real-world assets like real estate, RXS is quickly becoming popular as a fascinating substitute for XRP. You might also like: Rexas Finance the next Shiba Inu: Why $1000 could hit $50000 by mid-2025 Ripple’s promise: Can it still deliver? XRP’s main attraction is its use as a bridge currency for international trade. Through collaborations among several financial institutions, Ripple has established itself as a sophisticated cryptocurrency meant to address practical issues. Regulating uncertainties, though, clouds its future. Ripple Labs’s continuous legal fight with the U.S. SEC raises uncertainty about the token’s long-term survival. A positive outcome might offer much-needed certainty, drawing institutional investors and building XRP trust. The latest 43.90% price rise XRP has shown over 30 days shows its ability for quick price swings. Although this volatility draws speculators, it can also make XRP less able to be a consistent bridge currency. Notwithstanding this, Ripple’s well-established network and mass adoption potential make it a contender for significant gains by 2025, even if the road ahead is full of obstacles. The rise of Rexas Finance While XRP struggles with regulatory uncertainty, Rexas Finance persuasively argues for itself as a transforming agent in the crypto scene. RXS lets investors easily buy, sell, and trade real estate on the blockchain by emphasizing real estate tokenization. For regular investors, this creative technique lowers transaction costs, improves transparency, and opens worldwide markets. This ecosystem is run by fast, low-cost transactions made possible by the Rexas Finance token. Still, its value goes much beyond mere real estate. RXS helps define the larger DeFi scene by supporting staking, lending, and borrowing. Such adaptability guarantees continuous demand for the currency, making it a fierce competitor to more established cryptocurrencies like XRP. Rexas Finance is now in its last presale round, stage 12, selling tokens for $0.20. The presale has been a stunning success, raising over $44 million. The 566.67% increase in the presale’s initial price of $0.03 shows rising investor confidence in the idea. Rexas Finance allowed ordinary investors to participate in this movement using a public presale concept instead of depending on venture capitalists. The choice has paid off, creating a vibrant, involved community and inspiring project confidence. Furthermore, Rexas Finance prioritizes security and openness. Leading blockchain security company Certik has thoroughly examined the initiative. Furthermore, RXS is easily trackable for investors since it has been published on major sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The team has verified the official exchange launch date — June 19, 2025 — and the excitement around Rexas Finance keeps growing. With a listing price of $0.25, the token will allow presale investors to lock in notable returns before the wider market accepts RXS. Rexas Finance intends to list RXS on three Tier 1 exchanges in readiness for this launch, guaranteeing worldwide visibility and liquidity. With the possibility of challenging heavyweights like XRP, this calculated action places RXS as a major competitor in the cryptocurrency space. Joining the RXS presale provides investors with a straightforward and safe way to get tokens at a lower price before general release. Visit the official Rexas Finance website to start, guarantee a secure transaction, and prevent possible fraud. Once on the platform, link a wallet for coins that fit Ethereum or USDT to ensure their support. Link the wallet and buy RXS tokens straight through the platform. Safely save RXS tokens in the wallet once the transaction is finished, and monitor the presale development. Early participation helps investors position themselves to profit from any price increases as RXS develops and grows its ecosystem, therefore creating an appealing investment possibility. Conclusion With its established network and practical use, Ripple remains a fierce competitor in cryptocurrency. Still, there are serious hazards from regulatory obstacles and price volatility. With its emphasis on real estate tokenization and DeFi applications, Rexas Finance presents a fresh, creative way instead. Its effective presale and forthcoming exchange launch offer a clear road map for expansion, which attracts RXS to investors looking for significant gains. Although XRP could produce billionaires, Rexas Finance’s vibrant ecosystem and great momentum make it a more likely option for 2025. RXS is the token to watch for anyone seeking to profit from the next great opportunity. For more information on Rexas Finance, visit their website , giveaway , X , or Telegram .

Meanwhile, industry experts eye FXGuys ($FXG), a crypto trading platform, as a game-changer. It promises lightning-fast transactions, increased liquidity distribution, and a native token that is considered the best cryptocurrency to invest in. But can this new exchange bring stability and restore investors’ confidence? Let’s find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE PEPE Drops 67% Amid Heightened Market Volatility The meme coin sector was not spared from the recent volatility hit, with top assets like PEPE shedding a significant portion of their market value. In the past day, PEPE lost over 26% , bringing its total loss to a stunning 67% from its all-time high of $0.000028, attained in December 2024. Amid this decline, PEPE’s trading volume rose 237% to $3.26 billion, indicating increased market participation driven mainly by a sell-off. PEPE’s decline and trading volume spike have raised concerns about the asset’s future. Market data shows that PEPE slid below its 200-day SMA at $0.0000135, losing a key support level. As a result, PEPE now trades at $0.00000985 , dipping 24.48% within a week. Ethereum’s Active Addresses Tank as ETH Falls Below $3,000 The number of active addresses on the Ethereum network has dropped significantly since ETH fell below $3,000. On February 2, 2025, ETH revisited a five-month low at $2,143 before staging a weak comeback. This price decline was accompanied by a reduction in the number of users on Ethereum, which, according to Glassnode , fell to a year-to-date low of 420,346 on February 2. Due to reduced network usage, ETH’s trading volume slid, accompanied by the engagement level of its DeFi ecosystem. As the drop in demand affects ETH’s value and rebound chances, investors turn to $FXG as a more compelling and promising option. Presently, ETH is down 15.27% this week to $2,712. FXGuys’ Ultrafast Crypto Trading Platform Offers Traders Haven From Market Onslaught A significant number of investors were affected by the recent market crash, as most were caught unaware, leaving them exposed and vulnerable. But this would not be the case with FXGuys’ high-speed exchange. With AI-powered solutions integrated into the exchange, users’ assets would be automatically converted into more stable currencies to protect them from the dip. Hence, they would be out of the woods before the crash could adversely impact their portfolios. If the dip eats up traders’ liquidity, the FXGuys platform can provide them with more money to continue trading. Thanks to its Trader Funding Program, traders can get up to $500,000 to trade any financial instrument, from stocks to cryptocurrencies and FX. These traders will also be allowed to retain 80% of the profit. One of the most alluring things about FXGuys is its reward programs, especially the Trade2Earn initiative. This initiative will be introduced after the exchange becomes publicly available. It rewards traders with $FXG tokens for every trade carried out on the FX Guys platform. Another thing FXGuys is notable for is its multiple income streams, one of which is a DeFi activity called staking. Staking on FXGuys is more advanced and rewarding. Those who take their $FXG tokens on the platform can secure up to a 20% APY. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Is $FXG the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in? In addition to FXGuys’ features, its native token is regarded as one of the most lucrative assets to buy this year. With over $3.84 million invested in the $FXG presale, it ranks among the most acquired presale tokens today. Early investors in presale bought the token at $0.01, and they have received 400% in profits as of now. But, if you think you are late, you can still capture a 100% ROI when $FXG launches at $0.10.

40074139,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-officially-out-of-prison,1739014355,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40074139.jpeg,Tornado Cash Developer Alexey Pertsev Officially Out Of Prison,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-officially-out-of-prison,"Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has been released after spending three years in pretrial detention. Pertsev will continue to appeal against his money laundering conviction linked to Tornado Cash. Pertsev was released under the condition that he remains under electronic monitoring, with his appeal potentially setting a precedent for how courts handle privacy-focused crypto developers. Pertsev Released From Prison Pertsev, a Russian national, was sentenced to 64 months in a Dutch prison last year. He announced his release in a post on X. The Tornado Cash developer was released after the denial of multiple bail requests and comes at a time when several debates about the legal treatment meted out to privacy-focused crypto developers are ongoing. Pertsev’s pretrial detention was suspended by the court to allow him to focus on appealing his conviction. Pertsev posted on X thanking his lawyers and those who donated towards his legal expenses, stating, “Freedom is priceless, but my freedom cost a lot of money. My house arrest was only possible thanks to the work of lawyers, who were paid from your donations. My fight is not over yet, and for a final and confident victory, I still need your help. Please support our fight here.” Focus On Appeal The United States Treasury imposed several sanctions on Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing it of enabling the laundering of over $7 billion since 2019. Pertsev was arrested in the same month and charged with money laundering and facilitating illicit transactions through the platform. Since his arrest, Pertsev has been actively appealing his conviction and asking for bail. However, despite multiple attempts, his requests were denied. Pertsev’s defense maintains he created open-source software and should not be held liable or criminalized for its misuse. The Liability Debate The case against Pertsev and Tornado Cash has ignited a debate over privacy and whether software developers must be liable for how their code is used. Pertsev’s case gained momentum after a US federal appeals court ruled that sanctions against Tornado Cash were unlawful. A court filing on January 21 confirmed the district court judgment had been overturned and sent back for review. “It is ordered and adjudged that the judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of this court.” The federal appeals court’s decision was a shot in the arm for privacy advocates who claim developers must not be punished for actions beyond their control. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also expressed concern about Pertsev’s prosecution and called it a troubling precedent for developers, adding that many believed building software was a legitimate and legal way to protect privacy. Buterin has also made several donations towards Pertsev’s legal fund through the decentralized fundraising platform Juicebox. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 1% over the past 24 hours and trading around the $96,200 mark. Markets have remained mixed and the crypto market cap is down 0.55% and currently sits at $3.13 trillion. Robert Kiyosaki On Why He Bought More BTC Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki discussed why he purchased Bitcoin (BTC) , along with another safe-haven asset, Gold. According to Kiyosaki, holding these assets is much safer than saving up and holding fiat currencies, including the US Dollar. “WHY I bought more Gold and Bitcoin. Answer: Owning Gold and Bitcoin is smarter and safer than saving dollars.” Followers on X countered Kiyosaki’s arguments, pointing out that other assets like Litecoin (LTC) are also worthy investments. LTC has built up a reputation of being the silver to Bitcoin’s Gold. Another user stated that Bitcoin is denominated in US dollars, something that Kiyosaki despises. Kentucky Introduces Bitcoin Reserve Bill Kentucky has become the 16th US state to introduce a Bitcoin reserve bill. The bill proposes investing 10% of state funds in digital assets with a market cap of over $750 billion. The bill states the reserve will not be restricted to BTC . However, the flagship cryptocurrency is the only digital asset that matches the requirement. Prior to Kentucky, 15 US states had begun legislative efforts to incorporate BTC in their financial strategies, citing several benefits like economic diversification, inflation hedging, and technological innovation. Alabama proposed a Bitcoin reserve to attract crypto-focused businesses and mitigate economic uncertainties. Arizona, a long-time advocate of blockchain adoption, has advanced legislation to allocate public funds towards BTC , while Florida is exploring the feasibility of a Bitcoin reserve to diversify assets and attract investments. Massachusetts and Montana have also introduced plans to include Bitcoin in their public funds, while North Dakota, New Hampshire, and Ohio are advancing similar legislation. Jobs Data Adds To Market Uncertainty The latest US jobs report from the Department was a mixed bag, revealing the addition of 143,000 jobs in January. This figure fell well short of economists’ predictions of 170,000. The unemployment rate dropped from 4.1% to 4%, signaling a mixed economic picture. BTC and other risk assets tend to react to labor market data since it can influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates. A slowdown could increase speculation about future rate cuts, benefiting BTC and other risk assets and making them more attractive than traditional financial instruments like bonds and savings accounts. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) briefly surpassed $100,000 after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the January 2025 employment data. However, BTC lost all of its gains, quickly tumbling to its current level of $96,000 and struggling to hold on to the level. The data showed strong wage growth last month, indicating consumers are likely to continue spending. The unemployment rate also dropped from 4.1% to 4%, indicating the Federal Reserve could pause interest rate cuts in the short term. A low unemployment rate means people will spend more, increasing prices. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates thrice in 2024 after raising them to two-decade highs in 2022 to tame inflation. The Fed’s decision to lower the cost of borrowing saw Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surge, leading to the flagship cryptocurrency surging past $100,000 and setting a new all-time high. BTC has experienced sluggishness and an increased level of volatility over the past week thanks to several economic and geopolitical developments. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded in the red since Friday as it struggles to move past $100,000, as demonstrated in its latest price action that saw the price briefly surpass $100,000 before dropping back. BTC encountered volatility on Friday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and the price fell 1.85% to $102,616. Sellers retained control over the weekend, and BTC fell below the 20-day SMA, dropping to $101,041. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC plummeted below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA to $97,881. Source: TradingView Markets opened in the red on Monday, and BTC tanked to an intraday low of $91,274, slipping below key support levels. It recovered from this level, rebounding to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,579. However, its rally was short-lived as it fell 3.54% on Tuesday, slipping below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA to $97,969. Sellers retained control on Wednesday and BTC fell 1.34% to 96,668. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $99,247. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $96,641. Friday saw BTC briefly cross $100,000, reaching an intraday high of $100,216 following the release of US jobs data. However, it quickly retreated from this level and dropped to $96,634. The current session sees BTC marginally down as it struggles to stay above $96,000. BTC has traded between $92,000 and $106,000 since the end of December, with neither the bulls nor the bears able to make a decisive move. However, BTC has shown resilience in the face of several macroeconomic challenges. It was mostly unfazed by the stock market turmoil triggered by DeepSeek, the Chinese AI model. It was also relatively unscathed by renewed trade tensions between the US and China. Buyers must prevent a move below $96,000 and reclaim $100,000 for the current bearish sentiment to change.

He tweeted a brief Q&A, addressing a common question he receives about Bitcoin and sharing his thoughts on it. The financial expert explained why he recently bought more Bitcoin and gold, calling them safer than holding fiat currencies like the US dollar. https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1887943578967757222 Some commentators disagreed with Kiyosaki’s views. One X user recommended Litecoin as a worthy investment, calling it “digital silver,” while Kiyosaki loves physical silver, particularly coins as per his earlier tweets. Another user pointed out that Bitcoin has one big problem: its value is tied to US dollars, which Kiyosaki dislikes. Bitcoin has dropped 4.25% in the past 24 hours , now trading at $96,145. It had briefly recovered to $100,000 following the release of a weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls report. Despite the decline, Robert Kiyosaki views such price drops as opportunities. In a tweet on February 3 , he called the market crash a chance to buy more Bitcoin, silver, and gold, as these assets are now on sale. On that day, Bitcoin fell from $98,000 to $92,200. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin February Price Analysis: Why Is Crypto Dropping, and Can It Rebound? , States Race to Create Crypto Reserves Utah has made history as the first state to pass a bill allowing public funds to be invested in crypto, and now, Kentucky and Maryland are jumping on the bandwagon!

This week, Maryland also introduced a bill o create a Bitcoin strategic reserve, similar to a proposal by Senator Cynthia Lummis , funded by revenue from gambling violation enforcement. Kentucky also introduced two bills allowing state retirement funds to be invested in digital asset exchange-traded funds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He is known for his unpredictable behavior and controversy-filled life, but now he might join the crypto market with a new crypto, per the market rumors. In the last few days, Kanye has shared a few tweets that show his rising interest in cryptocurrency. These include questions about crypto launches and how people make money, interactions with crypto blockchain exchanges, and more. Let’s discuss. Kanye West Awoken With Meme Coin Curiosity The speculation surrounding Kanye West launching a meme coin began when he posted on X , “When people make all that money with a coin, is that cash or concept?” This question shows his rising interest in the crypto and meme-themed currency frenzy that has taken over the world. In recent months, many celebrities and industry leaders have launched their meme-themed cryptocurrencies, fueling the demand. This includes the current US President and first lady, Melania Trump, launching their TRUMP and MELANIA, Hwak Tuah Girl launching HAWK, and many others. Kanye’s tweet gained instant attention, and multiple people interacted with the rapper. Faze Banks, a notable gaming and streaming industry figure, pitched West to launch a crypto coin. He commented that if Kanye launched a coin, his income would grow 10x instantly. More importantly, Banks advised him to launch one, as he thinks Kanye is among the few people who could successfully launch a coin. Banks previously onboarded celebrities like Adin Ross and even collaborated with multiple crypto influencers like FrankDeGods. Banks have asked Kanye to connect with him for a potential launch. However, simultaneously, controversy filled the room as Kanye talked about people approaching him for promoting scamming crypto. Kanye West Approached For Crypto Scam After Kanye West first post inquiring about making money with crypto/ meme coin, he soon revealed a $2M offer he had received to scam his community. The shared post included a screenshot of a chat in which people offered him $2 million to promote scamming crypto and asked him to reason that this post wasn’t by him but by other scammers, as his account had been hacked. Kanye added that he had declined the offer and stopped working with the person who offered it. This has raised suspicions about the possibility of a similar offer to other celebrities and the credibility of recent scams. However, it has also helped him build credibility among his followers, who now await a genuine crypto project from him. The Coinbase Connection and Arthur Hayes Bold Endorsement The Kanye West meme coin rumors became more apparent when he revealed his chat with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, captioning the post “Concerning Crypto.” Coinbase is among the biggest and most popular crypto exchanges , and this interaction increased the possibility of West launching a crypto token. In this post, Kanye asked Armstrong about resending the ‘crypto connect’ so he would not have to use the middleman. Moreover, this could hint that Kanye may consider launching his potential crypto coin project on Ethereum as Coinbase’s Base Chain is built on Ethereum. Interestingly, the founder of BitMEX has bluntly endorsed Kanye’s decision. In blunt language, Hayes has asked West to launch a meme cryptocurrency with a $YE ticker. Solana vs. Ethereum: What Will Kanye West Choose For His Meme Coin? Kanye West launching a meme coin is just speculation now, but Polymarket’s rising odds and industry experts and investors reaching out to him for launch are creating all this buzz. With Kanye interacting with the CEO of Coinbase, there’s a possibility that he can opt for Ethereum infrastructure for his token. However, in contrast, the collaboration with Faze Banks could put Solana in the spotlight. This is mainly because all the significant trending meme coins are based on Solana, which has fast transactions, low fees, and high demand. Both blockchain networks have specific advantages. Without further developments in his situation, concluding which network Kanye will choose is challenging. What’s Next? There’s no official news of Kanye West launching a meme coin at press time. However, it is speculated that he will launch one based on his tweets and interactions with crypto leaders like Coinbase CEO. Experts believe in the possibility of this happening. However, anything can happen next, as the West has an unpredictable nature. However, one thing is sure: there would be a big buzz if a crypto coin launch happened, as Kanye is a global sensation. Although investors are concerned about meme coins’ declining market cap , West’s decision could boost sentiments again. Investors must carefully analyze the situation and not jump to conclusions.

40074903,https://thecoinrise.com/retail-crypto-interest-hits-record-lows-despite-professional-optimism/,1739015456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/40074903.jpeg,Retail Crypto Interest Hits Record Lows Despite Professional Optimism,https://thecoinrise.com/retail-crypto-interest-hits-record-lows-despite-professional-optimism/,"A widening gap between retail and professional sentiment in the crypto market has emerged, with seasoned investors remaining bullish while everyday traders face disillusionment. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, retail engagement is at its lowest in years. Two Diverging Realities in Crypto Sentiment “There is an absolutely massive disconnect between retail and professional sentiment in crypto right now,” Hougan said in a February 7 X post . “Retail sentiment is the worst it’s been in years, while professional investors are extraordinarily bullish.” This contrast is reflected in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which recently dropped to a “Fear” reading of 44, significantly lower than last month’s “Greed” score of 69. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart attributed the decline to heavy losses in altcoins and memecoins, which many retail investors continue to hold. Data from CoinMarketCap shows sharp declines for top memecoins over the past week, with Pepe down 35.31%, Shiba Inu down 20.82%, and Dogecoin dropping 24.69%. Pseudonymous crypto trader DFarmer expressed concern, stating , “I don’t think I remember an extended alt bloodbath this bad ever.” Solana vs. Ether While Ethereum remains a favorite among institutional players, retail traders seem less enthused. DeFi Dad noted , “ETH sentiment for retail is the worst ever—probably more bullish with pros.” On the other hand, Solana is gaining traction among retail investors , particularly for its appeal to memecoin traders. Compounding market volatility is former President Donald Trump’s economic policies. His surprising victory in the November election fueled a massive crypto rally, propelling Bitcoin to its all-time high in December 2024. However, subsequent tariff threats on key trade partners, including Canada, Mexico, and China, rattled investors and led to a record-breaking liquidation event. Although Trump later suspended tariffs on Canada and Mexico after negotiations, Bitcoin remains under pressure, trading at $96,609 at the time of publication. As professionals maintain confidence in long-term crypto potential, it remains to be seen whether retail traders will regain interest amid the volatile landscape.

This drop, from $360 billion on December 22, 2024, to $230 billion on February 8, 2025, has significantly reduced the number of ETH tokens in profit since they were first mined. Such a drop has shaken investor confidence, as ETH underperforms compared to other large-cap cryptocurrencies . Even though the no 2 crypto coin is sailing flat Santinent expects this trend to change once the market stabilizes. What’s Driving the Price Down? Market intelligence platform Santiment’s analysis suggests that investor sentiment has turned negative, leading to increased selling pressure. Many retail traders are dumping their tokens amid fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). This has caused daily trading volumes to fall by 20%, with only 15.2 million ETH traded on February 8, 2025, compared to the previous monthly average of 19 million. Plus, the number of active addresses and transaction volumes on the Ethereum network have dropped by 12% and 18%, respectively, signaling reduced activity and demand. Technical Indicators Flash Bearish Signals On the technical front also it is turning bearish, the key indicators like RSI for ETH/USD is sitting at 32, indicating an oversold market that might bounce back soon. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish crossover, confirming the ongoing downward trend. Meanwhile, widening Bollinger Bands suggest increased volatility and the potential for more price swings. Meanwhile, ETH dipped to $2,140 this week but rebounded to $2,620, still 37% below its December peak. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Kiyosaki Explains Why He Bought More Bitcoin and Gold in Latest X Post , Is There a Silver Lining? While things look weak, there might be a silver lining. Crypto analyst Maxpain highlights that Ethereum’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) metric signals capitulation. Historically, such moments are often a sign of strong price rebounds. Furthermore, whale transactions (over $100,000) have been on the rise since late January, hinting that large investors are quietly accumulating ETH, possibly preparing for a future rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The trusted token’s community has grown to 52,744 holders; even DeFi dad and $RAY skeptic @0xSanti appeared to be getting in on the action with a recent buy. What’s behind this price surge? It’s not just buy pressure from traders that is propelling the token upward. $RAY’s backing entity, @RaydiumProtocol, has been undertaking liquidity maneuvers to keep the token from falling, and these very buybacks and support measures are in the white paper guide for making a liquidity. JUST IN: Solana memecoin $RAY ( @RaydiumProtocol ) price rallies +393.46% in the past 24 hours with 52744 holders, making it the top gainer on https://t.co/X0JJbnERCx — Solsniffer (@solanasniffer) February 7, 2025 The recent surge in $RAY’s price has been accompanied by a new honor for the token: it’s now one of the top five on the Solana network with the highest decentralized exchange (DEX) buy volumes in the last 24 hours. This is no small feat for the asset, which has seen a staggering 150% pump in just four days. A breakdown of the next resistance and support levels will follow. For now, though, let’s enjoy the ride and take a closer look at how we should be perceiving this emerging Solana-based asset. A Strategic $54 Million Buyback The price of $RAY is not just rising because of market speculation and hype. It is also surging because @RaydiumProtocol has implemented an aggressive buyback program. In January 2025, Raydium spent a staggering $54 million buying back 8.8 million $RAY tokens. This buyback has probably been the largest in the history of the platform and shows a commitment to the half path tokenomics of $RAY as well as a substantial floor for the price of $RAY. New: @RaydiumProtocol spent $54M in January to buy back 8.8M $RAY tokens through its programmatic buyback program, hitting a new all-time high in monthly buyback spending. pic.twitter.com/BYJVM73DuG — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 5, 2025 The buyback strategy has impacted the token’s price. The repurchase of the token has had an impressive effect and is making a big difference in the price action of the token. This buyback strategy has had a significant impact on the token’s price, with the increased demand and reduced circulating supply contributing to the sharp rise in value. As more tokens are repurchased and taken off the market, the remaining supply of $RAY becomes more scarce, which can drive further price appreciation if demand continues to grow. This type of programmatic buyback is a common technique used by companies and token issuers to create upward pressure on their assets and reward long-term holders. It is worth emphasizing that the $54 million allocated for buybacks has reached a new peak for Raydium when it comes to buyback spending on a monthly basis. It demonstrates the platform’s commitment to establishing a robust market for its token. And the token benefits not just from price stabilization as a result of the buybacks but also from the actual sign of confidence in its future that the buybacks represent. Top DEX Tokens on Solana Within the Solana ecosystem, $RAY ranks alongside the most heavily traded tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) throughout the network. Across the DEXs in the past 24 hours, it ranked number one for buy volume, beating out other noted Solana-based assets, including $FARTCOIN, $SSE, $mSOL, and $ALPHA. Top 5 tokens on @solana with the highest DEX buy volume in the past 24 hours: 1⃣ $RAY ( @raydium ) 2⃣ $FARTCOIN ( @FartCoinOfSOL ) 3⃣ $SSE ( @usetapestry ) 4⃣ $mSOL ( @MarinadeFinance ) 5⃣ $ALPHA ( @alphaofsol ) pic.twitter.com/R8mFB23QCL — Alphanomics (@Alphanomics_io) February 7, 2025 The top five tokens have had a recent blend of performances, with $FARTCOIN grabbing attention for its remarkable price fluctuations and the by-now predictable strategic buy-ins from major whales. However, in the DEX buy volume rankings, $RAY is making itself increasingly known and liked among traders and liquidity providers on Solana. A token from the Tapestry Protocol, $SSE, and another from Marinade Finance, $mSOL, are also popular in the ecosystem, but $RAY’s 393% surge has catapulted it to the top of the leaderboard. As the Solana network continues to grow, these tokens—along with $RAY—are helping to reinforce the network as a serious contender in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and token-based ecosystems. The Impact of a Strong Community and Network Support The ascent of $RAY can equally be credited to the robust community it has attracted since launch. In just a short span, the number of holders has surged to 52,744, which speaks directly to the burgeoning interest around this token. Yet, what really distinguishes $RAY from many other Solana-based projects is the kind of community it has fostered. The Solana community (and beyond) has coalesced around $RAY, and the community’s pumped-up energy charge serves as $RAY’s primary fuel, both for its ascendant price trajectory and for the price moves we might expect in the near future. The decentralized exchange protocol supporting the token, Raydium, is well-integrated into the larger Solana ecosystem, which supplies not just liquidity, but also a reach into other decentralized applications (dApps). The network’s speed and scalability are major user attractions and are further solidifying Solana as the go-to blockchain for DeFi applications. Additionally, the progress of $RAY should be seen as part of a larger movement of projects built on Solana that are starting to achieve real-world success. As this decentralized push on the network becomes more pronounced, the role of $RAY within the Solana ecosystem is bound to increase. The interplay of solid network effects, well-planned buybacks, and a genuinely enthusiastic community sets $RAY up for a real shot at becoming a significant hit on the Solana blockchain. Looking Ahead: Can $RAY Sustain Its Momentum? Although $RAY’s price is undergoing an uptrend, maintaining that upward momentum remains to be seen. Why? Because upward price movements (aka rallies) are often sustained when there is (1) A REASON TO RALLY (like a strong support level, which we have in the form of a buyback program); (2) CONTINUED DEMAND (that could mean buying or not selling when the token is in the hands of traders and investors); and (3) A BROAD CRYPTO MARKET THAT IS HOLDING UP (which has been the case recently). Even so, the past 24 hours during which $RAY has performed remarkably, coupled with the fact that we have a well-funded, strategic buyback program in place, tells me that $RAY is not just another flash-in-the-pan token. The continued efforts by Raydium to secure the value of our token and the growing interest of the community make me think that the future of $RAY in the Solana ecosystem is potentially very bright indeed. Conclusion The Solana ecosystem has seen its latest favourite in the $RAY token, which has emerged as the surprising top gainer of the past few days with its 24-hour surge of 393.46%. It should be no surprise that avid supporters of the token and the Raydium project are enjoying this latest development. Buying extras in the hopes of a further uptrend is something enthusiasts are likely to be engaging in, what with all this chart business being talked about. And for good reason, too: if you engage with the Solana DeFi landscape, things are looking quite bright (if you own $RAY, that is). Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Notably, the latest US job data indicates a cooling labor market, which could give more space to the Federal Reserve to move with their rate cut plans. However, amid this, top experts predict a potential BTC dip to $90k, while maintaining their bullish outlook on the long-term trajectory of the coin. Bitcoin Price Likely To Hit $90K Before Targeting New ATH Bitcoin price has hovered between $90K and $100K for some time as macroeconomic woes and other concerns have dampened market sentiments. Amid this, top market experts anticipate further BTC decline, which would give more buying opportunities for investors. In other words, despite the short-term woes, analysts remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of the coin. For context, in a recent X post, top crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe identified $90,000 as an ideal buying zone for Bitcoin. According to his recent market analysis, BTC is currently in a “place of boredom,” with price movement stagnating. He believes that a dip to the lower boundary could be a prime entry opportunity for investors. In addition, his analysis highlights $104K as a crucial resistance level. If Bitcoin breaks past this barrier, it could signal the start of a rally toward a new all-time high. “Test the highs again = likely new ATH on the horizon.” van de Poppe explained. Source: Michael van de Poppe, X Echoing similar sentiments, market expert Ali Martinez pointed out that historically, the best buying opportunities for Bitcoin occur when traders face a 12% loss. At present, traders are still in profit by 0.21%, suggesting that BTC might still have room to drop before a significant uptrend. Source: Ali Martinez, X Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Is Poised To Rally Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Signals Bullish Momentum Ahead While short-term price predictions suggest a dip, on-chain data indicates growing long-term confidence among investors. Ali Martinez recently reported that over 70,000 BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past week. Source: Ali Martinez, X Notably, such large-scale withdrawals typically indicate that investors are moving their holdings to private wallets, reducing selling pressure in the market. This trend has often preceded major Bitcoin price rallies in the past. US Job Data Fuels Sentiment One of the key macroeconomic factors influencing Bitcoin price is the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates. However, the latest US job data suggests a cooling labor market , which could give the Fed more flexibility to implement rate cuts. Notably, BTC has soared past the $100K mark after the Labor market released this crucial data yesterday. Meanwhile, lower interest rates generally boost risk assets like Bitcoin by making traditional investments less attractive. Having said that, if the Fed moves forward with its expected cuts, it could trigger renewed investor interest in BTC. Crypto-Friendly Regulatory Environment And Bitcoin Reserve Speculations Donald Trump’s presidency has proved to be bullish for the broader crypto market, let alone the flagship crypto. Having said that, experts are eyeing towards crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the US, which could help boost investors’ confidence towards digital assets. In addition, a flurry of US states is already moving ahead with their Bitcoin Reserve plans. Besides, US crypto czar David Sacks recently said that the US administration is evaluating US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plans. This development, if happens, could further trigger the global race for BTC adoption, which in turn could send the price to a new high. How’s BTC Performing? Bitcoin price today was down about 2% and traded at $95,943, and its one-day trading volume soared 11% to $50.8 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $100,154.14 and $95,653 in the last 24 hours. Besides, the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index stayed at 41, indicating a strong momentum ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) price Adding to the bullish sentiment, a top market analyst recently predicted BTC price to hit $150K , sparking further optimism. It’s worth noting that this analyst is widely followed by crypto market enthusiasts, given his reputation for accurately predicting the BTC bottom in 2022. Having said that, it appears that despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin price is poised to hit a new ATH soon.

40074847,https://nulltx.com/?p=144041,1739015844,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ondo Finance Launches Ondo Chain: A New Era of Hybrid Blockchain Innovation,https://nulltx.com/ondo-finance-launches-ondo-chain-a-new-era-of-hybrid-blockchain-innovation/,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Ondo Finance has made an auspicious advance in the world of blockchain technology by announcing the debut of its new Layer 1 blockchain, Ondo Chain. This watershed event seeks to reconcile the advantages of permissioned blockchains favored by Finance—a.k.a. “Wall Street”—with the public blockchain accessible to everyone, like Ethereum. A Hybrid Blockchain for Financial Institutions As security, scalability, and regulatory compliance become ever more critical in the digital finance world, Ondo Chain aims to satisfy the increasingly complex requirements of both traditional finance and DeFi. It aspires to build a platform where institutions and individual users can interact, almost effortlessly, in a single ecosystem that manages to achieve the best of both worlds—that is, the integrity, decentralization, and transparency of public blockchains, and the trust and accountability provided by the kinds of private, permissioned blockchains enjoyed by financial institutions. Ondo Chain manages this feat, its architects say, by doing what public blockchains generally can’t do: it performs with an efficiency and speed comparable to the kinds of private, permissioned blockchains that are common in the finance world. The new blockchain will depend on a network of permissioned validators, which will play a crucial part in confirming transactions and making sure that the information inside the network is correct and current. These validators will be liable for the correctness of key pieces of information, like asset prices and token backing, which is so essential for financial institutions that work with real-time information and need it to be super accurate. Besides offering a pioneering blockchain infrastructure, Ondo Chain will also add advanced functionalities that enhance security, scalability, and compliance, making it a potentially appealing option for institutions that desire a more dependable and flexible blockchain solution. Partnerships With Leading Financial Institutions As part of the launch, several prominent financial institutions have already agreed to join the Ondo Finance Ecosystem. Some of the most well-known names in global finance have signed on, including FTI Global, Wellington Management, and WisdomTree Funds. These institutions will serve as the lead advisors to Ondo Finance in the design and development of its flagship product, the Ondo Chain. Their role will primarily be to ensure that the chain and its associated products are structured and governed in a way that makes them appealing to firms in the highly regulated financial industry. Ondo Finance $ONDO launches a new Layer 1 blockchain – Ondo Chain #OndoChain will combine the security and compliance features of the types of permissioned blockchains often used by financial institutions with the openness and accessibility of public chains like Ethereum.… pic.twitter.com/hfLMR98DQD — TOP 7 ICO | Crypto News & Analytics (@top7ico) February 7, 2025 These alliances demonstrate how much the conventional financial world believes in Ondo Chain’s promise to change the blockchain world. Working with such well-regarded firms, Ondo Finance is trying to lay down some strong first stones that will make larger institutions riff off them and adopt Ondo Chain, what with its strong compliance and regulatory credentials. If that happens, and if those larger institutions then “ramp up” on Ondo Chain, we will take to calling Ondo’s vision a success. The involvement of these institutions also symbolizes a new stage for Ondo Finance, placing the platform in the creation of a hybrid solution that can serve decentralized applications (dApps) and traditional finance institutions. This could potentially set up Ondo Chain to be a leading blockchain for institutional use while still maintaining the cryptocurrency movement’s ethos of decentralization. A Surge in Activity: $ONDO Token and Market Reactions Substantial market activity has arisen in response to the announcement of Ondo Chain, the native cryptocurrency of the Ondo Finance ecosystem now known as $ONDO. A noteworthy trade illustrates the growing confidence in $ONDO and its use as a long-term investment. World Liberty Financial recently executed a trade in which it swapped 470,000 $USDC for 342,000 $ONDO tokens. World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) swapped 470K $USDC to 342K $ONDO 20 minutes ago. $ONDO has dropped 15% in the past 7 days, but they seem very bullish on the altcoin, continuing to buy the dip. Follow @spotonchain and set alerts for more updates about #WorldLibertyFi … https://t.co/6re2FBCw14 pic.twitter.com/Awr8smKRGb — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 6, 2025 Even though the $ONDO token’s value has fallen 15% over the past week, it still seems to be attracting investment interest. The recent swap by World Liberty Financial for $ONDO tokens suggests a strong belief in the Ondo Chain’s bright future and in the $ONDO token’s potential to recover from its recent slump and grow in value. With this sort of belief motivating actual buying and swapping activity, it seems that investors are quite undeterred by the recent downturn and instead remain optimistic about the long-term value proposition of the Ondo Finance ecosystem and its newly launched blockchain. While the market might be experiencing short-term fluctuations, the project has a lot going for it—strategic partnerships, innovative blockchain features, and major financial institutions as backers. All of this stakes Onto Chain out as a serious contender in the blockchain world. And it’s not just a sleeper hit. Both institutional investors and individual users seem to be watching closely. Looking Ahead: The Future of Ondo Chain and $ONDO Ondo Finance’s journey takes a momentous turn with the arrival of Ondo Chain, but this is hardly the full story or the end of the unfolding saga. As the platform enhances its capabilities and reaches maturity, it promises to be a real shaper of something called the future of blockchain in finance. What drives Ordano Chain toward this goal? For starters, it has significant muscle backing it. Count among its supporters both leading U.S. and foreign financial institutions and technology powerhouses. All eyes will be on Ondo Finance as it attempts to broaden the blockchain base of the $ONDO token. If it can do that and continue to perform as “an expanding dual asset stablecoin,” Ondo could very well become a major player in the blockchain world, offering an intriguing alternative to traditional financial structures. Its recent transition to a token-based model for the payment of its Financial Risk Transfer products is certainly a signal that it’s serious about broadening the appeal of both the $ONDO token and the Ondo platform itself.

Major digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, have been already affected. As a result, many of these investors have been shifting their focus to high potential coins such as Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a meme coin with utility. Ethereum And XRP Prices React To New Tariffs Ethereum price is currently standing at $2,796 , a 0.47% drop in the last 24 hours. While this decline appears minor, ETH’s performance has been under pressure, especially after the news of the new tariff. In the last 7 days, the asset has lost 12.3%. XRP price on the other hand has taken a sharper hit, dropping 4.66% to $2.43 in the last day. XRP, often seen as a major competitor in cross-border payments, is particularly vulnerable to global trade tensions. If Trump’s tariffs spark a full-blown trade war, XRP could see further downward pressure due to uncertainties surrounding international financial settlements. In the last 7 days, XRP has lost even more bleeding by 24%. The market-wide fear has left investors with minimal options, looking for alternative opportunities with higher growth potential. Yeti Ouro Bullish Opportunity Amid Market Turbulence While Ethereum and XRP navigate the choppy waters of economic policy, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is defying the market. Investors searching for high-return opportunities are turning their attention to Yeti Ouro’s, especially for the highly successful presale performance. Yeti Ouro’s presale continues to accelerate, with investors flocking to secure tokens before the price increases in later stages. Currently, in Stage 2, YETIO is priced at $0.017 per token, and the presale has already sold 161,000,996 tokens. Already stage 1 presale investors are enjoying over 40% return on investment after the prices moved from $0.012 to $0.017. The presale is already 60.8% completed and the countdown to Stage 3 has begun with only 8 days remaining. Unlike Ethereum and XRP Yeti Ouro offers stability and massive potential for growth for early adopters. The project allocated 50% of the total supply to presale. Solid Proof Audit Boosts Investor Confidence One of Yeti Ouro’s strongest advantages is its security and credibility. The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain and has been audited by Solid Proof, a trusted blockchain security firm, ensuring that Yeti Ouro’s smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities and built for long-term success. Beyond the impressive presale performance, Yeti Ouro is powering a Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming game Yeti Go. Players can earn YETIO tokens by participating which adds to the utility aspect of the coin. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and well-structured tokenomics, the project has set aside 5% of the total supply burn. At the current momentum, Yeti Ouro is well positioned as one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025.

As the market continues to plow downward, on-chain data is showing increased activity among the sellers. This is us closing out our positions, which is in line with the overall downward move that we’re expecting. I don’t think there’s any credible story at the moment that could reverse this downward momentum and get us back to the highs we were seeing a little while ago. BEAR ALERT: $WIF has tanked 33% this week, hitting lows not seen since Feb 2024. On-chain metrics show more selling pressure, and traders are closing positions. If the downtrend continues, we could see $WIF drop to $0.55. But a bounce could push it back to $1.89! … — ChainGPT AI Agent (@ChainGPTAI) February 7, 2025 Market Struggles and Predicted Price Levels $WIF took a sharp downturn in the past week, losing a big chunk of its value. This steep drop has people worried, and investors are now sitting on the edge of their chairs, questioning whether the asset has any strength left to stage a comeback in the immediate future. Current on-chain metrics, however, indicate that we are continuing to see this bearish sentiment. If that is indeed the case, $WIF might be looking at some additional selling pressure before it can find any support level. Some analysts forecast that if the downtrend keeps going, $WIF could fall further, possibly hitting a low of $0.55. This would mark a continuation of the current downtrend, which has already driven the asset to its lowest price points since early 2023. Nonetheless, traders who are still optimistic see a glimmer of hope. If buying pressure returns, the price could thwart the current downtrend and potentially rebound to $1.89. That price has previously acted as a level of resistance and might now serve as a target for a recovery. A bounce back to this level would provide a very much needed and seemingly overdue help for investors who have been hit hard by the recent sell-off. Currently, market sentiment is cautious, and with several still-present bearish signals, $WIF is being closely watched. The next several days will be key in figuring out if the asset can stage a recovery or if further downside is guaranteed. Whale Activity and Large Withdrawals Even as price troubles persist, whale activity suggests that some significant moves are afoot. In recent days, however, a number of prominent whales have been seen accumulating the asset, even as its price slide continues. These large holders seem to be getting ready for something and are making massive withdrawals across several platforms. Eleven hours ago, a whale identified by the wallet address 4FhF5 made a bold move by withdrawing a substantial amount of $WIF from Binance. The move involved a withdrawal of 9.48 million $WIF, worth $7.17 million at the market price today. When a whale makes a withdrawal like this, it is always a vote of confidence because these big players are usually positioning themselves either for long-term gains or for hedging against a downturn. What makes this even more interesting is that another whale, A3kTT, who had been dormant for two years, made a reappearance just 9 hours ago. This particular wallet address had been silent for 24 months. Its first act of resurgence was to withdraw 6.5 million $WIF. As far as we know, that action put just about 5.19 million U.S. dollars into the hands of A3kTT. And again, this could mean that even the whales lying low for years are starting to engage more actively with the current market environment. In addition, 4x3M8, another whale, withdrew 9 million $WIF (worth about $7.42 million) within the past 11 hours, despite having incurred a significant loss of $1.35 million from their initial trade. This whale, who had previously invested in $WIF at higher prices, is believed to have lost around 8.74% on their position but still decided to withdraw a large sum. The motivations behind this move remain unclear, but it further underscores the importance of whale movements in the $WIF market. More big $PEPE and $WIF accumulations spotted! 1⃣ Smart whale “0xe7d” spent 974.642 $ETH to buy 280.85B $PEPE ($2.62M) ~5 hours ago, now holding 1.404T $PEPE ($13.2M) with a massive $13.75M profit (+328%). 2⃣ Fresh whale “4FhF5” created a new wallet and withdrew 9.48M $WIF … https://t.co/B44u1KyX0s pic.twitter.com/xm6UHpH5Xr — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 7, 2025 Implications for the Market Large pullouts and maneuvers by whales could be taken as an omen of volatility to come. Are these whales getting ready for a future upswing in $WIF, or are they just reacting to—let’s face it—the kind of market we all see around us today? More uncertain is what the future holds for an asset when the few large holders who do exist seem to be increasing their concentrations of stock in just the last few days? The market is still tense, and $WIF’s next steps will likely depend on how retail and institutional traders react to the current downturn. If the big players keep buying, they might give the market the liquidity it needs to stabilize and possibly start moving back to the upside. If, on the other hand, we see more retail and wholesale traders joining the selling parade, $WIF might find it hard to maintain a level above where it is now. Right now, $WIF is stuck in a phase of uncertainty, with forecasts bifurcated between two likely scenarios. One predicts the price could drop to around $0.55, while the other speculates a bounce-back to $1.89 is possible. Meanwhile, whale players keep doing their thing, and the on-chain data continues to reflect overall market mood. So, what will traders do? Until the massive volatility settles into a clear trend, they’ll be doing what they always do: watching and waiting. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

BONK: Solana’s Shiba Inu Coin Taking the Crypto World by Storm Meet BONK, the latest memecoin causing a stir in the crypto world. Based on the Solana blockchain and featuring a Shiba Inu mascot, BONK aims to shake up the status quo. It wants to put power back into the hands of the community, taking it away from big venture capital players. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi spaces. This move makes it a true community coin. BONK’s integration into Solana’s ecosystem is promising. It’s involved in a growing number of decentralized apps, including its own exchange called BonkSwap. However, challenges remain. Its high total supply and the unpredictable nature of memecoins add risk. In the current market, BONK stands out due to its community focus and rapid growth. Compared to other memecoins, it has a stronger connection to an active blockchain ecosystem. For those looking to explore new opportunities, BONK might be worth watching. But as always, do your research and be mindful of the risks. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin Barking Loud on Solana Dogwifhat, known as WIF, is the newest dog-themed meme coin gaining traction on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this token is capturing the interest of crypto enthusiasts looking for the next big community-driven coin. Meme coins thrive on community and viral trends, often born from internet memes or pop culture moments. Among the many dog-themed tokens in the crypto world, WIF seeks to stand out by bringing fun and a sense of belonging to its holders. The potential of WIF stems from its roots in a popular meme and the advantages of the Solana network, which offers fast and low-cost transactions. In the current market cycle, where meme coins can experience sudden spikes, WIF might catch the eye of those interested in high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Compared to other coins, its focus on community engagement could drive its popularity. However, meme coins like WIF are known for their volatile values and large supplies, which can lead to unpredictable price movements. As the crypto market continues to evolve, tokens like WIF highlight the ongoing trend of internet culture influencing digital assets. From Meme to Mainstream: How Floki Is Changing the Crypto Game In June 2021, Elon Musk tweeted about naming his pet Shiba Inu “Floki.” This simple message sparked the creation of the Floki Inu coin, now known simply as Floki. What began as a meme coin has grown into a project with real-world impact. Floki aims to provide utility and charity within its ecosystem. One of its standout initiatives is building schools in less developed countries like Laos and Nigeria. By blending fun with philanthropy, Floki is making a name for itself beyond its meme origins. Floki offers projects that set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. It has launched Valhalla, an NFT metaverse game, and FlokiFi, its own DeFi service. These platforms boost the coin’s usefulness both inside and outside its community. Through a partnership with NOWPayments and the Floki prepaid card, users can spend FLOKI tokens in everyday transactions. This move into NFTs, DeFi , and real-world use makes Floki stand out in the crypto market. While many meme coins depend on hype, Floki focuses on tangible growth. In today’s market, coins offering real value are getting noticed. Floki’s approach could make it an attractive option for those looking beyond the usual crypto offerings. Trump’s Meme Coin $TRUMP Surges 300%, Hits $15 Billion Market Cap Before Pullback Donald Trump’s latest foray into cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, has taken the market by storm, quickly reaching a market capitalization of $9 billion after peaking at over $15 billion. Launched on the Solana blockchain, the meme coin saw an explosive 300% price surge within hours of its debut, briefly surpassing $75 before experiencing some pullback. The initial supply of 200 million tokens is set to expand to 1 billion over the next three years, creating an evolving supply model. While marketed as a meme coin, $TRUMP has drawn significant attention from both crypto enthusiasts and political followers, fueling speculation on its long-term market impact. Despite its association with Trump, the coin’s website explicitly denies any political affiliation or investment purpose, stating it is not tied to any political campaign or government entity. However, 80% of its total supply remains controlled by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, both affiliated with the Trump Organization. These entities will receive revenue from trading activity, raising questions about potential long-term tokenomics and insider holdings. With its rapid price swings and meme coin status, $TRUMP remains a volatile yet intriguing entry into the crypto space, blending politics, speculation, and blockchain technology. Conclusion BONK, WIF, FLOKI, and TRUMP, some of which are Solana-based memecoins, are promising with whale support. But XYZVerse (XYZ) blends sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth, making it a standout.

40075157,https://nulltx.com/?p=144047,1739016430,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whales Buying the Dip on $HYPE as Hyperliquid Solidifies Market Dominance,https://nulltx.com/whales-buying-the-dip-on-hype-as-hyperliquid-solidifies-market-dominance/,"Today, the price of $HYPE has dropped 9%, yet two big cryptocurrency whales are making it clear that they have confidence in the token—and for good reason. They’ve recently scooped up massive amounts of $HYPE, signaling not just a belief in the long-term potential of the token but also an interesting opportunity for us small-fry investors to buy the dip. After all, $HYPE is still very much in the spotlight in the digital asset market. Two well-known investors identified by their wallet addresses “0x336” and “0x643” have made big moves, acquiring hundreds of thousands of $HYPE tokens at an average of $24.04 a token. These guys are clearly bullish and are pushing the narrative that Hyperliquid (the $HYPE platform) offers real potential, even if the recent price action has been a little dicey. If you were looking for a narrative that $HYPE is done for, these two guys certainly aren’t providing it. Whale Activity Signals Confidence Amid Market Dip The first significant whale transaction occurred about seven hours ago when the wallet “0x336” made an enormous purchase of 131,160 $HYPE tokens, spending a whopping 3.15 million USDC to do so. They bought the tokens at an average price of $24.04. Just six hours after that purchase, another whale—”0x643″—made a similar but slightly less big move, spending 1.75 million USDC to buy up 72,792.5 $HYPE. Once again, the purchase occurred at the same price of $24.04. All in all, these large-scale acquisitions of $HYPE tokens could fairly be characterized as a vote of confidence in the token’s future by not one, but two whales. The 9% price drop hasn’t deterred giant purchases of $HYPE by large investors. These “whales” have a long-term vision for the token and may well be predicting a price rebound after the current market fluctuations calm down. Such behavior is typical in our space and presages an imminent $HYPE uptick when market conditions improve. The purchases made by these whales are timed to perfection and reflect the broader trend in the crypto markets where both institutional and individual investors are always watching market movements. It’s a constant vigil that uses all manner of sophisticated tools and data to help make well-timed, and thus seemingly well-informed, decisions. For these whales, the recent price dip of $HYPE appears to be the perfect moment to enter the market. After all, Hyperliquid’s success and the token’s growth potential make a pretty good case for buying in. Hyperliquid Remains Dominant Despite Market Volatility Whale activity comes as Hyperliquid—where you can trade $HYPE—remains a top-tier platform in crypto. Even when $HYPE was down 9% today (it’s currently down about 10%), Hyperliquid was not only retaining its spot as the most favored platform for trading new tokens, but was also leading in open interest for a new token called $BERA—following two previous successful token launches, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Hyperliquid’s unyielding grasp of the market shows how much it attracts investors, particularly those after a dependable and vibrant venue for fresh token debuts. Not only does Hyperliquid pull in an impressive amount of interest, but it also seems to be perpetually positioned at the leading edge of the crypto world. The resilience of both the platform and the token is highlighted by the fact that $HYPE remains a key point on Hyperliquid, even though its short-term price movements have not been great. This suggests that the platform has some serious long-term potential. Hyperliquid is the leader in the open interest for new tokens, and the way in which it has solidified its place in decentralized finance (DeFi) generally makes it one of the most significant venues in the world for these sorts of tokens. Whales are buying the dip on $HYPE ! 1/ Whale ""0x336"" spent 3.15M $USDC to buy 131,160 $HYPE , at $24.04 on average, ~7 hours ago. 2/ Whale ""0x643"" spent 1.75M $USDC to buy 72,792.5 $HYPE , also at $24.04 on average, ~13 hours ago. Despite $HYPE dropping 9% today, #Hyperliquid … pic.twitter.com/MgVB33ltzz — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 7, 2025 Conclusion In summary, the $HYPE whale activity indicates that substantial investor confidence exists. Nevertheless, it’s the opposite side of the fence that is far more intriguing. Hyperliquid’s market strength and relevance—especially when it comes to launching new tokens—remains a crown jewel in decentralized finance. Even with today’s token price dipping 9%, it’s evident that $HYPE whales are signaling unfathomable strength and continued faith in the native token’s future. With all this occurring, it’ll be well worth watching Hyperliquid and $HYPE. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Meanwhile, BitLemons ($BLEM) continues to capture investor attention with its revolutionary GambleFi platform, already securing $1 million in seed funding and positioning itself to disrupt the $450 billion traditional casino industry. Is BitLemons ($BLEM) the Hidden 1000x Gem in the $450B Casino Industry? BitLemons ($BLEM) is transforming the digital gaming landscape with its innovative approach to GambleFi. The platform has already secured an impressive $1 million in private seed funding, demonstrating strong institutional confidence in its vision to disrupt the $450 billion traditional casino industry. The platform stands out with its custom-built crypto casino infrastructure, offering players an unmatched gaming experience. Unlike many speculative GameFi projects, BitLemons is already operational and generating revenue, providing investors with an immediate value proposition. What truly sets BitLemons apart is its revolutionary tokenomics model. The platform allocates 30% of its gross gaming revenue (GGR) directly to community benefits, with 15% dedicated to token buyback and burn mechanisms, creating natural scarcity, while another 15% rewards loyal stakers through generous yield opportunities. NEAR Protocol Dips 31% – Is Cross-Chain Innovation Enough to Reverse the Trend? NEAR Protocol's price action has taken a dramatic turn, plummeting by 31.81% over the past week to $3.17. The sharp descent began at the $4.65 level, showing persistent selling pressure that has driven the token to its current support zone. Trading volume has surged to $211.11M, indicating significant market participation in the downward movement. Despite this bearish price action, NEAR Protocol continues to advance its cross-chain integration initiatives. The protocol's enhanced interoperability between NEAR, Ethereum, and traditional financial systems has earned it recognition as a ""next-gen multi-chain powerhouse"" among trading experts. While the current market capitalization stands at $3.73B, down 6.08%, the platform's expanding ecosystem and increasing staking inflows suggest underlying institutional interest remains intact.

The token's market cap has contracted to $767.69M, though trading volume has surged by 25.99% to $204.01M, suggesting active market participation during the downturn. On the fundamental side, Virtuals Protocol continues to make waves in the metaverse sector with its revolutionary VR event hosting capabilities. The successful execution of a massive virtual gathering, attracting thousands of participants, has positioned VIRTUAL as a potential leader in the digital experience space. While speculation about Fortune 500 brand partnerships initially drove excitement, the recent price action suggests investors are taking a more measured approach, waiting for concrete implementation of these collaborations.

ETF Approval Soon?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-does-the-secs-recent-solana-decision-mean-etf-approval-soon/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be taking steps toward approving new cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a potential shift in its regulatory stance. This is happening even though former President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chairman has not yet been formally confirmed. The SEC on Thursday announced that it is seeking public comments on Grayscale’s Solana and Litecoin ETF proposals, according to two new filings. Industry experts are calling it a significant change of direction, given that the regulator has previously not accepted applications for ETFs that track the spot price of Solana, one of the largest cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin and Ethereum. The SEC also began seeking comments on another Litecoin ETF earlier this year. “The fact that the applications were even accepted into the review process shows that their views have already changed,” said Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, which also filed for the Solana ETF. “Just a few months ago, they weren’t reviewing them at all, and now they’ve officially accepted them into the process.” Related News: What Stage of the Bitcoin Bull are We in? Are We Nearing The End Or Are We Just Getting Started? Since Trump’s election victory, ETF issuers have been ramping up their applications to take advantage of what they hope will be a more favorable regulatory environment. Trump’s SEC Chairman nominee, Paul Atkins, has yet to be confirmed by Congress, but his expected leadership has fueled optimism among crypto advocates. Some issuers have offered highly original ETFs, including products that track specific digital assets tied to Trump’s brand. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., in particular, recently filed trademarks for six investment products, including three ETFs aligned with the president’s policy themes. In addition to soliciting public feedback on Grayscale’s altcoin ETF applications, the SEC is also requesting opinions on whether BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF should be allowed to create and redeem in-kind. While these developments signal progress, they do not guarantee approval, and the review process could take months. Additionally, the SEC has not yet clarified whether specific crypto assets in existing ETF filings will be classified as securities. Current Solana ETF filings treat the coin as a commodity. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What Does the SEC’s Recent Solana Decision Mean?

ETH Whales Continue To Support RBLK,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-doge-bounce-back-as-the-market-recovers-eth-whales-continue-to-support-rblk,"Dogecoin’s price took a hit following Donald Trump’s tariff announcement and the market has struggled to recover. With uncertainty lingering, investors are exploring new growth opportunities. One project gaining attention is Rollblock, a GameFi protocol tapping into the $450 billion gaming industry. Unlike traditional platforms, Rollblock prioritizes transparency and trust, two elements that have long been missing from online gaming. As the market searches for stronger, more reliable investments, Rollblock is emerging as a promising alternative, reshaping the gaming landscape with innovation and security. Rollblock Changes the $450 Billion Gaming Market with Crypto Rollblock is redefining online gaming by merging blockchain security with the thrill of traditional casinos. The protocol operates entirely on-chain, ensuring every game outcome is encrypted and permanently registered on Ethereum. It offers a diverse library of over 7,000 games, including live dealers and sports betting, all of which can be accessed anywhere in the world. Beyond security, Rollblock prioritizes speed. Traditional Web2 casinos take hours – sometimes even days – to process transactions. Rollblock changes that by enabling instant deposits and withdrawals through 20+ supported cryptocurrencies, making the gaming experience smoother and more efficient. This approach has already made Rollblock a rising force in GameFi. In December alone, the platform recorded $1.75 million in wagers, while signups and deposits surged by 600%. Investors have also taken notice, with the RBLK presale raising over $10 million as interest in blockchain-powered gaming grows. At the heart of Rollblock’s ecosystem is RBLK, its native utility token. Priced at $0.053, the token has already delivered a massive 420% return for early investors. The price movement was driven by RBLK’s key role in governance, staking, transaction fees, and Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model. To support its value, the protocol uses up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK from the open market. It then burns 60%, while the remaining 40% are distributed as staking rewards. Crypto Whales Are Selling Dogecoin Dogecoin is showing signs of recovery after a sharp decline. Analysts are now looking for a potential breakout above $0.30 as the market turns around. The price has formed a channel down pattern, which some traders interpret as a Bull Flag – a historically bullish signal. Adding to the optimism, Dogecoin recently tested its 200-day Moving Average for the first time since October 2024 – a level that previously triggered strong rebounds. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could rally toward $0.38, just below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. The recent 40% drop pushed Dogecoin to $0.20, but the price quickly rebounded after Donald Trump temporarily paused tariffs. Despite this, Dogecoin remains below the critical $0.30 resistance level, which must be broken to confirm a shift in momentum. Whale activity remains a big risk for Dogecoin. Large holders offloaded 270 million Dogecoin in just 24 hours, adding downward pressure to the price. If selling continues, the price could go under the expected range. For now, Dogecoin sits at a key decision point, with traders closely watching the $0.30 resistance level to determine whether a breakout is imminent or if further downside is ahead. Is 50x a Real Target for Rollblock? Analysts predict that Rollblock could reach $1 in 2025, potentially delivering a 50x return in under a year. This growth is driven by Rollblock’s strong foothold in the GameFi market, where its blockchain-powered approach to gaming sets it apart from traditional platforms. If Rollblock maintains its momentum, it could outperform Dogecoin, offering higher returns at a fraction of the cost. With its solid fundamentals and increasing investor interest, the protocol is quickly positioning itself as one of the most promising projects in the space.

The launch has sparked a flurry of $BERA claims, but possibly more interesting is the surge in whale activity, with some large investors making quite the scene on platforms like Hyperliquid. One whale, for instance, managed to turn a profit of $589,000 by shorting $BERA, which is a pretty clear sign of the kind of speed and volatility we’re witnessing in the markets post-listing. After $BERA was listed, a whale made a profit of $589K by shorting $BERA in less than 2 hours. He deposited 1.6M $USDC to #Hyperliquid 16 hours ago and shorted $BERA at ~$13. Then he closed the short position and withdrew 2.19M $USDC , making a profit of $589K.… pic.twitter.com/2pN3jaN12t — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 7, 2025 The $BERA launch was one of the most discussed recent events in decentralized finance (DeFi). As trading got underway for the new token, the market reacted with some immediate volatility—one that, as is often the case, several large traders took advantage of. Coming just days after the market’s overall mood had shifted toward bearish, we were led to believe by the trading action that $BERA might, at least for a little while, operate in a counter-trend manner and deliver some quick profits—some of which were booked by a whale who managed to make a profit of $589K in under two hours. Whale Shorting Strategy Yields Quick Profit on Hyperliquid The most notable action occurred when a whale moved 1.6 million USDC into Hyperliquid 16 hours ago to short $BERA at about $13 per token. Within just two hours, the whale had closed the short position and withdrawn 2.19 million USDC from the platform, netting a profit of $589,000. This incident shows that traders with the right strategy (and access to liquidity) can really capitalize on the short-term market movement after a new token listing. The success of the whale shows how liquid and levered platforms like Hyperliquid are for crypto traders. When the whale trades, it’s using a platform most traders can only dream of—a platform on which you can still make big trades without moving the market. That’s the kind of platform that crypto needs, and not for just one or two tokens. Otherwise, the timing of the whale’s trades might be the only thing we’re left to discuss when it comes to the trades being made on Hyperliquid. This event of shorting not only highlights the shorting of $BERA but also the more general problem, as we see it, with emerging exchanges like Hyperliquid. The exchange is increasingly popular with retail and even institutional investors. Its two main young selling points are its supposed ease of use and its liquidity, but if you are an investor (or even if you are just interested in the crypto space), it should concern you that both of these main selling points can be seen as red flags. The whale made a big profit shorting $BERA, but it only took 30 minutes for another major player to step in. About half an hour ago, a different whale went long on $BERA, depositing 2.5 million USDC into Hyperliquid for the occasion. This whale is most definitely not a $BERA bear. If anything, it seems like the confidence in $BERA from the $BERA whales might be picking up after its volatile debut, even if it is on the borderline of being a confidence scheme. A whale deposited 2.5M $USDC into #Hyperliquid to go long on $BERA 30 minutes ago. https://t.co/VufzUD1JTA pic.twitter.com/cA4VEpNjJN — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 7, 2025 Liquidity Dominance: Top Exchanges for $BERA When trading starts for the $BERA token, the leading exchanges by balance indicate where the most trading is taking place. The top three exchanges by balance are: 1. Bybit 2. Bitget 3. Gate.io The liquidity and market depth of $BERA, which is now traded primarily on these exchanges, have grown significantly since its inception. The presence of futures and spot markets, with accompanying advanced order types, has allowed for both retail and large-scale traders to exert quite a bit of influence on $BERA, with the path of least resistance for its price tending to be upward. Increasingly so, $BERA has been trending not just in price but in popularity among traders, to the point where eyes are beginning to turn toward the very real possibility of it becoming the next big moonshot. Bybit, Bitget, and Gate.io are the leaders in the space—at least at the moment. They each offer unique features that cater to different trader preferences. For my money, they are the three best platforms to use if you’re seeking to make a profit from $BERA’s, or just about any cryptocurrency’s, market swings. That said, I also wouldn’t mind rifling through the order books of Binance or KuCoin to see where either of them stands in the $BERA trading competition. And while I do that, I might try and spot Tether, which does have the advantage of being the biggest stablecoin by a long shot, all $83 billion of its market cap. In case you've been hibernating in a cave, @berachain 's mainnet went live yesterday, and $BERA claims have been rolling in. Who’s making moves? Let’s take a look: pic.twitter.com/5HD8qbrvSy — Nansen (@nansen_ai) February 7, 2025 Looking Ahead: $BERA’s Future in the DeFi Space The crypto community is taking notice of the $BERA token. Despite being mostly found under the radar, the $BERA token is currently the top-decentralized (DeFi) market in which to trade because that’s where all the liquidity is. Even though the $BERA token seems to not have much liquidity, it has enough whale trading activity to make it a near-essential decentralized market in which to trade $BERA. The trading of $BERA isn’t super straightforward or easy, but platforms like Hyperliquid and other key decentralized exchanges are mostly how traders trading $BERA can trade $BERA, period. In the previous 24 hours, the market for $BERA has begun to attract some big players, as evidenced by the activity we’ve seen with shorting and going long with the stock. These folks clearly understand the value of making quick, tactical moves. And while their presence could lead to further volatility for $BERA in the near term, that also creates an environment ripe with opportunity for anyone well-positioned to take advantage of what’s happening in the stock. In the end, the direction of $BERA will depend on the token’s evolution within the larger DeFi ecosystem, on its utility, and on the ongoing provision of liquidity by top-tier exchanges such as Bybit, Bitget, and Gate.io. What is abundantly clear, though, is that the launch of $BERA has set the crypto world abuzz, with heavy-hitting investors poised to capitalize on every move the market makes.

40076321,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=127048,1739018855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: Florida Senator Introduces Revolutionary Bitcoin Investment Bill,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/florida-bitcoin-investment-legislation/,"Is Florida about to become a Bitcoin bastion? Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because a potentially game-changing development is unfolding in the Sunshine State. Republican Senator Joe Gruters has just dropped a bombshell in the form of a bill that could allow Florida to invest state funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This isn’t just another crypto headline; it’s a seismic shift that could redefine how states manage their finances and embrace the burgeoning world of digital currencies. Let’s dive deep into what this bold proposal entails and what it could mean for Florida and the broader crypto landscape. Why Florida Bitcoin Investment Could Be a Game Changer Senator Gruters’ bill, as reported by The Block, proposes a significant step: authorizing Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to allocate up to 10% of state funds into Bitcoin . This isn’t a symbolic gesture; it’s a concrete move towards integrating cryptocurrency into the state’s investment strategy. But why Bitcoin, and why now? Let’s break down the potential motivations and implications: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: For years, state treasuries have primarily relied on traditional assets like bonds and equities. Bitcoin offers a completely uncorrelated asset class, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. In a world of fluctuating markets, diversification is key, and Bitcoin presents a novel avenue for this. Harnessing the Growth Potential of Crypto: The cryptocurrency market, despite its volatility, has demonstrated phenomenal growth over the past decade. Investing a portion of state funds in Bitcoin could allow Florida to capitalize on this growth and potentially generate significant returns for its citizens. Positioning Florida as a Tech and Innovation Hub: Embracing Bitcoin investment sends a powerful message: Florida is open to innovation and future-forward technologies. This could attract tech companies, crypto entrepreneurs, and skilled professionals to the state, boosting its economy and solidifying its position as a hub for technological advancement. Combating Inflation and Currency Debasement: Some argue that Bitcoin , with its limited supply, can act as a hedge against inflation and the potential debasement of fiat currencies. By allocating a portion of funds to Bitcoin , Florida could potentially safeguard its reserves against these economic pressures. The Nuts and Bolts of the Bitcoin Legislation: What We Know The proposed Bitcoin legislation is still in its early stages, but here’s what we understand from the initial reports: Key Aspect Details Proposer Republican Senator Joe Gruters of Florida Asset Focus Bitcoin and other crypto assets (specifics of ‘other crypto assets’ are currently unclear) Investment Limit Maximum 10% of total funds in any state account can be allocated to Bitcoin . Decision Maker Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would be responsible for investment decisions. Current Status Bill introduced; legislative process has just begun. It’s crucial to note that this is just the beginning. The bill will need to navigate the legislative process, potentially facing amendments, debates, and votes before it can become law. Public and political sentiment towards crypto investment bill will also play a significant role in its journey. Navigating the Challenges: Is State Bitcoin Investment Too Risky? While the potential benefits of state Bitcoin investment are compelling, it’s essential to acknowledge the challenges and risks involved. Critics and skeptics will undoubtedly raise concerns, and rightfully so. Here are some key hurdles Florida and other states considering similar moves must address: Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Critics argue that investing public funds in such a volatile asset is irresponsible and exposes taxpayer money to undue risk. Managing this volatility and implementing robust risk management strategies will be crucial. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unclear or changing regulations could pose risks to Bitcoin investments. States will need to navigate this uncertainty carefully and ensure compliance with all applicable laws. Security and Custodial Risks: Securing and storing Bitcoin holdings requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. States must implement robust security measures to protect against theft, hacking, and loss of funds. Choosing secure custodial solutions is paramount. Public Perception and Political Pushback: Bitcoin remains a relatively new and often misunderstood asset class for the general public. There may be public skepticism or political opposition to investing state funds in Bitcoin . Educating the public and building consensus will be vital for successful implementation. Operational Complexity: Investing in and managing Bitcoin is not as straightforward as traditional asset management. States will need to develop expertise in cryptocurrency markets, trading, and custody, potentially requiring new personnel and infrastructure. Examples of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Learning from Others Florida wouldn’t be the first institution to consider institutional Bitcoin adoption . While state-level investments are still rare, we can look at examples from other sectors and even countries to glean insights: MicroStrategy: This publicly traded company has famously adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth. Their experience provides a case study in corporate Bitcoin adoption, including strategies for acquisition, custody, and accounting. Tesla: The electric vehicle giant also invested a significant portion of its cash reserves in Bitcoin , demonstrating confidence in its long-term value. While they have sold some holdings, their initial investment signaled a growing acceptance of Bitcoin among major corporations. El Salvador: This nation-state made Bitcoin legal tender, a far more radical step than Florida’s proposal. While El Salvador’s experiment has faced challenges, it highlights the potential for governments to embrace Bitcoin on a national level. City of Miami: Mayor Francis Suarez has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin , and Miami has explored various crypto initiatives, including accepting tax payments in Bitcoin and considering allocating a portion of city funds to crypto. These examples, while diverse, demonstrate that institutional Bitcoin adoption is not a fringe concept but a growing trend. Florida can learn from the successes and challenges faced by these pioneers as it considers its own path forward. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto World? Senator Gruters’ bill is more than just a Florida story; it has broader implications for the cryptocurrency world and beyond: Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: If Florida, a major state economy, embraces Bitcoin investment, it sends a powerful signal to other institutions and governments. It further legitimizes Bitcoin as a viable asset class for institutional portfolios. Potential Ripple Effect Across States: Florida’s move could inspire other states to consider similar legislation. Imagine a scenario where multiple states allocate even a small percentage of their trillions of dollars in combined assets to Bitcoin – the impact on the crypto market could be substantial. Increased Scrutiny and Debate: This bill will undoubtedly spark intense debate about the role of cryptocurrencies in public finance. Expect increased media coverage, expert analysis, and discussions among policymakers, economists, and the public. This scrutiny, while potentially challenging, can also lead to greater understanding and acceptance of crypto. Opportunity for Crypto Education: The debate surrounding Florida Bitcoin Investment provides a perfect opportunity to educate the public about cryptocurrencies, their potential benefits, and associated risks. Clear and accessible information is crucial to fostering informed opinions and responsible adoption. Watch the Legislative Process Closely: For those interested in cryptocurrency and policy, tracking the progress of this bill in the Florida legislature is essential. Understanding the arguments for and against, the amendments proposed, and the final outcome will provide valuable insights into the evolving relationship between government and crypto. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step or a Risky Gamble? Florida’s consideration of Bitcoin investment is undeniably a revolutionary development. It represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency and a potential paradigm shift in how states manage their finances. Whether it proves to be a brilliant move or a miscalculated gamble remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: Florida is pushing the boundaries and initiating a crucial conversation about the future of money and state treasuries. The world will be watching closely to see if the Sunshine State illuminates a new path for institutional crypto adoption.

Recent reports indicate a significant surge in traditional financial institutions embracing Bitcoin ETFs. The latest headline-grabber? PNC Bank, a major U.S. financial institution, has massively increased its holdings in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). This bold move signals a growing confidence in cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class among established players. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it means for the future of crypto. Why PNC Bank’s Bitcoin ETF Investment Matters PNC Bank ‘s decision to boost its investment in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) from $10 million to a whopping $67 million is more than just a numerical increase. It’s a powerful statement of intent. This substantial rise, highlighted by Julian Fahrer, a former analyst at Sequoia Capital, underscores a significant trend: Institutional Investment in Bitcoin is accelerating. But why is this important? Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: When established banks like PNC allocate significant capital to Bitcoin ETFs, it lends further credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate investment. It moves Bitcoin beyond the fringes and into mainstream finance. Increased Market Liquidity: Larger institutional investments bring more liquidity into the Bitcoin market. This can lead to greater price stability and potentially attract even more investors, both institutional and retail. Signaling Future Adoption: PNC Bank’s move could be a bellwether for other institutions. Seeing a major player like PNC increase its exposure to Bitcoin might encourage other banks, pension funds, and investment firms to explore similar investment strategies. Wider Access for Clients: While the specifics of PNC’s investment strategy aren’t fully public, it’s plausible that this move could eventually translate to wider access to Bitcoin exposure for PNC’s clients, whether directly or indirectly through various investment products. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): A Smart Choice? PNC Bank’s choice of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) is noteworthy. With numerous spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the market, why BITB? While we can only speculate on PNC’s specific reasoning, here are some factors that might have influenced their decision: Reputation and Track Record: Bitwise is a well-established name in the crypto asset management space. They have a history of launching and managing crypto investment products, which could instill confidence in institutional investors. Competitive Fee Structure: BITB, like many newer Bitcoin ETFs, often comes with a competitive fee structure to attract investors. Lower fees can be a significant factor, especially for large institutional investments. Performance and Liquidity: BITB has likely demonstrated solid performance and sufficient liquidity to handle large investment flows, making it an attractive option for institutional portfolios. Transparency and Regulatory Compliance: Reputable ETF providers like Bitwise prioritize transparency and regulatory compliance, which are crucial for institutions operating within regulated financial frameworks. Choosing the right Bitcoin ETF is a critical decision for any investor. Factors like fees, tracking error, liquidity, and the issuer’s reputation all play a significant role. PNC’s decision highlights the growing sophistication in how institutions are approaching crypto investments, moving beyond simple exposure and towards strategic ETF selection. The Broader Landscape of Crypto Investment PNC Bank’s increased Crypto Investment isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger trend of institutional interest in digital assets. We’re seeing: Trend Description Implications Increased ETF Adoption Spot Bitcoin ETFs are becoming more widely accepted and utilized by institutional investors. Easier and regulated access to Bitcoin for institutions, driving demand. Corporate Treasury Diversification Companies are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as a part of their treasury management strategies. Further legitimization of Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Regulatory Clarity (Evolving) While still developing, there’s a gradual move towards clearer regulatory frameworks for crypto in many jurisdictions. Reduces uncertainty and encourages institutional participation. Growing Investor Education Increased awareness and understanding of crypto assets among institutional investors and financial advisors. More informed investment decisions and greater confidence in the asset class. This confluence of factors suggests that institutional investment in crypto is not a fleeting trend but rather a fundamental shift in how major financial players view digital assets. It’s a maturation of the market, moving from early adoption to broader acceptance and integration. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin and Institutional Finance What does PNC Bank’s bold move mean for the average crypto enthusiast and the future of finance? Here are some actionable insights and points to consider: Positive Market Sentiment: Institutional investment generally signals positive market sentiment. It can boost confidence and attract further investment, potentially driving price appreciation for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Focus on ETF Performance: Keep an eye on the performance of Bitcoin ETFs like BITB. Their success will further validate the ETF investment route for institutions and retail investors alike. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity remains crucial for sustained institutional adoption. Stay informed about evolving regulations in your jurisdiction and globally. Consider Diversification: While exciting, remember that Bitcoin and crypto investments come with risks. Diversification remains a key principle in any investment strategy. PNC Bank Embraces Bitcoin: A Sign of Things to Come? PNC Bank’s massive increase in its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF holdings is a powerful signal. It demonstrates a growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. This move not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class but also paves the way for further institutional adoption. As more traditional financial giants like PNC Bank embrace Bitcoin ETFs , the future of crypto and its integration into mainstream finance looks increasingly promising. This is a space to watch closely, as institutional investment continues to reshape the crypto landscape.

This volatility may be a sign that the coin has moved into the distribution phase of the Wyckoff Theory. Wyckoff is an old theory that identifies four stages that assets go through. In XRP’s case, it remained in an accumulation phase between 2022 and 2024. It then entered the highly bullish markup phase in November last year. The distribution phase is characterized by high volatility, followed by the markdown phase, which has high supply and less demand. A drop below this week’s low of $1.7900 will be a sign that it has moved to this markdown phase. A bullish continuation will be confirmed if the coin rises above the year-to-date high of $3.3877.

This dramatic action is being set to coincide with two significant events: the ending of the much-anticipated BONKDragon campaign and festivities surrounding the 2025 Lunar New Year. The decision comes at a critical juncture for the project, as the community rallies to build on recent momentum and move $BONK toward greater acceptance and recognition in the marketplace. BREAKING: @bonk_dao introduces a proposal to burn 2.025T $BONK to mark the end of the BONKDragon campaign and the 2025 Lunar New Year. pic.twitter.com/KZQrteAkks — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 6, 2025 The suggested burn represents a substantial portion of the total supply of $BONK, and if put into action, it would dramatically decrease the overall circulating supply of the token. If investors view the proposal positively, as a lot seem to be doing, then they could also view it as BONK’s team taking steps toward making the token more scarce, and therefore more potentially valuable in the future. Along with this proposal, the whole ecosystem seems to increasingly drive serious market activity, with the BONKBot being especially singled out for praise. BONKBot’s Burn Activity and Surging Revenues What has set the BONK ecosystem apart has been the performance of the BonkBot. The Bot, in the last 24 hours, has burned an impressive 848.11 million $BONK tokens, which equates to roughly $14,819 at current prices. This rapid pace of token burns has significantly furthered the project’s overall efforts to reduce the circulating supply of $BONK. In its lifetime, the Bot has burned a total of 614.6 billion and has signaled the death of a not-so-missed 10.74 million dollars. @bonkbot_io has burned 848.11 MILLION ($14,819) $BONK in the last 24 hours This brings the total $BONK burned by BONKbot to 614.6 BILLION At current $BONK prices, that is $10.74 MILLION lifetime BURNT — BONKbot Burn Bot (@BONKbotBurnBot) February 7, 2025 BonkBot’s ongoing success isn’t merely a matter of consuming tokens; it’s also about raking in substantial revenues. DefiLlama’s data indicates BonkBot is reeling in $400 million (annualized figures) as “revenues.” And these numbers are all directed toward buying up $BONK tokens. And if that doesn’t blow your mind, this setup plants BonkBot squarely in the realm of the most vomitous profit-seeking activities imaginable in crypto today. Indeed, if this were a “real” business, we’d have no choice but to view this token-revenue bonanza as an incredibly unsustainable quasi-ponzi scheme. DefiLlama’s revenues for BonkBot has $400m annualized. It all buys $BONk . At $1.3b mcap that’s a “PE” of 3.2. Tech companies normally 25-30 with outliers up to 300. 10b mcap would be rational and euphoria maybe 40b. @theunipcs is right, obviously going much higher… — bakes (@AlphaBakes) February 7, 2025 Such a low PE ratio suggests that $BONK might be a still undervalued token, offering a tempting long-term bet for investors. If the market cap were to rise to some not unreasonable figure like $10 billion, given that we’re onboard with the trajectory that $BONK seems to be on, the PE ratio would likely rise in step. Some wilder speculators posit a potential $40 billion market cap for $BONK in a fantastical next bull run, which would make it a major force in the cryptosphere and the next Capcoin coming down the pike. Market Momentum: Technical Indicators Show Promise In addition to the basics, technical analysis is also displaying positive indicators for $BONK. The TD Sequential, a widely used tool for monitoring price trends and spotting buy signals, has given a strong buy signal on the daily chart for $BONK. This is interpreted by many as forecasting a price rebound that could occur in the not-too-distant future, and it has certainly reanimated the $BONK trading and investing community. The buy signal follows a stretch of market consolidation. With such upcoming events as the proposed token burn and the surging activity around the BONK ecosystem, traders are waiting with bated breath for the next move. If the price of $BONK makes a significant uptick, it could be not just with the reduced supply from the burns driving it, but also bullish market sentiment that’s beginning to coalesce. The Impact of the Token Burn Proposal In recent months, one of the most significant developments for the BONK community has been the proposal to burn 2.025 trillion $BONK tokens. The BONK community has seen several surprises and developments over the past month, but the news of a potential token burn was by far the most positively received. In theory, burning tokens should in a straight-line way correlate with the price increase and with the safety of the asset, and the community was excited for a number of reasons that we have discussed at length. They also were excited because this potentially leads to what I called in a tweet earlier this week the “increased scarcity narrative.” The influence of BonkBot and its consistent revenue generation, when combined with the token burn, make BONK an exciting project in the crypto space. The technical indicators surrounding the project seem to be positive, and the burn rate seems to be accelerating. For the average investor, these developments might create what is sometimes referred to as a “hype cycle,” meaning we could be in for some serious upside. The TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the $BONK daily chart, suggesting a potential price rebound ahead! pic.twitter.com/OIg4x4Uhla — Ali (@ali_charts) February 7, 2025 BONK’s Future Prospects As BONK DAO works to burn tokens and grow the ecosystem, the reaction of the larger crypto market is of concern to us. We are watching that with interest. With the Lunar New Year and the BONKDragon campaign, we have a perfect backdrop for these developments to coincide with a surge of interest from both retail and institutional investors. The increasing burn activity, along with some strong technical signals, has us thinking that BONK may be positioned for an impressive rally. Of course, the nature of the crypto market means that could happen or not happen irrespective of what we think might be happening or not happening. At least, that’s how the crypto market seems to operate. BonkBot’s success and impressive revenue generation also raise questions about what this means for the BONK ecosystem. If BonkBot keeps doing well and keeps burning tokens, we could have a situation where supply and demand changes are self-reinforcing and going in our favor: reduced supply, increased demand, and some natural drift upward in the price of $BONK. Conclusion The $BONK token and the impressive performance of BonkBot are setting the stage for what’s potentially an exciting future for $BONK. With a low PE ratio (not a measure of future performance, but of current valuation), promising technical indicators (not predictions of future price, but indications of future potential), and an expanding real-world use case (that is, a context in which people are using $BONK), we’re seeing signs that $BONK has a shot—according to some in the crypto community—at a breakout when the price goes up and/or the market cap expands.

However, according to a report by cryptocurrency tax platform FinTax , these tokens could encounter tax-related challenges in the future. The report, shared on X, highlights the complexities of calculating capital gains taxes for volatile assets like TRUMP. As memecoins continue to rise in popularity, their rapid price fluctuations and unique characteristics pose significant difficulties for tax compliance and reporting. Understanding Capital Gains Tax in Crypto Cryptocurrencies, including memecoins, are treated as capital assets for tax purposes in many jurisdictions, including the United States. Capital Gains Tax Basics Cost Basis: The cost basis is the original price paid for the asset, which serves as the reference point for calculating taxable gains or losses. Capital Gain or Loss: If the asset is sold for more than the purchase price, the difference is a taxable gain. If sold for less, it results in a deductible loss. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Gains: Short-term gains: Held for less than one year, taxed at ordinary income rates. Long-term gains: Held for more than one year, taxed at lower rates. Challenges with Memecoins Like TRUMP 1. Price Volatility The highly volatile nature of TRUMP and similar memecoins creates significant challenges in determining the cost basis . Example: If an investor purchases TRUMP during a price spike and the price drops sharply before being sold, the calculation of capital gains becomes complicated. 2. Tracking Transactions Frequent trading, which is common with memecoins, results in numerous transactions that need to be tracked for accurate tax reporting. 3. Airdrops and Token Allocations Some memecoins are distributed through airdrops or other mechanisms, further complicating tax calculations. FinTax Analysis: “Airdropped tokens are often valued at the time of receipt, but volatile prices can make this value difficult to establish accurately.” 4. Lack of Regulation The absence of clear regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. adds another layer of complexity to tax compliance for assets like TRUMP. Potential Tax Issues for TRUMP Memecoin Investors Misreporting Cost Basis Investors may struggle to determine the correct cost basis for TRUMP due to frequent price swings. Errors in reporting can lead to penalties or audits. Short-Term Trading Taxes Memecoins are often traded quickly for short-term profits, resulting in higher tax rates on gains. Loss Deduction Limits Taxpayers can only deduct capital losses up to $3,000 per year against ordinary income, potentially leaving large losses unused. Cross-Border Taxation TRUMP’s global appeal may result in tax complications for international investors, particularly in countries with different crypto tax laws. FinTax’s Recommendations FinTax advises both individual investors and regulatory bodies to address the unique challenges posed by memecoins: 1. For Investors Maintain Detailed Records: Track all transactions, including purchase price, sale price, and dates. Use Tax Software: Cryptocurrency-specific tax platforms can automate calculations and ensure compliance. Understand Tax Obligations: Consult with a tax professional to avoid misreporting. 2. For Regulators Clear Guidelines: Establish straightforward rules for calculating cost basis and reporting gains for volatile assets like TRUMP. Education Campaigns: Inform the public about crypto tax responsibilities to reduce errors and non-compliance. Comparing TRUMP to Other Cryptocurrencies Aspect TRUMP Memecoin Traditional Cryptocurrencies Volatility Extremely high Moderate to high Cost Basis Complexity High Moderate Tax Reporting Challenging Relatively easier Regulatory Clarity Limited Growing The Role of Volatility in Crypto Taxation 1. Impact on Tax Burden High volatility can lead to unexpected tax liabilities when gains occur during rapid price increases. 2. Realized vs. Unrealized Gains Taxes are only due on realized gains (when the asset is sold), but tracking unrealized gains is essential for planning. 3. Risk of Overpayment or Underpayment Miscalculations due to volatile prices increase the risk of overpaying or underpaying taxes. Conclusion The launch of TRUMP memecoin highlights the growing influence of cryptocurrencies on financial markets, but it also underscores the challenges of navigating tax obligations in this unregulated space. FinTax’s warning serves as a reminder for investors to prioritize accurate record-keeping and consult professionals to avoid costly mistakes. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, both investors and regulators must adapt to its complexities, ensuring a balance between innovation and compliance.

40076627,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=122376,1739019511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Analysis: Trump Launches Memecoins to Avoid Constitutional Challenges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-launch-constitutional-avoidance/,"Trump’s Memecoin Launches: Strategic Move to Sidestep Constitutional Risks Zack Guzmán, founder of crypto-focused media platform Coinage , has shed light on a potentially significant motivation behind Donald Trump’s rapid release of his meme coins, TRUMP and MELANIA . Guzmán suggests that these launches, especially the release of MELANIA shortly after TRUMP, were strategically timed to prevent potential constitutional violations, which could have resulted in impeachment proceedings. According to Guzmán, “If the release of the meme coin had been delayed even by a single day, Trump might have faced accusations of unconstitutional behavior.” Background on Trump’s Meme Coin Launches TRUMP Meme Coin The first meme coin tied to the Trump name, launched earlier, aimed at capitalizing on the President-elect’s popularity and meme culture. Features a three-year lockup period for team allocations. MELANIA Meme Coin Released shortly after TRUMP, MELANIA introduces a faster unlock schedule with a 30-day lockup period for the team’s allocation, followed by linear vesting over 13 months. Understanding the Constitutional Concerns 1. Potential Conflict of Interest As President-elect, Trump’s direct involvement in projects that could generate significant personal profits raises questions about conflicts of interest. The U.S. Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibits federal officials from accepting financial benefits from external sources, including private enterprises. 2. Timing to Avoid Scrutiny Guzmán highlights that delaying the launch of MELANIA might have given critics more time to scrutinize Trump’s involvement, leading to accusations of exploiting his office for personal financial gain. 3. Impeachment Risks Had the coins been launched after Trump officially assumed office, any perceived misuse of presidential authority or influence for personal financial benefit could have triggered impeachment inquiries. Why Timing Was Critical Launching both meme coins before officially taking office serves multiple purposes: Maintaining Legitimacy By releasing the coins ahead of his inauguration, Trump avoids direct entanglement between his presidency and personal financial ventures. Minimizing Public Backlash A pre-office launch reduces public perception of impropriety, especially as the coins are tied to private initiatives rather than official government programs. Preempting Regulatory Concerns Early launches give regulators and critics less time to connect the coins with Trump’s political influence. Expert Analysis of Trump’s Strategy Zack Guzmán’s Perspective Guzmán argues that Trump’s swift action reflects his awareness of potential legal and political risks. Quote: “The rapid launch of these meme coins demonstrates a calculated effort to sidestep constitutional hurdles.” Legal Implications Legal experts have noted that Trump’s actions highlight the fine line between personal ventures and public office responsibilities, especially as the U.S. government navigates emerging cryptocurrency regulations. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Increased Publicity for Memecoins The Trump family’s involvement has drawn significant attention to meme coins, potentially boosting adoption and market activity. Regulatory Spotlight These high-profile launches may accelerate regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, particularly those tied to prominent figures. Market Volatility Speculation around TRUMP and MELANIA coins could lead to heightened volatility, as investors react to political and market developments. Criticisms of the Meme Coins Lack of Utility Critics argue that both TRUMP and MELANIA lack tangible utility, relying instead on hype and branding for value. Speculative Risks The rapid rise and fall of meme coins often leave late investors facing significant losses, raising concerns about market stability. Ethical Questions Tying meme coins to political figures blurs the line between personal gain and public service, prompting ethical debates. The Future of TRUMP and MELANIA Coins Short-Term Outlook Price Movements: Initial trading activity suggests strong interest, but prices remain volatile. Community Engagement: Success depends on the projects’ ability to maintain public interest and community participation. Long-Term Viability Regulatory Impact: Increased scrutiny could either validate or undermine the projects. Market Adoption: Sustained growth will require utility beyond speculative trading. Conclusion The rapid launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins underscores the Trump family’s strategic approach to navigating constitutional challenges while capitalizing on cryptocurrency trends. While the timing of these launches appears calculated to avoid legal scrutiny, they have also amplified debates around the intersection of politics and personal financial ventures. As these meme coins continue to gain traction, their long-term impact on both the cryptocurrency market and regulatory landscape remains to be seen.

Flush with over $13 billion in profit from its US Treasury holdings, the company is on a mission to plant its flag beyond crypto and deepen its ties to the political elite now that Donald Trump is back in the White House. At Tether’s annual Plan B Forum in El Salvador’s capital last week, CEO Paolo Ardoino made it clear that the company’s relationship with “the establishment” had changed dramatically. The crypto industry felt the heat of regulators for years, and USDT has been a prime target, accused of enabling shady transactions and lying about its reserves. But things look different now, with Trump’s administration stacked with crypto allies. Paolo beamed as he addressed a sellout crowd: “We have been hugged by the establishment… Now they have embraced us.” Trump’s return triggers a flood of Tether investments Tether is using its political connections to ramp up investments across industries, including a $775 million stake in right-wing video platform Rumble. The deal is the stablecoin issuer’s second-largest ever, and it came together through its close ties to Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and Trump’s commerce secretary. Howard’s son, Brandon, played matchmaker, introducing Ardoino to Rumble’s CEO Chris Pavlovski in the Bahamas. Cantor Fitzgerald also helped manage Tether’s reserves and holds a convertible bond issued by the stablecoin giant. Howard himself was under scrutiny as part of his Senate confirmation process, with lawmakers questioning whether his relationship with Tether crossed ethical lines. Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee pointed to a Wall Street Journal report that alleged Tether CFO Giancarlo Devasini had privately claimed Howard would “defuse threats” facing the company. Howard has denied making any promises, saying that he “never suggested anything improper.” Paolo also denied expecting favors from the administration. Still, his firm’s political connections are impossible to ignore, especially with David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar, who also owned shares in Rumble before stepping down from its board just a week before Tether announced its investment. Billions of excess cash fuel shopping spree Over the past year, Tether has dramatically expanded its investment portfolio, which started with traditional blockchain investments like its stake in German crypto-tech company Northern Data AG, but quickly veered into other sectors. Satellite imagery firms, brain-implant companies like Blackrock Neurotech, and even agricultural projects in South America have all secured funding from the USDT issuer. In just three months, its excess reserves grew by $1 billion, larger than most venture capital funds. Tether holds $94.5 billion in US Treasury bills to back its stablecoin USDT. Paolo has been saying Tether is lobbying US lawmakers to prove how its stablecoin indirectly supports the dollar’s global hegemony. But the company knows that its reliance on US Treasury yields won’t last forever, especially if interest rates drop or competitors launch better-regulated stablecoins. To hedge against those risks, the USDT issuer is expanding aggressively, kind of similar to how Saudi Arabia uses its oil wealth to secure its economic future. Paolo confirmed that Tether has pitched blockchain-based tokenization projects to governments, including a proposal in Turkey to create tokens representing borate minerals.

Recent 13F filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicate that prominent hedge fund managers are reducing their positions in AI-related stocks while increasing stakes in Bitcoin-focused investment vehicles. Key Institutional Players and Their Portfolio Changes 1. Israel Englander Who Is He? A billionaire hedge fund manager and the founder of Millennium Management , a leading global hedge fund. Portfolio Shift: Reduced holdings in NVIDIA, a leading manufacturer of AI chips. Increased investments in IBIT , BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF. 2. Yan Huo Who Is He? Founder of Capula Investment Management , a hedge fund specializing in fixed income and macro trading. Portfolio Shift: Divested portions of NVIDIA stocks. Increased exposure to Bitcoin through IBIT. Why Are Investors Shifting From AI to Bitcoin ETFs? 1. Overvaluation Concerns in AI Stocks AI chip manufacturers like NVIDIA have experienced explosive growth, leading to concerns about overvaluation. NVIDIA’s Market Performance: While the company remains a leader in AI technology, its high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has made some investors cautious about future growth. 2. Growing Appeal of Bitcoin Spot ETFs Regulatory Approvals: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major players like BlackRock has provided a more accessible and regulated entry point into the crypto market. Market Stability: Spot ETFs are seen as less speculative compared to other crypto investment vehicles, offering direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. 3. Diversification Strategy Institutional investors are diversifying their portfolios to include Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial market risks, including inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. 4. Long-Term Growth Potential of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s increasing adoption by governments and financial institutions reinforces its status as a store of value and digital gold . Data from 13F Filings The 13F filings , which disclose the quarterly holdings of institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management, reveal key trends: Decreased AI Holdings: A noticeable reduction in holdings of AI-related stocks like NVIDIA. Increased Bitcoin Exposure: Growing stakes in Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT. Implications of These Filings Market Sentiment Shift: Investors are transitioning from overvalued tech sectors to more promising opportunities in crypto. Institutional Validation: The adoption of Bitcoin spot ETFs by large-scale investors signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.

Price Growth Potential: Increased demand for Bitcoin through spot ETFs could drive its price upward. For AI Stocks Potential Correction: Reduced institutional interest may lead to price corrections in overvalued stocks. Focus on Fundamentals: Investors may prioritize AI companies with strong fundamentals and sustainable growth strategies. Expert Opinions on the Shift 1. The Motley Fool Emphasizes the strategic diversification by institutional investors, noting that Bitcoin is becoming a mainstream asset. 2. Financial Analysts Highlight the importance of risk management, suggesting that Bitcoin spot ETFs offer a safer way to gain crypto exposure compared to direct investment in volatile coins. Future Outlook Bitcoin Spot ETFs Short-Term: Increased inflows from institutional investors may boost Bitcoin prices. Long-Term: As adoption grows, Bitcoin could cement its position as a key asset class. AI Stocks Short-Term: Potential price corrections as investors rebalance portfolios. Long-Term: Sustained growth driven by advancements in AI technologies and applications. Conclusion The shift from AI stocks to Bitcoin spot ETFs underscores a significant evolution in institutional investment strategies. While AI remains a promising sector, concerns over valuation have led investors to explore Bitcoin as a viable alternative. The emergence of regulated investment vehicles like Bitcoin spot ETFs is further cementing Bitcoin’s status as a core portfolio asset.

With PEPE down 65% from its all-time high and Dogwifhat dropping 36% in just a week, many analysts believe the meme coin supercycle is coming to an end. However, savvy investors are shifting their focus to high-potential altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and DTX Exchange. While Cardano price eyes new big targets, DTX Exchange is making waves with its hybrid trading platform, already securing $13.5 million in presale funding. Let’s find out more about Cardano price and DTX. Dogwifhat and PEPE Crash: The End of the Meme Coin Mania? There has been a lot of volatility in the meme coin market lately, with well-known tokens like PEPE and Dogwifhat seeing sharp declines. PEPE, for example, has plummeted 26% in just a week and is now 65% lower than its all-time high. Investors are quite concerned about PEPE and Dogwifhat steep decline, which has resulted in the liquidation of nearly $20 million in leveraged holdings. Likewise, WIF has not been spared from market volatility. As of right now, the token is selling at about $0.75, down 36% from the previous week. These declines in PEPE and WIF have led analysts to speculate that the meme coin supercycle is coming to an end. The quick ascent and subsequent decline of PEPE and Dogwifhat tokens raise doubts about the long-term sustainability of meme-based cryptocurrencies by highlighting the risks involved. Cardano Price Forecast: Can ADA Really Reach $15? Despite Cardano price volatility, ADA, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading low but performing well compared to other market players. In a recent X post, well-known on-chain expert Ali Martinez stated a different perspective for Cardano price, suggesting that ADA will soon reach $15. Martinez provided a chart in his post that showed ADA following a historical pattern that resulted in a parabolic surge. He highlighted that if the Cardano price sticks to the same pattern established in 2021, ADA might witness a huge 3,000% surge. Given this finding, analyst Martinez’s $15 target is feasible. However, more factors may influence whether ADA will be able to meet the target or not. These include Cardano price movements, sentiments in the global cryptocurrency market, macroeconomic developments, and its recovery from the accumulation period. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.73, down 4.07% over the previous day. With a trading volume of $897 million and a market value of $25.7 billion. DTX Exchange: The $0.16 Altcoin Poised for Explosive Growth While experts signal an end of the meme coin cycle, DTX Exchange (DTX) has come under the spotlight as a leading player offering massive returns and innovative technology. DTX Exchange is an upcoming trading platform that is stepping into the market to solve problems like high costs, a lack of asset variety, centralization, counterparty risk, and restricted access. It solves them through its hybrid approach that combines the pros of DEX and CEX. Although the performance of this upcoming platform resembles a centralized exchange, the custody component is entirely decentralized. More than 120,000 commodities with over 1,000X leverage margin are available for trading on the platform. Traders will be able to effortlessly trade conventional stocks, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, stocks, ETFs, and a lot more from a single, unified interface. This platform is backed by its layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX. The platform recently launched the blockchain’s testnet, which gave an estimated transaction per second (TPS) of over 200,000. This has left many top players in the market behind, giving an unmatched processing time. Further elevating the game are its distributed liquidity pools, which reduce slippage and provide the best execution pricing by combining liquidity from many sources. DTX Exchange is currently in its presale phase and has proved to be a show-stopper with its stellar performance. The presale was able to collect over $13.5 million in funding from investors all around the globe in just a few months. The price has grown dramatically, currently standing at $0.16 per token.

The plan involved West posting about a fake digital currency on social media and later claiming his account had been hacked, potentially leading to significant financial losses for unsuspecting investors. Eight-Hour Fraud Plan Revealed On February 7, West shared details of the scam via a post on X, where he claimed he “said no and stopped working with the person who proposed it.” He included a screenshot outlining the dubious offer, which included an initial payment of $750,000 to keep the fraudulent post live for eight hours. After the post was deleted, West would allegedly claim his account had been compromised. In exchange for his participation, the proposal promised a second payout of $1.25 million. “The company asking you to do this will be scamming the public out of tens of millions of dollars,” read the message West shared. Shortly after, Kanye West sought direct connections in the crypto space, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, through a private conversation shared in the same post. Community Reactions and Market Buzz Crypto commentators were quick to react to West’s revelation. Armeanio, a prominent voice in the crypto community, suggested West consider using cryptocurrency to sell his merchandise rather than launching a memecoin. “Celebrity tokens generally bring a reckoning on retail,” he cautioned. Meanwhile, Crypto Vic speculated that Kanye West might be building hype ahead of his upcoming album release. “He is a master marketer,” Vic remarked, implying that Ye’s public stance may be strategic. The incident comes amid growing scrutiny of celebrity involvement in the crypto sector. Haliey Welch, known as the “Hawk Tuah” girl, recently resurfaced after the collapse of the HAWK memecoin , which had initially skyrocketed to a $490 million market cap before crashing by over 91%. Adding to the recent wave of high-profile crypto projects, former U.S. President Donald Trump launched his own memecoin in January. Trump’s token initially surged but fell by 38% following the release of his wife Melania’s coin.

Expert Blames Pumpfun But Optimistic On This Viral Utility Coin,https://thecoinrise.com/why-is-cardano-price-crashing-expert-blames-pumpfun-but-optimistic-on-this-viral-utility-coin/,"The ADA price has seen significant volatility recently. The token faces immense bear pressure and is hovering around key support levels of $0.7. The ADA token’s performance has shifted from one of the market’s most bullish and reliable assets to one with a constant bearish trend and no signs of a comeback. With the questionable long-term potential of the Cardano price, investors are moving towards DTX Exchange , which has definite potential to transform the global trading industry with its comprehensive multi-asset trading platform. The DTX token is the native currency of the DTX ecosystem and will give holders immense utility while being a worthwhile investment. Tariff Wars Push ADA Lower Early this week, a market crash triggered by the President’s announcement to implement tariffs on its closest trade partners pushed the Cardano price to almost 50 cents. It has recovered to $0.7, but the ADA token is still marked by significant volatility. Analysts wonder if the correction has been fully priced in or if a more considerable drop is expected. The Cardano price’s pullback depends on external market factors and appears stuck in a holding pattern. Technical indicators give mixed signals, and there is no certainty if the Cardano price can move up or will it take a step back. There has been news that whale activity has dropped in the past week for ADA. The net flow of ADA held by large investors has plummeted by 90%. Perhaps this dip in the Cardano price is an opportunity for retail investors to invest in ADA. The ADA price faces heavy resistance at $0.9 and is struggling to reclaim the $1 level. Once the Cardano price touches $0.9, the bulls can manage to take control, and there could be an upswing to push ADA higher. ADA is at a crucial point. The Cardano price’s ability to break through resistance depends on whale and retail investors’ interest, so bullish momentum can be regained in the face of market uncertainty. DTX Exchange: An Unprecedented Presale Poised for Massive Gains DTX recently progressed to the last stage of its presale, and tokens are selling out at $0.16. The price is set for another hike when listed on a tier-one exchange in a few days. Many crypto analysts predict that DTX could hit $1 as soon as it lists and progress to the fastest bull cycle seen in an altcoin this year. DTX Exchange has reinvented how traditional and crypto trading will move ahead into the future. Conventional and decentralized finance must work together as the digital asset industry grows. The DTX platform will facilitate this merger, and traders will have access to 120,000 fiat and crypto assets on the DTX Exchange.

The DTX Exchange is built on the VulcanX layer-1 blockchain, and in its test net run, it has achieved a speed of 200,000 transactions per second. It is an incredibly fast, intuitive, and user-friendly platform that users can adapt to quickly. Key Takeaways Other features of the DTX platform are access to 1000x liquidity, profit sharing through the rebate program, and the opportunity for token holders to participate in the network’s decentralized governance. DTX Exchange is focused on its mission to bridge traditional finance and cryptocurrencies with its innovative hybrid approach.

DTX is an excellent chance for quick profits before the token rises to more extraordinary highs.

As investors shift focus to developing projects offering superior growth potential, DTX Exchange stands as an industry-leading project which has gained significant attention in this sector. DTX has developed its blockchain platform where users can trade over 120,000 asset classes in one wallet. After gaining more than $13.6 million in its presale, its hailed as one of the most promising ICOs of 2025. DTX Exchange: A Strong Contender for 2025 Multiple investors see DTX Exchange as their preferred choice for the next-generation trading platform since it operates on a proprietary hybrid Layer-1 blockchain framework. DTX sets itself apart from because it links centralized trading (CEX) dynamics with decentralized (DEX) protocols to enable secure smooth market transitions while reducing cost and improving market depth. The combination of CEX and DEX features within DTX appeals strongly to traders who wish to experience centralized and decentralized finance advantages. DTX users can trade their choice of thousands of assets between stocks, forex, ETFs, bonds and cryptocurrencies through a platform that functions as a non-custodial system. The platform successfully repositions its operations to be a disruptive force in the $92 billion global trading sector because it captures retail and institutional investor attention. Investor Demand for DTX Surges Amid Growing Interest Users demonstrate strong interest in DTX tokens as the project sold through successive ICO funding rounds much faster than expected. At a presale price of $0.16 apiece, the DTX ICO is rapidly nearing sellout. With more than 70% of the supply sold, there’s a limited number of DTX tokens in the final presale stage. If DTX Exchange were to take even 1% of the trading market, the pool of 475,000,000 DTX tokens would each be worth $1.84, which makes the current price very appealing. The platform will launch on all top-tier trading exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap, and many more. As DTX enters the last stretch, tokens are in high demand.

Cardano (ADA) Faces an Uphill Battle As one of the most promising blockchain networks on the market, Cardano (ADA) stands out because of its research-based development model along with its proof-of-stake security features. Scarce bullish movement in 2025 has characterized the performance of ADA in spite of its strong fundamental strengths. Like other cryptocurrencies ADA faces decline as its market value remains at $0.75 following a September 2021 peak of $3.10. The altcoin market uncertainty has led to a fall with even the most established projects. The development speed of Cardano is what represents its primary obstacle. The latest network improvement through Plomin hard fork has enhanced Cardano’s governance capabilities yet failed to create adoption rates that would boost ADA price potential. The smart contract ecosystem of Cardano faces competition from Ethereum and Solana since it demonstrates reduced developer engagement. Investors doubt if ADA can duplicate past cycle price surges since it seems to be caught in lasting accumulation patterns. Chainlink (LINK) Struggles Amid Market Uncertainty Decentralized finance (DeFi) relies extensively on Chainlink (LINK) for its oracle services because they enable smart contracts to access real-world data. However, the technological significance of LINK cannot save it from its ongoing difficulty to continue moving upward in value. The current market value of Chainlink stands at $20.38 at the time of writing with a major price drop from its peak of $52.88 in May 2021. Major partnerships between institutions and blockchain projects fail to demonstrate an accurate impact on LINK token price levels. Market participants feel disappointed due to this divergent relationship, which causes traders to sell off Chainlink while searching for higher potential return assets. Several industry analysts express doubts about LINK’s future leadership position in oracle solutions since competitors keep launching new alternatives during the next several years. Conclusion: The Shift Towards High-Growth Assets is Underway The current short-term market movements indicate that Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) suffer from significant selloffs. DTX Exchange has positioned itself as a promising industry newcomer through its hybrid trading model, which provides scalable security features for investors. Analysts predict that DTX Token will exceed the performance of established projects such as ADA and LINK throughout the upcoming months. The integration of various institutional relationships and the tremendous ecosystem expansion positions DTX to become a major player in the coming months.

40076744,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=122729,1739019675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Why Trump Launched Memecoins: “If You Can’t Stop It, Use It”",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoins-free-market-approach/,"Trump’s Memecoin Strategy: Embracing a Free Market Approach As the debate around cryptocurrency and its regulation heats up, Donald Trump , the President of the United States, has taken a unique stance by launching his own meme coin, TRUMP . Analysts suggest that Trump’s philosophy is rooted in a pragmatic approach: “If you can’t stop it, use it.” This strategy not only embraces the unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies but also positions the TRUMP memecoin as a symbol of the free-market ethos underpinning his administration’s policies. TRUMP Memecoin: A Liquidity Magnet One of the most striking aspects of TRUMP is its ability to act as a “black hole” for global liquidity, absorbing investments from individual investors worldwide. Key Highlights of TRUMP Memecoin Global Appeal: The TRUMP coin’s celebrity association and meme-driven marketing have made it a viral phenomenon, attracting investors across borders. Infinite Possibilities: The memecoin trend demonstrates the boundless creativity of the crypto market. TRUMP is just one of many celebrity-linked coins, but its symbolism as a political statement sets it apart. Free-Market Philosophy: Rather than pushing for stringent regulations, the Trump administration has chosen to embrace the decentralized and free-market principles of cryptocurrency. “If You Can’t Stop It, Use It”: Trump’s Philosophy on Memecoins 1. The Inevitability of Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies have grown into a global phenomenon, with widespread adoption making them impossible to ignore. By launching a memecoin, Trump acknowledges this inevitability, aligning himself with the movement rather than opposing it. 2. A Free-Market Experiment The Trump administration’s decision to “accept a free market instead of regulating it” reflects a belief in minimal government interference, even in an industry as volatile and disruptive as crypto. Quote: “Memecoins can take countless forms in the future, and their potential is infinite.” 3. A Symbol of Modern Populism TRUMP coin embodies the populist appeal of Trump’s political brand, leveraging his global recognition to create a cryptocurrency that resonates with his supporters and beyond. The Role of Celebrity Memecoins Memecoins tied to high-profile figures like Donald Trump represent a new frontier in cryptocurrency. Marketing Power: Celebrity involvement creates instant visibility and credibility. Investor Psychology: Fans and followers are more likely to invest in a token associated with someone they admire. Cultural Influence: These coins are not just financial instruments but cultural phenomena. Challenges and Criticisms of Trump’s Memecoin Strategy Regulatory Risks: Critics argue that by avoiding regulation, the TRUMP coin opens the door to market manipulation and speculative bubbles. Market Volatility: Memecoins are inherently volatile, and their price movements often leave late investors with significant losses. Ethical Concerns: Tying a cryptocurrency to a political figure raises questions about conflicts of interest and the blending of personal financial ventures with public office. What Does TRUMP Memecoin Represent for the Crypto Market? 1. A Shift Toward Decentralization The launch of TRUMP signals a growing acceptance of decentralized financial systems, even among traditional power structures. 2. Mainstream Adoption High-profile memecoins like TRUMP encourage broader participation in the crypto market, introducing new investors to the ecosystem. 3. The Future of Celebrity Coins TRUMP’s success may inspire other public figures to launch their own cryptocurrencies, expanding the memecoin market exponentially. Comparing TRUMP to Traditional Cryptocurrencies Aspect TRUMP Memecoin Traditional Cryptocurrencies Utility Limited (primarily symbolic) Functional use cases (e.g., payments, smart contracts) Volatility Extremely high Moderate to high Regulation Unregulated Varies by jurisdiction Market Drivers Hype, celebrity appeal Adoption, innovation, regulation How the Free-Market Approach Shapes Crypto Regulation By choosing to embrace memecoins, the Trump administration underscores its commitment to fostering innovation in a free-market environment. Advantages of the Free-Market Approach Encourages Innovation: Minimal regulation allows for creativity and rapid development. Attracts Global Investors: A permissive environment makes the U.S. a hub for crypto activity. Reduces Bureaucratic Barriers: Streamlined processes enable faster adoption and integration of new technologies. Potential Risks Market Manipulation: Without oversight, bad actors could exploit the system. Investor Losses: Inexperienced investors may face significant financial risks. Conclusion Donald Trump’s launch of the TRUMP memecoin exemplifies his administration’s philosophy: “If you can’t stop it, use it.” By embracing the unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies, the Trump administration has signaled a willingness to adapt to the realities of a decentralized financial future. While the TRUMP memecoin’s success highlights the potential of celebrity-driven cryptocurrencies, it also raises questions about market stability, regulation, and the long-term implications of this approach. As memecoins continue to evolve, their role in shaping the future of finance and culture cannot be ignored.

Stotz has a clear vision and plan for expanding TON into the U.S. He is aligning the foundation’s overall strategy with the expected pro-crypto policies that could come back into play if former president Donald Trump returns to the Oval Office. This might-friendly environment would be one in which Stotz and his team could really push for mass adoption of TON and its native cryptocurrency, Toncoin ($TON), especially among U.S. retail users. NOW: The new TON Foundation president, Manuel Stotz, plans to expand The Open Network ($TON) into the US, aligning with Trump’s anticipated pro-crypto policies and aiming to boost retail adoption. pic.twitter.com/Sgc7CwD8L0 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 6, 2025 As one of the most ambitious Web3 projects to date, TON’s growth shows no signs of letting up. Already having an impressive 2.5 million active users on its network, and with over 9.5 billion MAUs on Telegram—the platform underpinning the TON blockchain—TON Foundation has set its sights on a massive increase in Web3 adoption. By 2028, the ambitious outfit aims to on-ramp an astounding 500 million Telegram users, using the immense scale of the messaging app to introduce a veritable flood of users to dApps and crypto. Expanding TON’s Reach in the U.S. Market Under Stotz’s leadership, one of TON’s major priorities is to expand into the United States. That is seen as very important for the project’s global positioning, because it really has to be part of the U.S. scene to be taken seriously by anyone. The U.S. has been a big player in the whole cryptocurrency world. But regulatory uncertainty has too often kept many projects from fully establishing a presence here. Still, with the increasing likelihood of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, under Trump’s policies, it seems, TON is looking to capitalize on this potential shift to drive mainstream adoption in the U.S. The plans of the TON Foundation in the direction of a pro-crypto U.S. presidency coincides with a time in which the U.S. government is starting to adopt a more friendly stance toward blockchain technologies. This partnership could be incredibly beneficial if all goes well, allowing $TON to zoom past several other blockchain projects and be among the leaders in the U.S. market. That’s particularly interesting since this market seems to be growing much more friendly toward crypto in recent weeks and months. With its growing network and its strong retail focus, TON seems well-positioned to shape the future of this increasingly friendly U.S. crypto market on at least some level. Telegram’s Vast User Base Fuels TON’s Potential An integration with Telegram, which has a huge and varied user base, is one of the most singular advantages that TON has. With 9.5 billion Monthly Active Users (MAUs), Telegram represents an untrammeled opportunity for Web3 adoption. Because of its global reach and usage, TELEGRAM may offer up TON to millions of users as an entry point into the world of blockchain and decentralized applications. #GateResearch TON’s explosive growth is just beginning. With 9.5B MAUs on Telegram and 2.5M users on the TON network, the potential for Web3 adoption is huge. By 2028, TON plans to onboard 500M Telegram users. Read more: https://t.co/7TOHnPVY2V #TON #Web3 #Blockchain … pic.twitter.com/XW9xqM3odQ — Gate.io (@gate_io) February 6, 2025 TON is working to make cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) accessible to everyone. It has a global audience reach of half a billion people, an integration within the platform that allows for a user-friendly interaction, and a currency system that operates seamlessly within the app itself, as well as through other Telegram ecosystem dapps. It has everything it needs to work that magic carpet ride and take us half a billion strong to a world where cryptocurrency and DeFi are accessible and usable by the masses. The plan to bring on 500 million Telegram users by 2028 is not merely ambitious. It is a reflection of the huge untapped potential of the Web3 space. With the already-millions of people using Telegram daily, the presence within this ecosystem of TON and the blockchain that it represents could serve to accelerate the adoption of both blockchain technology and use of the Toncoin ($TON) utility token for within-network applications to an even greater extent than we otherwise might have expected. Whale Movements Signal Growing Interest in TON In the preceding week, there have been several significant movements by whales on the TON network. From wallets identified as whale wallets, a total of 1.43 million $TON has been moved. As we know, whale activity is often a key indicator of a market’s sentiment, and this movement certainly has the appearance of signaling something positive for Toncoin. We now look at these transactions to see what they might reveal about the token’s future orientation, with the network’s growing user base along with its ongoing developmental push. Whales moving such a large amount of Toncoin may signal a sudden uptick in the overall belief in the long-term value of the project, particularly as the TON Foundation steps up its expansion efforts. A committed and visible foundation is a positive for any crypto project, and the use case for TON is rather clear. It’s a blockchain designed for not only using toncoin but for running other contracts and programs—especially not using Ethereum, in its current prime form—so when whales do this, it seems to indicate something. Over the past week, 1.43 million #Toncoin $TON have moved from whale wallets. Watching closely to see how this plays out! pic.twitter.com/TAUk1OjJig — Ali (@ali_charts) February 7, 2025 A Bright Future for TON and Web3 Under Stotz’s leadership, the TON Foundation has positioned itself to capitalize on the gigantic global user install base of Telegram, to not only tend to the global push of the $TON (TON) ecosystem and its adventure into the Web3 world but also to take those plans and push them into the mega market of the United States. The way things are looking no, those plans and Telegram’s U.S. user base could quite possibly be one of the neighboring forces that bring about a brighter, more prosperous, and legal future for cryptocurrency. Besides its strategic growth, the whale movements on the TON network showcase the swelling interest from institutional investors and big-scaled stakeholders who are starting to grasp the potential of the TON blockchain. With a goal of onboarding 500 million Telegram users by 2028, TON’s path toward growth looks incredibly promising and seems, at least for now, to be preserving the decentralized values of Way for a revolution in the way people interact with Web3 technologies. As $TON keeps gaining traction, it will be fascinating to watch the integration with Telegram and the push into the U.S. market unfold. With a solid basis, clear strengths, and some pretty soaring ambitions, TON seems set to become a linchpin in the decentralized-finance and Web3 space. Conclusion The future of TON looks very bright under the leadership of Manuel Stotz. With an ambitious expansion plan into the U.S., a goal of onboarding 500 million Telegram users by 2028, and the deep interest from whales and investors, TON is set for some serious growth in the next few years. As the push for crypto regulation moves forward, the TON Foundation, too, seems well-positioned for success. We see the potential for Toncoin to be among the key winners in the race toward the global cryptocurrency market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account, Bitcoin Magazine labeled TRUMP a “shitcoin,” sparking a flurry of debate within the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin Magazine’s Statement Bitcoin Magazine has long been a champion of Bitcoin and the broader principles of decentralized, trustless financial systems. Its critique of TRUMP stems from several perceived issues: Quote from X Post: “Solana-based memecoin TRUMP of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a shitcoin .” Key Issues Highlighted: Speculative Nature: TRUMP, like many memecoins, is seen as a speculative asset with no intrinsic utility. Association with Solana: Bitcoin maximalists are skeptical of alternative blockchain networks, viewing Bitcoin as the only legitimate cryptocurrency. Perceived Lack of Value: TRUMP is criticized for being purely hype-driven, with no clear roadmap or use case. What Is the TRUMP Memecoin? The TRUMP memecoin was launched ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration, aiming to capitalize on his brand and appeal. Built on the Solana blockchain , it entered a market already saturated with meme-driven tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. TRUMP Tokenomics: Total Supply: 100 billion tokens. Team Allocation: 35% locked for 3 years. Community Allocation: 20%. Utility: None announced beyond speculative trading. Why Bitcoin Maximalists Oppose Memecoins 1. Focus on Fundamentals Bitcoin maximalists prioritize projects that align with Bitcoin’s core principles: decentralization, censorship resistance, and a finite supply. 2. Lack of Utility Memecoins like TRUMP are often criticized for lacking meaningful use cases. Instead, they rely on celebrity endorsements and social media hype. 3. Reputational Risks The proliferation of memecoins has led to scams, rug pulls, and extreme price volatility, tarnishing the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. 4. Diversion from Bitcoin Adoption Memecoins are seen as distractions, diverting attention and resources from the goal of increasing Bitcoin adoption. Supporters of TRUMP Memecoin Despite criticism, TRUMP has gained traction in some circles: Celebrity Influence: The association with Donald Trump gives the coin immediate recognition and a dedicated following. Speculative Gains: Traders are drawn to TRUMP for its potential to generate quick profits amid market hype. Solana Network Benefits: TRUMP leverages Solana’s low fees and high transaction speeds to attract users. Impact of Bitcoin Magazine’s Criticism The statement from Bitcoin Magazine has intensified the divide between Bitcoin maximalists and memecoin proponents. 1. Reinforced Purist Sentiment Bitcoin maximalists see the critique as validation of their skepticism toward altcoins and memecoins. 2. Market Reaction The negative publicity could affect TRUMP’s trading volume and investor confidence, although its impact remains to be seen. 3. Broader Debate on Crypto Purpose The clash highlights ongoing debates about the role of cryptocurrencies: Should they be serious financial tools like Bitcoin? Or can they exist as speculative, meme-driven assets? Conclusion Bitcoin Magazine’s labeling of TRUMP as a “shitcoin” reflects a broader tension within the cryptocurrency community. While memecoins like TRUMP thrive on hype and celebrity branding, Bitcoin purists view them as undermining the credibility of the crypto market.

40076854,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=122439,1739019932,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump Memecoin Faces Securities Allegations: Forbes Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-securities-allegations-forbes/,"Trump Memecoin Accused of Securities Misconduct: Forbes Analysis A recent Forbes article by Alexandra Andhov, a law professor at Auckland University, has raised serious allegations against TRUMP , the Solana-based memecoin issued by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Andhov asserts that TRUMP aligns with the Howey Test , a standard used to determine whether an asset qualifies as a security under U.S. law. If proven, these allegations could have significant legal implications, even as the incoming Trump administration is expected to usher in new cryptocurrency regulations. What Is the Howey Test? The Howey Test , established by the U.S. Supreme Court, identifies four key criteria to determine whether an asset is a security: Monetary Investment : Involves investing money or assets. Common Enterprise : Investors pool resources into a shared venture. Expectation of Profit : Investors anticipate financial returns. Efforts of Others : Returns rely on the actions of a third party, such as promoters or managers. According to Andhov, TRUMP satisfies all four elements of the Howey Test, raising the possibility that it could fall under securities regulation . How TRUMP Meets the Securities Criteria 1. Monetary Investment Andhov argues that TRUMP qualifies as a monetary investment since the public can purchase the tokens using fiat or cryptocurrency. 2. Common Enterprise Trump-affiliated entities reportedly control 80% of the token supply , and the tokenomics suggest a coordinated effort to tie investor returns to the project’s success. The token supply is set to expand from 200 million to 100 billion over three years, further linking investor gains to the project’s performance. 3. Expectation of Profit TRUMP’s marketing has fueled investor expectations of price gains , evident from its dramatic price fluctuations. Investors were drawn to the token not for utility but for speculative financial returns. 4. Efforts of Others Andhov highlights Trump’s active involvement in marketing and token supply decisions , stating that investor returns are heavily dependent on his efforts and brand. Legal Implications for TRUMP Memecoin 1. SEC Regulation If TRUMP is deemed a security, it would be subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. Compliance Requirements: Registration as a security. Disclosure of financial and operational information to investors. Potential Violations: Failure to comply with securities laws could result in penalties, fines, or enforcement actions. 2. Shift in Regulatory Environment While the Trump administration is expected to introduce crypto-friendly policies , existing securities laws remain enforceable. Andhov warns, “Even under a pro-crypto administration, existing securities laws cannot be ignored.” Criticism of TRUMP Memecoin Transparency Issues The lack of clarity around tokenomics, particularly the large allocation to Trump-affiliated entities, has raised concerns about transparency. Price Manipulation Dramatic price swings shortly after the token’s release suggest potential market manipulation. Ethical Questions The involvement of a sitting U.S. President-elect in a speculative financial product blurs the lines between personal ventures and public office responsibilities. Supporters’ Counterarguments Despite the criticism, supporters argue that TRUMP represents: Innovation in Finance: The memecoin demonstrates how celebrity branding can drive adoption in the crypto space. Decentralized Market Dynamics: Backers claim that the token operates within a free-market system, where investor choice dictates its value. Legal Gray Areas: Proponents contend that the evolving regulatory environment leaves room for tokens like TRUMP to innovate outside traditional frameworks. Expert Opinions on TRUMP’s Legal Risks Alexandra Andhov (Forbes Contributor) Quote: “TRUMP satisfies all four elements of the Howey Test. Its launch timing, dramatic price fluctuations, and centralized control make it a clear candidate for securities classification.” Regulatory Analysts Many agree that TRUMP’s structure and marketing strategy could attract scrutiny from the SEC, even under a pro-crypto administration. Crypto Advocates Some argue that the SEC’s application of the Howey Test is outdated and unsuitable for decentralized assets like memecoins. Conclusion The allegations that TRUMP memecoin may qualify as a security highlight the complexities of navigating cryptocurrency regulation in a rapidly evolving market. While the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly stance may shift the regulatory landscape, it remains unclear whether TRUMP can avoid scrutiny under existing securities laws. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to mature, the case of TRUMP serves as a critical example of the challenges and opportunities that arise when traditional financial frameworks intersect with innovative digital assets.

January 3, 2025, marked the 16th birthday of Bitcoin ( BTC ), the world’s first-ever cryptocurrency. It has come a long way since—inspiring an entire industry of rival cryptocurrencies, exchanges, digital wallets, and trading apps, all of which contributed to a blockbuster year for the crypto sector in 2024. You might also like: Will Bitcoin survive the coming financial collapse? | Opinion Interest from the retail and institutional sectors were major drivers of this growth, but the emergence of new forms of cryptocurrency, such as memecoins and “rug pull” scams, where developers pull the plug on an upstart crypto project, leaving investors high and dry, have discouraged retail investors in particular from pursuing their interest in crypto investment. The launch of the HAWK memecoin in early December 2024, associated with the viral social media personality Hailey Welch, is just one example of how badly things can go wrong. Having initially soared to a $490m market capitalization, the HAWK memecoin’s value dropped by around 90% within hours of its December 4 launch date. A group of investors has since filed a lawsuit against the creators of the memecoin, accusing them, among other things, of engaging in misleading market practices. Subsequent mainstream media coverage of the issue has only added to a growing feeling of unease and skepticism, deterring investors from entering the market. The cost of inexperience At the heart of the problem lies a pronounced lack of experience from crypto founders in the web3 space. While many founders hold a degree of technical proficiency in blockchain development, they lack the business acumen and commercial savvy needed to launch a successful crypto product and gain real world enterprise adoption—anything from proper customer discovery sessions in order to understand pain points and use cases, negotiating deals, brand identity building, marketing, promotion to PR support. These supplementary skills are a foundational part of building and sustaining a successful business venture. Their absence has resulted in a proliferation of memecoins that are able to raise huge sums of money, occasionally propped up by a high-profile celebrity, but are ultimately unable to deliver on their promises. By not focusing on establishing a strong business foundation, too many of these projects are often doomed to fail. From innovation to incubation To address the problem, we need to look outside the industry and shift our focus from innovation to incubation and adoption. Specifically, non-crypto native incubation hubs hire experienced professionals from a range of industries, from software as a service (SaaS) to business development, marketing, and branding. Collectively, this knowledge would be used to evaluate, review, and vet cryptocurrency projects for their financial viability. This crucial outsider perspective, where individuals from a wide range of backgrounds evaluate proposals free from the hype that often clouds new product launches in the crypto space, will help put an end to all the fake promises of founders who are merely looking to make a quick buck at the expense of investors. Instead, these hubs would be able to determine which crypto products have genuine potential, restoring trust and security to a sector that has been tarnished by a combination of inexperience and ineptitude. Strategy is everything The crux of the matter is any successful business venture depends on a fusion of not only ideation and innovation but also strategy and execution. That means creating a strategic roadmap that fuses market positioning, growth projections, and approaches for long-term value creation with risk management considerations, particularly when it comes to mitigating possible “rug pull” events associated with cryptocurrency launches. The integration of non-crypto native expertise through incubation hubs is a powerful way to nurture a more stable and trustworthy crypto ecosystem, marrying both the innovative spirit of the crypto ecosystem with robust tried-and-tested business principles. Only then can the industry move beyond the era of hype-driven fads towards products that provide tangible real-world utility and deliver on the promise inherent to decentralized technologies.

40076899,https://nulltx.com/?p=144079,1739020061,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP ETF Filings and Strategic Partnerships Propel the Future of XRPL Ecosystem,https://nulltx.com/xrp-etf-filings-and-strategic-partnerships-propel-the-future-of-xrpl-ecosystem/,"The exciting development surrounding Ripple’s $XRP in the world of cryptocurrency has to do with the application for an ETF tied to $XRP . Several major investment funds have applied to launch an ETF tied to $XRP. They are 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and WisdomTree. Their applications signify the growing appeal of $XRP among not just retail investors but also institutional investors. And this development comes against the backdrop of a generally maturing cryptocurrency market, a market in which more and more traditional financial institutions appear to be interested in integrating digital assets into financial products. Institutional Interest in XRP Soars Some of the most prominent asset managers in the industry have filed for ETF applications for $XRP. This is a big deal for Ripple and the cryptocurrency climate in general. Why? Because an ETF would provide both retail and institutional investors a more accessible and regulated means through which they could invest in $XRP—without the confusing and often daunting prospect of directly holding or trading in a cryptocurrency. Thrilled to announce our groundbreaking partnership with Girin Wallet to revolutionize the XRPL ecosystem! We're bringing Supertransactions to $XRP , making multi-chain operations as simple as a single click. No more juggling gas fees or complex bridging steps! Key features:… https://t.co/RUbGxALg59 — Biconomy (@biconomy) February 7, 2025 Vehicles such as the 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and WisdomTree have been crucial to the advancement of exchange-traded products for cryptocurrencies. Their interest in $XRP, however, goes beyond expressing a desire to provide products related to the token. The very presence of such firms in the $XRP space—a sign of increasing confidence in the token’s future—hints at a potentially exceptional development story for $XRP. Of course, should these firms secure the various approvals needed to launch an $XRP ETF, that would be the real story. Whales Capitalize on Market Dip With the interest of institutions in $XRP growing rapidly, retail investors are also keeping a close eye on the asset. After the recent market dip, large-scale crypto investors took advantage of the situation and went on a buying spree, accumulating a staggering amount of $XRP. In just a few days, these “whales” netted 520 million $XRP, which speaks volumes about their confidence (and maybe our collective confidence?) in the token’s long-term potential. The crypto community is closely watching these large transactions, since they obviously involve—by definition—large amounts of crypto. What’s more, market sentiment is always an aspect of trading whales that the community pays attention to. And for us to have luxury whales accumulating $XRP in a down market, that’s positive sentiment to project into the community. So obviously, we have to consider the prospect of positive developments for not just Ripple, but its entire network, since that’s what’s going to make the community perceive the price of $XRP positively. Groundbreaking Partnership: Biconomy and Girin Wallet In another exceptional development, Biconomy has entered into a strategic partnership with Girin Wallet to continue to revolutionize the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. This collaboration takes aim at the user experience for those interacting with $XRP and the XRPL, attempting to make it as simple as possible for them to engage in multi-chain transactions. One of the key features of this partnership is the introduction of “Supertransactions” to the XRPL, which are designed to streamline cross-chain operations. This new feature allows users to execute transactions seamlessly across different blockchain networks with a single click. Traditionally, users have had to navigate complex steps to complete multi-chain transactions, often dealing with multiple gas fees, bridging processes, and sometimes, complicated interfaces. The integration of Supertransactions into the XRPL removes these barriers and offers a frictionless experience that could drive mass adoption of applications built on top of the XRPL. Biconomy’s Multi-Execution Engine (MEE) has changed the rules of the game. Previously, when a user made a transaction on a blockchain, they were directly responsible for the gas fee of that particular transaction—as well as potentially several other associated transactions. Paying these gas fees was often a pain point because of the price and inconvience involved. MEE operates under the principle that it should not be the user, but rather the system as a whole, that incurs this cost. The gas fee is now an abstracted feature of the system, benefiting the user. The Future of the XRP Ecosystem With the excitement around the filing of an ETF continuing to build, and with what partnership like the one between Biconomy and Girin Wallet do to push the envelope of real-world, XRPL-based possibilities, institutional interest in $XRP seems to be heading ever-forward. And why wouldn’t it? On the regulatory front, $XRP is looking clearer all the time, and it’s not just an ETFs-related story. Biconomy’s Supertransactions and the new multi-chain capabilities they bring are just the tip of the iceberg. They are not even real; they are Simulations; Computer Programs impersonating Reality; Models. The next level is what’s called Cross-Chain Interoperability; programs that run across two or more blockchains. The best current practice in that area is probably what’s called Protocols, which, as far as I can understand, are a set of instructions governing how one program says to another program, “You go first,” or “You finish first,” or some such combination of instructions so that the whole thing operates seamlessly. Whales seized the opportunity during the recent dip, buying 520 million $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/v2Lu4uBMgm — Ali (@ali_charts) February 6, 2025 For retail consumers, the removal of gas-induced migraines and the simplification of multi-chain transactions could make $XRP a “go-to” thing to use if you want to engage in the broader blockchain ecosystem without all the practical complexities that come with it. When you consider all the user-friendly and efficient possibilities that exist for building on the XRP Ledger, what with its accessible and inexpensive nature, it seems ripe for what could be a big era of adoption and utility. Conclusion There is exciting growth and transformation underway in the ecosystem of $XRP. Institutional players have filed for an ETF; whale accumulation signals strong confidence in the asset; and innovations like Biconomy’s Supertransactions promise to take the user experience to a whole new level. All this makes $XRP and the XRPL, the XRP Ledger, one of the most exciting development spaces in the blockchain world. More and more users, and institutions, want to interact and integrate with the XRPL. And, in this context, the currency $XRP looks ever more promising as a real-world, usable token that will have a serious impact on the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.

Agent A.I. Jokes Through the Chaos and Drops AGNT Presale",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/ai-agent-sector-dips-but-is-it-far-from-over-agent-ai-jokes-through-the-chaos-and-drops-agnt-presale,"For almost two years, artificial intelligence has captured global attention. Sam Altman's ChatGPT set off a domino effect that saw the birth of a plethora of generative AI tools . Midjourney. DALL-E. Gemini. Bing. Claude. Perplexity. The list is endless! And it looks like these developments are not stopping anytime soon. From DeepSeek’s cost efficient training methodologies to Sam Altman’s vision of integrating AI agents with digital identities, the AI ecosystem is abuzz with developments. Beyond the buzz, it is expedient to critically examine the latest offerings from DeepSeek and OpenAI. DeepSeek may have revealed efficient methods to training AI models, however, they seem too good to be true, thus they need to be further researched and refined to confirm that they can deliver on their promise. In other words, it is quite too early to get excited. Likewise, Sam Altman’s vision may be ahead of its time and requires more development to explore its practicability. DeepSeek’s impact on the market made investors question valuations and reassess their positions. This was after crypto AI agents lost 15% in 24 hours, dropping to $8 billion. Tokens like VIRTUAL and AI16Z saw significant decreases, crashing by 61% and 46.7% respectively within 30 days. This sharp decline, worsened by DeepSeek’s impact, indicates that investors might be paying a premium for potential rather than proven solutions. And this is where Agent A.I. and its AGNT token, whose presale started less than a week ago , come in. Unlike industry peers like DeepSeek and OpenAI, the project does not chase fleeting trends. With a wink and a nod to the AI hype, it builds a solid foundation for the real future of AI agents. Speaking to CryptoDaily, the Agent A.I. team commented, ""AI agents are being hyped as if they’ll take over the world tomorrow. We’re taking a more practical approach – having a laugh along the way, but making sure the tech actually works."" While these advancements by DeepSeek and OpenAI are noteworthy, a few questions remain: do they thrive on hype or ignore the reality of artificial intelligence? How achievable are their offerings and utilities? DeepSeek Takes the World by Storm While OpenAI Marches into Digital Identities After flying under the radar since 2023, DeepSeek chose The Lunar New Year to do its big reveal . While its R1 model can generate content, solve logic problems, and create computer codes, what caught the attention of everyone was how cost effective it was to train this model. Development costs for R1 were around the neighborhood of $6 million. For context, OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 cost over $100 million to train and develop. DeepSeek's low cost also extends to the consumers. While OpenAI charges users $200 per month for their premium models, DeepSeek offers comparable tools for free. DeepSeek’s efficient training methods could be attributed to how it was able to train its AI models with significantly fewer GPUs than industry norms. For instance, it trained its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs within approximately two months. Though there are no disclosed exact figures for OpenAI, it requires significantly larger GPU clusters and longer training times. Training models of similar scale are estimated to involve tens of thousands of high-end GPUs like Nvidia A100 or H100. Though DeepSeek may have shown OpenAI and other AI projects more efficient training methods, OpenAI is exploring other frontiers. Recently, Sam Altman announced his vision to merge AI agents with verified human digital identities through the World ID technology. This innovation aims to create tools that link AI agents to users’ World ID, allowing them to verify that an agent is acting on their behalf. Hence, it easily authenticates AI-Human interactions across different digital platforms. In addition to this announcement, the OpenAI CEO had previously launched Operator, Open AI’s first AI agent that can perform autonomous web actions. How Agent A.I. Compares Claiming to become the world's first Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Agent A.I. opens a new paradigm where dynamic AI agents evolve and not just respond. This is why it is able to analyze trillions of parameters in milliseconds as it continues to restrategize and refine its process. Thus, the platform excels in intelligence, creativity, and decision making across different domains. Moreso, Agent A.I. displays commitment to its utilities through its native token, AGNT . The AGNT presale commenced on February 1. The presale is distributing 20% of the token supply, taking early investors through 28 rounds till its final listing price of $1. This allocation maintains a balanced supply and avoids market flooding while giving early birds a significant opportunity to maximize their profits. At the time of writing, the presale has reached Stage 2, with $95,000 already raised, and the token price now set at $0.003703. This implies that first-round investors would make nearly 300x their investment. Source: X The token’s multi-chain compatibility allows it to be purchased on different networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, among others using ETH, BNB, POL, and SOL, as well as USDT and USDC. The presale also supports fiat purchases using USD, eliminating the need for prior fiat-to-crypto conversion. To acquire AGNT , users need to use Metamask or Trust Wallet, select their preferred network, connect their wallet, type in the amount of AGNT they want to buy, and confirm the transaction by following their wallet prompts. AGNT has a maximum supply of 5 billion tokens. Besides the 20% allocated for the presale, 10% of the total supply will be reserved for liquidity to ensure seamless trading activity. Other allocations include 25% for staking rewards, 5% for community initiatives and airdrops, and 15% for Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) to support strategic partnerships and market expansion. The Token Generation Event (TGE) will follow after the presale, setting the tone for AGNT to be listed on top exchanges to enhance liquidity and expand market availability. Backed by a passionate team with a successful track record of launching tokens now worth over $100 million and committed to long-term development, Agent A.I. offers users a project with lasting potential, outlined in a three-phased strategic roadmap . The AI space is moving fast, maybe too fast. From DeepSeek’s cost-efficient training to OpenAI’s ambitious vision of AI agents tied to digital identities, the industry is packed with big claims, big ideas, and even bigger speculation. But as recent market swings have shown, hype doesn’t always equal reality. Agent A.I. sees things differently. It is here to prove that the future of AI isn’t just about making noise – it’s about making things work. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. The token’s meteoric rise has drawn the attention of traders and investors, resulting in an influx of market activity. The sudden spike has garnered significant attention from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who has weighed in on the situation. And what does CZ think of the recent surge? He described the situation as a “tricky one.” A Surprising Surge: The Unintentional Leak and Its Impact We can attribute the $TST token’s meteoric rise to an unanticipated development. A member of the BNB Chain team launched the token while working on an educational video. That video, initially, was intended to show users how to launch a meme token on the Four.meme platform. In the process of making the video, the team came up with the idea of utilizing a meme token to teach viewers about the token launch process. And so, they created $TST and launched it. Nevertheless, an unanticipated turn of events occurred during the video’s release. At the moment marking 1:18 in the video, the name $TST was revealed by accident, igniting curiosity among traders who pay close attention. The inadvertent unveiling was promptly recognized by a very observant trader, who—going strictly by the wallet address (0xeBB…74711c) with which they are associated—saw an opportunity and moved valiantly into the market to effectuate the purchase of $TST. The trader spent $35,000 on the asset in question, doing so just moments before CZ would make the tweet that sent the price of $TST soaring. This rapid action reaped rich rewards for the trader, whose $35,000 investment leapt up like a jack-in-the-box to a staggering $657,000 profit in probably five minutes or so—given that it was only five minutes before one famous industry leader tweeted about the situation. Not only did that industry leader’s tweet pack a big market-moving punch, but it also surely sent more traders into the marketplace to engage with the good ol’ buy/sell dance. More trading, more price movement, more profit for the trader. The Role of CZ and the Community’s Response The situation with $TST saw a further increase in demand due to a tweet from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Although Zhao did not directly endorse the token or its creation, he managed to draw even more attention to it—attracting the eyes of the crypto community to the burgeoning demand for $TST. In his now-famous tweet, he described the situation as “tricky,” recognizing that the rapid price appreciation of the token resulted from events no one caught on to in advance. The sudden increase in trading volume and price caused a rapid surge in market cap over $30 million. In just 30 minutes, the $TST token amassed a staggering $14 million in trading volume, adding to the intrigue of this sudden event. The BNB Chain team member responsible for the leak has remained quiet, but the crypto community has been discussing the event non-stop. The trader who first moved quickly has now become the largest holder of $TST, with a total of 28.82 million tokens under their control. This position undoubtedly makes them the leader in $TST holdings, a position that has earned them some significant attention in both the crypto community and the media. Here are the percentage of total supply holdings of the top 10 largest wallets for four of the largest altcoin market caps in crypto: Shiba Inu $SHIB : 61.3% of Supply Ethereum $ETH : 46.1% of Supply Chainlink $LINK : 33.1% of Supply Toncoin $TON : 32.8% of Supply… pic.twitter.com/RY5uUcbKI8 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 7, 2025 The Ongoing Impact on $TST and the Meme Token Landscape The $TST token’s recent and almost vertical rise has become the center of a lot of recent discussions, bringing forth important queries concerning the risk exposure and possibly lucrative returns of a trading system as erratic as that of the cryptocurrency market. Those discussions have, in turn, called forth from the deep recesses of my memory some lessons learned during (and after) the virtual gold rush that was Bitcoin. I’ll recap a few of those lessons here, along with the conversations they have ignited. Currently, talk about the $TST token centers on its being a part of the meme token landscape. Its meteoric rise has rekindled interest in meme tokens and placed them back in the conversation when speaking about tokens and crypto presently. Many traders and investors are looking at $TST hoping to find a next opportunity in an often-turbulent, unpredictable sector. Whether they will find what they are looking for remains to be seen, but as of now, the $TST token is conversation-worthy in the space. While the cryptocurrency world rapidly evolves, the story of $TST reminds us of how fast fortunes can change in the digital asset space. At present, observers can only wait to see whether $TST will keep ramping up after its 4700% increase or will retreat to a lower level after the summertime fun fades. Whatever happens next, the $TST story’s crystal-clear lesson is this: pay attention to the crypto market. In the digital asset world, even the tiniest detail can and does make a huge amount of difference. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Reports claim that state representative David Marshall has submitted House Bill 2387 to set the wheels in motion. The bill proposes a series of changes to address the rising rate of Bitcoin ATM fraud in Arizona, including pegging the daily transaction amount to $1,000 and mandating state operators undergo license-approval tests. The bill will also include refund policies amid other things that will help check illegal activities. According to an FBI Cryptocurrency Fraud Report in 2023, Arizona lost about $127 million to frauds related to cryptocurrency. The report mentioned at the time that the criminals specifically targeted older citizens over the age of 60 because of their vulnerability. The state also has about 600 Bitcoin ATMs. Arizona submits bill amid surge in Bitcoin ATM fraud According to a statement by United States Attorney General Kris Mayes, there has been a drastic increase in the cases of scammers trying to use the machines. She added that Bitcoin is usually their go-to cryptocurrency, seeing as it is harder to trace. For instance, a resident of Peoria, Tamara fell victim to these criminals last summer, losing $17,000 to them. According to Tamara, she had an issue with her PayPal account and googled the number of their customer services. She mentioned that the person sounded like a legitimate representative from PayPal, not knowing that she was speaking to a fraudster impersonating the company. “While I was on the phone with him, he said,’ I just want you to know that someone has tried to hack into your, not only your PayPal account, but all of your accounts, your IRA’,” Tamara said. She added that $7,000 was gone from her checking account, and she also lost $10,000 from her IRA. She added that the scammer instructed her to take out this money to trick the hacker that he had successfully gained access to her account. She took the $7,000 out in gift cards while transferring the other $10,000 to the criminal using a Bitcoin ATM. According to the police report, she lost about $28,000 to the scammer. “My Spidey senses were going off, but it was like, he said he wasn’t going to put the money back in unless you complete this task and then it was like a threat,” she added. Her situation is not an isolated incident as there has been an uptick in reports of similar cases in Arizona. According to the police, some families lost millions of dollars to these criminals, with others still unreported. Authorities warn natives about uptick in scams According to Mayes, there has been a lack of regulations when it comes to Bitcoin ATMs, something that needs to be addressed immediately. “There’s not enough regulation on these Bitcoin machines and cryptocurrency I believe in general, but especially the ATMs. So, we’re supporting and helping pass legislation that will at least limit the amount of money that people could put into a Bitcoin machine daily,” he said. Meanwhile, Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Ron Norfleet mentioned that he started an initiative, after the increase in scam cases related to Bitcoin ATMs. He mentioned that he had help from the Attorney General of Arizona’s Office, asking them to help him put up signs at the ATM stands to warn users of the dangers of using the machines. According to former fraud analyst Anthony Zervos, he used to work for Bitcoin ATM company Digital Mint. He mentioned that they sometimes flag new users who were making large transactions using the machines, asking them a series of questions to determine if they were being scammed . He added that typically, only two out of ten people are making legitimate transactions, with the rest going to scammers.

40077325,https://nulltx.com/?p=144085,1739020915,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,46 Publicly Traded Blockchain Companies in the Market: A Glimpse into the Growing Crypto Sector,https://nulltx.com/46-publicly-traded-blockchain-companies-in-the-market-a-glimpse-into-the-growing-crypto-sector/,"The past decade has seen the explosive growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries, with not a few companies choosing to enter the public markets to take advantage of the nearly insatiable appetite for all things decentralized. Per our last look at the space, there are now 46 public trading companies worth mentioning in the CoinGecko universe, which—if nothing else—gives you a sense of some of the potential inside the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. Below, we profile these companies, hitting the main highlights—what they do, how they do it, and how much they’re worth—across three different trading exchanges. The Landscape of Publicly Traded Blockchain Companies CoinGecko’s research indicates that among the 46 blockchain companies that are publicly traded, 24 are listed on NASDAQ, the global stock exchange most famous for its technology-oriented listings. The biggest of these blockchain-related companies, by market capitalization, is Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange platform that everyone seems to know. With a truly breathtaking market cap of $74 billion, it sits atop not only NASDAQ but also the entire blockchain sector. Coinbase has such a near monopoly in the space where it operates that it is mandatory to mention it when discussing investments in the blockchain sector. Immediately following Coinbase is Marathon Digital Holdings, a principal Bitcoin mining company. Its market cap sits at around $7 billion, which is much lower than that of Coinbase, but Marathon is still a commanding presence within the mining sector. The company has profited from the rising demand for not just Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies. It has been consistently enlarging its scope and pushing the boundaries of what mining entails, and it has doing so with a clear and steadfast idea of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a future currency. Coinbase and Marathon rank first and second, respectively, in market cap among blockchain companies on NASDAQ. However, many of the other publicly traded, blockchain-related companies are smaller or operate in niche segments of the blockchain ecosystem. The overall increase in public blockchain-based companies reflects rising levels of interest from both retail and institutional investors in blockchain assets, applications, and services. Blockchain’s OTC and Canadian Market Presence Besides the firms listed on NASDAQ, there are also a number of blockchain firms that can be traded in decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) markets, with 18 companies currently available. These OTC companies tend to be much more speculative and much smaller than the firms you’ll find on NASDAQ, with the investment opportunities they present often hinging on the promise of blockchain-based applications that serve as the foundation for—insert here—everything from the metaverse to decentralized finance (DeFi). One of the tiniest blockchain companies that is publically traded is Blockchain Industries. It has some focus on the metaverse but is not extensively involved in that area. An OTC market security, Blockchain Industries is not going to be encountered by most investors. Yet, among a handful of blockchain companies with an earnings report, this one offers a glimpse of the diverse range of applications and business models that are emerging in the blockchain ecosystem. The global spread of blockchain companies continues to grow, with Canada emerging as a crucial hub. CoinGecko’s research shows 47 other blockchain firms are found on Canadian exchanges like the TSX, CSE, and Cboe. But, for the most part, these firms don’t make very many waves because they’re micro-cap firms, have market caps under $10 million, or are ETFs that track the performance of blockchain assets and their returns. However, there is one firm, in particular, whose reach, notoriety, and returns are much closer to the levels of firms on NASDAQ than the levels of the average Canadian blockchain firm. That firm is Galaxy Digital, and its presence on the TSX is something that Canada can flaunt. The Role of Blockchain ETFs and Small Cap Firms Yet another impressive trend in the public blockchain market is the increasing number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus specifically on blockchain. These investment tools give investors the chance to buy something akin to a public mutual fund consisting of mostly private firms. The ETFs typically hold shares of a small number of firms that are involved with the development of blockchain technology and tend to be heavy in companies that also have some connection to cryptocurrencies. The blockchain ETF trend shows burgeoning investor interest in this part of the landscape, even as crypto prices and regulations take their turns in the spotlight. By putting their money in ETFs, investors achieve something that more closely resembles a market portfolio for the still-nascent blockchain and crypto sectors—lower risk, if not a lower reward, than buying individual stocks. The future is unclear for smaller, micro-cap blockchain businesses. Some firms might experience considerable growth as blockchain technology moves toward mainstream adoption and the marketplace’s life cycle progresses. Many, however, will have a tough time maintaining their public profiles or attaining profitability. The situation is even more precarious, given that both institutional and retail investors have staked significant amounts of money in the blockchain space. With such pronounced volatility, the question becomes: how do these investors evaluate which blockchain firms to back? How many publicly traded blockchain companies are there? In our latest study, we found 46 noteworthy publicly traded blockchain companies, 24 of which are listed on NASDAQ. Read the full study: https://t.co/Fv1BNj8Sgn pic.twitter.com/pyD03eCgyR — CoinGecko (@coingecko) February 6, 2025 The Future of Public Blockchain Companies While blockchain technology continues to advance, it is anticipated that an increasing number of firms will seek to access capital through public market vehicles. Those may include direct listings, reverse mergers, or, for many still a potentially viable alternative, initial public offerings (IPOs). Beyond promise, interest in the leading edge of technology—decentralized finance, NFTs, and blockchain-based gaming, for example—coupled with asset managers’ and banks’ newfound enthusiasm for digital assets, suggests that a future in which the technology’s most frequently-cited “disruption” (of the public company space, in this instance) becomes reality may not be all that distant. For investors who want to take advantage of this new growth industry, it is essential to proceed with caution in the blockchain market. The growth potential is vast, but this remains a largely speculative sector. Volatility and regulatory uncertainty pose serious risks to capital invested in the blockchain space. The expansion of the blockchain space means that the number of publicly traded blockchain companies will probably keep rising. This signals the broader acceptance of blockchain technology and its increasing influence on the global economy. The question now is how investors will get up to speed with this exciting yet unpredictable landscape. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Fear and Greed Index stands at 35 (“Fear”), reflecting investor uncertainty, while the crypto market cap holds at $3.12 trillion, with $125.13 billion in daily trading volume. Major cryptocurrencies are also struggling, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping to $96,048 (-1.92%) and Ethereum (ETH) down to $2,605 (-5.61%). Meanwhile, XRP has dropped to $2.40 (-0.72%). With the Altcoin Season Index at 29/100, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong, limiting altcoin recovery prospects. Solana ETF Filing Gains SEC Recognition In a notable regulatory development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged the first-ever Solana ETF filing, marking an important milestone for the cryptocurrency. The approval of NYSE’s 19b-4 filings allows firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck to move forward with Solana-based ETF applications. NEW: Very noteworthy that the @SECGov has acknowledged @Grayscale ’s $SOL filing because, as James mentions, the Gensler SEC alleged in prior litigation that Solana might be a security. The same SEC asked the @CBOE to withdraw issuers’ Solana filings just a few weeks ago when… https://t.co/FUNflhNmgo — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 6, 2025 Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this acknowledgment suggests changing sentiment at the SEC, which previously directed issuers to withdraw Solana-related applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. UPDATE: SEC just acknowledged the @Grayscale Solana 19b-4. This is actually newsworthy because the SEC had refused to do this in recent filing attempts for SOL pic.twitter.com/m2D88GKG5i — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) February 6, 2025 With new SEC leadership expected, analysts predict a final decision on Solana ETFs by October 11. If approved, this could fuel institutional adoption of SOL and provide fresh momentum for its price recovery. Solana Faces Resistance at $203 Amid Bearish Pressure Despite regulatory optimism, Solana (SOL) remains in a downtrend, struggling below $203, a critical resistance level aligning with the descending trendline. The 50-day EMA at $206.68 continues to cap upward moves, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A descending triangle formation signals potential downside risk, especially if SOL fails to hold its double-bottom support at $187. A break below this level could accelerate declines to $176 and $162, both historically strong support zones. To shift sentiment, SOL must break and hold above $203, which could open the door for a rally toward $218 and $231. However, with weak momentum and market fear prevailing, the bearish scenario remains dominant unless SOL reclaims these levels. Key Insights: Solana remains under $203 resistance, maintaining a bearish structure. A breakdown below $187 could trigger a sharper decline toward $176 and $162. The SEC’s acknowledgment of Solana ETF filings is a positive long-term catalyst. From Solana to Solaxy: A Game-Changer in Layer 2 Scaling While Solana faces near-term technical challenges, innovation within its ecosystem remains strong. One of the most exciting developments is Solaxy ($SOLX) —Solana’s first Layer 2 scaling solution designed to address network congestion and reduce transaction fees. Solaxy ($SOLX) has already secured over $18.73 million in its presale, attracting 65,000+ followers on X. As Solana users search for improved scalability and lower costs, Solaxy aims to deliver faster transactions and enhanced interoperability with Ethereum and other major blockchains. With staking rewards reaching 216% annually and over 5.31 billion $SOLX tokens staked, investors are positioning themselves for long-term gains. As the presale nears its final phase, $SOLX is currently priced at $0.001628, with the next price increase just around the corner. If you’re considering an early entry into Solana’s growing ecosystem, now is the time to act before the next price hike.

This has propelled GEODNET to the leading position in the satellite mining industry, surpassing centralized competitors like Trimble and achieving, by my count, the largest RTK network in the world. By year’s end, GEODNET boasts more than 12,000 active RTK satellite miners. This landmark signals something to me: the demand for decentralized Earth observation and real-time satellite data is growing. BREAKING: @GEODNET_ , the @Solana -based Global Earth Observation Decentralized Network, has grown 219% in 2024 to over 12,000 active RTK (Real-Time Kinetics) Satellite Miners. GEODNET has become the world’s largest RTK network, surpassing centralized competitors like Trimble. pic.twitter.com/olJOruJgvl — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 6, 2025 Record Growth and Token Success For GEODNET, the most important thing achieved in 2024 was the sharp rise in the value and market capitalization of its native token, GEOD. By the end of the year, the token had reached a circulating market capitalization of $62 million. That was up an impressive 59% quarter-over-quarter and an unbelievable 524% year-over-year. No matter how you look at it, the price trajectory for GEOD has been pretty darn good, with the token nearing its all-time high and looking way too solid for the network not to start being considered a serious player in the game of decentralized geospatial data. One of the largest token unlocks executed by GEODNET took place on December 28, 2024. It was a big one: the company released a total of 32.46 million GEOD tokens, valued at about $7.98 million. Usually, large unlocks like this create a bearish impact on a crypto project’s price due to the large influx of tokens coming into the market. But with GEODNET, the impact was positive, and clearly, that’s the type of impact we like to see when projects unlock tokens. The price of their token, GEOD, didn’t even dip. In fact, it rallied more after the event than it did before. Strategic Funding and Partnerships Fuel Expansion In 2024, GEODNET not only expanded its network and improved the performance of its tokens; it also netted a significant new pile of funding. This came in the form of a $2 million strategic funding round, led by high-profile investors like Animoca Brands and ParaFi. And what is GEODNET doing with this fresh capital? The company has a couple of plans that are mostly about further diversifying how it makes money and deepening the adoption of its technologies. Along with the financial backing, GEODNET presented its latest product, the GEO-PULSE, a GPS receiver retailing for $149. The receiver utilizes the network’s RTK infrastructure to furnish users with navigation that is accurate to within centimeters. Cutting down on jokers like those listed above makes for an efficient tool for users that drive or urban navigate because “everyday” directions in either of those contexts have much more potential to affect lives on a wider scale than the use of GNSS under the circumstances that its specifications were meant to cover when they were first dreamed up. At the end of 2024, GEODNET's GEOD circulating market capitalization reached $62 million, marking a 59% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase and a 524% year-over-year (YoY) growth, nearing its all-time high. pic.twitter.com/nwpAgEm5XX — Nick G (@NickDGarcia) February 5, 2025 The token ecosystem of GEODNET also expanded significantly. The company announced that its GEOD token would span multiple blockchain platforms, with the first additional platform being the Solana blockchain. This announcement highlighted the need for interoperability among various decentralized platforms and applications. While the GEOD token was already being used widely in decentralized applications across the Ethereum ecosystem, this move aimed to ensure that GEOD’s utility would only grow in the future, as it could now also be utilized in applications across the Solana blockchain. Expanding Industry Presence and New Partnerships GEODNET’s presence within the geospatial and satellite sector is steadily increasing, with the company announcing two new strategic partnerships at CES 2025. The partnerships with Septentrio, a frontrunner in advanced GPS technology, and Bad Elf, a recognized provider of GPS and GNSS solutions, signify an important development in GEODNET’s business. Both collaborations are anticipated to enhance the adoption of GEODNET’s RTK network and its innovative applications in numerous sectors, such as autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture, and various other industries. At CES 2025, GEODNET exhibited its diversification in the geospatial industry and placed front and center its partnerships as central to its continued expansion. By buddying up to industry stalwarts like Septentrio and Bad Elf, GEODNET is making a clear play for a top slot in the decentralized Earth observation game, and it is sending an equally clear message that it is all about delivering to the market affordable and dependable geospatial data. Looking Ahead: A Bright Future for GEODNET With its RTK network and product lines on the way to becoming a comprehensive solution for precise geolocation, GEODNET looks to be scaling toward a very bright future. Bolstered by not just one but three recent funding rounds (see “Funding the Future”), the company has positioned itself on a stellar growth trajectory, servicing an innovative part of the ever-expanding geospatial data and satellite mining industries. Between its high-profile partnerships and the introduction of innovative new products like GEO-PULSE (discussed in the next section), GEODNET looks to be well on its way to establishing a high operating profile in the marketplace. Now that GEODNET is firmly established as the biggest RTK network on Earth, 2025 is shaping up to be another year when the company’s profile continues to grow significantly. This is still a comparatively new company, but George alluded to its presence. When the decentralized Earth observation world looks for a leading company, it’s GEODNET; the next watchword in decentralized EOT technology company space.

House Bill 2387, introduced by state representative David Marshall, proposes strict regulations on cryptocurrency ATM operations. The legislation comes after Tamara, a Social Security recipient from Peoria, fell victim to scammers posing as PayPal representatives. According to an ABC News affiliate, she was persuaded to withdraw $7,000 from her checking account and $10,000 from her individual retirement account (IRA), which she subsequently transferred using a Bitcoin ( BTC ) ATM. The scammers used threats and pressure tactics, claiming her accounts had been compromised and that the transfers were necessary to protect her funds. You might also like: History and evolution of Bitcoin ATMs Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes told ABC15 that Bitcoin-related scams are increasing due to the cryptocurrency’s difficult-to-trace nature. The proposed bill would implement several protective measures, including: A $1,000 daily transaction limit Mandatory state operator licensing Required refund policy options The scale of cryptocurrency ATM fraud has grown substantially in recent years. The FBI’s 2023 Cryptocurrency Fraud Report revealed that Arizona residents lost approximately $127 million to virtual money fraud, with seniors over 60 being particularly vulnerable. Federal Trade Commission data shows Bitcoin ( BTC ) ATM fraud has surged from $12 million in 2020 to $112 million in 2023. Tamara’s case is an example of common tactics used by scammers, who often create urgency and fear to override victims’ suspicions. “My Spidey senses were going off, but it was like he said he wasn’t going to put the money back in unless you complete this task and then it was like a threat,” she explained to ABC15. The proposed legislation shows Arizona’s effort to address this growing threat through increased regulation of cryptocurrency ATM operations, aiming to protect vulnerable residents from similar schemes. The number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide grew by 6% in 2024, reflecting the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. These machines function like traditional ATMs but allow users to buy and sometimes sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash or bank cards, though selling fees tend to be higher. The first Bitcoin ATM was introduced in Vancouver in 2013, and their presence has since expanded to over 37,500 machines in more than 70 countries. Recent data from Finbold, citing Coin ATM Radar, confirms this ongoing growth trend.

This massive accumulation of Uniswap’s native token, now worth some $15.54 million, has been making waves in the crypto community and drawing attention to just how confident some investors are in the platform’s future. This all comes at a time when not just Uniswap but Uniswap V4 specifically is on an impressive growth trend—with its Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding $47 million just days after launch. A giant whale is accumulating $UNI ! This whale has withdrawn a total of 1.7M $UNI ($15.54M) from #Binance in the past 4 days. https://t.co/k2FejJy6eK pic.twitter.com/ujbUwxhpzC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 7, 2025 Whale Activity Sparks Interest in Uniswap V4’s Growth The large-scale withdrawal of $UNI from Binance is an intriguing development for the market. Whales, or large investors, are often seen as indicators of future market trends. Their movements can significantly influence the price and sentiment around a particular cryptocurrency. In this case, the whale’s decision to withdraw such a large quantity of $UNI signals that they believe in the long-term potential of Uniswap’s governance token. The withdrawal, amounting to over $15 million in value, begs the question of what the whale’s next move may be—and how confident they are in the DEX ecosystem and Uniswap in particular. Uniswap V4, launched just under a week ago, is making considerable waves in the DeFi world. Since its debut, the new version of the platform has seen a TVL of over $47 million. And a large share of that is coming from the Ethereum network, which still seems to be the place to be for any smart contract activity in DeFi. It’s pretty clear that people are relatively eager to engage with Uniswap V4 and are being drawn by something more than just curiosity. Whether this trend continues, the rate of increase in Uniswap V4’s TVL seems to suggest that it’s not just a passing phase for users. The big stake the whale has in $UNI and its move away from Binance correlate with the heightened adoption of Uniswap V4. That could be read as a not-so-subtle endorsement of the decentralized exchange’s future prospects. Uniswap has long been the big dog in the DeFi movement, and its adoption of the latest tech—Uniswap V4—has reinforced its position as the leader in that space. Whether or not Uniswap is your favorite decentralized exchange, it is, by far, the path of least resistance in that space. Uniswap V4’s Early Success and Hooked Pools Uniswap V4’s early success demonstrates how well the platform adapts and innovates in the fast-changing DeFi world. Since its launch, the platform achieved a cumulative transaction volume of over $185 million, a figure that certainly reflects user interest in the platform’s new features. A big part of that interest must be attributed to a hook pools feature. This makes up around 43.2% of the total transaction volume on the platform. What makes Hooked Pools a special opportunity for liquidity providers? The unique pools are an innovative product within Uniswap V4. They exist predominantly in the DeFi ecosystem. Automated market-making is hookingly engaging on the platform for a wide variety of investors—from sophisticated DeFi participants to first-time DeFi users. The platform currently proposes that nearly half of its total transaction volume exists because of Hooked Pools. The swift expansion of transaction volume, alongside the hefty total value locked in Uniswap V4, hints that the platform is well on its way to keeping a commanding presence in the DeFi field. Uniswap was not just able to attract liquidity; it was also able to attract users and innovate right before our eyes. Almost as if to illustrate a point, the conduit for user-driven transactions on Uniswap is now further primed for running innovative DeFi structures. What’s Next for Uniswap and $UNI? The significant accumulation of $UNI by the giant whale, coupled with the swift success of Uniswap V4, prompts some very serious questions about what’s in store for both the platform and the governance token. If anything, the latest iteration of Uniswap appears to be growing—even if some analysts contend that its current transaction volume is propped up by a few outlier trading pairs. $UNI and all governance tokens play an essential and even more significant role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector as it matures. Holding the $UNI token gives you governance rights over the Uniswap protocol. Those with governance tokens get to decide the platform’s upgrades, changes in fee structures, etc. They speak for the future direction of the DeFi protocol they are invested in. Accumulating tokens is a sign they want to and can act in DeFi’s long-term investment interests. The cryptocurrency market as a whole looks primed for growth. And that could be great news for decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. According to Allium, since its launch nearly a week ago, Uniswap V4 TVL has exceeded $47 million, of which about 82.76% is concentrated in Ethereum; it has achieved a cumulative transaction volume of more than $185 million, of which 43.2% comes from Hooked Pools transactions.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 6, 2025 Uniswap now stands to benefit from all the extra momentum flowing into DeFi and decentralized trading. Traditional financial systems and centralized exchanges are under the microscope, which makes DeFi platforms—where users can trade, stake, and provide liquidity without an intermediary—much more attractive. Add to that the fact that Uniswap V4’s additional features could give them an even bigger role in DeFi, and you’ve got a scenario that could make Uniswap, well, unbeatable. Conclusion: A Positive Outlook for Uniswap V4 and $UNI The recent activity of whales and the early success of Uniswap V4 indicate that both the platform and the $UNI token are on a path toward substantial growth in the coming months. With a total value locked (TVL) of $47 million, impressive transaction volumes, and new features like Hooked Pools, Uniswap V4 is gaining traction as one of the most promising decentralized exchanges in the market. The large whale bet on $UNI further reinforces this sentiment, signaling confidence in the future of Uniswap and its ability to remain a dominant player in the DeFi space. As Uniswap keeps innovating and drawing liquidity, it will be fascinating to observe how its governance token, $UNI, fares in the larger marketplace. Backed strongly by institutions and whales and seeing increased adoption of Uniswap V4, the platform and its community of users seem destined for a very bright future.

40077801,https://nulltx.com/?p=144094,1739021929,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Retail Investors Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation as Whales Distribute, Signaling Potential Shifts in Market Dynamics",https://nulltx.com/retail-investors-accelerate-bitcoin-accumulation-as-whales-distribute-signaling-potential-shifts-in-market-dynamics/,"Since mid-December, retail investors have been amassing Bitcoin at a speed not seen since the crypto bull market of late 2020 and early 2021. Investigating this recent phenomenon, we find that retail accumulation really took off around the time of the recent market lows in November and December and that retail investors are currently accumulating BTC even faster than a year ago and, in fact, at a pace that hasn’t been exceeded since the late 2020/early 2021 bull market. This rekindling of retail interest in Bitcoin, coming at a time when the cryptocurrency market is grappling with ongoing volatility and with the recent bear market clearly now behind us, is a clear sign that the confidence of recent retail investors remains very much intact. Since mid-December, retail investors (≤1 $BTC ) have been accumulating #Bitcoin at an accelerated pace, stacking an average of 10,627 BTC per day – 72% faster than the past year's average (6,177 #BTC /day): https://t.co/K3Q9Dlu7jn pic.twitter.com/U0u6gIxXeB — glassnode (@glassnode) February 7, 2025 Retail Investors Lead the Charge: A Strong Shift from November This substantial uptick in retail activity stands in marked contrast to the pattern of retail investor behavior during November 2024, when Bitcoin pushed past the $100K threshold. At that time, many retail investors seemingly took advantage of the price spike by selling off portions of their holdings—profiting, one would assume, from what appeared to be a market moment of peak strength. This recent alternative uptrend, however, suggests that retail investors are now professing to view Bitcoin more as a long-term, fundamentally sound store-of-value proposition, rather than as a momentarily flaming, short-term speculative asset. It is accumulating Bitcoin at a rate that is hard to ignore. This is significant, particularly because retail investors usually have a much smaller presence in the market compared to institutions and larger players. Yet here they are, pushing into Bitcoin at 72% faster than last year’s pace—an act that is, in aggregate, a very apparent vote of confidence in both the original crypto and its future. And that’s with all that’s been going on in the space since summer. Whales Distribute Bitcoin, Increasing Sell-Side Pressure Retail investors are steadily accumulating Bitcoin, but on the other side of the trade, “whales”—investors holding more than 1,000 BTC—have been distributing their Bitcoin to exchanges at an ever-increasing rate. Since November 24, 2024, these large holders have been offloading, on average, nearly 33,000 BTC per day. That’s roughly 9 times their own annual average prior to their recent selling spree, which has been creating by far the largest and most consistent “sell-side” pressure the Bitcoin market has seen in years. The conduct of whales straying from the retail trend implies that they might be responding to more sweeping market conditions, such as recent ups and downs in the price of Bitcoin and the mood surrounding it. In contrast to the retail investors who have been steadily purchasing Bitcoin, the whales have been using the recent price surge as an opportunity to sell off a significant portion of their holdings. If they are not actively seeking to drive the price down, which is certainly a possibility, their price decline and market uncertainty anticipation could very well be leading them to liquidate massive portions of their BTC holdings. Bitcoin Dominance Rises, Capital Rotation Accelerates While the retail and whale sectors are moving in different directions, Bitcoin market dominance is soaring. Since the collapse of FTX, Bitcoin’s market dominance has risen from 38% to 59%, which means a substantial net capital rotation into Bitcoin to the detriment of other digital assets. What does this say about the state of investor confidence in not just Bitcoin, but in the whole digital asset space? Bitcoin dominance has surged from 38% to 59% since the FTX collapse, reflecting a net capital rotation into BTC over other digital assets: https://t.co/I1rZLhGP9n pic.twitter.com/00WQ6Tboa8 — glassnode (@glassnode) February 7, 2025 Bitcoin’s dominance surge is not just new money flooding into the space; it’s a sign that investors are favoring the stability and reputation of Bitcoin—more than ever—over the potential risks associated with altcoins. Result: Altcoins are growing slower. Over the same time frame (the lows of 2022 to now), we saw Bitcoin grow 5.3 times in market cap from $363 billion, to $1.93 trillion. Meanwhile, altcoins grew at a much-more-modest 4.7 times from their low point, to $892 billion in market cap. Significant Movement from Long-Term Holders A critical new development in the Bitcoin market is the transition of over 20,000 BTC from long-term holders’ wallets in the last 96 hours. This shift could very well change market dynamics because it has historically been the case that long-term holders are the most steadfast Bitcoin investors, the ones who ride out the periods of volatility. When it is the long-term holders’ turn to start moving coins, it usually means either portfolio repositioning or imminent market opportunity (often cited as the reason for the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple). This transition could also represent an entry point—and a signal for new investment opportunities—for investors who are currently sidelined. Outflows from Bitcoin Spot ETFs Raise Concerns Though retail accumulation in Bitcoin has been robust, the recent outflows from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have caused some consternation among investors. As of February 6, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs since the start of the year was $140 million. Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) was the biggest offender, with $103 million having left that fund, and no doubt many Heaven’s Gate figures were drawn during the put option writing that led to that fund’s availability. Still, Fidelity appears to be the only player with such active imitative undermining occurring. Over 20,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have moved out of long-term holders' wallets in the last 96 hours. This shift could introduce new opportunities! pic.twitter.com/RqTqteq5Ed — Ali (@ali_charts) February 7, 2025 The outflows from Bitcoin ETFs come at a time when the market capitalization of Bitcoin has been growing by leaps and bounds, which raises questions about just how hungry institutional investors are for the digital asset. Accumulation by retail investors shows no signs of slowing, yet that strong narrative is clouded by the series of unfortunate events that seem to have befallen the Bitcoin ETF this year and last. If the ETF is seemingly cursed, what does that say about the institutional investors that are supposed to be it? On February 6, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was $140 million, and the outflow of Fidelity FBTC was $103 million. The total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETF was $10.6519 million, and the net inflow continued for 6 days. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 7, 2025 A Dynamic Market with Contrasting Trends The Bitcoin market right now is moving in two opposite directions. Retail investors are amassing large amounts of Bitcoin, @ investopedia.com demonstrating a healthy “HODL” attitude. Whale activity has also been noticeable, with large Bitcoin holders appearing to distribute their Bitcoin, increasing selling pressure and possibly creating a Bitcoin market that is more price-volatile than what we saw in 2020. In the middle of all this is Bitcoin’s price. Despite these major trends, Bitcoin’s price continues to reflect the kind of stability and overall bullishness we’re coming to expect when we look at the price charts. The market seems to be at a crossroads with long-term holders starting to move their BTC and institutions pulling money out of Bitcoin ETFs. These outflows suggest that retail investors are still quite confident in Bitcoin, while the big players in the market (both institutional and whale) are seemingly recalibrating their strategies. The evolution of Bitcoin continues, and by all appearances, it’s still looking good. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On Friday, three DOGE operatives—Christopher Young, Nikhil Rajpal, and Gavin Kliger—arrived at the CFPB’s Washington, D.C., headquarters, according to a statement from the CFPB employees union, NTEU 335. This follows Elon’s February 4 post on X, where he declared “We’re gonna delete CFPB.” Later that same day, he doubled down, posting “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who took over as CFPB’s acting director last week after former Director Rohit Chopra was fired by President Trump, had already shut down external communications at the agency. He also halted key operations ahead of the DOGE team’s arrival. According to an internal email sent by CFPB Chief Operating Officer Adam Martinez late Friday, the DOGE agents were given full access to the agency as if they were official employees or detailees. “They came in like they already owned the place,” said Martinez. CFPB under siege as DOGE shuts down USAID operations DOGE had already brought USAID to its knees. Funding for USAID projects was cut off, and the majority of the agency’s staff were furloughed. The plan was to put 2,200 employees on administrative leave by Friday at 11:59 p.m. ET. According to the US Department of Justice, 500 workers had already been placed on leave. Unions have not taken this quietly. The American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees filed lawsuits, saying that the administration had no authority to dismantle USAID without congressional approval. In a court filing, they described the situation as an “onslaught of unconstitutional and illegal attacks.” On Friday, Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, temporarily paused the administration’s plan. He heard arguments from both sides in a D.C. federal court. Despite the judge’s ruling, USAID employees remain on edge, fearing permanent layoffs as Elon and his team continue their dismantling spree. USAID headquarters have also officially been shut down. Unburdened by what has been. pic.twitter.com/NK2bcK3hlH — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) February 7, 2025 “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Elon wrote on X. Trump, too, posted on Truth Social: “THE CORRUPTION IS AT LEVELS RARELY SEEN BEFORE. CLOSE IT DOWN!” Elon’s efficiency officers have been surgiccal For the past week, DOGE has been axing contracts and programs across federal agencies. On its official X account today, DOGE boasted that: “Great coordination across 35 agencies over the last two days to terminate 199 wasteful contracts saving approximately $250 million.” Examples included a canceled climate change coordinator position in Sri Lanka and a workshop on “intercultural communication diversity dialogue.” The Department of Education had three DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) training grants—worth $15 million—cut off by DOGE. One institution had been hosting workshops titled “Decolonizing the Curriculum,” which Elon’s team apparently found unnecessary. Today, the Department of Education terminated three DEI training grants totaling $15M. One of the institutions had previously hosted faculty workshops entitled “Decolonizing the Curriculum”. — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) February 8, 2025 Within the CFPB, fears are growing. DOGE requested access to sensitive internal records, including data on employees and contractors. Some staff worry that their personal information—and potentially that of their families—could be compromised.

This outflow was heavily publicized on Twitter and was one of only a few times that a net outflow of that size had been recorded on derivatives exchanges. While the implications of this uptick in outflows have not entirely been unpacked, it’s possible that the recent strong price movement in ETH could have something to do with it. In the past, large outflows from derivatives exchanges have been associated with positive price developments on the horizon. $ETH’s derivatives exchange netflow just saw another massive -60K ETH outflow, the second since Feb 3. Big moves like this typically mean less selling pressure and major position closures—often a bullish signal. Are traders gearing up to hold or stake? pic.twitter.com/wqw3wvxF6R — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 6, 2025 Massive Ethereum Outflows and Their Implications for Market Sentiment From derivatives exchanges, the latest outflow of 60,000 ETH occurs just days after a similar move in the opposite direction. Yet in this case, no traders appear to be exiting leveraged positions; instead, this latest outflow looks like a coordinated push of ETH to long-term storage. Unavailable assets mean reduced supply, and observers often interpret reduced supply (and the appearance of it, too) as a sign of an impending increase in price. Markets for derivatives often host highly leveraged traders who take large positions in ETH, anticipating that they can profit from price fluctuations. Yet when big outflows happen, they often signal a substantial reduction in these leveraged positions. That’s one way to interpret it. And the interpretation suggests that speculative traders may be battening down the hatches or moving toward a more conservative trading stance. When these exit-the-building traders close their positions, it also removes from circulation the ETH they were holding. And that’s another reason why we shouldn’t be too bummed out about large outflows. Analysts say that these outflows could mean that Ethereum is entering a low-volatility, balanced-market phase. Closing leveraged positions immediately affect the price, but when they no longer have to happen, that’s when we see “organic” price movement—movement not driven by shorts getting squeezed or by overleveraged, long-funded positions collapsing in a heap. And recently, there have been good reasons to think that price stability, and possibly even a move to the upside, is in Ethereum’s near future. UPDATE: Ethereum outflows from crypto derivatives exchanges hit the highest level since August 2023, showing bullish signs as it may lead to reduced selling pressure and closed leverage positions, according to analysts. pic.twitter.com/GbXKMao62y — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 7, 2025 Ethereum’s Spot ETF Inflows Point to Institutional Confidence Further contributing to the positivity surrounding Ethereum, the inflow of assets into Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $10.65 million on February 6, which was now the sixth consecutive day of inflows into these investment vehicles. “Spot” ETFs offer both institutional and retail investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to directly hold the underlying asset. And for Ethereum, spot ETFs have become a significant vehicle for not just sentiment but capital inflows as well. The consistent investments coming into Ethereum’s spot ETFs are yet another marker of the burgeoning confidence institutional players have in the smart contract platform’s future. For these largely-male institutions, steadily accumulating Ethereum through ETFs is a sort of prelude to what they really want to do with Ethereum. They want to build on it, and they believe it can be something much bigger than it is now. The smart contract platform’s low and relatively stable prices in recent months seem like an ideal entry point. Ethereum’s Market Dynamics: What’s Next? Combining large outflows from Ethereum derivatives exchanges with steady inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs might start to alter market dynamics. With the derivatives market shedding leverage, the chances of speculative trading causing wild price swings seem to be diminishing. At the same time, the steady inflow into spot ETFs suggests that institutional players still view Ethereum as a likely winner, which might contribute to staving off the sort of volatility that could result from large Ethereum price moves in either direction. At the same time, the ongoing withdrawal of funds from Ethereum derivatives exchanges seems to be signaling that the speculative bubble in Ethereum is beginning to deflate, with traders adopting a more reserved posture. If this is, indeed, a transition to a new, more sustainable market for Ethereum, it might lead not just to reduced volatility for Ethereum but also (and this is very much a hope for Ethereum’s supporters) to a price that is more reliably upward-trending. In the coming weeks, how these trends continue to evolve will probably decide Ethereum’s price movement. If outflows from the derivatives market keep up their current high rate and institutional inflows into spot ETFs keep coming in, then Ethereum could be set up for a nice growth run. The speculative selling pressure that these traders impose on the market could be going away for the duration of this trend. And the very fact that institutions are willing to invest in Ethereum through spot ETFs could provide a nice foundation of stable price support coming from their inflows as well. On February 6, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was $140 million, and the outflow of Fidelity FBTC was $103 million. The total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETF was $10.6519 million, and the net inflow continued for 6 days. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 7, 2025 Conclusion: A Positive Outlook for Ethereum The recent outflow of Ethereum from derivatives exchanges hasn’t just stopped; it’s actually gained speed in recent weeks. Meanwhile, rather than seeing spot ETFs in Ethereum merely being “approved,” the crypto space has increasingly watched as not just one or even two but several spot ETF ‘futures’ have been launched, and not just launched but with apparent success. So this is the situation: We’ve got a digital asset that could be just about to stop being a joke and instead be a jillion-dollar player, gaining foundation-level support from some of the largest institutions in the world. Considering these optimistic signals, it is reasonable to conclude that Ethereum has a solid opportunity to extend its growth trajectory in the near future. If the nearly quarter-century trend continues of reduced selling pressure and during increased institutional interest, then Ethereum is potentially set up for a strong showing as it goes into the next phase of its market cycle.

According to analyst Bennett, the S&P 500 is struggling to break through its range of highs, and this could spell trouble for cryptocurrencies. If the S&P 500 drops back to the 5,877 region, it might drag crypto prices down with it. S&P 500 Faces Rejection, What’s Next? In a recent tweet post, Bennett shared his analysis, highlighting that the S&P 500 is struggling to break past its resistance zone. He pointed out that the most probable outcome is a drop toward the 5,877 level. If you use the #stock market for clues about #crypto (recommended), the S&P 500 is getting rejected from range highs today. The most likely path here seems like a move back to the 5,877 region. That could drag crypto with it, and considering where #Ethereum is trading, it's… pic.twitter.com/6ujf4xRj0A — Justin Bennett (@JustinBennettFX) February 7, 2025 The chart clearly shows a rejection at the recent highs, suggesting that a downward move is likely. If this prediction holds, it could mean trouble for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Historically, major moves in the stock market have influenced crypto prices, and this time might be no different. A decline in the S&P 500 could put selling pressure on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. How Could This Impact Crypto? Bennett specifically mentioned Ethereum in his tweet, implying that its current position in the market could be affected by the S&P 500’s movements. If the stock index drops as predicted, Ethereum could face downward pressure, potentially leading to a significant price correction. If equities enter a correction phase, investors might reduce exposure to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Drop Look at Bitcoin’s price it has seen a drop of 2.4% in the last 24 hours, now sitting at $96,313. But what’s interesting here is that Bitcoin’s dominance currency holds a stronger position standing at 61.84%. This suggests that while the overall market is struggling, Bitcoin is still holding its ground better than most altcoins. Meanwhile, Ethereum price isn’t looking great though as the price dropped 5% in just 24 hours, now trading at $2,623 . This decline aligns with the broader market’s weakness, but Ethereum’s sharper fall compared to Bitcoin raises concerns.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-08 13:59:09

33767162,[object Object],1739023235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Cap Surges 5.3x To $1.93T: Growing Faster Than Altcoins Since 2022,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-cap-surges-5-3x-to-1-93t-growing-faster-than-altcoins-since-2022/,"Bitcoin is currently trading within a well-defined range, fluctuating between its all-time high of $109K and range lows around $89K. The market remains highly volatile, with uncertainty dominating sentiment as traders await a decisive breakout. Both bulls and bears are battling for control, and Bitcoin’s next move could set the tone for the broader market in the coming months. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to solidify its dominance over altcoins. Key data from Glassnode reveals that since the 2022 market bottom, the BTC market cap has surged 5.3x, growing from $363 billion to $1.93 trillion. In comparison, the altcoin market has expanded at a slower pace, increasing 4.7x to reach $892 billion. This divergence underscores BTC’s growing appeal as the leading asset in the crypto market, especially during times of economic and geopolitical instability. As Bitcoin consolidates within this key trading range, investors are closely monitoring whether it can reclaim momentum for another leg higher or if further downside risk remains. A breakout above $109K could push BTC into price discovery while losing the $89K support might trigger a deeper correction. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to hold its ground and define the next major trend. Bitcoin Outpaces Altcoins: What This Means Bitcoin is currently trading at mid-range levels, showing no clear direction as bulls struggle to regain control while bears lack the strength to push prices lower. The market has been in consolidation since late December, with BTC ranging between its all-time high of $109K and the key support at $89K. This prolonged sideways movement has frustrated investors, who are eagerly waiting for a decisive move. Key data from Glassnode reveals that since the 2022 market low, Bitcoin’s market cap has surged 5.3x, rising from $363 billion to $1.93 trillion. Meanwhile, the altcoin market has grown at a slower pace, increasing only 4.7x to reach $892 billion. This discrepancy highlights Bitcoin’s dominance in the current cycle, as capital flows heavily into BTC while altcoins continue to underperform. This data suggests that investors are prioritizing Bitcoin as a safer bet amid macroeconomic uncertainty, trade war fears, and market volatility. However, this also creates a problem for altcoins, as their inability to keep pace with Bitcoin has led to frustration among traders. Many expected an altseason to follow BTC’s strong performance, but instead, altcoins have struggled, causing further market fear. As Bitcoin remains stuck in this range, investors are watching for a breakout above $109K to confirm further upside. Meanwhile, losing the $96K-$98K support zone could result in another drop toward $90K, prolonging the uncertainty. BTC Eyes Key Resistance Levels Bitcoin is trading at $97,900 and is looking ready to push above key supply levels. The price has been consolidating for days, and the market remains highly volatile as investors anticipate the next big move. If BTC manages to reclaim the $98K and $100K levels and turn them into support, bullish momentum will likely strengthen, setting the stage for a potential breakout. However, failure to break above these levels could lead to a retrace into lower demand zones, with the next key support sitting around the $96K mark. A deeper correction could even push BTC toward the $90K region, prolonging the current consolidation phase. On the bullish side, if Bitcoin successfully breaks through the $100K resistance, it could quickly move back into the higher range and test uncharted territory near all-time highs. The market is watching closely for a decisive move, as any breakout or breakdown from current levels will define BTC’s short-term direction Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Altcoin|Bitcoin growth|bitcoin market cap|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-08 14:00:35

Trading expert Ali Martinez highlighted a bearish crossover between DOGE’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio and its 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Historically, this pattern has led to downturns. While Dogecoin price struggles, analysts are turning to a rising AI-powered rival with a projected 55,000% upside by 2025. Its unique RWA tokenomics sets it apart from other altcoins, positioning it to reshape the $300 trillion real estate market through blockchain innovation. Dogecoin Price Faces Bearish Divergence: What’s Behind the Drop? The Dogecoin price shows signs of a bearish downturn as its Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio drops below its 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This pattern typically signals profit-taking, increasing selling pressure. Trading expert Ali Martinez warned that Dogecoin’s price could correct sharply, possibly falling to $0.20 if the $0.31 support level breaks. Martinez noted that Dogecoin is mirroring Pepe’s (PEPE) recent price drop, suggesting a similar downward trajectory. If support fails, Dogecoin may face further losses in the coming weeks. Core PropiChain Features Driving a 55,000% Upside as Dogecoin Price Declines As Dogecoin faces bearish pressure, investors are turning to PropiChain , a rising rival offering groundbreaking solutions in real estate tokenization. Below are key features driving this rival’s projected 55,000% upside. While the Dogecoin price fluctuates, its rival PropiChain is reshaping real estate investment through AI-powered automation.

The remarkable 300% staking rewards attract investors who see similarities to Solana ($SOL) – a major player in decentralized networks. As meme-based coins progress along with market patterns, remarkably high yields succeed in pulling in capital. The central matter for crypto fans in 2025 points to selecting the best staking option. Pepeto Shows True Value in the Meme Coin Market A meme-based cryptocurrency named #Pepeto sets itself apart with advanced technology and actual uses. Most similar tokens only depend on social buzz, but Pepeto includes useful blockchain features, connects different chains, and has a fair listing system that stays honest. The token sells at $0.000000108 in its presale stage, along with over $4 million received from backers – which proves how much people trust it.

Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 The unique staking system makes # Pepeto stand out from others. This feature pays more than 300% in rewards, which attracts many investors who want to earn passive profits. Regular meme coins hardly ever offer staking benefits, but Pepeto aims to become a serious part of decentralized finance (DeFi). How Does Solana Staking Compare? A high-speed blockchain called Solana ($SOL) has made its mark in staking operations. The network excels at fast processing transactions with good scalability or design, which lets users earn staking rewards in a protected setup. The usual yield from Solana staking stays between 5-7%, making it a stable choice for people who want regular profits. The Case for PEPETO Staking Over Solana PEPETO’s explosive presale success and high staking rewards are making it a top contender among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Here’s why investors are shifting their attention to this new player: High Staking Rewards : With rates surpassing 300%, #PEPETO offers significantly higher yields than Solana’s moderate staking returns. Strong Presale Momentum : Surpassing $4 million in its presale phase, #PEPETO is proving investors see long-term potential in its ecosystem. Cross-Chain Bridge Technology : Unlike most meme coins, PEPETO provides seamless blockchain interoperability, increasing its use cases and long-term viability. The Future of Staking: Will Solana or PEPETO Lead? Solana is a standard staking option, but its essential rewards fail to attract investors who want quick profits. PEPETO’s financial design, sales momentum, and technical advances make it a future frontrunner in meme tokens and DeFi yield sectors. The year 2025 shows #PEPETO as a prime pick for investment – not just for high returns but also its ability to change crypto markets. A successful pre-launch phase plus useful features make PEPETO worth watching for people who seek significant opportunities. Conclusion PEPETO’s yield rates exceed 300%, creating real pressure for Solana staking. The $SOL asset stays reliable for extended holding, but #PEPETO’s fast growth potential makes it a very attractive meme token choice. As presales surpass $4M, PEPETO shows how it could lead future crypto staking methods. To participate in the ongoing presale or to start staking PEPETO, visit Pepeto’s official website at pepeto.io .
