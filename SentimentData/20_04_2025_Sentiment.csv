Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Various attempts to pierce key levels have been unsuccessful, with prices going as low as $0.149 before recovering marginally. Market observers indicate that these short-term setbacks could be a prelude to monumental price swings in either direction. Possible 40% Fall Before The Huge Rally A fresh analysis published on TradingView by SwallowAcademy indicates Dogecoin might see a dramatic drop before any significant price increase. The analyst looked into DOGE‚Äôs price action compared to Tether (USDT) on daily charts, where the meme coin has been known to be extremely volatile. Their plots indicate a sudden spike in the beginning of 2024 followed by a decline from highs around $0.23, then another downslide to $0.09 mid-year before recovering above $0.45. SwallowAcademy thinks that the same trend may develop in 2025. However, their prediction is that Dogecoin may decline another 40% to around $0.09, creating a zone of support before, possibly, skyrocketing 400% to $0.45. The price stands at over $0.15 currently, and the analyst is holding out for the anticipated drop to $0.09. The ‚ÄòFalse Break‚Äô Pattern ‚Äì What It Means A standalone analysis by Trader Tardigrade indicates Dogecoin‚Äôs initial ‚Äúfalse break‚Äù since December 2024. The cryptocurrency has, in general, traced a downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, which are common bearish market indicators. After dropping to $0.13 on April 7, though, the price did bounce briefly before declining once more. Trader Tardigrade reads this as a ‚Äúfalse breakdown‚Äù ‚Äì potentially indicating the end of the downtrend. With prices remaining above the support line for a few days, this pattern may indicate an imminent bullish reversal. Based on their analysis, Dogecoin may aim for $0.42 if the reversal occurs. #Dogecoin Makes a False Break for the First Time Since Dec 2024 üî• It‚Äôs staying above the support line for days, confirming the characteristics of a false break.

According to the firm‚Äôs data, activity on the XRP Ledger has fallen by 80% since its peak in December, reaching unprecedented lows in recent months. This decline is not limited to on-chain data. A similar decline is also observed in the XRP futures market. There has been a decrease of approximately 70% in open interest, with these levels last seen in November 2023. In addition, funding rates are also in a downward trend and have turned negative at times. According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs assessment, XRP‚Äôs estimated leverage ratio is also on the decline. This ratio is calculated by dividing open positions by the XRP reserves on an exchange and reflects the average leverage usage of users. Related News: Senior Analyst Claims Bitcoin Price ‚ÄúCould Go Much Higher,‚Äù Predicts What Would Happen in This Scenario Despite all this negative data, the XRP price is only down about 35% from its December peak, a more limited decline compared to other major crypto assets like Ethereum, which has lost close to 60% of its value in the same period. Another noteworthy data is the continuous decline in exchange reserves on the XRP Ledger. Exchange reserves, which have fallen to levels last seen in July 2023, may indicate that investors prefer to withdraw their XRP from exchanges and store it for the long term. CryptoQuant claims that this data could be a potential recovery signal for XRP. The relative resilience of the price and the decline in exchange reserves could indicate positive investor sentiment for XRP, even if market conditions remain challenging. *This is not investment advice.

The Westlake, Texas-based firm is already capitalizing on strong engagement with digital assets and is poised to expand its offerings even further, Wurster explained on a recent conference call. According to a transcript, available on Seeking Alpha, the newly appointed CEO pointed to a broad range of available products‚Äîfrom crypto ETFs to Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures‚Äîand a rapidly growing interest from both clients and potential customers, adding: ‚ÄúWe saw a 400% increase in traffic to our crypto site recently‚Äî70% of whom were not clients.‚Äù That spike in traffic, Wurster noted, is a sign that Schwab‚Äôs reputation as a trusted financial brand is resonating with crypto-curious investors who may have previously been hesitant to jump in. ‚ÄúAs people in the industry are thinking about crypto, they‚Äôd love to work with a trusted brand‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre that firm.‚Äù You might also like: Chart of the week: Solana could end crypto market limbo with 10% rally, SOL eyes $150 target Spot crypto trading While Schwab currently enables access to crypto through ETFs, closed-end funds, and futures, Wurster revealed that the firm is actively planning to offer direct access to spot crypto trading.

Wurster framed the expansion as both a response to client demand and a strategic move to maintain the firm‚Äôs role as a top destination for retail and institutional crypto investors alike. As digital assets evolve from fringe fascination to mainstream financial tools, Schwab‚Äôs next chapter may look more Web3 than Wall Street. What‚Äôs the competition like? Several firms already offer spot crypto trading, giving users direct access to buy and sell actual cryptocurrencies. Leading crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Gemini dominate the space, offering robust platforms with a wide range of trading pairs and deep liquidity. These platforms are typically favored by both retail and institutional users for their user experience and advanced trading tools. Traditional finance players are also entering the arena. Fidelity, through its Fidelity Crypto platform, offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, while Robinhood and eToro enable commission-free crypto trades alongside stocks and ETFs.

Referencing a chart from IntoTheBlock, Brett pointed out that the total value locked (TVL) in RWA platforms has now exceeded $10 billion. This chart shows a steady climb in TVL from under $5 billion in mid-2024 to over $10 billion by April 2025, marking more than 100% growth within a year. The upward momentum is important as it reflects expanding confidence and capital inflows into blockchain-based tokenization of traditional assets such as real estate, credit, and government bonds. BOOOOOOOOOOOOM üí•üí•üî• BULLISH: The total value locked in real-world asset ( #RWA ) protocols has surpassed $10 billion, continuing its growth trend. $XRP pic.twitter.com/tdah8kbuxq ‚Äî Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 18, 2025 Implications for XRP in the Tokenization Sector This development carries strong implications for digital assets like XRP, which have been building infrastructure to support tokenized assets. Ripple has made it clear that real-world asset tokenization is a core focus. The company recently partnered with RWA.xyz to allow seamless tracking of tokenized assets and RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and has made significant strides in the tokenization market. As the RWA sector draws in more capital, XRP is best positioned to support the coming wave of tokenized assets. Its infrastructure is already tailored to these needs and is a natural fit for institutions looking to move from pilot projects to real-world implementations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Positioned for Utility-Based Growth The XRPL is engineered for efficiency and interoperability, both vital traits in the tokenization landscape. As traditional financial firms explore blockchain solutions, those with proven scalability will stand out. The XRPL already hosts tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and other assets and has become a popular choice for institutions looking to launch RWAs on the blockchain. WhiteRock, a multi-million dollar tokenized securities platform, recently went live on the XRPL , bringing tokenized stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and other real-world assets into the digital finance ecosystem. The $10 billion milestone shows that tokenization is not a distant concept but is already underway. This rise in locked value across protocols signals that institutional demand is growing, and as Brett pointed out, the market is responding favorably. XRP, one of the few digital assets with existing enterprise solutions for real-world value transfer, could benefit significantly from this adoption curve. If the trend in RWA TVL continues, the digital asset‚Äôs relevance as a settlement asset and infrastructure layer will become even more pronounced. Brett‚Äôs post serves as a timely signal that the tokenization market is accelerating, and XRP is capitalizing on that growth.

The plan suggests cutting stakeholder rewards from 7% to 3.79%, prompting support and opposition across different stakeholders. Aptos Push for Innovation Faces Resistance from Validators According to reports, the main argument behind AIP-119 is to move user focus from passive staking to more active use of capital within the ecosystem. Many supporters believe the current 7% reward encourages holding tokens without driving innovation. According to their position, reducing this yield can free up capital to support activities such as restaking, MEV extraction, and deeper participation in DeFi protocols. Proponents also argue that high-stakes returns are similar to excessive interest rates in traditional finance. The proposal‚Äôs authors describe the 7% as a risk-free benchmark and stress their position by stating that it might be holding the system back from realistic growth. Some, like crypto user Moon Shiesty, believe the drop in staking demand will be balanced out by inflation control and new projects launching in the next half-year. He mentioned that funds saved from staking rewards could be used to support early Layer 1 stablecoins through incentives and lower gas fees. Meanwhile, Aptos recently shifted its focus toward strengthening its NFT and DeFi ecosystem . This aims to attract developers and projects looking for alternatives to Ethereum and Solana. Smaller Validators Fear Getting Priced Out It is worth noting that not everyone agrees. The report also disclosed that smaller validators say the proposal could hurt their ability to remain in the network. Running a validator node on Aptos costs between $15,000 and $35,000 annually. With rewards dropping, some fear they might not break even. The report details that more than 50 validators currently hold less than 3 million APT each. They represent just 9% of the total network but are important for maintaining decentralization. The proposal includes a delegation plan to support these operators by assigning extra tokens to help them stay afloat. Call for Balance in Governance Decisions It is important to add that notable Voices like Yui, COO of Slime Revolution, are urging caution. While speaking on the development, she warned that pushing out smaller players could affect the system‚Äôs health in the long run. Meanwhile, others argue that lowering emissions could lead to price growth, making up for the lower yield. The proposal remains under review, with the community watching closely. In related news, Aptos recently unveiled new upgrades for faster and more scalable blockchain solutions.

Tokyo faces a 24% levy on most exports to the United States, though that rate, like many of President Donald Trump‚Äôs duties, has been paused for 90 days. The temporary freeze is due to expire in early July, and economists warn that a snap‚Äëback could jolt trade in both directions. A 10% universal tariff still applies, and finished cars‚Äîone of Japan‚Äôs biggest money earners‚Äîcarry a separate 25% charge. Because the two countries follow different crash‚Äëtest systems, officials in Tokyo believe they can narrow the gap. Letting U.S. models meet American standards instead of Japan‚Äôs would be offered in exchange for lighter tariffs, unnamed sources told Nikkei . The tariff dispute has shaken markets and stirred fears of a deeper slowdown. Japan is trying to roll back what Trump calls ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù duties that he has imposed on dozens of trading partners. After one of the first round‚Äëtable sessions since the trade offensive began, Trump said Wednesday that the two sides had made ‚Äúbig progress.‚Äù Industry analysts say the wider fight over car tariffs could steer the future of electric vehicles in the United States. Tariffs may slow EV adoption in the US Many lower‚Äëpriced electric cars sold in America are imported. The 25% duty Trump placed on them is expected to raise sticker prices and curb demand. Higher costs and slower sales would squeeze profit margins and leave less money for research and development. ‚ÄúIf they are having to spend more money to either pay for tariffs or move production to the U.S., that‚Äôs significant capex for most of the companies,‚Äù said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funding not going to R&D, which means they‚Äôre not going to be able to innovate and not bring new technologies to market. That will make them less competitive in the global marketplace at a time they‚Äôre already getting shut out of China.‚Äù Affordability is already a hurdle Dealer data company Cox Automotive Inc. says the average transaction price of a new electric vehicle tops $55,000. Buyers also worry about driving range, public chargers, charging speed, grid stability, and a political debate over the cars‚Äô role in cutting emissions. Trump has ordered a review of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that helps consumers. Analysts warn that adding a 25% tariff to imported models‚Äîone tool automakers have used to keep prices down‚Äîcould lift costs by $4,000 to $20,000 per vehicle. Trump is acting under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, saying the country needs a strong manufacturing base and secure supply chain. He argues that the duties will bring jobs home, raise tax revenue, and help reduce the federal debt. The same 25% rate will hit imported auto parts starting May 3. Parts that meet the rules of the United States‚ÄëMexico‚ÄëCanada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2020, are exempt until the non‚ÄëU.S. share can be measured. There may be one bright spot for battery cars. The battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric vehicle. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers subsidies for battery plants in the United States, and billions of dollars are flowing into new factories. Officials say that, once a tracking system is in place, the auto tariffs will cover only the content made outside the country. A car assembled in Mexico but fitted with U.S.‚Äëmade batteries could avoid most of the duty. The administration has not said when that accounting will begin. For now, negotiators hope that a shift in Japan‚Äôs crash‚Äëtest rules will be enough to ease tensions and soften tariffs that have upended trade flows across the Pacific.

In its most recent SEC filing dated April 15, the company revealed a paper loss of approximately $41.8 million for the first quarter of 2025. This loss stems from the sharp drop in BTC prices, which slid from $93,500 at the beginning of January to almost $82,000 by March 31. Semler Scientific Sees Steep Losses Despite the downturn , Semler remains heavily invested in the cryptocurrency and holds 3,182 BTC at quarter‚Äôs end. The firm, which ranks as the twelfth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, right above Boyaa Interactive International Limited, continues to double down on its digital asset strategy. CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian reiterated this stance when he affirmed the company‚Äôs dual focus on Bitcoin accumulation and ongoing healthcare innovation. Financially, Semler projected modest revenue between $8.8 million and $8.9 million for the quarter, but operating losses are expected to land between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. As of March 31, Semler reported having about $10 million in cash and cash equivalents. In yet another strategic move, the company also announced plans to issue up to $500 million in securities, the proceeds of which are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including continued cryptocurrency purchases. However, investor sentiment appears wary. The company‚Äôs stock, traded under the ticker SMLR on the Nasdaq, has declined by more than 22% since the start of the year. Agreement With DOJ Semler Scientific announced via a separate 8-K filing that it has reached an agreement-in-principle to resolve longstanding legal concerns with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The company said that it is prepared to pay around $30 million to address allegations that it violated the False Claims Act through improper marketing practices tied to devices billed to Medicare. The DOJ‚Äôs civil investigation dates back to 2017, when it issued a formal demand to examine potential fraud. While this proposed settlement would mark a major step toward resolution, Semler‚Äôs filing noted that a finalized agreement with the agency is not yet guaranteed.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging from the shadows with the kind of early metrics and innovation that once defined top-tier projects. Those involved in the altcoin presale are purchasing MUTM tokens at a price of $0.025, with the platform raising a total of $6.9 million so far. The presale has attracted over 8,400 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. If the projections hold, this token may not just catch up to SOL and XRP, it could fly right past them. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform collected more than $6.9 million and accumulated 8,400 members in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of the Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 USD value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. The first users who join gain complete access to unique staking keys together with voting rights along with premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. The Ethereum-based platform achieves price stability by letting users deposit USD funds and operate within it stablecoin system. This transaction system utilizes a resilient solution to eliminate stability problems that typically appear in financial operations. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its two-part crypto lending system that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models to bring users better asset availability with enhanced transparency. Smart contract pools in the P2C model enable stablecoin lending by users so platform users can obtain instant borrowing access with passive income opportunities. Automatic interest rate adjustments enabled through smart contracts provide value to lenders through higher returns and lower costs of borrowing to borrowers. Decentralized lending takes place on the P2P model so users can bypass traditional financial institutions during their transactions. The borrowers and lenders can both negotiate specific loan conditions through this system to create an easier and more personalized process. All parties benefit from platform transparency because it provides users full control over their transactions thereby establishing trust and grants them power in their lending and borrowing activities. While giants like Solana (SOL) and XRP remain strong contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as a serious challenger. With $6.9 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM‚Äôs innovative dual-lending model and growing presale momentum signal massive upside potential. Early investors at $0.025 could see up to 140% ROI by launch. Don‚Äôt miss your window and get in early.

Fast transactions and cross border payments are what XRP is known for and has been a pioneer in displaying the capabilities of blockchain. But as the crypto space matures, the spotlight is shifting to platforms that combine blockchain with other game changing technologies. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a project that will redefine innovation by merging artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Ruvi AI is getting a lot of attention in the crypto space and for good reason. This forward thinking project has already sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised over $100,000 in just a few days of its presale. The excitement around Ruvi AI is not just about the ROI but also the utilities and the vision. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart? Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt launching another cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs launching an entire ecosystem that solves real world problems. At the heart of it is the Ruvi AI superapp, a feature rich platform that allows users to use AI for various tasks, from generating professional level content to creating visuals and multimedia. By holding the $RUVI token, users get access to this ecosystem and benefits including: Access to Premium AI Tools Whether you‚Äôre a marketer, content creator or entrepreneur, Ruvi AI‚Äôs superapp lets you streamline your workflow with AI generated text, images and even multimedia. Passive Income Opportunities Investors can stake their $RUVI tokens to earn rewards, effectively turn their holdings into a steady stream of income. Governance Rights Unlike traditional platforms, Ruvi AI gives token holders a voice in the decision making process of the ecosystem and features. This combination of utility, income and community driven governance makes $RUVI more than just a speculative asset. It‚Äôs a tool for innovation and growth. Limited Time Opportunity before 50% Price Increase The window to get in on Ruvi AI‚Äôs early growth is closing. During the current presale, $RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.01 each. Once this phase is over, the token price will increase by 50%, so now is the time to get in. For those looking to maximize returns, Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP bonus structure offers additional rewards. Through this system, investors can earn extra tokens based on the size of their presale contribution. VIP Tier 2 Example: Big Rewards for Small Investors To show how good the VIP system is, let‚Äôs say an investor puts in a small $500 during the presale. At the current price of $0.01 per token, that‚Äôs 50,000 $RUVI tokens, which qualifies the investor for VIP Tier 2. This tier gets a 40% bonus, which adds 20,000 tokens to their total allocation, making it 70,000 tokens. At the listed price of $0.07 per token, the original $500 investment becomes $4,900, a 880% ROI. That‚Äôs what Ruvi AI is offering to its early supporters. Leaderboard Rewards Add Extra Incentives If the VIP rewards weren‚Äôt enough, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program to recognize and reward its top investors. Throughout the presale , the biggest token holders are ranked and significant bonuses are given based on tiered rankings: Top 10 investors get an extra 500,000 $RUVI tokens (a $35,000 value at the listed price). Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens as a reward. Even broader groups, like the Top 1,000 get 20,000 tokens each. These bonuses stack on top of the VIP tier rewards, so serious investors get even more returns and a community driven environment. While XRP has established itself as a major player in the blockchain space, Ruvi AI is heading into uncharted territory. By combining blockchain with the power of artificial intelligence, this platform is solving real world problems and disrupting industries like digital media and content creation. Market analysts and crypto enthusiasts are raving about Ruvi AI‚Äôs utility, presale performance and vision. The $RUVI token is not just any other cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs an investment in the tools and technologies of the future. Next Steps for Ruvi AI The crypto world moves fast and those who get in early get the biggest returns. Ruvi AI has everything an investor could want in a blockchain project: innovative technology, tangible utilities and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. The first phase will be over soon and the price will increase by 50%. Now is the time to get in. Join the early adopters and get in on Ruvi AI.

After months of downward pressure, analysts are eyeing a possible breakout toward the long-awaited $1 target. $1 Dogecoin Price Target Closer Than Ever Crypto analyst Master Kenobi believes that the Dogecoin price could reach the highly coveted $1 target before the end of this market cycle. Based on his technical analysis, DOGE is once again mirroring a historical breakout pattern that previously led to an explosive surge in price. Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here‚Äôs What The Experts Say The analyst shared a Dogecoin price chart with two main sections highlighted. The first green box, between September to November 2024, shows a historical breakout that occurred after the meme coin broke above a critical descending trendline. Following this breakout, the price surged significantly over the next 55 days. Notably, the descending trendline has acted as a strong resistance for months. However, with Dogecoin‚Äôs momentum currently building, Master Kenobi believes that a strong breakout is imminent. Looking at DGOE‚Äôs price action, it appears the same conditions for its previous breakout are forming again. Master Kenobi‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that a breakout above the current descending resistance line could spark a similar rally, one that could potentially take Dogecoin from its current price of $0.158 to $0.9 or even $1. Such a move would represent a staggering gain of approximately 533%. Similar to past trends, Dogecoin‚Äôs current chart indicates a projected 55-day move following the breakout, with the green arrow and shaded box indicating a path to the conservative $0.9 target. This would place Dogecoin‚Äôs target window during the first few weeks of June, aligning closely with historical timelines from the last major breakout. Adding to the optimism, Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 43.35 ‚Äî a level typically considered a neutral to oversold zone. The current descending resistance line has already been tested multiple times, meaning a clean daily close above it could spark Dogecoin‚Äôs next major rally. Dogecoin RSI Shifts From Bearish To Bullish Dogecoin is showing promising signs of a bullish reversal after a key breakout of a technical pattern on the 4-hour chart. According to a recent chart analysis by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has exited a Falling Wedge formation and is preparing for an uptrend continuation. The breakout was confirmed as the RSI crossed above the 50 level, signaling a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Before the Falling Wedge breakout, Dogecoin had been trading in a downward channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. This pattern often precedes an upward price movement, and Dogecoin seems to be following through with this trend. As a result, the analysis suggests that Dogecoin could push toward stronger resistance levels in the short term.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund is expected to cut its global growth outlook. ‚ÄúOur new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession,‚Äù Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday. She added, ‚ÄúWe will also see markups to the inflation forecasts for some countries. We will caution that protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial‚Äëmarket stress.‚Äù The IMF announcement , delivered blocks from the White House, opens a week packed with reports that will test the impact of tariffs on global trade. Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 gather in Washington at the same time. Georgieva urged them to seek ‚Äúa more resilient world economy, not a drift to division,‚Äù calling the talks ‚Äúa vital forum for dialogue at a vital time.‚Äù United States and Canada The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book on Wednesday will offer ground‚Äëlevel stories about how firms are coping with higher tariffs and redrawn supply lines. Earlier that day, officials are expected to show a small rise in March new‚Äëhome sales. Mortgage rates have hovered above 6.5 percent since October, so builders have been offering discounts and upgrades to coax buyers. Data on existing‚Äëhome resales follow on Thursday. In Canada, the election campaign enters its last week with Prime Minister Mark Carney‚Äôs Liberals about five points ahead, close to the majority line, even as U.S. trade tension weighs on factories in Ontario and Alberta. Asia‚ÄëPacific China will set its loan prime rates on Monday; economists see no change after stronger first‚Äëquarter growth. Indonesia will post March trade data showing conditions before the U.S. measures took effect, while the Philippines is likely to record another balance‚Äëof‚Äëpayments surplus for the month. On Tuesday, New Zealand will release March trade numbers, and Taiwan and Hong Kong will publish employment data. A day later, Bank Indonesia is expected to keep its key rate steady for a third meeting to support the rupiah, one of Asia‚Äôs worst‚Äëperforming currencies this year. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa Most European markets close on Monday for a holiday, and many central bankers will be in Washington. Euro‚Äëarea consumer‚Äëconfidence data will arrive on Tuesday, followed by the European Central Bank‚Äôs survey of professional forecasters. The ECB wage tracker due Wednesday points to slower pay gains after President Christine Lagarde cut rates last week. Germany‚Äôs Ifo survey of business confidence will arrive on Thursday, showing how companies view the tariff shock and the new coalition agreement. Similar sentiment gauges from France are due Friday. The Swiss National Bank will report its first‚Äëquarter earnings on Thursday, and President Martin Schlegel will address its annual meeting a day later. Latin America Argentina, fresh from a 20 billion‚Äëdollar financing deal with the IMF that brings 12 billion dollars up front, releases February economic‚Äëactivity data on Tuesday. Colombia will post February numbers after January‚Äôs growth surprised analysts and led some to raise 2025 forecasts. Paraguay‚Äôs central bank may lift its policy rate above the current 6 percent after inflation jumped 100 basis points in four months to 4.4 percent. Brazil‚Äôs mid‚Äëmonth inflation report for April is due Friday; if March is a guide, the headline rate could move further beyond the top of the central bank‚Äôs target. Mexico ends the week with February economic‚Äëactivity figures and a mid‚Äëmonth consumer‚Äëprice update. What to expect next? Georgieva says the IMF does not expect a global recession, yet the run of data will give the clearest picture so far of how quickly the tariff fight is filtering through spending, hiring, and prices. Investors and officials will scan every report for clues on whether the world economy can absorb the shock or whether deeper cracks are forming. Markets will react as numbers come into focus soon.

Back in 2021, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu blew up outta nowhere. They took over Twitter, Reddit, and even made it into conversations at your local panader√≠a. Folks laughed at them at first‚Äîuntil those same coins minted millionaires. That‚Äôs the thing about meme coins: they thrive on culture, community, and pure digital energy. Now here we are in 2025, and meme coins have become more than just speculative assets. They‚Äôre vibrant communities, sometimes even stronger than those around serious DeFi projects. Meme coins represent rebellion, humor, and the underdog spirit‚Äîya sabes, that ‚Äúwe got nothin‚Äô to lose‚Äù attitude. And while some came and vanished faster than a reggaet√≥n summer hit, others left footprints (or pawprints) that made the crypto world sit up and pay attention. Enter Troller Cat ($TCAT). This ain‚Äôt your average meme coin. This fluffy rebel is bringing a whole new game to the table. It‚Äôs got the humor, sure‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also got whispers of play-to-earn utility, potential deflationary mechanics, and early adopters foaming at the mouth with excitement. If you‚Äôve been on the sidelines, scratching your head and thinking, ‚Äú¬øSer√° que esta vez s√≠?‚Äù, this is your moment. The Troller Cat whitelist is open, and let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs pure fuego. The Real Power of Getting in Early Whitelist Imagine it‚Äôs 2010. Bitcoin is under a buck, and you got invited to buy some by a techie friend. You passed. ‚ÄúToo weird,‚Äù you said. Fast forward, and that same friend‚Äôs buying property in Punta del Este or sipping Malbec in Mendoza on a Tuesday. You? Still saying, ‚ÄúNext time.‚Äù Well, guess what. Troller Cat is your ‚Äúnext time.‚Äù Getting on the whitelist of a meme coin like Troller Cat isn‚Äôt just some exclusive club‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic move. Being early gives you access to the token at the lowest price possible. When the presale opens to the public, you‚Äôll already be chilling with bags full of $TCAT, while everyone else is scrambling to catch up. It‚Äôs like showing up to the party before the DJ starts but already knowing the whole setlist. And here‚Äôs the chisme on the street: rumor has it that early holders might get access to exclusive features in the upcoming TrollerCat ecosystem. There‚Äôs talk of a Game Center with play-to-earn vibes, and a deflationary burn system that could make this cat rarer than a good avocado in Bolivia during off-season. Every time players interact with the platform, the supply goes down. People across Latin America have been quietly stacking up their favorite coins during presales. Why? Because they know the game. The big gains? They happen before everyone and their mam√° starts buying. And that‚Äôs the beauty of the whitelist‚Äîyou‚Äôre ahead of the curve, sipping your mate or caf√©, while the rest are just logging in. What Makes Troller Cat Different from Other Meme Coins? Let‚Äôs not pretend. The meme coin space is a circus. Some projects are cool, others‚Ä¶ puro humo. But Troller Cat? This kitty‚Äôs got claws and charisma. It ain‚Äôt just another copy-paste dog coin. Troller Cat is building a full-blown ecosystem where humor meets real use cases. That combo‚Äôs as rare as a good day in traffic on S√£o Paulo‚Äôs Marginal Tiet√™. First off, the branding is top-tier. Troller Cat‚Äôs visuals are cheeky, bold, and dripping with meme culture that hits different. It‚Äôs the kinda character that Gen Z and Millennial investors adore‚Äîfun, rebellious, a little loco, but somehow always on point. It‚Äôs like if Bad Bunny and El Chapul√≠n Colorado teamed up and dropped a coin. Then there‚Äôs the rumor mill. Staking rewards? Yep, people are whispering that early adopters might be in for some juicy APYs. Nothing confirmed yet, but if you‚Äôre on the whitelist, you‚Äôll likely be first in line to benefit. That‚Äôs the kind of alpha you don‚Äôt wanna miss. And this one‚Äôs big: Troller Cat might have a built-in Game Center, letting users earn while they play. That means utility, baby. And it‚Äôs deflationary, too. With each game transaction, some $TCAT gets burned. So while people play, your stack could become more valuable. Imagine playing your way to financial freedom. En serio, that‚Äôs some next-level innovation. We‚Äôve seen communities like Doge and Pepe explode because they were fun and united. But Troller Cat? It‚Äôs leveling up that idea. It‚Äôs got hype, it‚Äôs got memes, and it might just be the most clever cat in the crypto jungle. Latin American Crypto Fans, This One‚Äôs Tailor-Made for You Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîLatin America is low-key one of the most crypto-savvy regions in the world. With unstable currencies, wild inflation, and governments that sometimes dance bachata with corruption, folks here get it. Crypto isn‚Äôt just a flex‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline. A new kind of financial freedom. And meme coins? They‚Äôre like digital underdogs, just like many of us. Troller Cat is speaking your language‚Äîliterally and figuratively.

When you jump into the Troller Cat whitelist, you‚Äôre not just buying a coin‚Äîyou‚Äôre joining a tribe. One that values memes, money, and messing with the system. Plus, let‚Äôs be honest. The global North has had the first-mover advantage long enough. It‚Äôs our time to catch the wave early and ride it to el cielo. You‚Äôve seen how fast tokens fly once they hit public listings. Imagine the gains if you got in before that madness even starts. You could be sipping micheladas while your $TCAT stack multiplies. The Whitelist is Heating Up‚ÄîWhat Are You Waiting For?

But the real winners? They‚Äôll be the early cats‚Äîthe ones who believed in the whiskers before the rest saw the claws. Whitelist access gives you primo pricing. You can get your paws on $TCAT before the rest of the world even sees the light. That‚Äôs leverage, pap√°.

Posting to X, Farina stated that purchasing $1,000 worth of XRP at its current price of around $2 is equivalent to holding over $50,000, as he expects the asset‚Äôs price to reach $100.

This potential 50x return shows the asset‚Äôs potential and the confidence experts like Farina have in this investment. His message aligns with his past support for the digital asset. Another crypto expert recently described XRP‚Äôs utility as a safe haven for investors, and its use in cross-border payments, tokenization, and institutional finance could help drive adoption and price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions Farina‚Äôs statement drew strong reactions from the XRP community, ranging from enthusiastic agreement to cautious skepticism. One user expressed long-term optimism, saying he would revisit the post when others ask how early investors succeeded. Another commenter supported the idea of holding XRP, mentioning that he was glad to have accumulated the token at $0.50. However, not all responses were optimistic. Some questioned the feasibility of XRP reaching $100 within the next few years. One person remarked that XRP may not hit $10 in the next five years. A lot of skeptics cite concerns about growth pace and external challenges like regulation, but prominent supporters have debunked these claims. Is XRP On the Brink of a Price Surge? Farina previously showed through historical data that XRP always moves fast and aggressively . The asset‚Äôs rapid ascent from $0.5 to $3.39 between November 2024 and early January 2025 supports this belief, and I could experience much quicker growth as the market recovers from the recent downturn. Additionally, the recent dismissal of the SEC‚Äôs appeal against Ripple has removed all regulatory hurdles surrounding XRP. Ripple can freely innovate and offer industry-changing products without the fear of an attack from regulators. While skeptics may debate the timing or possibility of such high valuations, Farina‚Äôs confidence highlights the enduring belief among many investors that XRP is far from reaching its full potential.

The draft bill has been released for public consultation, which will be open until May 5, 2025. This will make Slovenia one of the first European nations to adopt the regulations. Finance Ministry Sets Clearer Rules on Crypto Asset Gains According to reports, the Ministry of Finance in Ljubljana presented the draft on Thursday through its Directorate for the Tax, Customs and Other Public Revenue System. As detailed , the proposal focuses on taxing profits from the sale or use of digital assets. This includes cases where crypto is converted into fiat currency, used to buy goods or services, or transferred to another person. Under the new rule, these are all treated as disposals. It is worth noting that the draft excludes crypto-to-crypto exchanges or transfers between wallets belonging to the same holder. This is seen as an attempt to reduce the reporting burden for users who do not convert their holdings into money or spend it. The proposed law intends to align Slovenia with international tax practices while keeping the paperwork manageable for taxpayers. It was reported that the ministry fixed the tax rate at 25%. Additionally, profits will be calculated by subtracting the crypto‚Äôs acquisition value from its value at the time of disposal. It is important to add that taxpayers must maintain accurate records of their acquisitions and sales. Authorities may ask to see these records at any time. Simplified Option for Taxpayers Included in Draft The proposal also includes a simplified approach. This method allows taxpayers to calculate their tax based on 40% of the total value of their crypto assets as of December 31, 2025. It also considers all disposals from the past five years and helps those without full records avoid calculating profits on each transaction. In related news, Ukraine‚Äôs financial watchdog has proposed taxing certain crypto transactions as personal income , with rates up to 23%. The watchdog aims to align with global standards while meeting local financial needs. Derivatives Also Face the Same Crypto Tax Rate Alongside crypto, the Ministry has included derivative financial instruments in the proposal. These would be taxed at the same 25%, no matter how long the asset was held before being sold. This change supports Slovenia‚Äôs Capital Market Development Strategy for 2023 to 2030, pushing for a more uniform tax system. Meanwhile, a Nigerian court has delayed Binance‚Äôs next hearing in the $2 billion tax evasion case until April 30 , allowing time for the tax authority to respond to a legal objection raised by Binance.

The Chainlink (LINK) price decline made headlines earlier this year, and now it‚Äôs showing signs of life with a 6% rebound. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) update is gaining traction as Soroban smart contracts officially go live, creating new opportunities for developers on the network. Both events have traders watching closely‚Äîbut not everyone is sticking with legacy names. That‚Äôs where Web3 ai is starting to stand out. Built as an all-in-one AI-powered research tool, it takes the guesswork out of finding the next high ROI crypto. Instead of spending hours sifting through documents and forums, users get a full breakdown of project potential‚Äîfrom tokenomics and team credibility to risk factors and vesting schedules. For traders looking to get ahead without drowning in data, it‚Äôs proving to be a real edge. Web3 ai: AI-Driven Research That Cuts Through the Noise If you‚Äôve ever spent an afternoon buried in whitepapers and Telegram links just to figure out whether a presale is worth your time, you already know the pain. Web3 ai‚Äôs ICO & Token Sale Advisor solves that. It uses AI to instantly analyze early-stage crypto projects across multiple chains and categories, including launchpad IDOs, meme coins, and real utility tokens. The tool doesn‚Äôt just score projects‚Äîit explains the reasoning behind its ratings. Want to know if the team is doxxed? How the tokenomics play out long term? Whether there‚Äôs a risky vesting cliff? It‚Äôs all there‚Äîsummarized, contextualized, and easy to understand. That makes Web3 ai a must-have for anyone seriously hunting the next high ROI crypto project. And while the tech is impressive, the economics are just as compelling. The $WAI token powers everything on the platform, from premium access to governance. Users who stake $WAI don‚Äôt just hold it‚Äîthey earn a portion of actual revenue from platform usage. It‚Äôs not just a utility token; it‚Äôs a piece of an AI SaaS ecosystem built to scale. The token is currently in presale across 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267, with a confirmed listing at $0.005242. That‚Äôs a potential 1747% ROI baked into the model for early supporters. In a space full of hype and empty promises, Web3 ai is aiming to deliver both product and value. Chainlink (LINK) Price Decline Shows Signs of Recovery Earlier in 2025, Chainlink (LINK) faced a tough stretch. Prices slid, sentiment wavered, and many questioned what was next. But March marked a turning point. Chainlink launched its Payment Abstraction system on mainnet, enabling users to pay for services like CCIP and automation using assets such as ETH, which then get auto-converted to LINK. Aave was among the first to jump on board, using Chainlink‚Äôs Smart Value Recapture system to improve liquidations. Since then, LINK‚Äôs chart has started to show a slow but steady comeback. It‚Äôs now printing higher lows, and some analysts are watching for a possible bullish reversal. With more focus on fundamentals‚Äîlike MEV protection and cross-chain utility‚ÄîChainlink is positioning itself for a broader 2025 narrative. The question isn‚Äôt whether the price will climb overnight‚Äîit‚Äôs whether the groundwork being laid today can drive sustainable traction later this year. Stellar (XLM) Update: Smart Contracts Bring Fresh Momentum Stellar‚Äôs big move in 2025 came with Protocol 20, which officially brought Soroban smart contracts to mainnet. It‚Äôs a major upgrade for the network, transforming Stellar from a simple payment-focused chain into one that now supports a full range of decentralized applications. The market responded quickly. In mid-March, XLM jumped more than 11% in a single day, outperforming major tokens on the CoinDesk 20 Index. This isn‚Äôt just about price‚Äîit‚Äôs about what‚Äôs now possible. Developers finally have a framework to build dApps on Stellar, and the ecosystem is responding with renewed energy. Tools, SDKs, and documentation are rolling out alongside the protocol update, suggesting Stellar isn‚Äôt just making announcements‚Äîit‚Äôs delivering infrastructure. If adoption follows, this could be the start of a long-term evolution for the chain. Final Take: Big Updates Are Good‚ÄîSmart Tools Are Better Yes, the Chainlink (LINK) price decline was concerning, but the recovery signals show there‚Äôs still life in the project. The Stellar (XLM) update is more than just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs a step toward real developer traction. But while both networks are building, the challenge for traders is always the same: how do you spot the right opportunities early? That‚Äôs where Web3 ai delivers. With its AI-driven due diligence system, users can evaluate projects faster and more accurately than ever‚Äîno spreadsheet tabs, no endless social digging. It‚Äôs a tool that does the hard part for you and gives you answers you can actually use. And with its presale running now‚Äîfrom $0.0003 to $0.003267 across 50 stages, and a listing price of $0.005242‚Äîearly users could see up to 1747% ROI. In a market flooded with hype, Web3 ai is earning attention for offering something that‚Äôs harder to find: clarity.

Optimism (OP) and Kaspa (KAS) are rising as well, each bringing fresh narratives to the altcoin scene in 2025. These names are drawing in capital‚Äîbut eyes are turning to a new contender quickly rising from the watchlists.

While the token isn‚Äôt listed on major platforms yet, traders are already calling it one of the most compelling new entries of 2025. FINAL ENTRY WINDOW ‚Äì PRE-SALE CLOSING FAST ‚Äì ACT NOW ROI Outlook ‚Äì Coin Comparisons Compared to coins like Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Optimism (OP), and Kaspa (KAS), the outlook for MAGACOINFINANCE presents a sharp contrast: Ripple (XRP): Known for stability and legacy partnerships, but 2025 growth models remain conservative, with many forecasting capped momentum in mature zones. Solana (SOL): Still favored for network performance, though its explosive growth phase appears to be tapering as it matures. Optimism (OP): Technologically promising, but adoption speed and user retention pose recurring challenges in the Layer-2 space. Kaspa (KAS): Well-regarded for its technical design, though slow mainstream integration has tempered recent investor excitement. MAGACOINFINANCE: Now emerging as a 52x valuation candidate, supported by consistent trendline growth, surging holder counts, and breakout-level social metrics‚Äîpositioning it as a standout for those targeting agile, early-phase entries. EARLY ENTRY = 4,500% RETURN ‚Äì BUY NOW ‚Äì LIMITED ACCESS Final Word Analysts tracking early-stage tokens with real upside are quickly including MAGACOINFINANCE in their 2025 shortlists.

The project is positioning itself as the key player in the blockchain gaming world. Gala‚Äôs ecosystem is designed to empower game developers and players by integrating blockchain into gaming experiences. From decentralized game ownership to in-game economies powered by crypto, Gala is laying the foundation for the next generation of gaming. One of Gala‚Äôs key innovations is its focus on user control. In traditional gaming, players have no real ownership over their in-game assets. You buy skins, weapons, and characters, but you don‚Äôt truly own them. With Gala, everything is on the blockchain, meaning that players can buy, sell, or trade in-game assets securely and transparently. As the next bull run crypto, Gala is also expanding its reach through partnerships with popular game developers, offering an ever-growing portfolio of games. With its Gala Games ecosystem, Gala is combining NFTs, gaming, and DeFi in a unique way, creating an environment where players, developers, and even spectators can participate in an entirely new digital economy. In 2025, Gala‚Äôs price action will likely be influenced by its ability to onboard new users and game developers. The ongoing integration of blockchain into gaming experiences presents a huge opportunity for Gala, and as more players start engaging with its ecosystem, the demand for $GALA tokens could soar. Hedera: The Fast, Secure, and Scalable Blockchain for Enterprises When it comes to scalability, few blockchain platforms can match Hedera.

The Hedera network is perfect for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology for real-world applications. From supply chain management to secure digital identity solutions, Hedera has established itself as a leader in enterprise blockchain. Unlike other networks that suffer from bottlenecks as usage increases, Hedera‚Äôs unique architecture allows it to handle large-scale operations seamlessly. Moreover, Hedera‚Äôs governance model is what sets it apart. Rather than relying on a small group of miners or validators, Hedera‚Äôs governing council is made up of some of the world‚Äôs largest companies, ensuring the network‚Äôs credibility and stability. This makes Hedera a strong contender for adoption by mainstream businesses looking to integrate blockchain technology. In the context of the next bull run crypto, Hedera‚Äôs focus on enterprise adoption and scalability positions it for continued growth. With its robust infrastructure and strong governance, Hedera is set to remain a top player in the blockchain space.

The figures demonstrate the alarming divergence between the two assets from April 2015 and April 2025. In particular, this striking ascent of Bitcoin has caught the eye of investors spread around the globe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Bitcoin Vs. Gold: From Equal Footing To Massive Gap Ten years ago, gold and Bitcoin were at similar prices. In April 2015, Bitcoin moved between $200 and $250, whereas gold was ranging around $1,200 to $1,300 per ounce. The fortunes of these investments have since become totally different. Bitcoin has soared to about $84,000 per coin, up some 33,500% in the ten-year period. The cryptocurrency briefly peaked at nearly $109,000 during the timeframe. If someone tries to tell you gold is better than Bitcoin‚Ä¶ Just show them this: In 2015, 1 BTC = 1 ounce of gold. Today? That same Bitcoin is up 13,693% in 10 years. Let the numbers speak. pic.twitter.com/8JipH5IsNr ‚Äî Ted (@TedPillows) April 17, 2025 Gold, on the other hand, has preserved its image of reliability over volatility, rather than offering spectacular gains. The precious metal increased by only 156% over the same period. From the market onlookers, gold‚Äôs worth proposition is still anchored on its consistent, inflation-proof behavior spanning very long timescales. Historical Context Demonstrates Divergent Patterns Of Growth Going back even farther shows an even greater disparity in the growth rates. According to a market analyst on social media platform X, the price of gold was only $20.67 per ounce in 1933. As for 2025, the price has gone up somewhat to around $3,330 an ounce, which is indeed a steep rise but a gradual increase over a period of almost a century. Ted's analysis on X. Bitcoin has had a completely different history. From a price of $1 in 2011, it came up to $84,000 by 2025. With such rapid appreciation rates, both excitement and skepticism have been brought forth by financial analysts debating the worthiness of such growths. Sheer Disparity In Size According to analyst Belle, a stark contrast in the behavior is due to the sheer difference in the size of their market. Gold has roughly a market capitalization of a little over $22 trillion. Due to this great size, gold provides an element of stability, rendering the market less sensitive to individual transactions or flows of short-term investments. GOLD added $1 trillion to its market cap in one day. That‚Äôs nearly the entire value of #Bitcoin right now. This shows how massive traditional markets are & how early we still are with Bitcoin. Even a small shift into $BTC could send it flying. pic.twitter.com/YsjSgOZKjx ‚Äî Belle (@Bitt_Belle) April 17, 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization is at approximately $1.667 trillion‚Äîlarge but still only a fraction of gold‚Äôs. This reduced size makes Bitcoin more sensitive to capital flows. Gold recently saw an impressive $1 trillion rise in market capitalization over one day, but this was a much smaller percentage move than the same dollar flow would trigger in Bitcoin‚Äôs value.

Base has onboarded 155 million addresses, bridged 1.9 million ETH (representing 1.6% of Ethereum's circulating supply), and currently secures nearly $10 billion in total value. Over the past six months, Base has averaged 93 transactions per second. Ethereum supports L2s through 'blobs,' a low-cost data storage mechanism introduced with EIP-4844. Industry analysis indicates that Ethereum's planned increases in blob capacity, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade to six blobs per block, may not be sufficient to meet rapid L2 transaction growth. Simulations suggest that a tenfold increase in L2 transactions could push average transaction fees to $0.64, unless blob capacity is expanded to at least 33 blobs per block to keep L2 transaction costs below $0.02.

Powell. ‚ÄúDonald Trump has hurt the credibility of the dollar with his aggressive moves on tariffs, for a long time,‚Äù Lombard told La Tribune Dimanche. ‚ÄúIf Powell is pushed out, this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.‚Äù He warned that higher borrowing costs would follow and a ‚Äúprofound disorganization of the country‚Äôs economy‚Äù would result, forcing Washington to seek talks ‚Äúsooner or later‚Äù to calm tensions. The remarks landed after Trump renewed a threat that has hovered for years: firing the Fed chair he appointed in 2018. On Thursday, speaking in the Oval Office, the president said, ‚ÄúIf I want him out, he‚Äôll be out of there real fast, believe me,‚Äù moments after posting online that ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs termination cannot come fast enough!‚Äù White House officials advise Trump not to fire Powell Investors watched a fresh spike in market nerves as the comments circulated. Inside the White House, advisers have told Trump that breaking with decades of central‚Äëbank independence could rattle already unstable financial markets , according to people familiar with the discussions. They also pointed to unanswered legal questions about whether a president can dismiss a Fed chief without cause. For now, those warnings have tempered action, the people said. Still, the debate is active. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that Trump was ‚Äústudying whether he could fire‚Äù Powell. The chair‚Äôs four‚Äëyear term ends in May 2026. Lombard‚Äôs intervention marked an unusually direct comment on U.S. domestic policy from a French minister. President Emmanuel Macron has clashed with Trump on Ukraine and trade, and has offered French research posts to American scientists whose funding was cut. Tariffs remain a second flash point. This month, the Trump administration imposed 10 percent duties on some European Union imports. Lombard said that level is ‚Äúa huge increase that isn‚Äôt sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade.‚Äù He added that Europe still wants a free‚Äëtrade zone with the United States and urged European chief executives to show ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù by working with their governments to protect the region‚Äôs interests. On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose LVMH group owns Mo√´t & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, and Hennessy, hinted that EU leaders were not pressing hard enough for a tariff accord. The tension around the Fed adds to a rough month on Wall Street, where investors have wrestled with the tariff wars and fears of slowing growth. Many see the central bank as a stabilizer. Undermining it, Lombard said, would shake confidence in the dollar itself. The immediate question is whether the president will act on his threats. As Trump put it, ‚ÄúIf I want him out,‚Äù he can move quickly. Whether markets would stay calm, Lombard suggested, is another matter entirely. Powell has not commented publicly on the latest threats as of yet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

It can handle thousands of transactions per second and is loved by developers and investors alike. But while Solana leads in performance, a new project is emerging that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to disrupt the crypto space, Ruvi AI (RUVI) . Ruvi AI is gaining recognition as the next big opportunity for investors with its presale success and unique blend of blockchain and AI. Early buyers of $RUVI during the presale will see massive returns and analysts are already predicting big price jumps after the token launches. Here‚Äôs why Ruvi AI is all the buzz and you don‚Äôt want to miss out. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Ecosystem: A Game-Changer for Users and Investors Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project. It‚Äôs an ecosystem around a superapp that democratizes artificial intelligence. The platform is designed to help marketers, content creators and entrepreneurs to use AI for tasks like generating professional text, creating visuals and producing multimedia. But what really sets Ruvi AI apart is its token utility that gives value to investors and users. Holders of the $RUVI token get: Premium AI Tools for streamlined workflows and better output. Passive Income through token staking. Governance Rights to have a say in the platform‚Äôs development. This trifecta of functionality makes Ruvi AI not just a tech platform but also an investment vehicle with tangible returns and utility. Early Presale Success Ruvi AI has caught the attention of investors worldwide, sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised $100,000 in the first few days of the presale . At the current price of $0.01 per token , this is the time to get in. But this offer is time limited. Once the current presale phase is over the token price will increase by 50% , so act fast to get ahead. Exclusive VIP Tier 3 Rewards Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP bonus structure adds another layer of excitement to the presale by rewarding investors based on their contribution. For example, consider the benefits of being in VIP Tier 3. An investment of $1,000 in the pre-sale causes the automatic distribution of $100,000 in RUVI tokens to the investor. Since the token is sold at a price of $0.01 per piece, 100000 token pieces are the result of it and the investor is bumped up to VIP Tier 3. The investor stands to get a bonus of 60% from the group and the total is then 160,000 tokens. Now consider Ruvi AI‚Äôs projected listing price of $0.07 per token . The $1,000 investment becomes $11,200 , a whopping 1,020% ROI . These rewards show Ruvi AI‚Äôs commitment to giving high value to its early backers. What are Ruvi‚Äôs Leaderboard Rewards? To complement the VIP structure, Ruvi AI has introduced a leaderboard rewards program that incentivizes top contributors during the presale. This program gives out token bonuses based on ranking: Top 10 investors get 500,000 additional tokens , worth $35,000 post-launch. Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens , valued at $17,500 . Even the Top 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens , a $1,400 value at the listing price. These leaderboard rewards stack on top of the VIP tier benefits, making the returns even more juicy for dedicated investors. Analysts Predict Big Returns Post-Launch Analysts are very bullish on Ruvi AI‚Äôs post-launch performance. And they have good reason to be: that utility and the momentum Ruvi‚Äôs seen so far in presales are a powerful combination. Many think the $RUVI token could hit‚Äîand stay above‚Äî$0.5 within months of its launch. What does that mean for early investors? If you buy in during the presale at $0.01, here‚Äôs what you can expect to see: For every dollar you invest, your returns would multiply tenfold to $0.50 per token. That‚Äôs a pretty enticing prospect. A VIP Tier 3 investor with 160,000 tokens would see their portfolio grow to $80,000‚Äîa massive 8000% return on investment. That kind of potential makes Ruvi AI one of the most exciting investment opportunities out there right now. Why Solana Investors Should Pay Attention Solana has shown that blockchain can be fast and scalable. But Ruvi AI is different. By combining advanced AI with blockchain‚Äôs transparency and security, Ruvi AI opens up new possibilities. Its ecosystem solves real-world problems in content creation, marketing and more while giving early participants big financial gains. Ruvi AI‚Äôs purpose is clear, its utility is unmatched and its design is innovative. It‚Äôs a must-have in any crypto portfolio. With real use cases and high growth potential, this is a competitor to established tokens like Solana. Conclusion Cryptocurrency markets reward those who position themselves early for the next big thing. With Ruvi AI, the opportunity is clear, from its ecosystem to its presale to post-launch projections. As the presale ends and the $RUVI price is about to rise, there‚Äôs no better time to get in. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor who knows Solana or new to crypto, Ruvi AI is a chance to be part of a game-changing solution that combines blockchain and AI.

Threshold Network powers tBTC, a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that can be used throughout DeFi ecosystems. The project‚Äôs native token, T , is trading at $0.0223 at time of writing, up from $0.0143 one week ago. The 236th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up nearly 48% in the past 24 hours alone. T‚Äôs price surge largely materialized after Threshold Network announced on Thursday that it planned to restructure its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to reduce annual operational costs by approximately $1.1 million. Explains the project, ‚ÄúAdded to the more than $8.5 million in annual savings expected from the elimination of tBTC staking rewards, this sets the stage for significant profitability moving forward. Cost efficiency also allows the DAO to eliminate treasury sales of T tokens, enabling it to strategically reinvest in T token. The DAO treasury will continue to accrue tBTC via bridge fees and T tokens via buybacks as per¬†TIP-54. Threshold has already completed its first purchase of ~30 million T tokens for 5.8 tBTC‚Ä¶ Given the tight economic linkage between T and tBTC, this shift is expected to create a virtuous cycle of growth, where increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and bridge velocity drive T‚Äôs value, attracting further participation and reinforcing the ecosystem‚Äôs expansion.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH), though still a juggernaut, is contending with high gas costs and congestion issues. Optimism (OP) and I njective (INJ) offer their own innovation layers, but neither has yet ignited the type of widespread traction seen in past cycles. Now, a different contender is drawing attention‚Äînot for what it‚Äôs done already, but for the projections being placed in front of it. Enter: MAGACOINFINANCE . EVERY MILLIONAIRE WAS EARLY ‚Äì 55X TARGET ‚Äì SECURE YOUR SPOT MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Analyst Watchlist Pick With 33x Forecast Few tokens are making the kind of quiet progress MAGACOINFINANCE is accomplishing right now. It isn‚Äôt trending on every platform yet‚Äîbut its name is showing up in more investor watchlists and analyst previews than ever before. What‚Äôs driving the movement? Steady user acquisition, consistent expansion in exposure, and technical setups that point to a potential launch beyond expectations. Current modeling from several high-profile trackers has placed a 33x return forecast on the altcoin, citing comparative entry points and trend velocity similar to major 2021 runs. It‚Äôs this kind of momentum shift that‚Äôs pulling in early buyers‚Äîespecially those who missed key windows with tokens like SOL, INJ, or OP. And while no forecast is a guarantee, the combination of tight supply mechanics and increasing retail discovery is creating real urgency across the board. 2025‚ÄôS TOP COIN ‚Äì 33X WINDOW OPEN ‚Äì JOIN NOW Coin Comparisons Ethereum (ETH) still leads in overall dominance, but its maturity means exponential growth is less likely. Solana (SOL) brings high performance and strong branding, yet some argue much of its 2025 potential has already been priced in. Optimism (OP) holds technical value in scaling layers, but adoption hasn‚Äôt caught fire outside niche ecosystems. Injective (INJ), while technically promising, remains in a holding pattern after early volatility. That‚Äôs why MAGACOINFINANCE is being discussed in different circles‚Äînot as the next SOL or XRP, but as something with its own trajectory. The 33x forecast places it firmly in the category of early momentum movers, not follow-up plays.

In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is still unfolding its narrative‚Äîand with projections pointing toward a 33x valuation , it could soon step into the spotlight as a serious contender.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a viral Ethereum-based token, now catching the eye of investors chasing Solana-like upside. With a newly launched leaderboard dashboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, the project has ignited a surge of interest from both whales and everyday traders. The project has raised more than $6.9 million and obtained over 8400 holder accounts. The fourth phase of MUTM offers tokens at $0.025 but the project launch price will begin at $0.06 which provides investors with a valuable 140% return on investment. Mutuum Finance could hit $4 sooner after the launch. MUTM is quickly becoming a serious performer as SOL fights to defend its place among the crypto elite. Surging Interest in the MUTM Presale During phase 4 of the MUTM presale investors have rapidly increased their contributions through 8400 accounts resulting in $6.9 million token deposits throughout the first several purchase days. Investors with hardware wallets can obtain MUTM tokens during pre-sale but they receive the following advantages: they get an opportunity to purchase tokens at $0.06 setting their future value potential. Mutuum Finance tokens will reach prices expected to surpass $4 after their listing date because exchange agreements will improve their value following launch. Mutuum Finance is in the process of a smart contract audit by CertiK, an essential measure to strengthen security and trust. The official report will be published on their social media once the audit is complete. Expanding the Mutuum Finance Ecosystem Mutuum Finance achieves its innovative expansion and sustainable growth objectives through its secure and scalable design which supports expansion potentials and architectural components. Predictive smart contracts optimize the lending mechanisms of the platform that connects various networks because of its platform-independent features. Stakeholders receive periodic rewards which generate passive income throughout their whole investment period. USD stablecoin provides stability to users through system-supported platform assets which establish a new economic direction. Mutuum Finance oriented itself as a top DeFi investment platform by deepening its liquidity operations while building its market positioning prior to its market listing. Exclusive Perks for Early Investors Mutuum Finance conducts an early adopter celebration giveaway that distributes $100,000 MUTM tokens while providing $10,000 MUTM tokens to each participant from the ten members who join. The platform gives users benefits from its referral network because new members earn greater rewards advantages through it. Mutuum Finance delivers foremost decentralized lending solutions through their dual-lending model that includes adjustable capabilities along with optimal operational results. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) platform strengthens both lender and borrower interactions by providing better rates of capital accessibility together with automatic management systems for interest rates. Each user within the Peer-to-Peer model independently establishes their personal loan agreements using the direct operating system provided by the model. Mutuum Finance establishes its place as the top DeFi lending service by implementing its dual-lending system for the market. Solana (SOL) remains a strong performer in 2025, but rising competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hard to ignore. The project has raised $6.9 million from over 8,400 investors, with current Phase 4 pricing at $0.025 and a launch price set at $0.06, offering early buyers up to 140% gains. A $100,000 giveaway, Top 50 Holder rewards, and a CertiK audit boost its credibility. Analysts see MUTM hitting $4 post-launch, making it a serious threat to legacy tokens. Now is the time to get in before prices jump in Phase 5.

The premier cryptocurrency is struggling to break out of the $85,000-$86,000 price range following an impressive price rally in the second week of April. However, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified the major price resistance for the current Bitcoin uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters New Phase: Analyst Predicts Positive Movement In 2025 Bitcoin STH Realized Price At $91,000 Presents Major Make-Or-Break Moment In a recent post on X, Martinez states that Bitcoin faces a key resistance level at the $91,275 following a price rebound in early April.¬†Notably, the asset surged by 17.33% after reaching a price low of $75,000 on April 9. However, BTC has since entered a consolidation following this feat, producing no significant price movement in either direction. Over the past week, the crypto market leader moved only between $84,000 to $86,000, forming a tight range-bound market. However, amidst these struggles, Martinez states that Bitcoin short-term holders realized the price lies at $91,275, indicating the pivotal resistance to the recent market resurgence lies ahead. For context, the short-term holders‚Äô realized price is the average price at which new buyers (i.e, new investors of Bitcoin over the past 155 days) acquired their BTC. It is an important technical indicator used to evaluate short-term market sentiment and behavior. When a market price is above the STH realized price, it indicates a bullish momentum as recent buyers are in profit and are likely to hold. In this case, the STH realized price serves as a strong support level, with new market entrants often defending their entry zone. However, when Bitcoin‚Äôs price is below the STH realized price as currently seen in the market, the realized price forms a significant psychological price resistance. This is because many short-term holders may choose to exit once the market breaks even, increasing the selling pressure around that zone. Therefore, Bitcoin reclaiming $91,275 is essential to validate a sufficient bullish potential to fuel a complete price reversal.

Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency is down by 1.34% on its monthly chart as bearish pressure continues to wane. While a major market resistance lies at $91,000, Bitcoin faces an immediate opposition at the $86,000 price zone, breaking past which could spur a sharp price rise to $91,000. However, a price fall below the support at $84,500 could result in a further price slide to $84,000 with the potential to trade as low as $83,300.

Several investment models now project a 5,700% return window , based on recent surges in wallet creation, watchlist adds, and overall trader engagement.

Let‚Äôs break down the current sentiment: Bitcoin (BTC) : While it still leads, it now represents a capital preservation asset rather than a growth vehicle. Cardano (ADA) : Technically mature but facing skepticism after previous cycles underperformed. Kaspa (KAS) and Arbitrum (ARB) : Active networks with solid use cases, yet neither are projected beyond a 4x window by leading analysts. By contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is pegged with a clear 62x upside potential , making it a high-leverage, early-access opportunity in a field where such setups are increasingly rare. The core difference? While most altcoins hope for momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE is already building it. 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER ‚Äî ENDS SOON!

43553185,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=712539,1745112725,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43553185.jpeg,Robert Kiyosaki predicts $1M Bitcoin by 2035 amid rising inflation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/kiyosaki-predicts-1m-bitcoin-by-2035/,"Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki recently predicted that Bitcoin will surpass the price of USD 1 million by 2035. Kiyosaki said he expects Bitcoin, gold, and silver to soar as the dollar loses strength because of inflation and the growing‚ÄÇtotal of government and debt. ‚ÄúI firmly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will exceed over $1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,‚Äù he wrote . Kiyosaki is famous for recommending hard asset investing, specifically gold and silver. In recent years, he has included BTC on that list, dubbing it ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù and a primary tool for preserving wealth. Kiyosaki says the American economy is heading for dangerous territory. As it stands, rising credit card debt, growing national debt, increased unemployment, and weakened retirement savings are a few red flags he points to. He thinks that the U.S. may be nearing what he calls a ‚Äúgreater depression.‚Äù In his post, he stated that in 2025, credit card debt had reached all-time highs, U.S. debt was at record levels, unemployment was rising, 401(k) plans were losing value, and pensions were being stolen. For him, the answer is not to place trust in traditional financial systems. Instead, he advises building wealth using assets governments can‚Äôt dilute or tinker with ‚Äî like Bitcoin. Experts predict Bitcoin will hit $1 million Kiyosaki isn‚Äôt the only one who believes that BTC will spike in the near future. Many famous investors and financial leaders have made statements with similar predictions of Bitcoin in the millions over the next 10 years. In May last year, Twitter co-founder millionaire Jack Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin would reach a million dollars by 2030. He said decentralized finance was the future and that Bitcoin would prosper with increasing mistrust in central banks. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raised her forecast in February 2025, arguing that Bitcoin could surpass $1.5 million by 2030. She said her expansion outlook is driven by demand growth, particularly from institutions and nations looking at crypto for use as a financial reserve. Eric Trump spoke at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi in December 2024. He said that its fixed supply and growing global interest make Bitcoin a powerful hedge against inflation ‚Äî and its value could soar to $1 million per coin. Others argue the price of BTC could be heavily affected by the actions of the U.S. government. If the U.S. started buying Bitcoin as part of a national reserve strategy, Blockstream CEO Adam Back hinted, prices could go to the moon. In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order that permits federal agencies to seize unused or confiscated crypto and to allow these assets to be converted into a strategic Bitcoin fund. The step was intended to bolster the country‚Äôs standing in a shifting global economy. Investors view Bitcoin as a shield against inflation Kiyosaki‚Äôs prediction is based, at its core, on his belief that inflation will keep eating away at the value of fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. He and others believe that Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized architecture, serves as a hedge against that risk. With increasing distrust in financial institutions globally, Bitcoin appeals to an increasingly broader range of investors ‚Äî retail and institutional. While critics identify potential volatility and regulatory obstructions, the general sentiment from many financial corporations is quite straightforward: Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term future looks bright. Whatever the outcome of this increasingly popular price target, several analysts hold that Bitcoin is transforming the global economy and will continue to do so in the years ahead.

The new tokens represented 4% of the project‚Äôs one billion token limit but boosted the circulating supply by 20%, from 200 million to 240 million. Traders had expected selling pressure; instead, the market price climbed from about $7.54 before the unlock to roughly $8.30, leaving the meme coin up 8.5 percent on the day and well above holiday‚Äëweekend lows. Data posted by CoinMarketCap shows that only $1.3 million volume can still nudge the price 2 percent on the largest exchanges, a sign of thin Easter weekend liquidity that can increase volatility. Token unlock events normally put a lot of pressure on digital coins because early holders can sell their bags. Thursday‚Äôs allocation belonged to the project‚Äôs creators and to CIC Digital LLC, the corporate entity that manages Trump‚Äôs licensing deals, the memecoin‚Äôs website states. Online forums buzzed with rumors that Trump is planning a gathering for major token holders. However, no details or confirmation have surfaced. The coin‚Äôs purpose is still unclear Beyond bets on the price action and movements, the coin‚Äôs purpose remains unclear. The project‚Äôs website says the tokens are ‚Äúan expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ‚Äò$TRUMP‚Äô and the associated artwork,‚Äù and stresses they are ‚Äúnot intended to be ‚Ä¶ an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.‚Äù Blockchain data by Dune shows that 636,000 wallets hold TRUMP, but only 12,285 control more than $1,000 worth. Research firm K33 labeled the tokenomics ‚Äúpoor‚Äù in a January note when the coin briefly touched its record $71. Regulatory scrutiny has followed the hype. Three days before taking office, Trump promoted the Solana‚Äëbased token on social media. The watchdog group Public Citizen urged authorities to investigate the endorsement. Reuters reported in February that entities behind the coin collected nearly $100 million in trading fees within two weeks, citing estimates from three blockchain‚Äëanalysis companies. Government concern has also spilled into lawmaking. Last month, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, R‚ÄëArk., said the Trump family‚Äôs growing crypto activity is complicating congressional efforts to craft stable‚Äëasset rules. It includes links to the decentralized‚Äëfinance venture World Liberty Financial and its planned stablecoin. Trump is listed as manager, president, secretary, and treasurer of CIC Digital LLC, which has already licensed his likeness for several NFT collections. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Recent statistics indicate that these large holders, or ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù are acquiring around three times the amount of daily Bitcoin produced by miners as the cryptocurrency sits at key price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Whales Purchase At Record Levels While Exchanges Witness Outflows According to Glassnode information, investors possessing between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoins are buying up the cryptocurrency aggressively. These giant holders are at present taking on over 300% of the annual supply emission of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, large crypto exchanges are seeing steady outflows of Bitcoin. This indicates that increasing numbers of whales and large holders are taking their assets to long-term storage instead of leaving them on hand for trading. Market observers view this exodus from exchanges as a sign of improving confidence in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. Most of these large investors have persisted in buying when prices drop, viewing downturns as opportunities to increase their positions rather than sell. Onchain analysts have reported that this activity is reminiscent of trends during Bitcoin‚Äôs 2020 bull cycle. Technical Indicators Reflect Key Resistance Points Bitcoin is now testing its 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages as points of resistance. Based on previous examination by analysts, these levels are approximately $85,500. A pullback could occur if Bitcoin does not manage to breach the technical barriers. The next important support lies at about $80,000 on the upper trendline of the current wedge formation. A narrow price range has existed for some time, between about $75,000 and $85,000. This period of lackluster volatility, combined with substantial buying pressure, may well suggest that accumulation is occurring behind the scenes in anticipation of a large price move. Related Reading: BNB Weathers The Storm Better Than Altcoins, Stats Show Three-Month Correction Follows Typical Bull Market Trend The price of Bitcoin is now back to correction after almost three months since reaching highs near $100,000 earlier in the year. The price has seen a drop of nearly 30% since then. According to analysts, this drop follows the typical trend of previous bull markets. A decrease of 25-35% occurring midway through the cycle would usually denote a situation from which the prices would then continue up once again.

Still, Anthony Pompliano, a long-term BTC bull, continues to believe in the long-term potential of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Pompliano sees the ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin price as a buying opportunity and expects the crypto king to resume its upward trajectory in the months ahead. For investors, even ones restricted in terms of available capital, that should come as good news since Bitcoin tends to drag the rest of the crypto market with it in the same direction. So, if it‚Äôs going to rally, other crypto assets, including meme coins, like CartelFi could also do well in 2025. CartelFi to move in tandem with BTC as it rallies Bitcoin has underperformed gold in recent weeks, but in the trailing 12 months, the performance of both assets has been identical. More importantly, the founder of Professional Capital Management is convinced that Bitcoin will surpass gold in terms of performance as we proceed through the remainder of 2025. ‚ÄúWhat we do see, though, is when gold runs, about 100 days later or so, Bitcoin not only catches up, it usually runs much harder,‚Äù he told CNBC in a recent interview . Pompliano‚Äôs comments indicate better days ahead for Bitcoin. And if they come to fruition, some of the capital, particularly from investors limited in terms of what they can invest, could find its way into CartelFi, given it‚Äôs going for pennies only at writing versus BTC at about $85,000.

CartelFi‚Äôs narrative is sitting well with the community CartelFi is committed to becoming more than an average meme coin.

That‚Äôs why the devs are calling this new platform the ‚Äúultimate staking cartel‚Äù. The narrative already seems to be sitting well with investors, considering the meme coin has raised more than $1 million in presale.

While traditional assets saw volatility, digital currencies responded with sharp pivots.

MAGACOINFINANCE , while still flying under the radar for many, is beginning to show the signs of a project with real breakout potential. Analysts tracking wallet activity, user growth, and community engagement have started pointing to MAGACOINFINANCE as a possible high-return altcoin.

XRP, despite its legal clarity and strong utility, is being priced more conservatively by analysts. Kaspa (KAS) has strong fundamentals, but slower adoption is tempering its near-term forecasts. Optimism (OP), a player in the scaling space, still faces pressure from fierce competition in the Layer-2 arena. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is just getting started. With lower exposure, a rapidly expanding user base, and a 4,200% projected upside , it holds the kind of profile that investors usually wish they had entered before the listings begin.

Both tokens have become foundational parts of the altcoin landscape. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) and Sei (SEI) are developing steadily, each carving out a niche within interoperability and speed-first applications.

PRESALE SELLING OUT ‚Äì CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Presale Token Projecting a 42x ROI Curve MAGACOINFINANCE has emerged as one of the most closely tracked altcoins among early-stage investors and on-chain analysts. The project is gaining momentum not through short-term hype but through tangible metrics: accelerating wallet creation, surging organic social mentions, and a strong increase in investor retention across platforms. Quantitative analysis from three independent research dashboards places MAGACOINFINANCE on a trajectory toward a 42x ROI curve , based on current entry levels versus forecasted market cap following listing. Analysts cite early-stage tokenomic structure, a highly engaged user base, and sharp pre-listing discovery as critical ingredients behind the model.

MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is gaining real momentum at the ground level.

Rising volumes and stronger sentiment suggest that several digital coins could move sharply in the weeks ahead. Five names‚ÄîNEAR, FET, ONDO, SEI, and a newcomer called Codename:Pepe‚Äîstand out for their recent patterns and news. Analysts and retail traders alike are keeping a close eye on them, waiting to see which one will make the first big jump. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new project that aims to combine two of crypto‚Äôs busiest trends: artificial intelligence and meme‚Äëdriven branding. Many tokens in the market use the word ‚ÄúAI‚Äù but do not offer real tools. Codename:Pepe‚Äôs is built around genuine machine‚Äëlearning features that scan social media feeds and blockchain data in real time. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. According to the roadmap, the project‚Äôs AI framework will spot new meme coins by watching posts and wallet activity. Measure market mood by checking online chatter and large‚Äëholder moves. Create trading forecasts, risk scores, and early buy‚Äëand‚Äësell signals. Moreover, update automated strategies on the fly so they keep pace with fast markets. The developers plan to keep expanding these tools over time. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors To raise funds, Codename:Pepe is running a community‚Äëdriven presale. The sale uses 28 price stages. In the first stage, the $AGNT token cost $0.003333333. Each stage lifts the price a little, so the first buyers pay the least. The supply on offer is limited, and every tier closes when its allocation sells out. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice The token brings together AI utility and the viral pull of memes. By tying real analytical features to a playful brand, the team hopes to build a broad user base. Supporters point to the small float in presale and the rising price ladder as reasons to enter early. Community channels on the project‚Äôs website, Telegram group, and X account have been growing since launch. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing ‚Äì Join the Mission Now! NEAR Protocol‚Äôs Tenfold Growth: A New Era for Blockchain in 2025 NEAR Protocol enjoyed major user growth in 2023, helped by the release of NEAT inscriptions‚Äîits own twist on non‚Äëfungible tokens‚Äîlast November. The launch drew many first‚Äëtime users. One year earlier, NEAR had partnered with Alibaba Cloud, opening its services to a near‚Äëbillion‚Äëstrong customer base. Although activity dipped after that deal, the chain gained speed again in October and November. Another boost came from KAIKAINOW, an app that lets people read content without unlocking their phones. By late 2024, NEAR‚Äôs market price climbed from under $4 to above $5. On January 23, 2025, CCN forecast that the coin could reach $8.21 during 2025. Longer‚Äërange predictions suggest $15 to $20 by 2030. Fetch.ai: Revolutionizing AI with Blockchain‚ÄîWill FET Soar to New Heights? Fetch.ai, founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh and Toby Simpson, aims to blend artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Their vision is a decentralized world where smart contracts engage with the physical world through Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs). These agents perform tasks like negotiating contracts and managing supply chains autonomously. By combining AI and blockchain, Fetch.ai enhances interoperability between systems. Users benefit from efficient processes, saving time and effort. The platform uses a proof-of-stake mechanism, offering scalability and energy efficiency. Its applications span various industries, including logistics, healthcare, and finance. Historically, FET‚Äôs price remained around $1 until early 2024. Then, it saw a significant rise to $3 within weeks, likely due to increased adoption of AI technology and interest in cryptocurrencies. Analysts speculate that with continued growth, FET could reach $10, considering its past performance and potential. Long-term predictions suggest even higher values. Some experts foresee FET reaching between $30 and $50 by 2050. However, these predictions are speculative, and the volatile nature of crypto markets means outcomes can vary widely. In the current market cycle, Fetch.ai‚Äôs integration of AI and blockchain positions it strongly. Its technology and growing partnerships make it an attractive option for those interested in innovative crypto projects. As industries increasingly adopt AI, FET could be poised for significant growth. Ondo Finance‚Äôs ONDO Token: Bridging Real-World Assets to DeFi Success Ondo Finance is revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) by bringing real-world assets on-chain. With its ONDO token, it offers institutional-grade liquidity solutions. By tokenizing assets like US Treasuries, Ondo makes traditional financial products accessible to all. Launched on January 18, 2024, ONDO‚Äôs price soared, peaking in June. After a downturn, a surge in interest for real-world asset cryptos boosted ONDO to a record high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, the token stood at $1.45, showing resilience. Price predictions are positive. By the end of 2025, ONDO could reach $3.50. Forecasts suggest $6 by 2026 and up to $12 by 2030. These estimates rely on Ondo‚Äôs continued growth and broader adoption. Founded by Nathan Allman and Pinku Surana, Ondo combines blockchain with traditional finance best practices. Investors can easily subscribe, redeem, and transfer synthetic assets. This innovative approach positions Ondo well in DeFi. With strong technology and market potential, ONDO looks attractive now. Its focus on real-world assets and solid leadership indicate future growth. As Ondo integrates further into finance, it could be a bright spot for investors. SEI‚Äôs Fast Track to 2025: Technology and Price Predictions SEI launched in August 2023 with a focus on quick trading. The chain advertises a confirmation time around 250 milliseconds, staking its claim as the fastest in the industry. The project hit its price peak in March 2024 but then slid even after a V2 upgrade in May. On January 23, 2025, SEI traded near $0.3385. Predictions call for an average of $0.75 by the end of 2025 and potentially $2.50 by 2030. SEI employs proof of stake to keep costs low while handling large order flows. By targeting speed, the platform aims to serve traders who need instant execution. With market attention shifting toward efficient infrastructure, SEI‚Äôs technical strengths may gain more notice if volumes rise and fees on older chains stay high. Conclusion Despite positive signals, NEAR, FET, ONDO, and SEI may offer limited short-term gains. Their growth potential might be overshadowed by more dynamic opportunities in the current bull market. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout contender for maximizing profits. Leveraging true artificial intelligence, it delivers valuable trading signals and automated strategies to navigate the meme coin space. With a strong community focus and innovative features, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself to capitalize on explosive market movements.

While the market suffered no major price pullback, the high level of sideways price movement indicates a strong investor uncertainty. Interestingly, popular market analyst with X username Daan Crypto has provided an insightful technical analysis on the BTC market, highlighting the present barriers that are restricting an upward price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Peril? Expert Warns Of China‚Äôs Alleged Scheme To Crash BTC To $40,000 Bitcoin Multiple Barriers: 200-Day EMA, 200-Day MA, And Diagonal Trendline In Focus Since hitting a new all-time high in late January, Bitcoin has slipped into heavy correction, losing over 22% of its market price. The majority of the price loss has been linked to international trade tariff crises, which have forced investors to seek relief in less risky assets. However, a pause in new tariffs and an onset in global negotiations soon accompanied a price rebound seen in early April. Albeit, Bitcoin is now struggling to break out of the $84,000-$86,000, forming a tight consolidation range. In performing a technical analysis on the current BTC market, Daan Crypto has identified the three resistance factors that have been active in the specified price zone. The first price opposition is a diagonal downtrend line formed by Bitcoin‚Äôs consistent lower lows and lower highs amidst the price correction in the past three months. To establish any intent of a trend reversal, Bitcoin bulls must force a convincing price breakout above this long-standing diagonal resistance. Other critical indicators are the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 200-day Simple Moving Average (MA), both of which provide an average of the past 200 days‚Äô prices, with the EMA giving more weight to recent prices. The 200-day EMA is important in spotting medium-to-long-term trend changes as it reacts faster to any price change than the 200-day MA, which is a classic long-term indicator. However, Bitcoin must move above both indicators to break out of its consolidation and perhaps experience a full price recovery. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout Bitcoin Ultimate Resistance At $90,000-$91,000 Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs struggles in the $84,000-$86,000 price zone, Daan Crypto has warned that the asset‚Äôs ultimate test of a price reversal is at the $90,000-$91,000 price range, which served as a key support in the earlier phase of the bull cycle. A successful reclaim of this range would place Bitcoin back into the bullish trading zone, signaling a potential resumption of the broader bull market. At press time, BTC continues to trade at $84,868 following a 0.13% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 42.34% and valued at $12.52 billion.

43559042,https://nulltx.com/?p=148119,1745124264,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Token Burn Events: A Key Strategy in Crypto Supply Management,https://nulltx.com/token-burn-events-a-key-strategy-in-crypto-supply-management/,"A common practice in the world of cryptocurrency is token burning , which aims to reduce the overall circulating supply of a digital asset. When a digital asset‚Äôs supply is decreased, the price of that asset may increase, benefiting holders of the token. These events, however, do not guarantee immediate price jumps and could even be considered a market manipulative tool for projects that do not have strong fundamentals. In the last few years, however, strong projects with solid fundamentals have conducted meaningful burn events. Here are some of them. Recent Burn Events Across Prominent Crypto Assets In the past few months, several major cryptocurrencies have been engaged in token burning, with some involving large amounts of their fully diluted valuations (FDV). Here‚Äôs a look at the most significant burns that have happened lately. $BGB ‚Äì A Massive Burn on April 17th On April 17, 2025, a leading digital asset in the market, the $BGB token, burned a quite remarkable 2.55% of its FDV. It is nearly 2.5 times the amount of mendacity needed to get on a billionaire‚Äôs radar. Now, this is a part of the show where, ordinarily, I might try to stick a little price forecast in there for good measure, but to be honest, the $BGB token has such a strong community that the result could very easily steer the asset in an upward trajectory. $BNB ‚Äì Consistent Burn Strategy Continues Binance Coin ($BNB), the native token of the Binance ecosystem, has a firm handshake with token burns. On April 16, 2025, Binance burned tokens right in front of their noses‚Äîa burn that, when added up, took out 1.00% of the token‚Äôs FDV. Now, of course, this is the Future Development Value we‚Äôre talking about, and some observers are putting the number to the tune of $800 million for what Binance actually burned. Noting that since the next FDV is never quite the same as the last, our tokenomics friends over at Binance have kept the price level fortuitously stable and increased the runway for long-term growth. And they do this with a wink and a smile. Recent Token Burn Events Token burns help reduce supply and can support price growth. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the latest burn events with % of FDV: $BGB ‚Äì 2.55% of FDV burned on Apr 17 $BNB ‚Äì 1.00% of FDV burned on Apr 16 $ORCA ‚Äì 30.5% of FDV burned on Apr 16 $OSMO ‚Äì 0.01% of‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/BjvxzWB84m ‚Äî CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 18, 2025 $ORCA ‚Äì A Major Reduction in FDV Maybe one of the most zesty burns in current memory happened on April 16, 2025, when the $ORCA token underwent a burn of a staggering 30.5% of its FDV. In terms of amount, in relation to the current circulating supply, and in relation to what it might mean for the short-term and long-term price movements of the token, this is a very big deal. It‚Äôs also obviously a very rare deal. So when something this significant happens, it‚Äôs only natural for investors to start thinking about the underlying reason for such a drastic move. $OSMO ‚Äì A Modest Burn in March On March 9, 2025, the token $OSMO, which powers the decentralized exchange Osmosis, burned only 0.01% of its FDV. Given the current conditions of the crypto economy, this is a comparatively low percentage for a token to be burning. And unlike many other projects that are deflationary by design, $OSMO is not: ‚ÄúUnlike other deflationary tokens, OSMO inflation isn‚Äôt motivated by market arbitrage opportunities; there aren‚Äôt external OSMO governance tokens waiting to be minted that will drive up the price of OSMO. In fact, the only motivation we have for burning OSMO right now is to make OSMO worth more over time.‚Äù $BORG ‚Äì A Tiny Burn with Potential Implications On March 5, 2025, the $BORG token had a tiny burn event, with just 0.04% of its FDV getting taken out of the circulating supply. For context, 0.04% of 67 million is about 28,000. The amount isn‚Äôt large enough to visibly impact price or supply in any meaningful way, but again, it is about the principle of providing the appearance and reassurance that a small, as of yet, not super significant project like $BORG is managing its token well. $CAKE ‚Äì A Significant Burn in February Conducted on February 27, 2025, 4.04% was reduced from PancakeSwap‚Äôs native token FDV due to its most recent token burn. This is one of the more prominent and significant fires happening lately‚Äîhappening in an exchange environment that is serving up a native token to a user base that is poised to notice disappearances in the supply of that token (in this case, by 4.04%). $QUBIC ‚Äì A Smaller Burn to Manage Supply On February 19, 2025, the $QUBIC token witnessed a minuscule 0.08% of its FDV being burned. While this sounds insignificant, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction for maintaining the supply of the token and introducing a little more scarcity into the ecosystem. And when it comes to positive price action, that‚Äôs the direction you want to head in. The Strategic Importance of Token Burns Even though there is a correction in the market currently, we believe it is a great time for HBAR to bring in more people to its ecosystem. We also congratulate HBAR Foundation for conducting HBAR token burns to reduce the number of circulating tokens. Following that, we profess $HBAR is an even more attractive investment option in comparison to many of its direct competitors. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin was stuck between $84,000 and $85,000, while Ethereum was hovering near its lowest point in months. This article provides a forecast for some of the top-performing coins like JasmyCoin (JASMY), Fartcoin, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), and Gala Games (GALA). Jasmy price prediction JASMY price chart | TradingView JasmyCoin is a top cryptocurrency often seen as Japan‚Äôs Bitcoin. It is a mid-cap token that is popular among traders. The Jasmy price bottomed at $0.00826 this month and has slowly made a comeback to the current $0.01538. The rebound happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a highly popular bullish sign in technical analysis. This pattern comprises of two descending and converging trendlines, with a comeback happening when they near their confluence. Jasmy price has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average, and is nearing the key resistance point at $0.01615, the lowest swing in November this year. Therefore, the coin has likely bottomed, and will continue rising, with the next point to watch being at $0.020, the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement point. A break above that level will signal more gains to the psychological point at $0.25. However, a drop below $0.013 will invalidate the bullish sign. Fartcoin price analysis FARTCOIN chart by TradingView Fartcoin has emerged as one of the most popular Solana meme coins in the crypto market. After bottoming at $0.1940 in February, the token rebounded to $0.8530. Fartcoin price has remained above the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pointed upwards. This rebound happened after the token formed a cup and handle pattern, comprising of a rounded bottom and some consolidation. The cup has a depth of approximately 70%, indicating that its primary target is $1.0722. This target is derived by measuring 70% from the cup‚Äôs upper side. It is also the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Read more: Fartcoin price prediction: is this the best Solana meme coin to buy? Gala price technical analysis GALA chart by TradingView Gala is one of the top gaming networks in the crypto industry. Some of the top games in its ecosystem are Town Star, Sweep it Poker, Champions Arena, and Treasure Tapper. Gala price peaked at $0.072 in November as most cryptocurrencies surged. It has then pulled back, moving to its a low of $0.01190, close to its lowest level on record. Gala Games token has formed a falling wedge pattern whose two lines are about to converge. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have formed a bullish divergence pattern. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising, with the initial target to watch being at $0.02620, the 23.6% retracement level. A drop below the support at $0.01120 will invalidate the bullish view. FET price prediction FET chart by TradingView The FET token dropped to a low of $0.3585 earlier this month and has since bounced back to its current price of $0.5700. It has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average, while the RSI and the MACD have pointed upwards. The next point to watch will be at $0.6970, which coincides with the lowest swing on August 5. This price was also the giant double-bottom point whose neckline was at $2.235. A break above that level will raise the possibility of it rising to the psychological point at $1.

43559153,https://nulltx.com/?p=148118,1745124498,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Movements in the Memecoin Market on April 18, 2025: A Day of Outflows",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-movements-in-the-memecoin-market-on-april-18-2025-a-day-of-outflows/,"The memecoin market saw a strong imbalance between inflows and outflows. On-chain activities from smart money indicated they were taking more capital out than putting in. Total volume on the day was only $10.28 million, yet net outflow was a stark $5.16 million‚Äîand seems to suggest a shift in sentiment away from at least some memecoins. That said, some projects classified as memecoins still seem to be pulling in positive inflows. So not all of them are seeing activity that suggests the merry memecoin days are over. Inflow vs. Outflow: A Day of Imbalance Although total inflows came to $2.56 million, outflows were almost three times greater, with $7.72 million departing the market. This was a period when there seemed to be more capital leaving than entering, and that could have been a cautious signal from traders or, more likely, could have been profit-taking behavior in a sector that‚Äôs known for its volatility. Some tokens, despite the market being generally down, found ways to attract new inflows. Take, for instance, $PNUT, $MTN, and $DARK: these were some of the only tokens in crypto that saw any capital inflows. But even they were insufficient to counteract the wave of outflows in the memecoin space. The overall net volume, which was negative at -$5.16 million, was an evident sign of the market not having any significant positive momentum. This showed that there was more selling pressure than buying pressure in the memecoin sector. A potential reflection of the cyclical nature of the memecoin market, with its rapid surges and sharp corrections. Tokens with Positive Inflows: Selective Interest Amidst the Downturn Even when the overall trend is down, some tokens manage to see money coming into them. One of those is $PNUT, a relatively high-profile memecoin at the moment, which saw its capital inflow amount to a hefty $837,000. What does this mean? It could mean investor confidence or even speculative interest in what could be an imminent breakout, as $PNUT is a token whose price could move heavily in one direction or the other based on the amount of social media buzz it is currently generating. Other tokens that received fresh inflows included $MTN, which saw fresh investments totaling $83K; $DARK, which attracted $93K; and smaller amounts into #CHILLGUY ($40K) and $BLOCK ($36K). Investing in these tokens seems much more contained and the amounts much smaller compared to conventional targets. Still, the fresh interest in them is undeniable. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 18/04/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $2.56M Outflow: $7.72M Volume: $10.28M Net Volume: -$5.16M There was inflow into: $PNUT ($837K) $MTN ($83K) $DARK ($93K) #CHILLGUY ($40K) $BLOCK ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KqGZmvVdNX ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 19, 2025 These inflows suggest that while the memecoin market as a whole might be cooling, certain projects are still attracting niche investors or traders looking for the next big thing. The selective nature of these inflows seems to indicate that traders are being more cautious and returning to a core approach that evaluates opportunities across a smaller range of tokens. Tokens with Notable Outflows: Signs of Profit-Taking and Caution Conversely, a number of tokens experienced significant outflows, which overshadowed the day‚Äôs other activities. The largest outflow hit $FARTCOIN, which saw a huge $4.30 million exit the market. This enormous withdrawal was almost certainly due to profit-taking, especially given the absolutely wild price swings that memecoins tend to have, allowing investors to take profits in a very short time after a huge surge. Significant outflows were seen from other tokens as well, with $WIF, for instance, seeing $139K leave, $JLP experiencing $660K in outflows, and $POPCAT parting with $832K. Again, while it‚Äôs not clear why any one token or another would see outflows, the fact that several in this group do is telling. Either investors are pulling back on the group as a whole or reallocating to something else. Outflows of this nature could be due to traders lessening their exposure in the wake of recent volatility or simply adhering to a market trend that‚Äôs seeing a lot of cautiousness and not much enthusiasm. Whatever the reason, traders seem to be pulling back on their volume with us and are seemingly also pulling back with their volume in the market overall. Looking Ahead: The Future of the Memecoin Market The memecoin market‚Äôs unpredictable characteristics make it hard to forecast whether these outflows will persist or if the inflows into certain tokens will start to reverse the trend. As it stands, the inflows‚Äô selectivity suggests that while memecoins‚Äô appeal hasn‚Äôt waned, investors are now somewhat pickier about which short-lived fads they‚Äôre investing in. It‚Äôs also possible that the current outflow period is part of a larger correction phase within the memecoin sector, where traders are consolidating before re-entering the market. Looking ahead, those who follow the market will be watching very closely to see how well tokens like $PNUT, $MTN, and $DARK perform. Can they keep the kind of momentum going that they‚Äôve got now? If they can and if we‚Äôre not in a totally downsliding market (which we only kind of are, as of this writing), then these tokens might give us a signal that there‚Äôs a new trend in the memecoin space. If, on the other hand, the total market is just sliding downhill, then inflows won‚Äôt matter much, and we can forget about life under the bridge as a way for these tokens to signal anything. So, here‚Äôs to hoping. The defining characteristic of the memecoin space continues to be volatility, and traders should be ready for abrupt mood swings in the market. Can the market shift back to a bullish trend, or will outflows keep dominating? It almost certainly will depend on two main factors: macroeconomic conditions and the actions of key players in the space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

But don‚Äôt be fooled by the sideways slumber. According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish structure is ‚Äústill intact,‚Äù with a Fibonacci-based target of $135,000 still in play for 2025. The $135K Prophecy The analyst insists that even if BTC pulls back to key support, the megatrend remains bullish. ‚ÄúThe path to higher highs is still open,‚Äù he posted . His bold prediction? Bitcoin is first eyeing $107,000, followed by a launch to $135,000, with or without short-term correction. In another post, he highlighted that the cryptocurrency was ‚Äúprogressing within a megaphone pattern,‚Äù a broadening formation with at least two higher highs and two lower lows, indicating increasing volatility and potential trend reversals. In his estimation, if history repeats, BTC could go up to $186,500, reflecting historical trends where the cryptocurrency‚Äôs megaphone formations preceded significant price movements, such as the 2017 peak near $20,000 followed by a correction. However, there‚Äôs a catch. According to the trader, Bitcoin remains stuck below the Ichimoku Kumo Cloud, a stubborn resistance zone that has capped upward momentum. Adding to the tension, the Easter weekend is expected to sap liquidity from the markets, raising the risk of erratic price swings in crypto. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has oscillated between $84,366 and $85,398, reflecting a market caught between accumulation and exhaustion. Zooming out, the seven-day performance shows a slight 2.1% uptick, which was still good enough to outperform the broader crypto market, down 0.8% in the same period. Whales Swarm Meanwhile, as retail traders watch the sideways action in frustration, whales and sharks are in a feeding frenzy, with Santiment reporting that wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC now control a record high 67.77% of the asset‚Äôs supply. Since March 22, these deep-pocketed investors have scooped up more than 53,600 BTC worth more than $4.5 billion, with the latest move being a $250 million buy-in, just hours before Bitcoin breached $85,000, sparking speculation of an incoming supply squeeze. Adding fuel to the fire, macro investor Kyle Chasse pointed to a $106.7 trillion liquidity surge from central banks, suggesting it could push Bitcoin into overdrive. ‚ÄúBITCOIN IS NEXT,‚Äù he declared , framing the number one cryptocurrency as a hedge against fiat debasement. The asset now stands at a pivotal junction. The ingredients for a rally are all there: whale accumulation, bullish technicals, and a potential liquidity boom. Still, the $85,000 resistance refuses to break. The post $135K in Sight?

The Refund Protocol allows for non-custodial refunds and a mostly on-chain dispute resolution process for payments made in $USDC. The Refund Protocol might represent the next step in the evolution of how digital currencies are exchanged. Enhancing on-chain transaction security, in any and every way possible, seems key to reaching the ‚Äútrustless‚Äù ideal proposed by early proponents of Bitcoin. Yet central to any ‚Äútrustless‚Äù exchange is a vision of a world in which on-chain, and by extension off-chain, transactions can be carried out without relying on any centralized intermediary. A range of key features characterizes the Refund Protocol. For one, it offers transparent, programmable escrow. If a buyer and seller can‚Äôt agree on a refund, then the Refund Protocol lets them engage the services of a non-custodial arbiter. Both of these features, I would argue, make it possible to handle refunds in a way that respects the trust-minimized nature of blockchain systems. This is important not only for the protocol‚Äôs users but also for the appearance and reality of stablecoins, which are (or ought to be) secure and transparent. Enhancing Trust with Programmable Escrow and Dispute Mediation The Refund Protocol‚Äôs standout feature is programmable escrow. In conventional payment systems, when buyers and sellers have to resolve disputes or request a refund, they rely on banks or third-party processors. The Refund Protocol, however, replaces these intermediaries with blockchain-based solutions that are promising in their transparency and security. Thanks to smart contracts, the Refund Protocol can hold funds in escrow until any disputes tied to the transaction are resolved. The system of smart contracts is clear and verifiable, and it lets one see at any time where the funds are. Both parties to a transaction can see the payment progress. The system does away with the need to trust some third party, and it certainly gives one more control over the funds, even in the event of a dispute. An important part of the system is the process used to resolve disputes, which Circle has designed to be managed by non-custodial arbiters. These arbiters act as neutral parties, step in when there‚Äôs a disagreement between users, and do so in a manner that ensures all resolutions are fair and transparent. Using non-custodial arbiters eliminates any potential bias or corruption that could arise with centralized mediators, and it also facilitates a sort of trustless resolution that is, in my opinion, a critical part of any system that is really trying to embody the ideals of a ‚Äúbanking with the unbanked‚Äù platform. Circle Launches Refund Protocol for Onchain Dispute Resolution and $USDC Refunds! @Circle has introduced Refund Protocol, a smart contract system enabling non-custodial refunds and onchain dispute resolution for #stablecoin payments‚Äîbringing trustless protections to real-world‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) April 18, 2025 Other key features of the system include non-custodial arbiters. These are neutral parties who step in when there‚Äôs a disagreement between users, and they do so in a fair and transparent manner. Early Withdrawals with Sender Approval Besides having the features of escrow and dispute mediation, the Refund Protocol allows early and sender-approved withdrawals. This is especially useful in the not-so-rare instances when a buyer wants to retrieve his or her funds before a dispute has been resolved. And it is one more way the Protocol helps to ensure that transactions are fair and mutually agreed upon. This flexibility can offer a major edge over conventional systems in which getting a hold of your money‚Äîin the form of a withdrawal or refund, say‚Äîis often a protracted and legally befuddling affair. The Refund Protocol allows users to access their funds faster in times when they need them and, as with all things blockchain, with an assured level of safety and transparency that‚Äôs downright enviable. The Refund Protocol draws on the expertise of Inflowpay, a company that works with payments, and knows well the ins and outs of payment processing systems. Inflowpay handles payment disputes and refunds in a decentralized manner, and its knowledge and experience have been instrumental in helping Circle develop the Refund Protocol. A Step Forward for Stablecoin Payments For users of $USDC and other stablecoins, the Refund Protocol marks a major step forward in securing on-chain payments. Although stablecoins like $USDC have long been a trusted tool for transferring value on the blockchain, the introduction of the Refund Protocol significantly upgrades the safety and security of stablecoin transactions. Circle is addressing a major user concern in the crypto space‚Äîsecurity‚Äîby providing non-custodial refunds and dispute resolution that‚Äôs trustless. The Refund Protocol has been developed in accordance with the most secure coding practices, making it a safe and efficient system. The protocol is not merely a research paper; it has already been implemented and tested within decentralized applications. We feel confident enough with the underlying code to release the Refund Protocol as an open-source project. It can be found here. Under its new Refund Protocol, Circle is setting a new standard for how stablecoins can be used in the real-world applications of today. This feature not only builds trust among users but also gives broader ballast to the adoption of $USDC in the wider financial ecosystem. After all, stablecoin transactions still largely have to pass through the existing banking system‚Äîby one means or another‚Äîso the use of $USDC in the actual payment transactions of today is as close to a banking-free payment system as one can get. Although the crypto world is ever growing, it is clear that Circle is making its way into the upper echelons of the most exciting and innovative companies. Why? Because it‚Äôs not only making USDC a valuable and reliable digital currency, but it‚Äôs also bringing it and its parent company directly to the forefront of Web 3.0.

As part of the unlock, 40 million tokens were released today‚Äîrepresenting 20% of the total circulating supply. The unlock‚Äôs current price is roughly $311 million, which is part of the reason why market observers are wondering about the price and liquidity of the token over the next few days. Though the direct response has so far been even-keeled, the situation with $TRUMP continues to change. Today‚Äôs unlock is just one part of a complex larger strategy involving not just $TRUMP but also the whole ecosystem being built around it. Despite this being the largest single release so far‚Äîsomething like 600,000 tokens‚Äîthe price of $TRUMP is down only 5% at midday. Daily Unlocks and the Pressure on $TRUMP The token unlock that occurred recently has shed light on the $TRUMP token‚Äôs daily operations. Along with 40 million tokens that were available for use today, we have learned that there are daily releases of 493,150 $TRUMP tokens ‚Äî a number worth around $3.79 million if you take the current market price as gospel. We are led to understand that the price of $TRUMP could be negatively affected in the near term by this ongoing supply pressure, as the S&P 493,000 Club keeps getting more members (i.e., as S&P 493,000 Club members keep getting $3.79 million worth of $TRUMP tokens daily). But the market is handling this relatively well without any signs of instability. Trump‚Äôs Memecoin Just Unlocked $300M TRUMP‚Äì What‚Äôs Next for $TRUMP ? The official token unlock for Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin #TRUMP is now complete! 40 MILLION $TRUMP tokens just got unlocked today ‚Äî that's 20% of the total circulating supply, worth around $311M at today‚Äôs‚Ä¶ https://t.co/N1aWoiWlvq pic.twitter.com/uhkuoT1Qgg ‚Äî Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) April 18, 2025 Now stands at just under 200 million tokens (199,999,976.64 to be exact), the total circulating supply of $TRUMP means that the token faces continuous selling pressure unless demand increases significantly. Coupled with daily unlocks, this sizable supply necessitates that price appreciation be characterized by increases in demand rather than decreases in supply. Interestingly, even though a considerable number of tokens were unlocked today, the price fell by only about 5%. This suggests that demand for $TRUMP is likely still strong enough to soak up all those new tokens. Now, normally, when a large quantity of tokens is released, it‚Äôs a sell signal for memecoins, like, say, $TRUMP. Yet despite market conditions that would typically send a memecoin‚Äôs price tumbling, the price of $TRUMP remains surprisingly stable. A Memecoin with a Real World Tie: Trump Plans a Dinner for Holders The $TRUMP token is not only associated with the political figure of Donald Trump, but it is also tied to interesting real-world incentives. An event is being planned‚Äîat least, that‚Äôs the word circulating‚Äîfor $TRUMP token holders. A recent price surge has been attributed to this expected announcement. Prices were up nearly 12% today, as excitement around the project has evidently been ramped up. The team behind the project seems to be in the process of making a dedicated webpage for the event, though it remains unclear what kind of event (if any) is actually in the pipeline. Market News: Trump Plans a Dinner for TRUMP Holders According to market rumors, @realDonaldTrump plans to host a dinner for $TRUMP token holders, and the team is working on a dedicated webpage for the event. As a result, $TRUMP has surged 12% today, bringing its current‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/43MRwvO3z7 ‚Äî Followin (@followin_io) April 19, 2025 A dinner might be an effective marketing strategy for the Trump token, aimed at building a loyal community of holders. It could also at least temporarily rev up interest in the token. By associating a real-world event with the digital currency, Trump and team are making a personal appeal that might resonate with potential investors. Memecoins often live or die by the strength of the communities around them and the viral nature of events associated with them. A dinner for holders of the Trump token, then, could be a way to pump up the price of that token. At present, the token‚Äôs market cap is elevated and resting at $1.69 billion. This mix of online and offline engagement is about as unique as it gets and could help keep $TRUMP in the public‚Äôs eye. The token unlock was a test of sorts for the market and for $TRUMP, and every indication was that the test had been passed. The Future of $TRUMP: A Balancing Act of Supply and Demand The future of $TRUMP depends on its ability to hold the line between two forces: ever-present supply pressure from daily unlocks and demand that‚Äôs generated by the community and real-world incentives. Sure, a dinner for token holders is something that could create some buzz and stir some interest in the project. But I think the long-term survival of $TRUMP is far more contingent on the absorption capacity of the wider market for the daily influx of new tokens. One factor to watch is how the market reacts as the daily unlocks continue. If the demand for $TRUMP continues to rise, the token might be able to hold its value or even appreciate over time despite the steady stream of new tokens. However, if demand fails to keep pace with the daily releases, the token could experience downward pressure in the coming months. Currently, the attention of investors seems to be squarely on $TRUMP, and with a market cap of $1.69 billion, it‚Äôs obvious that the project has, at the very least, booked some time on the crypto runway. Whether its price will keep climbing, or even stay at this level, is anybody‚Äôs guess. But with daily token releases and a few upcoming, potentially headline-making events (like Trump dining with some select guests), $TRUMP will remain a topic of conversation in the crypto space.

On-Chain Moves Suggest a Strategic Shift,https://nulltx.com/is-galaxy-digital-rotating-out-of-ethereum-and-into-solana-on-chain-moves-suggest-a-strategic-shift/,"The crypto markets are seeing an unprecedented level of activity from big institutions, and the spotlight is on Galaxy Digital after a recent batch of on-chain transactions that some are interpreting as a way for the firm to reduce its exposure to Ethereum while increasing its position in Solana . This hasn‚Äôt been a quiet week for on-chain activity from Galaxy. Blockchain data shows that in recent days, the firm has taken almost $78 million in SOL off centralized exchanges while putting $98 million worth of ETH onto those same exchanges. ùóúùòÄ ùóöùóÆùóπùóÆùòÖùòÜ ùóóùó∂ùó¥ùó∂ùòÅùóÆùóπ ùó±ùòÇùó∫ùóΩùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóòùóßùóõ ùó≥ùóºùóø ùó¶ùó¢ùóü? ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) April 19, 2025 This morning, just 30 minutes before this writing, a wallet tied to Galaxy Digital removed another 145,999 SOL, worth about $19.5 million, from Binance. This is three more times since last week that we‚Äôve seen a wallet connected to Galaxy pull down substantial assets from the exchange, bringing the total number of SOL moved off exchanges by Galaxy to an estimated $77.5 million.

According to onchain data, Galaxy has‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/n7C9IP3IYE ‚Äî SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) April 18, 2025 This pattern has not gone unnoticed. Analysts, traders, and the wider crypto community are now questioning whether Galaxy Digital is up to something. Is it executing a deliberate rotation out of Ethereum and into Solana? Could it be placing a bet on what might well be the next dominant smart contract platform? The Data Behind the Moves Over the course of one week, Galaxy Digital has sent out 72,781 ETH ‚Äî worth about $98 million ‚Äî to a number of different crypto exchanges. Generally, this kind of inflow tends to announce an upcoming liquidation or rebalancing act. To keep us on our toes, meanwhile, the same firm has been taking the opposite tack with SOL and pulling that crypto off of platforms like Binance and others. Those SOL now seem to be stashed in what can only be described as long-term custody wallets. These are big moves. When institutions shift this kind of capital, it is usually for very good reasons. So what unifies all of these deals above? First, they involve big sums of tied-up capital. Second, they all look to affect the same thing: increase the amount of Solana tied up in the Solana ecosystem (even if ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô means just one of the things that you can do in it, like looking at an NFT). You might even call this a coordinated Solana effort on the part of Galaxy and its friends. Observers in the industry are also looking at the behavior of institutions to understand what is happening. They are saying that what has been going on in the market is the result of institutions behaving in a certain way. At the same time, a lot of criticism is being directed at Ethereum from various quarters. And it‚Äôs not criticism that‚Äôs emerging as a result of any technological shortcomings that Ethereum has (there‚Äôs a lot of debate about whether or not Ethereum has any such shortcomings; I‚Äôll get into that in a second). Instead, the criticism seems to be mostly coming from stagnation in the scaling that Ethereum is achieving, in the network‚Äôs being able to handle increased demand, and also, in the network‚Äôs just being very expensive to use when demand is high. It‚Äôs not just Galaxy Digital that is losing patience with ETH. Other venture capital firms and institutional investors have also started reallocating funds or hedging their Ethereum exposure. Reallocating funds usually means venture capital firms and institutional investors are no longer bullish on an asset. Strategic Rotation or Tactical Hedge? It is yet to be seen if Galaxy Digital‚Äôs actions signal a shift in the firm‚Äôs long-term, strategic vision or if they are just a shorter-term hedge. The firm has taken its share of hard falls over the last couple of years and has rebounded nicely lately, with a prime opportunity narrative of Solana. With Solana‚Äôs Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) really picking up steam, new dApps, token launches, and ecosystem grants are revitalizing user interest on the Solana network. And with Solana again becoming a liquidity magnet, the prime opportunists over at Galaxy Digital seem to have taken a renewed interest in Solana. It is also worth mentioning that Galaxy possesses a substantial framework for managing on-chain assets, allowing it to shift large amounts of capital with relative ease and speed. Beyond that notable detail, the mix of ETH going into exchanges and the firm‚Äôs accumulation of SOL suggests a firm not just passively reallocating capital but actively betting on where it sees near-term and possibly mid-term upside. Currently, there is no public position from Galaxy Digital confirming or denying these intentions. But the blockchain tells a story that many in the industry are interpreting as a vote of confidence in Solana‚Äôs future ‚Äî and a warning sign that even major institutions may be growing weary of Ethereum‚Äôs current trajectory. Traders and analysts will be watching closely for more signs as this story continues to unfold. Whether Galaxy‚Äôs pivot turns out to be an early smart move or a high-stakes gamble, one thing is for certain: the institutions are not sitting still in a market that never sleeps.

It has crypto community members raising eyebrows for what seems to be a controlled liquidity maneuver ‚Äî a sell-off of sorts. The project team has apparently divested 23.45 million $MELANIA tokens over the past month, and it did so in a way that shouldn‚Äôt have affected the price much. Yet the team‚Äôs been using (or has been rumored to be using) some sketchy tactics to make it seem like the token‚Äôs going places when it‚Äôs really just, um, not. Meteora liquidity operations have mostly been conducted from the other side of the price pool, allowing sales of up to 50% of MELANIA without large-sell alerts being triggered. One downside to this approach is that it pushes the price paid per MELANIA up, but that‚Äôs a downside in the context of this activity being a sale to generate funds to pay for other aspects of the project, like team salaries. So why not just sell to the buy side? Because that would trigger a public sell alert on-chain, and nobody wants to be perceived as dumping their own project‚Äôs token. Gradual Sell-Off Raises Transparency Concerns The most recent activity occurred just seven hours ago, when the team transferred yet another 2.95 million $MELANIA tokens from its reserves. It sold this latest batch for 9,009 SOL ‚Äî worth around $1.2 million. As with the previous token transfers, this one is being recorded in a pseudonymous fashion. And ‚Äî again, with this latest transfer ‚Äî liquidity is being added in such a manner that the $MELANIA tokens are being sold in a kind of automated process as they are needed. And what‚Äôs really weird is that this was done in a range between a token price of 0.025 and 0.040 SOL. 7 Â∞èÊó∂ÂâçÔºåÂèàÊúâ 295 ‰∏áÊûö $MELANIA Ë¢´È°πÁõÆÊñπ‰ª•Ê∑ªÂä†ÂçïËæπÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßÁöÑÂΩ¢ÂºèÂá∫ÂîÆÊàê 9,009 Êûö SOL ($1.2M)„ÄÇ ËøáÂéª 3 Â§©ÈáåÔºå$MELANIA È°πÁõÆÊñπÁªßÁª≠‰ªéÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßË∑üÁ§æÂå∫Âú∞ÂùÄËΩ¨Âá∫ 764.3 ‰∏áÊûö $MELANIA ($3.21M)ÔºåÁÑ∂ÂêéÂú® Meteora ‰∏äÊ∑ªÂä†Âà∞ MELANIA/SOL ÂçïËæπÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßÔºåÂ∞Ü $MELANIA Âú®ËÆæÂÆöÂå∫Èó¥Âá∫ÂîÆÊàê SOL„ÄÇ ÂÖ∂‰∏≠ 295 ‰∏áÊûö‚Ä¶ https://t.co/DCOMFOsGfz pic.twitter.com/zL2rIeTqOB ‚Äî ‰ΩôÁÉ¨ (@EmberCN) April 19, 2025 This is not a singular occurrence. In just three days, the team has moved 7.643 million $MELANIA, about $3.21 million worth, from liquidity and community wallets. ‚ÄúThe tokens were also funneled into unilateral liquidity strategies that are offloading the $MELANIA for $SOL across a defined trading range,‚Äù Coindesk writes, referencing an Ocean Falls research report. ‚ÄúIn layman‚Äôs terms, that means they‚Äôre selling $MELANIA for $SOL, but doing it in a way that won‚Äôt make the price of $MELANIA tank.‚Äù Collectively, on-chain records indicate that over the last 30 days, the strategy of offloading $MELANIA has been executed a total of 23.45 million times. This constant sell-side pressure has funneled into accounts holding a cumulative total of 110,000 SOL, now worth around $14.75 million. Although this liquidity management isn‚Äôt necessarily bad or malicious, it ain‚Äôt good, either, when the team behind the project failed to relayed just what the hell their intentions were with the gathering of SOL. The investors and community members are starting to wonder if this liquidity action is a clever way to build a treasury or if it‚Äôs really a prolonged exit strategy in disguise. Market Impact and Community Reactions The ongoing liquidity injections have yet to make much of a dent in the price, and for this, we can thank the well-practiced team behind the project. They are selling tokens in a way that won‚Äôt get too many people too riled up in the short term‚Äîspreading sales across liquidity bands so as not to cause big on-chain price movements, for one. It‚Äôs almost like they are trying not to distribute the news that they are, in fact, distributing the tokens. Some community members view this as a treasury strategy that is far from erratic. They see it as an intentional, well-thought-out, and well-planned treasury strategy. They see it as an intentional move to build up reserves. They believe those reserves are going to be used for what I would call traditional development or marketing efforts. Others, however, see this as an outright betrayal of early supporters‚Äîa sellout, if you will. They see refusing to sell tokens as a kind of loyalty oath‚Äîand they see violating that loyalty oath as a precursor to The Flag of Cashing Out. The team‚Äôs silence adds fuel to the speculation. Officially, as of now, there has been no statement from the $MELANIA project concerning the 110,000 SOL that have been accumulated. What is their purpose? And more importantly, what is the long-term ecosystem plan, if there is one, for the token? Critics contend that if this is part of a strategic roadmap, the team should be clear with the community, especially considering how much value has been pulled from the liquidity pools in the last month. A couple of analysts have even started to draw parallels with other projects that have used comparable techniques and then, over time, shut down. At this point, the project‚Äôs wallets still hold large reserves, and the regular flow of $MELANIA into liquidity pools shows no immediate signs of abating. Traders and holders are left in a state of uncertainty, watching closely, questioning motives, and waiting for some clarity. As always in the world of cryptocurrency, when something happens and how openly it is communicated are of paramount importance. If the happening is not communicated in a timely manner, then those who should know may find out much too late. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to Farina, this is evidence that ‚Äúthe flip has already begun.‚Äù BREAKING: $XRP üëë has officially surpassed ETH in Fully Diluted Market Cap!

Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP‚Äôs supply in escrow, which keeps its market cap lower despite growing interest and usage. The fully diluted market cap considers the total supply of a token, not just what is currently circulating. XRP‚Äôs recent overtaking of ETH by this metric has renewed focus on the token‚Äôs long-term positioning in the cryptocurrency market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite being ranked third behind Ethereum in traditional market cap terms, XRP‚Äôs strong performance over the last few months has analysts reassessing its potential to climb further. Experts have long projected that XRP will eventually overtake ETH . Now, with XRP outperforming Ethereum for over five months straight‚Äîthe longest stretch since both tokens have coexisted‚Äîthe possibility of a full market cap flip is gaining momentum. Ethereum Slowly Losing Ground XRP‚Äôs sustained momentum has been supported by ongoing developments in its ecosystem and increased institutional engagement. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its appeal against Ripple , giving the asset full regulatory clarity and opening the door to increased institutional adoption. Moreover, the broader market appears to be reacting to XRP‚Äôs long-term potential rather than short-term speculation. This contrasts with Ethereum, which, while still dominant in decentralized finance and smart contracts, faces challenges such as scaling issues and high transaction costs that have yet to be fully resolved. At press time, XRP had an FDV of $208.69 billion, while Ethereum had an FDV of $193.59 billion. With Ethereum struggling to stay on top, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it loses its position to XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Across five months, the balance in the wallet has swayed from almost $10 million in profit to just under $10 million in loss; at this moment, a tipped-to-the-side scale between unrealized and realized loss precariously balances the two rather against the backdrop of the very profitable-looking alcoves of $PNUT, $ai16z, and $ARC, now harboring a whale. As per the blockchain data and trading activity analysis, the wallet in question deployed a total of $16.41 million in capital to pile up positions across the three tokens. But things went south quickly, with all three trades now in the red ‚Äî two already closed at a loss and one still open with a substantial floating deficit. Breakdown of the Losses: A Pricey Crypto Experiment Most of this whale‚Äôs capital went to $PNUT. The investor spent about $9.12 million to assemble a position at an average cost of $0.3448 per token. This move first got analysts‚Äô and retail traders‚Äô eyes, with some taking the buy as a bullish signal from a smart player. However, after weeks of downward price pressure, the wallet threw in the towel and fully exited its $PNUT position just two weeks ago ‚Äî realizing a loss of $4.975 million. Next in line is $ai16z, another heavily backed token in the whale‚Äôs portfolio. For this position, the investor spent $5.6 million to buy in at an average cost of $0.7447. Unlike the $PNUT play, this position remains open, but it has already generated a massive floating loss of $4.58 million. Market watchers have noted that unless the price of $ai16z sees a substantial rebound, the whale may be looking at yet another deep red exit if they choose to close it in the near future. The third and final token in this trilogy is $ARC. This whale entered this position at a cost of $0.2914, deploying $2.77 million in capital. But after market conditions turned against the token, this whale exited the position two months ago, realizing a loss of $426,000. Compared to the other two, this was a smaller bet ‚Äî but still contributed to the overall drawdown. These trades have incurred such damage that now they stand at an astonishing $9.98 million in realized and unrealized losses, reaping a 60 percent decline from the original investment capital. I am just stating obvious facts here, with my subpoenaed lawyer‚Äôs hat on.

In reality, though, we have no idea who is behind the address or how it is getting funded, and analysts at this point can only make educated guesses when working through the possibilities. A Stark Reminder of Risk in High-Cap Altcoin Plays Whale wallets are a form of sentiment analysis for many retail traders. If a large player is in a position, he must know something, right? Not necessarily. The recent story of FTX proves that size and even seemingly sophisticated strategies are no guarantee of success. If you follow a whale wallet, you are betting, in a way, on the smarts of a large and presumably informed player. But those bets can go bad in a hurry in crypto. Regardless of if the wallet is owned by Galaxy Digital or another institutional player, the losses show how fast times can change ‚Äî even for whales. The recent market volatility, coupled with the thin liquidity across many altcoins, is now forcing large holders to truly consider their positions. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to manage sizable stakes in many altcoins without a) suffering serious slippage (which is how we got here in the first place), or b) essentially acting as a market maker (which is what large holders usually do when they want to get in or out of a position without causing too much of a scene). Currently, the attention is on the $ai16z position, which is still open. If the token keeps falling, the whale might have to take more losses in the near future. But if the token reverses and the market turns, the whale might have a chance to see some of these losses get reduced. This saga is a powerful warning story‚Äînothing more, nothing less. It warns us not only about the risks of betting on speculative altcoins but also about trusting supposedly infallible whale wallets. Even the biggest players can miscalculate, and when they do, it hurts‚Äîbig time. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

One such tale just emerged from the nascent market for memecoins . An early investor in a new token called $LUCE once sat with $43 million in unrealized profits, but now he‚Äôs looking at a $342,000 paper loss on that same investment. As the value of $LUCE has plummeted in the past week, some have started to question whether the meme-inspired tokens are the next big bubble in crypto. This investor‚Äôs journey began on October 28, 2024, the very day $LUCE was minted. On that day, he purchased 19.14 million tokens, investing a total of five hundred twenty-seven thousand sixty-five dollars. Over the following seventeen days, the token surged in value, skyrocketing by eighty-two times and transforming his investment into an enormous fortune worth over forty-three million dollars. From $43M Profit to -$342K Loss ‚Äì When Diamond Hands Go Wrong 6 months ago, one early investor bought 19.14M $LUCE on the very day it was minted ‚Äî October 28, 2024 ‚Äî investing $527,065. Within 17 days, $LUCE pumped 82x, and his unrealized profit hit a massive $43 MILLION.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/THWeiGsC43 ‚Äî Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) April 19, 2025 The investor didn‚Äôt sell even one token, despite the remarkable gains. He didn‚Äôt even take out his original investment. Encouraged instead‚Äîcertainly, this wall street artist was using the diamond hands philosophy‚Äîthat in hope of even greater returns, one should not sell but should hold on even tighter than before, he surely was holding firm. But the memecoin market is brutal for the holders of tokens who get too caught up in the hype without a clear strategy for when to get out. Six months have passed since then, and $LUCE has plummeted over ninety-eight percent from its all-time high. The same assets that were once worth in the ten million dollar range are now worth something much less than the initial investment. Once the envy of the memecoin world, the wallet now holds a staggering unrealized loss of over three hundred forty-two thousand dollars. When Holding Too Long Goes Wrong The phrase ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù signifies a substantial level of holding an asset during market ups and downs. In the world of crypto, it‚Äôs used to commend those who don‚Äôt sell when the market gets turbulent. While the commendation fits certain assets with a long-term outlook (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), it doesn‚Äôt really fit speculative playthings (almost all tokens not named Bitcoin or Ethereum) that don‚Äôt have any fundamental value and aren‚Äôt going to be around in two, five, or ten years. In this instance, the investor overlooked one of the most fundamental rules of investing: secure your principal when you can. Many seasoned traders counsel retrieving your initial investment as soon as a trade turns profitable, allowing any leftover gains to ride with less emotional baggage. This method keeps the investor from mutable circumstances that make them lose money and provides more freedom to stay calm under the pressure of changing markets. Altogether, it protects the investor from total loss and keeps them on a rational path. Rather than being guided by a rational assessment of the odds, the investor let greed and overconfidence push him around. He held on to every last ounce of a stock during an unsustainable price run-up and left himself utterly and completely naked when the price crashed. And this reversal of fortune wasn‚Äôt just a missed opportunity; it was a collapse that wiped out a huge part of his net worth. Price action like this is common in the memecoin world. Countless tokens have taken the same path: an overly excited launch, huge early profits, and then a sharp turn south as interest and liquidity drain away. Even when they don‚Äôt take profits or rebalance their portfolios, that unrewarded hypothetical just-in-time timing can turn anyone‚Äôs biggest win into a soul-crushing loss overnight. The investor‚Äôs ether was somehow unlocked and then moved, but it wasn‚Äôt because the investor did any of the following: 1. moved any of his $LUCE tokens. 2. showed any signs of profit-taking. 3. made any partial sells. 4. attempted to exit during any smaller retracement. When $LUCE‚Äôs value went down more than 98 percent, this token-holder who was presumably still holding (and now in a 98 percent underwater position) showed no signs of moving or selling. The narrative has travelled far and wide, not as a reason to throw a party, but as a reason to heed the old saw about ‚Äúmaking hay while the sun shines.‚Äù Unsurprising, really, given that traders work under the constant pressure of short time frames and high stakes. Still, it‚Äôs a bit strange for such a collective victory to produce an atmosphere not of jubilation but of dread. But that‚Äôs the way the Bitcoin lightning story has gone so far. The reality is this: what wasn‚Äôt a collective victory for Bitcoin in any obvious sense has become a reason for business writers to swarm. And swarm they have. The crypto world is unpredictable, and it can make fortunes just as quickly as it can lose them. This investor‚Äôs tale highlights the crucial need for a strategy‚Äîexecuted with discipline‚Äîthat can weather these kinds of market storms. Of course, knowing when to get out is part of that strategy. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

They are essential to crypto‚Äôs liquidity landscape, providing the sorts of dollar-pegged assets that facilitate trades and offer safety in otherwise volatile markets. But of late, they‚Äôve been looking a bit less stable‚Äîand for a few pretty plausible reasons. #Stablecoin supply growth remains positive but has softened in recent weeks. As stablecoins serve as core quote assets across crypto markets, this slowdown adds further evidence of a broad contraction in digital asset liquidity and a more risk-off environment. pic.twitter.com/2ccBnwsSzp ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) April 17, 2025 As almost every crypto exchange and trading pair, stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI, have core quote assets. These assets signal capital movement and sentiment. When the supply of these assets is rising, it almost always indicates that an influx of fresh capital is coming into the space and is ready to be deployed into some of the riskier assets. At times when capital isn‚Äôt flowing into the forced reserve stablecoins, we can assume that investors are either pulling capital from the space or sitting in the space waiting for clearer market signals. The recent slowdown in stablecoin supply expansion, while subtle, is adding to accumulating signs that the wider crypto market might be entering a more prudent phase. After a year that was 2024‚Äîspeculatively by the main meme coin manias, AI token rallies, and a deluge of fresh on-chain projects‚Äîthat part of the crypto world seemed more like the deep, blue sea than the promising surf zone. And this is not to even mention at the turn from late 2024 into early 2025 and what might happen to crypto price action and trading volume if the Fed persistently keeps interest rates high. #Stablecoin transaction volume surpassed Visa's payment volume for the first time in 2024 in 2024, according to reports. pic.twitter.com/qLJH5Lg5iH ‚Äî Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) April 17, 2025 Stablecoins Outpace Visa in Transaction Volume Even with this growth slowdown, stablecoins‚Äô influence in international finance appears to be gaining. Reports suggest that, for the first time ever, stablecoins cleared more in payments than the Visa network does in a year. That‚Äôs quite a milestone for an asset class that many in traditional finance still view as a bit of a wild child. But what‚Äôs happening here isn‚Äôt just a crypto thing. This is also about transactions based on U.S. dollars, and stablecoins clearing payment volumes in a dollar-dominated world. Tether (USDT) has seen a 13% increase in users in Q1 2025, showcasing its role as a key financial tool in developing countries facing economic challenges. More info https://t.co/S5T6AnqxoQ #Crypto #Investment #USDT #Stablecoin #Finance ‚Äî Cobak (@CobakOfficial) April 15, 2025 Fast, low-cost and borderless transactions‚Äîthat‚Äôs what you get with stablecoins. This makes them a not-so-secret weapon for not just traders but also businesses, remittance platforms, and individuals wandering through the financial desert of unstable monetary policy. These dollar-backed digital currencies are part of a shift that threatens to take a huge bite out of the payment systems operated by traditional banking giants. Among all stablecoins, Tether (USDT) remains the forerunner in adoption. In the first quarter of 2025, USDT had a user base that increased by 13%‚Äîthat is, a significant leap that indicates growing usefulness in the very sort of places where its sort of decentralized functionality is most desired: developing nations. Those from the developed world who are poor and who are told they might as well stay poor are increasingly using Tether to shield themselves and their families from the sorts of things that make a currency unstable, inflation guaranteed, and financial system collapse all but certain. The expanding utility places stablecoins at a unique intersection of the crypto innovation and real-world financial resilience. While the speculative use cases may ebb and flow, the demand for stable, accessible, and censorship-resistant money remains persistently strong, especially in places where conventional finance fails. But, the macroeconomic headwinds we encounter don‚Äôt just blow against stablecoins; they blow against the whole crypto market and the whole economy. A sustained recession or series of negative quarter-on-quarter GDP reports (which can sometimes happen) can lead to memories of the Great Depression. These are waters the whole crypto market is trying not to tread. The worry among stablecoin issuers is that regulators may restrict the amount of cash that can back a stablecoin. However, a recent report from the International Monetary Fund notes that funds held at banks may not be enough to back all the stablecoins in circulation. If that‚Äôs the case, stablecoins are at another near-death experience. However, at present, stablecoins exemplify how crypto can shake up and make financial systems more accessible. Stablecoins were in the Digital Dollar 1.0 phase. They now meditate on what the next phase looks like. That is why they are here, reading from the same hymnal but acknowledging in their different ways that the agenda must change. In the coming year, the market will be observing intently to determine if the ascent of the stablecoin supply will once again gather steam‚Äîor if this most recent cool-off is a sign of a much longer withdrawal stretching over the whole crypto realm.

This month, 23.8 million $BLUR tokens‚Äîworth about $2.3 million‚Äîwere sent to Coinbase Prime, the institutional arm of the crypto exchange. The transfer is the latest installment in Blur‚Äôs monthly token unlock cycle, which began in mid-2023 and has since become a key factor in the token‚Äôs price behavior and circulating supply. Blur began its token unlock process on June 15, 2023, as part of a larger plan to very slowly and very deliberately bring its full token supply into circulation. Since then, the project has set free a little over a third of its total $BLUR token supply‚Äîabout 1.068 billion tokens (35.6%). Each batch of unlocked tokens has been sent off to Coinbase Prime, which very much suggests that Blur is making these tokens available for trading on the open market. The resulting unlocked tokens had a mind-boggling combined valuation at the point of transfer of an enormous $340 million. This really highlighted the unlock operation‚Äôs scale and made us rethink the token‚Äôs present-value proposition. But alas, here we are: the token‚Äôs trading value today is at $0.096, with the average transfer price being, by my estimate, around $0.318. ‰∏ÄÊúà‰∏ÄËß£ÈîÅÁöÑ Blur Âú® 1 Â∞èÊó∂ÂâçÂ∞ÜÊú¨ÊúàËß£ÈîÅÁöÑ 2380 ‰∏áÊûö $BLUR ($2.3M) ËΩ¨Ëøõ Coinbase Prime„ÄÇ Blur Ëá™ 2023/6/15 ËøõÂÖ•Ëß£ÈîÅÂë®Êúü‰ª•Êù•ÔºåÂ∑≤ÁªèËß£ÈîÅ‰∫Ü 35.6% ÊÄªÈáèÁöÑ BLUR (10.68 ‰∫øÊûö) Âπ∂ËΩ¨Ëøõ Coinbase Prime ËøõÂÖ•Â∏ÇÂú∫ÊµÅÈÄö„ÄÇ ‰ª•Ëß£ÈîÅËΩ¨Âá∫Êó∂ÁöÑ‰ª∑Ê†ºËÆ°ÁÆóÔºå‰ª∑ÂÄº $3.4 ‰∫ø„ÄÇËΩ¨Âá∫Âπ≥Âùá‰ª∑ $0.318ÔºåËÄå BLUR‚Ä¶ https://t.co/rcxFGzufcb pic.twitter.com/MZCGF6E16y ‚Äî ‰ΩôÁÉ¨ (@EmberCN) April 18, 2025 Token Unlocks Pressure Market as Prices Slide The average unlock price compared to the actual market price is getting larger. This emphasizes investor concern. Many in the community argue that the price going down is a direct result of too many unlocked tokens being dumped on the market. We have done quite a few unlocks now, and every one of them is basically creating a supply increase in the market. This is happening alongside demand that hasn‚Äôt really picked up in a major way. Blur‚Äôs strategy for unlocking tokens closely mirrors a familiar crypto project playbook‚Äîgradually releasing tokens held by teams, investors, and communities in a way that (ideally) avoids sudden supply shocks. In practice, though, scheduled unlocks can create problems for a project and its token, particularly in a bear market, or when demand just can‚Äôt keep up with new supply. They‚Äôre a kind of necessary evil in crypto, a way to ensure the people and institutions that helped make a project happen get compensated for their unpaid work and that the project doesn‚Äôt just fall apart. More than one-third of the total $BLUR supply has already been unlocked and is now in circulation, so the next phases of this release schedule have market participants‚Äô full attention. If the trend seen so far continues, significant additional volumes of $BLUR will make their way into the markets over the next few months. The result could be a supply-induced downturn unless the markets can come up with some fresh $BLUR demand or supply-side use cases to absorb the unlocked tokens. Blur, which has zeroed in on NFT marketplace aggregation and DeFi tools, accumulated a lot of hype upon launch and during its early operations. But as the crypto world changes and the speculative juices dry up, it‚Äôs become tougher for the company to keep pumpin‚Äô up investor interest and the value of its token. Blur remains busy running its unlock schedule, which is coming off with what seems to be lots of transparency and consistency. What does this mean for long-term holders of the token? Well, it may be a bit mixed. For institutional players, the predictable inflow of liquidity seems to be coming off fine and dandy, especially with its conjoined partner, Coinbase Prime. Market prices, however, don‚Äôt seem to be validating the token as retail investors and early adopters of this space who have bought in seem to be feeling the pinch. The path forward for $BLUR may rely tremendously on how Blur‚Äôs main offering and community develop. More usefulness, more platform users, or a revival in the NFT market could all steady or reverse the token‚Äôs present course. Until that day, the Blur ecosystem has to make sure that it doesn‚Äôt too freely expand liquidity. If it does, value could start drifting down, and a down market for any token is a distant cousin to the cash cows we do stables in Web3. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Solana (SOL) remains a strong force among Layer-1s, and XRP continues to prove its staying power in institutional finance. Polygon (MATIC), Aptos (APT), and Sei (SEI) are all battling for positioning in an increasingly crowded field. But as the rotation into high-upside plays accelerates, investor focus is shifting toward a new contender. That contender is MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äîand analysts are paying close attention. PRESALE SELLING OUT ‚Äì CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Still Under the Radar With a 6,250% Potential Climb There‚Äôs a measurable excitement building around MAGACOINFINANCE , but it‚Äôs not based on speculation‚Äîit‚Äôs driven by early investor activity and analyst forecasts. With wallet growth now exceeding 12,500+ holders and visibility on the rise, traders are positioning for what some are calling one of the final early-stage plays left in 2025. Research desks are now pointing to a 6,250% potential climb , using projection models tied to user base growth, market cap potential, and trading activity patterns ahead of major listings. The token is moving fast‚Äîbut not yet priced in by the broader market. This disconnect between valuation and visibility is precisely why experts believe MAGACOINFINANCE could follow the early trajectory of coins like Solana and Aptos before their explosive expansions. THIS IS YOUR 6,250% OPPORTUNITY ‚Äì ACT NOW ‚Äì JOIN EARLY Coin Comparisons Ripple ( XRP) remains relevant in payment rails, but long-term holders acknowledge its growth curve is maturing. Polygon (MATIC) continues to innovate in the scaling sector, though competition is limited upside.

Even as Bitcoin attempts rallies, pessimism runs rampant among analysts, who have lost conviction amid the current climate. Yet, diverging sharply from this trembling, AI-driven presale projects such as FloppyPepe are stirring fervor, being heralded by many as the next 100x AI presale token. Market Pulse: Navigating April‚Äôs Tariff Tremors & Crypto Predictions General sentiment across the crypto space continues to be held back by macroeconomic factors, the pending US-China trade war being one of them. This speculation is a direct contributor to massive capital flight from crypto assets as well as Bitcoin ETFs during the earlier part of this month. Although temporary halts to tariff pains provided some relief, the lingering threat of regress keeps markets on edge. adding to overall volatility. The ongoing battle for Bitcoin to firmly sustain gains above $86K is a testament to the considerable surrounding fragility. April‚Äôs trajectory, together with the start of May, looks to be challenging to navigate. Constructive developments surrounding the trade talks might activate a rally, testing Bitcoin‚Äôs upper resistance of $88K-$93K . On the flip side, renewed macro fears might prove detrimental, causing prices to fall to lower support levels of $74K-$78K, significantly devaluing Bitcoin. Hence, the short-term outlook can be defined as a cautious rogue troubled by a high sensitivity level to external news surrounding the economy and geopolitics. FloppyPepe Fever: The AI Token Tagged for 100x Potential Despite the downtrends in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is performing well in presales, earning the label of ‚ÄúAI token‚Äù from some followers, and they are predicting it to have a 100x return. This project combines the AI hype with meme culture and offers huge potential returns. The low entry price drives great expectations for volatility. The presale value for FPPE is $0.0000002, whereas the suggested target for the 100x potential sits at $0.00002. This means that, from a theoretical perspective, there would be huge returns on the original price. The narrative that drives presale popularity is the massive spike projected to follow, which seems possible given the position FloppyPepe holds as a key player between AI and meme culture. FloppyPepe‚Äôs AI Arsenal: Tools, Tokenomics & Audited Trust FloppyPepe is already showcasing some of its AI capabilities and promises not to just be another hollow speculative asset. Its unique components, like FloppyX (an AI video creation tool), as well as meme generators like Meme-o-Matic, which are said to be operational on Telegram, allow users a new level of creativity. They also help to build a collaborative ecosystem with a community around the project. This sets them apart from the traditional focus on meme coins. Coupled with a tech focus is a commitment to security, demonstrated by achieving a successful audit of the SolidProof smart contract, which provides important peace of mind for early investors. The ‚ÄòFloppynomics‚Äô of the project, which include token burning, rewards for holders, and charitable donations, also seek to enhance sustainability. Finding Opportunity Amidst Uncertainty While broader market fear prompts capital flight from some established assets, it simultaneously pushes discerning investors toward specific pockets of innovation. Projects like FloppyPepe , with a strong narrative focus on a trending sector like AI and demonstrable progress via tool launches, can potentially carve their own path. Its specific niche appeal might allow it to capture interest somewhat independently of the macro concerns weighing on Bitcoin, offering a targeted play on technological advancement. Leverage the AI Opportunity: The Case for FloppyPepe‚Äôs Attention-Seizing Presale With fear-mongering often dominating headlines and even Bitcoin taking center stage during times of scrutiny, scanning the landscape for authentic innovation is essential. FloppyPepe offers this opportunity‚Äîan early investment in an AI project leveraging its tools and building momentum during its presale phase. While all presales are riddled with risk, some of these worries are alleviated through FloppyPepe‚Äôs security audit and transparent tokenomic structure. Capitalizing on AI, this presale is unique at $0.0000002, straddling the dangerous intersection of artificial intelligence with the rapidly growing meme community. This is an outstanding opportunity in April for investors looking to ride the growth wedge FloppyPepes offers, especially when compared to other investments less correlated with macro fears. Embrace the FloppyPepe presale now and place yourself strategically amid the seismic shifts dictated by AI advancements in crypto.

In a post on X, SMQKE noted that the SEC must respond to Grayscale‚Äôs XRP spot ETF filing by that day. This deadline has gained significance in light of the recent approval of Teucrium‚Äôs 2x Leveraged XRP ETF . ‚ÄºÔ∏èBREAKING: XRP Spot ETFs Could Get the Green Light by May 22‚ÄºÔ∏è üëá pic.twitter.com/J71fGDFFxs ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 18, 2025 The SEC has acknowledged several applications for XRP spot ETFs, signaling that the agency is formally reviewing them. Acknowledgment does not mean approval but marks an important step in the regulatory process. With Teucrium‚Äôs leveraged XRP product already approved by the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), the SEC is now under pressure to justify why a less risky spot product should not be approved. Teucrium‚Äôs Approval Raises New Questions Teucrium‚Äôs 2x Leveraged XRP ETF, which relies on returns from European ETPs and swap agreements, was approved despite its complexity and risk profile. This fact is central to SMQKE‚Äôs argument, as the approval makes it harder to justify rejecting a spot XRP ETF. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Leveraged ETFs aim to amplify daily returns, which introduces greater volatility. If such a product is deemed acceptable, the rationale for denying simpler spot-based products becomes weaker. The market is also eager to trade with these products, as Teucrium‚Äôs CEO recently revealed that the XRP ETF was the most successful launch in the company‚Äôs history . SEC‚Äôs Shifting Approach to Crypto Regulation The SEC‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation appears to be changing. Over the past few months, the Commission has dropped several crypto-related lawsuits, including the long-running lawsuit against Ripple . Although the SEC has not formally endorsed cryptocurrencies, this move has been interpreted by many in the crypto space as a signal of a broader policy shift. This shifting stance is reflected in the agency‚Äôs willingness to engage with ETF applications tied to cryptocurrencies. These ETFs will likely be approved, as concerns about market manipulation and investor protection may not hold in the current regulatory environment, especially when riskier products like leveraged ETFs are approved. Investors will wait eagerly for the May 22 deadline, as many market participants believe ETFs will help XRP grow substantially. Whether the SEC grants or denies the application, the justification provided will likely influence how future XRP-related financial products are treated.

As the broader crypto market stabilizes amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global trade tensions, Solana has managed to inch closer to a critical resistance level. Despite the risks still looming, especially with trade war rhetoric between the US and China escalating, some market participants believe the conditions are aligning for a potential recovery rally. Adding weight to that view, recent on-chain data from Glassnode reveals a subtle yet notable shift in whale activity. The number of wallets holding more than 10,000 SOL has increased by 1.53% over the past week, rising from 4,943 to 5,019. This uptick suggests that larger holders may be accumulating ahead of a possible breakout, interpreting current price levels as favorable entry points. Historically, such accumulation phases have preceded strong upward moves, particularly when combined with technical recovery signals and improving market sentiment. Whether Solana can break through resistance and sustain a recovery remains uncertain, but the growing whale interest paints a cautiously optimistic picture for the days ahead. Whale Accumulation Grows As Bulls Regain Momentum Solana has been one of the hardest-hit assets during the recent market downturn. Since peaking in January, SOL has lost over 65% of its value, reflecting deep investor uncertainty and heightened selling pressure. As macroeconomic tensions between the US and China continue to grow, global markets have shifted toward a risk-off sentiment, with high-volatility assets like Solana taking the brunt of the damage. However, there may now be signs of relief. A possible resolution in the ongoing trade dispute and improving liquidity conditions are breathing fresh life into the broader altcoin market. In Solana‚Äôs case, the recovery narrative is gaining support from on-chain metrics. According to data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X , the number of wallets holding over 10,000 SOL has increased by 1.53% over the past week, rising from 4,943 to 5,019. This subtle but notable uptick in large-holder activity suggests growing institutional or whale confidence in Solana‚Äôs long-term potential. 10K | Source: Ali Martinez on X"" width=""860"" height=""484"" srcset=""https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=750 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=860 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=1140 1140w"" sizes=""(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"" loading=""lazy""/> This accumulation trend, paired with rising momentum among bulls, could mark the beginning of a shift in sentiment after weeks of relentless pressure. If global risk appetite improves and Solana can hold key support zones, this whale behavior could lead to a sustained rebound in price. Solana Tests Key Resistance As Investors Aim For A Recovery Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $140, just below a critical resistance zone that has capped price advances for weeks. After showing signs of strength in recent sessions, bulls are now attempting to push SOL above the $150 level‚Äîa key threshold that, if broken, could quickly propel the price toward the $180 mark. The current momentum is being closely watched, as reclaiming this resistance would signal a trend reversal and provide the foundation for a stronger bullish recovery. To confirm an uptrend, SOL must break and hold above the $150 mark and then target the 200-day moving average, currently acting as a dynamic resistance. A decisive move above the 200-day MA would indicate a shift in sentiment and reinforce Solana‚Äôs breakout potential in the near term. However, if bulls fail to reclaim and defend these levels, bearish pressure could return. A rejection at current prices would likely open the door for a retest of lower demand zones. Losing support around the $125 level could take SOL back to $100‚Äîa level that previously served as a strong support during earlier selloffs. The next few days will be pivotal for determining Solana‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

This collaboration aims to boost renewable energy use and blockchain technology across the nation, creating meaningful opportunities for sustainable development. A Partnership with Purpose Announced recently, this partnership is all about combining renewable energy with blockchain technology. Fedrok AG , a Swiss-registered blockchain company focused on sustainability, has developed a novel ‚ÄúProof of Green‚Äù consensus mechanism that rewards blockchain activity powered by renewable energy. Howarig Traders , based in Papua New Guinea (PNG), is known locally for its work in renewable energy projects. The company will help Fedrok apply blockchain tech directly to clean energy initiatives throughout the country. Together, they're aiming to set an example for sustainable blockchain practices globally. An important reason behind this collaboration is to introduce the T4G Pay system to Papua New Guinea. This blockchain-based payment platform integrates tokenized carbon credits and is designed to promote climate-positive financial activity. The platform will run on Fedrok‚Äôs Proof of Green consensus mechanism and use the T4G Token (T4GT), a stablecoin developed for everyday transactions across PNG. While T4GT powers the payment system locally, Fedrok‚Äôs broader blockchain ecosystem is built around the FDK Coin, its native cryptocurrency used for infrastructure-level operations and tokenized carbon markets beyond PNG. Green Energy as a Priority Fedrok‚Äôs Proof of Green method rewards renewable energy use by linking blockchain activities directly to measurable carbon reductions. Traditional blockchain activities have faced criticism for consuming high amounts of energy. Fedrok‚Äôs model handles this challenge by incentivizing energy efficiency from the start. For Papua New Guinea, a country full of renewable energy potential but reliant on fossil fuels, this could seriously change how energy is used. Howarig Traders will assist Fedrok in setting up projects involving solar, hydro, and wind power, all feeding directly into blockchain mining operations. This way, both carbon emissions and energy waste are reduced. The collaboration also emphasizes carbon credit tokenization. Through T4G Pay, landowners will be able to form Incorporated Land Groups (ILGs), map and assess carbon stock on their land, and claim tokenized carbon credits. These credits can then be traded transparently and securely on-chain, reducing fraud and promoting verifiable climate action. Real Opportunities for PNG‚Äôs Economy One of the partnership‚Äôs promises is its potential boost to the local economy. Renewable energy and blockchain combined can create immediate jobs and stimulate growth in technology-related fields. Training and skill-building programs are planned to make sure that local communities actively participate and gain expertise in both blockchain technology and renewable energy. ‚ÄúThis is about helping local communities participate in the carbon economy,‚Äù said Dr. Philip Blazdell, CEO of Fedrok AG. This fits well with Howarig Traders‚Äô long-term dedication to empowering communities and fostering local economic development. The T4G Pay system is also being developed with financial inclusion in mind. In a country where a huge portion of the population remains unbanked, T4G Pay will provide access through mobile apps, USSD codes for offline transactions, point-of-sale systems for merchants, and even T4G Visa cards. This allows rural and underserved populations to participate in both the digital and green economy. Proceeds from carbon credit sales will be distributed through smart contracts, guaranteeing that landowners receive a fair share, between 45‚Äì65% of net proceeds, after allocations for government, platform operations, and development. This transparent revenue-sharing model aims to build lasting infrastructure while delivering direct benefits to local communities. Transparency and Trust Another advantage of blockchain is transparency. Fedrok AG intends to use blockchain technology to clearly track renewable energy production and carbon reductions. This transparent and secure record will help build trust and accountability around environmental initiatives. Greater transparency could attract further international investment and support, improving Papua New Guinea‚Äôs standing as a leader in sustainable innovation. The implementation of T4G Pay will further enrich transparency in financial transactions, reducing corruption and mismanagement risks. The use of SevisPass Digital ID for platform access adds a secure, government-linked identity verification layer for users. A Step Forward for Sustainability Around the world, industries face increased pressure to adopt environmentally friendly practices. This partnership is a direct response, demonstrating how blockchain can be used practically and responsibly. With clear objectives and actionable plans, this partnership could become a leading example for other nations aiming to merge renewable energy with blockchain technology. It marks a notable step forward, not only for PNG but for sustainable practices globally. What‚Äôs Next? Both Fedrok AG and Howarig Traders have indicated that initial projects under this partnership will start soon, with pilot initiatives in various parts of Papua New Guinea. Already, there‚Äôs enthusiasm among local communities and governmental bodies about the positive impact this collaboration might have. As the world keeps an eye on these developments, Fedrok AG and Howarig Traders are setting a positive pace, showing how combining blockchain with renewable energy, innovative payment solutions like T4G Pay, tokenized carbon credits, and inclusive infrastructure can genuinely support national development.

During the company‚Äôs 2025 Spring Business Update this week , Schwab revealed that it is moving into spot crypto trading, allowing clients to directly buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This marks a big shift in how major financial firms approach digital assets. Schwab ‚ÄòOn A Great Path‚Äô to Launch Spot Crypto Trading Schwab currently enables access to crypto through ETFs, closed end funds, and futures. Wuster revealed that they are ‚Äúon a great path‚Äù to launch direct spot crypto trading within the next year. Schwab‚Äôs entry into the spot market would be a major step especially as regulatory clarity improves. He called the expansion a response to client demand as well as a strategic move to maintain its role as a top destination for retail and institutional crypto investors. Recently, the CEO highlighted growing interest in Schwab‚Äôs crypto offerings like ETFs and Bitcoin futures. Rick Wurster became Schwab‚Äôs CEO in 2025 and said in a 2024 interview that the firm was ready to offer crypto trading but was waiting for clearer regulations. Schwab saw a big 40% jump in profits last quarter, as many investors shifted their portfolios due to market volatility. Wurster suggested that some of those investors might be turning to crypto. Notably, there was a 400% surge in traffic to their crypto site, of which 70% was from non-clients which indicates rising public interest. Wurster noted that the massive spike in traffic indicates that investors who were once hesitant to jump into crypto space are now doing so, due to Schwab‚Äôs reputation as a trusted financial brand. ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said numerous times in past, spot crypto trading will be table stakes for every major brokerage,‚Äù reacted Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, to the development.

As he stated, ‚ÄúRipple and SWIFT are not partners.‚Äù His message aims to end years of speculation that reemerges with each market cycle. According to All Things XRP, this rumor dates back years, and in 2018, SWIFT publicly denied any talks with Ripple. Around the same time, the Ripple CEO clarified that the two entities competed rather than working together. Despite this clarity, recent developments have reignited the narrative of a collaboration. üö®üö´ RIPPLE & SWIFT PARTNERSHIP? LET‚ÄôS KILL THE MYTH ONCE AND FOR ALL. Every bull run, it‚Äôs the same recycled rumor: ‚ÄúRipple and SWIFT are partnering. Huge announcement incoming.‚Äù Let‚Äôs clear this up with facts not hopium. üëá üîπ 2018: SWIFT denied talks with Ripple. Ripple‚Äôs‚Ä¶ ‚Äî All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 18, 2025 Why the Rumor Resurfaced in 2025 All Things XRP pointed to Ripple‚Äôs acquisition of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin in late 2024 as the catalysts that renewed the speculation. Many in the XRP community believe these moves signal a deeper integration with traditional finance institutions. The timing of these announcements, especially in the wake of the SEC‚Äôs decision to withdraw its appeal against Ripple, has added to the speculation. A major source of confusion came in March 2025 when Watcher.Guru‚Äôs account was compromised. During the breach, posts claimed billions of XRP were locked in escrow and falsely suggested a partnership between SWIFT and Ripple. These claims were quickly debunked, but many believe a partnership is in the works. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SWIFT‚Äôs Blockchain Strategy It is accurate that SWIFT is exploring blockchain solutions. However, All Things XRP noted that the institution has chosen to collaborate with Chainlink for interoperability testing. Although Ripple‚Äôs clients, such as Santander, use its services, they are not operating through SWIFT‚Äôs infrastructure. Some XRP advocates point to potential benefits SWIFT could gain by integrating XRP. Yet, there‚Äôs no evidence that SWIFT has ever formally considered such a move. Independent studies by global banking organizations have acknowledged XRP‚Äôs potential, but SWIFT was not involved in these assessments. Misunderstood References and Misleading Assumptions Much of the confusion arises from indirect associations. For instance, EastNets, a third party that licenses SWIFT software, has mentioned using Ripple‚Äôs technology . Some see the mention as a direct connection between both parties, despite there being none. Similarly, Ripple and SWIFT‚Äôs alignment with ISO 20022 has led some to infer an impending collaboration. However, compliance with a global messaging standard does not equate to partnership. Despite persistent claims, no credible evidence supports the idea of a Ripple-SWIFT partnership. While such a relationship could benefit XRP in adoption and institutional recognition, it remains purely speculative.

His forecast for Bitcoin ( BTC ) Dominance to rise further comes as the ratio has already exceeded the levels many crypto analysts expected it would reach by late 2024. ‚ÄúUnit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated,‚Äù Mow said in an April 19 X post. Mow suggested that unit bias ‚Äî a psychological method in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually like to own a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size ‚Äî often causes less experienced investors to assume cheaper whole altcoins are better value than owning part of a Bitcoin. Mow questions altcoin valuations on level playing field ‚ÄúYou can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000,‚Äù Mow said. He asked, ‚ÄúWhat happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equivalent of 1/21 million?‚Äù He pointed out that Ether ( ETH ) would be priced at $9,200, XRP ( XRP ) would be priced at $5,800, and Solana ( SOL ) would be priced at $3,400 ‚Äî representing increases of approximately 278,746%, 470%, and 2,328%, respectively, from their prices at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. ‚ÄúNo way these alts are worth that much,‚Äù Mow said. Source: Samson Mow Sunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin proponent, said on Jan. 12 that ‚ÄúUnit bias is a core foundational framework of the normie mind. ‚ÄòCheaper better.‚Äô‚Äù Mow said that ‚Äúmost‚Äù altcoins take advantage of unit bias by implementing a very high total supply so market participants ‚Äúcan‚Äôt figure out what they‚Äôre buying.‚Äù Related: XRP: Why it‚Äôs outperforming altcoins ‚Äî and what comes next Based on his calculations, Mow said Bitcoin dominance is going ‚Äúso much higher.‚Äù Bitcoin dominance ‚Äî a metric that reflects Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market capitalization ‚Äî is often used by traders to gauge when Bitcoin might be nearing a price peak. Historically, when Bitcoin Dominance declines, it often signals the start of altcoin season, with capital flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins to find higher returns.

Experts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/has-ethereum-turned-itself-around-experts-weigh-in/,"‚ÄúThe Ethereum ship is slowly turning around,‚Äù claimed David Hoffman from Bankless on April 19. He added that the process started over six months ago and changes are already observable, highlighting six areas of change Ethereum is undergoing. The project went through a rough patch earlier this year with leadership issues at the Ethereum Foundation, developers jumping ship, and record levels of FUD being disseminated. However, despite that, it is still the industry standard network for DeFi, stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization , and decentralized applications. Evolution of Ethereum After primarily being research-focused for years, Ethereum is now recognizing the need to adapt in response to competitive pressures that emerged around 2021, argues Hoffman. He added that the Ethereum community is actively addressing these issues through aggressive layer-1 scaling, with plans to increase gas limits tenfold over two years. There has also been a shift from protocol-first to product-first thinking, with new leadership roles, and the Ethereum Foundation is taking a more active coordinating role with new co-executive directors. He also said there is now a more inclusive culture as the doors to the ‚ÄúIvory Tower‚Äù open, enabling a welcoming ecosystem of voices into roadmap conversations. There is better layer-2 integration and developing interoperability standards, positioning Ethereum layer-1 service provider to L2s. Finally, an increased urgency is embracing shorter roadmap cycles and faster protocol upgrades. ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs Strategic Pivot‚Äù The Ethereum ship is slowly turning around.

He argued Ethereum should stick to its rollup-centric layer-2 scaling strategy, which it has developed over the past five years. ‚ÄúPeople need to pick a lane and attempt to mitigate the risks associated with it vs scrambling to shift narratives and strategy every month.‚Äù He added that he was also against ‚Äújust do every approach,‚Äù which is probably the only thing worse than not picking an approach. Meanwhile, Ethereum prices remain at March 2023 levels, failing to push much higher than $1,600 so far this weekend. The post Has Ethereum Turned Itself Around?

While tokenizing real estate, art, or equities has become increasingly familiar, uranium‚Äîa tightly controlled, highly capital-intensive commodity‚Äîhas remained far out of reach for the average investor. That‚Äôs changing. Why Uranium? The uranium market, traditionally opaque and hard to access, trades over the counter in massive lot sizes‚Äîtypically 100,000 pounds, valued at around $6 million at today‚Äôs prices. It‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs not accessible to retail investors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an asset class of critical importance,‚Äù said Elvidge, ‚Äúbut historically very difficult to access.‚Äù Through a partnership with the Tezos Foundation, Uranium.io acquired a minimum tradable lot of uranium, stored it in a certified facility, and tokenized it, becoming one of the more interesting RWA crypto projects . Now, the average investor can gain exposure to physical uranium for as little as $4‚Äîno need for millions in capital or complex brokerage agreements. How It Works Uranium.io leverages a trust-based legal framework under English common law to represent fractional ownership in physical uranium. The uranium itself is stored in Cameco, one of three global storage facilities approved for this purpose (the other two are in the U.S. and France). Their partner, Curzon Uranium, helped facilitate the process. Users can buy tokens directly through the platform using a MetaMask wallet and USDC, with built-in on-chain analytics flagging suspicious activity. The onboarding is KYC-light, only requiring full identity verification if a red flag is raised. Each token represents a portion of the physical uranium stockpile, and‚Äîunlike most tokenized commodities‚Äîtoken holders can actually request physical delivery, assuming they have an approved converter account and pass relevant nonproliferation checks. One of the core advantages, Elvidge emphasized, is transparency. Currently, uranium pricing is derived from voluntary broker submissions and updated only during U.S. and UK trading hours. Uranium.io‚Äôs platform introduces real-time price discovery through live token trading. While the platform is still in its early stages, a market-making partner helps ensure price accuracy relative to legacy data feeds. Beyond Tokenization Hype Elvidge argues that Uranium.io is a case of real-world tokenization moving beyond buzzwords. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not doing tokenization for tokenization‚Äôs sake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is about taking something previously inaccessible and opening it up.‚Äù Increased access helps retail investors, but also benefits the broader uranium supply chain‚Äîparticularly fuel buyers and utility providers‚Äîby improving liquidity and price transparency. These market efficiencies are sorely lacking in the current OTC-only trading structure. While spot uranium trading is unregulated in many jurisdictions, Uranium.io has taken a careful approach to legal structure. Its framework doesn‚Äôt rely on an SPV and avoids categorizing the tokens as securities. Still, the regulatory environment is complex and remains under constant review, particularly as the project scales. Why Uranium Now? The fundamentals support long-term interest. Elvidge pointed to increasing demand from tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, all showing interest in nuclear power as a reliable energy source. Governments are shifting toward pro-nuclear energy policies. In 2023 alone, uranium demand reached 194 million pounds, while supply lagged behind at 155 million pounds. ‚ÄúUranium has no meaningful correlation with Bitcoin, the S&P 500, gold, or oil,‚Äù Elvidge noted. That makes it an attractive uncorrelated asset at a time when crypto investors are seeking diversification and stability amid risk-off market sentiment.

According to the company's statement, such correlation declines, especially observed on daily or hourly charts, indicate critical moments when the market may deviate from its usual direction. According to Alphractal‚Äôs analysis, historically, markets have experienced significant movements when correlations have fallen. The company has highlighted three key patterns: If Bitcoin moves sideways after a few days of bullishness and altcoin correlation drops, this is usually a sign of a market-wide price decline. If Bitcoin shows signs of recovery after falling for several days and the correlation falls again, it could signal that the downtrend is not over yet. If altcoin correlation remains high (around 1) while Bitcoin moves up or down, this may indicate that the market is in the process of consolidation or following a clear trend.

Tron (TRX): Fast and efficient, but long-term price movement remains limited. Arbitrum (ARB): Strong utility, but not showing the same investor response.

The 30x potential stands in sharp contrast to these more established assets, offering a unique window for traders seeking exponential growth rather than incremental returns. 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE ‚Äî USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT‚ÄôS GONE!

Phase 4 of the MUTM presale is now live, sparking optimism among investors. With over $6.9 million raised and 8400 holders already on board, new investors are snapping up MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.025, knowing that the price will rise to $0.03 in Phase 5. Current participants have the potential to earn a 140% return on investment before the official project launch at $0.06. MUTM presents an opportunity for those seeking to expand their crypto portfolios beyond established assets like SOL and ETH.‚Äã Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance has emerged as one of the rapidly rising top decentralized lending platforms thanks to its distinctive dual lending structure which attracts extensive investor interest. The project‚Äôs presale has attracted more than 8,400 investors who contributed $6.9 million to its success scale. During Phase 4 MUTM tokens offer a price of $0.025 yet investors can anticipate 20% profit growth from Phase 5‚Äôs price increase. Multiple analysts assure that MUTM represents a DeFi platform of low value because it will reach over $5 in market capitalization upon launching. MUTM provides investors with stable investment opportunities unlike the volatile nature of meme coins. Investors seeking returns from DeFi operations will find MUTM attractive due to its distinctive lending mechanisms along with a dynamic top-50 leader leaderboard system that provides benefits to loyal users.

Users can generate passive earnings through the P2C model by providing USDT liquidity with automatic functionality supported by smart contracts. Users have the ability to make direct transactions through the P2P model which eliminates the requirement for intermediaries. Mutuum Finance integrates its P2C and P2P systems to create an attractive decentralized finance solution which enhances user security and operational efficiency and decentralization for investors searching for profits in the DeFi sector. Creating Stability and Security in DeFi Mutuum Finance provides a USD-backed stablecoin operated on Ethereum as a long-term asset solution. Through the implementation of over-collateralization the platform maintains lower risks than conventional algorithmic stablecoins do.

The first participants to join Mutuum Finance gain special access to staking opportunities as well as governance powers along with priority updates which keeps them deeply involved in the project‚Äôs advancement.

By offering staking rewards, the platform incentivizes users to lock in their tokens, which helps support the token‚Äôs value as the project progresses. This approach ensures long-term growth and stability for both the platform and its investors, making MUTM a strong performer in the DeFi market. As Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) holders look to diversify their portfolios, many are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction with its innovative dual-lending model.

The estimate is based on the altcoin crossing Farina‚Äôs desired price target of $100 per token, from its current value of around $2. ‚ÄúBuying $1,000 worth right now is really buying over $50,000 in the future when $XRP hits $100+‚Äù, Farina tweeted recently.

He asserts that such an amount is the minimum one needs in order to take advantage of the use and greater adoption of XRP in the future. Such opinions regarding the issue have been unequivocal. Farina has reportedly said that individuals who have fewer than 1,000 XRP tokens ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care enough about their financial success‚Äù and called possessing less than that amount ‚Äúinsanity.‚Äù Though these comments represent Farina‚Äôs individual investment strategy, they echo a developing perception among XRP enthusiasts that the asset is undervalued and poised for strong growth if regulatory clarity increases and more businesses embrace it. Doubters Challenge The Life-Changing Assertions Not everyone shares Farina‚Äôs positive perspective. Doubters have raised issues with his assertion that $1,000 in XRP today may be worth $50,000 someday. One critic pointed out that even if XRP hits $100 and converts $1,000 into $50,000, this may not be sufficient for early retirement. The remark points out that what appears to be a good return may not necessarily be the life-altering wealth many investors expect. Questions also arise regarding if XRP will ever hit the $100 level, and if so, how long it would take to arrive there. Related Reading: Whales Swallowing Bitcoin Fast ‚Äî Will This Push BTC Price Up?

In a recent post on X, VET stated that for XRP to be utilized extensively by market makers to provide liquidity, the XRP Ledger must support many issued tokens with economic value. According to VET, the quality of the issuer is a significant factor, with higher-quality issuers naturally being more desirable. For XRP to be used a lot by market makers to provide liquidity the XRP Ledger needs a lot of issued tokens that have economic value. The higher the issuer quality the better obviously. Without it the XRP Ledger, which in itself is a DEX, can't play out its full strengths. ‚Äî Vet (@Vet_X0) April 17, 2025 The validator emphasized that without a substantial volume of such issued tokens, the XRP Ledger‚Äôs inherent capabilities as a DEX cannot be fully realized. While the XRP Ledger is technically designed to support trading between various assets without intermediaries, its actual impact depends heavily on the availability of assets that market participants want to trade. Range of Asset Types Encouraged for On-Chain Issuance In response to a question from X user XRP FOREVER, who asked whether the mentioned tokens could include examples like RLUSD, RLGBP, RLJPY, and BBRL, VET provided a broader perspective. VET replied that the scope is not limited to fiat-backed assets but extends to a wide array of items that people perceive as valuable. This includes airline miles, store loyalty points, gold, Treasury bills, meme coins, and stablecoins. The message from VET was clear: any asset that users associate with value and wish to trade should be brought on-chain to leverage the XRP Ledger‚Äôs capabilities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Concerns Over Community Attitudes Toward New Projects However, not all community members share the same enthusiasm when it comes to the proliferation of new tokens. A user identifying as A Concerned Human offered a critical but nuanced observation about the current sentiment within the XRPL ecosystem. This user pointed out that a significant portion of the XRP and XRPL community frequently dismisses new on-chain tokens as ‚Äúshitcoins,‚Äù often discrediting them before they have had an opportunity to demonstrate value or purpose. The same commenter acknowledged that many newly issued tokens have made questionable claims, such as announcing partnerships without verifiable evidence or presenting exploratory communications with institutions as official endorsements. Despite this, they argued that most legitimate projects start with little more than a concept and that real support often comes only after usefulness and viability have been established. They cautioned that while skepticism is reasonable, especially for those unable to assess a project‚Äôs fundamentals or team integrity, wholesale rejection of nascent efforts can harm the growth of the XRPL ecosystem. Support Needed for Ecosystem Growth and Ledger Utility The comment concluded with a call to action for informed investors and ecosystem participants. According to A Concerned Human, if the goal is to see the XRP Ledger thrive as a decentralized marketplace for asset exchange, it is counterproductive for knowledgeable stakeholders to impede the development of on-chain token initiatives, even in early or experimental stages. VET‚Äôs original message and the ensuing reactions reflect a broader tension within the XRPL community. On one hand is the desire to preserve trust and prevent scams from undermining the ecosystem. On the other hand is the recognition that for the XRP Ledger to reach its full capabilities, it must host a diverse range of tokenized assets that people recognize as having value. VET‚Äôs post serves as a reminder that the utility of XRP and the ledger itself is inseparable from the ecosystem of assets users are willing to issue, hold, and trade.

The purchase of 44,158 tokens brings its total to 83,084 SOL, currently valued at $9.6 million. This marks Janover‚Äôs second major Solana buy, reflecting a 109% jump in SOL-per-share value to $6.59. The aggressive accumulation follows an April leadership shake-up, where ex-Kraken executives took over, raised $42 million, and pivoted the firm toward Solana staking and DeFi infrastructure. Janover‚Äôs Institutional Bet on Solana: At a Glance Total Holdings: 83,084 SOL (~$9.6M) SOL per Share: 0.06 SOL ‚Üí $6.59 value Growth: 109% jump in per-share crypto value Staking Expansion and Whale Moves Add Fuel Janover isn‚Äôt alone in its conviction. SOL Strategies Inc . (CSE: HODL), a Canada-based crypto investment firm, is also betting big on Solana. In March, it added 24,000 SOL to its treasury‚Äînow totaling 267,151 SOL, worth over $30 million. In March, SOL Strategies (CSE: HODL) acquired 24,000 SOL, bringing total holdings to 267,151 SOL‚Äînearly all of which is staked across our validator network. Our commitment to Solana continues. Full article via @CoinDesk : https://t.co/ezSVXFr1mA ‚Äî SOL Strategies (CSE: HODL | OTCQX: CYFRF) (@solstrategies_) April 8, 2025 What makes this especially notable is that most of these tokens are actively delegated to validator nodes. That means they‚Äôre not just holding‚Äîthey‚Äôre building, with long-term exposure to Solana‚Äôs proof-of-stake economy. Despite the solid fundamentals, SOL Strategies‚Äô stock has lagged behind, dropping 67% year-to-date‚Äîa stark contrast to SOL‚Äôs 36% slide. Still, CEO Leah Wald isn‚Äôt blinking. She‚Äôs confirmed plans to grow staking operations into other chains like SUI, Monad, and Archway. A whale bought another 32,000 $SOL ($3.72M) after 6 months. This whale seems to be extremely bullish on $SOL . Three years ago, he bought 30,541 $SOL ($6.61M) at $216 and didn't sell ‚Äî even when $SOL dropped below $10. https://t.co/ouiQ0QsxeZ pic.twitter.com/qMDeQoks7T ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2025 And it‚Äôs not just institutions getting in. On-chain data shows whales are returning, too. One long-dormant wallet scooped up 32,000 SOL (about $3.72 million) just before Janover‚Äôs announcement. This same address famously bought 30,541 SOL at $216 during the last cycle‚Äîand never sold, even when prices dropped below $10. Accumulation Snapshot SOL Strategies Holdings: 267,151 SOL Whale Activity: 32,000 SOL bought at $3.72M Previous Buy: 30,541 SOL at $216 (held through 2022 crash) Solana Technical Setup: $145 Breakout Could Unleash Bulls From a technical angle, Solana is still in bullish territory. After briefly testing resistance at $145, price has pulled back slightly to $139, but key support at $136‚Äì$131 remains intact. The 50-day EMA around $131 adds confluence to this zone. Momentum indicators are still on the bulls‚Äô side. The MACD is trending higher, suggesting buyers are maintaining control. If SOL can punch through $145 with conviction, next upside targets sit at $153 and $161. Trade Setup: Entry: Bounce from $136 or breakout above $145 Targets: $153, $161 Stop Loss: Below $131 (EMA + trendline confluence) Final Take: Institutions Are Betting on Solana‚Äôs Comeback Between institutional stacking, whale activity, and a solid technical setup, Solana is quietly preparing for its next big move. While the headlines focus elsewhere, smart money is clearly circling‚Äîand for patient investors, this stealth rally may just be the beginning. BTC Bull Token Presale Tops $4.8M As Bitcoin edges closer to the $85,000 mark and macro uncertainty intensifies, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction with retail and crypto-savvy investors. This Ethereum-based meme coin stands out by offering real Bitcoin airdrops every time BTC hits key price milestones‚Äîaligning directly with Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upside. Earn Bitcoin with 86% APY Through Staking Beyond the airdrop rewards, BTC Bull‚Äôs staking program remains a major draw. Investors can earn up to 86% APY in passive income, while also contributing to the token‚Äôs network strength. The ability to unstake anytime makes it flexible for new and seasoned holders alike. Staking Snapshot: Annual Yield: 86% APY Total Staked: 1,222,531,969 BTCBULL Unstake Anytime: Yes With over 1.22 billion tokens already staked, momentum continues to build ahead of the next price milestone. Presale Nears Final Stretch as Demand Surges The presale is now approaching full subscription, with $4,801,979.55 raised out of the $5,550,445 target. The current token price remains at $0.002465, but with limited supply left and rising demand, a price hike could be imminent. Latest Presale Stats: Token Price: $0.00247 Raised So Far: $4.80M of $5.55M This window may be one of the last chances to secure BTCBULL before the next pricing tier kicks in. With its high-yield staking, real BTC rewards, and growing ecosystem engagement, BTC Bull is emerging as a top contender in the meme coin space‚Äîbacked by actual Bitcoin utility. With limited time remaining and demand accelerating, this is a key window to secure BTCBULL at presale rates before the next price jump.

Starting January 16, Jio integrated JioCoin into its JioSphere browser following a collaboration with Polygon Labs to incorporate Web3 and blockchain technologies. POL price prediction April 2025 Following Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. However, the recent announcement on Tariffs has triggered bearish pressure in the altcoin market. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following the crash. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.17 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.28 in April. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction April 2025 $0.17 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That‚Äôs why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It‚Äôs anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

POL historic price sentiment POL price history | Coinmarketcap POL debuted in 2019, initially valued below a cent. Maintained a steady level of around $0.02 for the following two years. POL‚Äôs rebranding to Polygon in 2021 fueled growth, surpassing $1 in May and peaking at an all-time high of $2.92 on December 27. In 2022, POL struggled, falling below $1 in May, under $0.50 in June, briefly rebounding above $1 in August, and ending the year at $0.7585, down 70%. In the following year, 2023, Polygon saw mixed performance, breaking $1 in February but dropping to $0.5593 in June after Crypto.com news.

The report cites a mix of macroeconomic resilience and strengthening on-chain indicators as key drivers behind the optimistic forecast. The research draws parallels between the current market cycle and 2021, when Bitcoin weathered major external shocks like China‚Äôs blanket mining ban without derailing its long-term uptrend. This time, the shocks come in the form of monetary policy disappointment and increased global liquidity, both of which underpin Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal. ‚ÄúDespite the volatility, we see strength rather than fear in the market,‚Äù the report said, noting that Bitcoin is currently trading around $84,400, down from around $83,152 earlier this month. Related News: Telegram and Toncoin (TON) Founder Pavel Durov Responds to Allegations of Collaboration with the European Union After Being Detained One of the most notable changes, according to 21Shares, is how Bitcoin now responds to disruptions in the traditional financial system. Events like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank no longer lead to panic selling. Instead, they reinforce Bitcoin‚Äôs reputation as a hedge against systemic financial risk. Even crypto-specific setbacks like the recent Bybit hack have failed to shake investor confidence in Bitcoin, with the market appearing increasingly adept at distinguishing between the failings of centralized participants and the fundamental value proposition of the decentralized protocol. On-chain metrics support this optimism, according to the report. Long-term holders continue to accumulate, and there is no sign of a broad-based distribution that would signal a market top. Meanwhile, institutional interest is growing, with increased flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and improved regulatory clarity lending more legitimacy to the asset. *This is not investment advice.

43566847,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64539,1745137444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Forecast For April 20, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-forecast-for-april-20-2025/,"On the weekly timeframe, XRP is consolidating within a well-defined bull flag, a classic continuation pattern following its explosive rally above $3.50. This downward-sloping channel has contained price action since late 2023, offering healthy retracement after the steep climb. The flag‚Äôs lower boundary, near $1.20, has consistently acted as dynamic support, while resistance remains around the upper trendline. Bollinger Bands are gradually tightening, signaling declining volatility and the likelihood of a breakout. Despite the current bearish candle, a strong wick rejection from the lower trendline suggests bullish pressure is mounting beneath the surface. Falling Wedge Hints at Reversal The daily chart reveals a bullish falling wedge, a pattern characterized by converging trendlines that slope downward. This setup typically precedes a trend reversal , especially when it appears during a broader consolidation phase like the weekly bull flag. XRP is currently trading just below the upper boundary of the wedge, with resistance at $2.23 and support near $1.87. Price has been steadily compressing within this structure, and the Bollinger Bands show a notable squeeze‚Äîoften a precursor to an explosive move. A daily candle close above the wedge could validate the breakout and trigger the next rally phase. Coiling Price Action Near Resistance On the 4-hour chart, XRP has recently rebounded from the lower wedge support and is now consolidating below immediate resistance around $2.08‚Äì$2.15. The price action is compressing into a tight range, often a sign that a breakout is near. The MACD shows a bullish crossover, with the MACD line now moving above the signal line and the histogram printing positive bars. Although trading volume remains subdued, the technical posture suggests bulls are gaining control. A surge in volume alongside a clean break above $2.15 could catalyze a quick rally toward $2.50. Momentum Shifting Bullish Technical indicators across all timeframes support a bullish thesis. The Bollinger Bands on the daily and 4-hour charts are extremely tight, indicating that volatility is about to expand. On the daily chart, price is nearing the middle band (20 SMA), which if reclaimed, could flip market sentiment in favor of buyers. The MACD on the daily timeframe is still slightly negative but flattening, while the 4-hour MACD has already turned positive. This multi-timeframe MACD setup often precedes broader momentum reversals. These indicators, in conjunction with the patterns, suggest that XRP is approaching a pivotal move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bull Flag and Falling Wedge Suggest Upside The two primary technical patterns‚Äîweekly bull flag and daily falling wedge‚Äîboth suggest a continuation of the prior bullish trend. The flag reflects long-term consolidation after a strong upward move, while the falling wedge signals waning bearish momentum and potential breakout. This dual-pattern setup creates a high-probability scenario for an upward move. Structural alignment across timeframes adds weight to this outlook, making any breakout above the $2.23 zone particularly significant. Price Forecast For Today XRP trades around $2.08, with clearly defined resistance at $2.23 and support at $1.87. The tightening wedge, bullish MACD cross on the 4-hour, and squeezed Bollinger Bands all suggest a breakout is imminent. If XRP breaks above the $2.15‚Äì$2.23 resistance zone with volume confirmation, it could quickly rally toward $2.50 or even $2.80. Conversely, failure to reclaim this level may result in a brief pullback to the $1.90 region. For today, the expected trading range is $2.00 to $2.30, with a bullish tilt favored by both pattern structure and momentum indicators.

Software Engineer States Seven Key Reasons,https://timestabloid.com/why-xrp-price-not-moon-software-engineer-states-seven-key-reasons/,"In a post on X, Software Analyst Vincent Van Code recently offered a detailed response to the frequently asked question: ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt the price of XRP surged?‚Äù In his post, Vincent acknowledged several reasons often cited by the crypto community for XRP‚Äôs sluggish price movement but dismissed them as speculative and ultimately invalid explanations. Instead, Van Code reaffirmed a long-term outlook on XRP, characterizing it as a strategic investment rather than a short-term trade. ""Why XRP price not moon""? This is probably the second most common question people asking (the first is of course ""where is Elvis"") Here is my take on what PEOPLE think is happening: 1. Regulatory uncertainty persists: The SEC lawsuit against Ripple isn‚Äôt fully resolved, and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) April 17, 2025 Investor Concerns Around Regulation, Supply, and Sentiment According to Van Code, regulatory uncertainty remains one of the most referenced explanations among investors. Despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple nearing resolution, lingering legal implications and the possibility of remaining penalties continue to make some investors hesitant. Van Code stated that this concern is not valid for XRP‚Äôs valuation today, as he believes the fundamental issues have already been addressed and priced in. Another argument commonly put forward, as outlined in his post, relates to market dynamics. He noted that global concerns such as trade wars, competitive pressure from stablecoins and alternative tokens, and Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing dominance in the crypto market all contribute to sidelining XRP despite its recent developments. Van Code listed this as part of public sentiment, but again reiterated that such external comparisons are speculative and do not reflect the actual utility of XRP. He also referenced tokenomics challenges, pointing out that XRP‚Äôs circulating supply, currently around 56 billion, and the monthly release of XRP from Ripple‚Äôs escrow accounts are often cited as downward pressures on price. In the eyes of many investors, this consistent unlocking of supply may discourage holding XRP for long durations due to the fear of dilution. Van Code challenged this perception, arguing that the influence of escrow releases is exaggerated and that broader market understanding around XRP‚Äôs use is evolving. Questions of Utility and the Impact of Infrastructure Developments Van Code then addressed recent developments, such as Hidden Road‚Äôs approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) , clarifying that the benefit to XRP is indirect. Since the approval is connected to RLUSD, Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, and not XRP, some investors perceive a lack of direct utility. Nevertheless, Van Code rejected this notion, emphasizing that such infrastructure developments form a foundation that indirectly supports XRP‚Äôs long-term adoption. He went on to mention the role of market memory and sentiment. Historical volatility, especially during sharp gains followed by rapid corrections, has left many investors cautious. As a result, the confidence to hold XRP beyond modest profits is limited. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Van Code, this psychological barrier reflects past market behavior rather than present fundamentals. Similarly, he pointed out that many investors remain anchored to past price points, such as $0.50, and hesitate to enter the market at higher levels‚Äîeven when fundamentals improve. Long-Term Outlook Remains Firm Despite Short-Term Doubts In closing, Van Code dismissed all of these investor theories as lacking in substance. ‚ÄúOf course, my view is NONE of these are valid drivers of price and demand, and are merely speculative opinions,‚Äù he wrote. He emphasized that XRP has always been intended as a multi-year investment and that the strategic role Ripple envisions for the token requires time. Now that the SEC lawsuit is over and what he called ‚Äúfavorable tailwinds‚Äù are beginning to form, Van Code expects progress and notable developments in the coming months. He concluded by urging investors to view XRP as a long-term asset. Referring to it as a ‚Äúbuy and store it away‚Äù token, he suggested that those waiting for short-term catalysts may misinterpret XRP‚Äôs value proposition. According to Van Code, Ripple‚Äôs efforts involving XRP unfolding over years, not months, and the market should align its expectations accordingly.

43566849,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64543,1745138067,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Projection For April 20, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-projection-for-april-20-2025/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $84,657.78, recording a mild daily dip of 0.18%. The daily chart reveals a consolidation zone between $78,000 and $88,000, with price hugging the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) at $82,930.39. The Bollinger Bands (BB) are tightening, reflecting compressed volatility‚Äîa classic precursor to a breakout. Price movements remain non-committal, but this squeeze pattern often precedes decisive action. Daily MACD Hints at Gradual Bullish Momentum On the daily timeframe, the MACD (12, 26) has formed a subtle bullish crossover. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and early green bars are appearing on the histogram. While this momentum shift is not yet strong, it indicates that buying pressure is starting to build. Traders should watch for a volume surge, which would confirm bullish intent and signal a potential breakout above current resistance. 4-Hour Chart Forms Bullish Structure with Ascending Triangle Zooming into the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is displaying a textbook ascending triangle. Higher lows continue to form, while resistance at $86,000 caps the upper boundary. This pattern generally suggests a bullish continuation. The Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand, signaling increased volatility on the horizon. MACD remains in positive territory, reinforcing the potential for an upward breakout if resistance is breached with conviction. 30-Minute Timeframe: Range-Bound with Breakout Potential The 30-minute chart shows short-term consolidation between $84,400 and $85,200, indicating an accumulation phase. The Bollinger Bands are compressed, suggesting that a significant move may be imminent. The MACD has slightly turned downward, pointing to a minor dip before a possible rally. This timeframe highlights market indecision but also provides an ideal setup for intraday traders awaiting breakout confirmation. Key Support and Resistance Levels in Focus Technically, Bitcoin‚Äôs structure is well-defined. Immediate support lies at the 20-day SMA of $82,930. Should this level fail, the next significant support sits at $77,996, marked by the lower Bollinger Band. On the upside, resistance stands at $86,000, followed by a breakout threshold near $87,864. A sustained move above this zone could open the door to a rally toward $90,000. These levels will likely dictate short-term market direction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro Sentiment and Market Drivers The broader crypto market maintains a cautiously bullish tone, supported by easing macroeconomic pressures and optimism following Bitcoin‚Äôs halving event. Liquidity remains steady, and institutional interest is holding firm. However, traders are waiting for a technical catalyst. Without a strong breakout or fundamental trigger, Bitcoin may continue to range. Still, technical indicators suggest momentum is gradually shifting in favor of the bulls. Price Projection For Today Based on current technical across the daily, 4-hour, and 30-minute charts, Bitcoin is expected to trade within a range of $83,500 to $86,500 today. A confirmed breakout above $86,000 could push the price swiftly toward $88,000, aligning with the upper BB on the daily chart. Conversely, a dip below $82,900 may lead to a retracement toward the $80,000‚Äì$81,000 range. Traders should monitor lower timeframes for breakout signals, especially MACD crossovers and Bollinger Band expansions.

But while price may be lagging, institutional interest is anything but. This week, HashKey Capital launched Asia‚Äôs first XRP Tracker Fund, giving professional investors exposure to XRP without the need to directly hold the asset. Ripple, the company behind XRP, is backing the initiative as an early investor‚Äîan endorsement that speaks volumes.

Regulatory Clarity Could Be the Game-Changer Legal uncertainty has long been one of XRP‚Äôs biggest hurdles‚Äîbut that could be changing. Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have agreed to a 60-day pause in their ongoing lawsuit, a move many believe signals potential settlement talks. That pause has added a layer of optimism to the broader XRP narrative. @Ripple vs. SEC APPEAL PAUSED FOR 60 DAYS!

And according to prediction markets, there‚Äôs now an 82% probability that at least one XRP ETF will receive approval in 2025. A green light from the SEC could significantly boost market liquidity and bring a wave of new capital into XRP. Technical Picture: Range-Bound but Poised for a Move From a technical standpoint, XRP is trading in a tight channel between $2.05 and $2.12. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $2.07, is acting as dynamic support. Momentum remains subdued, but that could change quickly with the right catalyst. XRP/USD Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview If XRP breaks above $2.12, it could trigger a bullish move toward $2.23 and eventually $2.34. On the downside, failure to hold $2.05 might send prices back to support zones at $1.93 or $1.85. Key Technical Levels Pivot: $2.07 Resistance: $2.12, $2.23 Support: $2.05, $1.93 50 EMA: $2.07 MACD: Neutral (momentum still building) XRP Trade Setup Bullish : Buy above $2.12 with volume. Target : $2.23, then $2.34 Stop Loss : Below $2.05 Bearish : Sell on breakdown below $2.05 Target : $1.93, then $1.85 Stop Loss : Above $2.12 XRP Price Outlook: Signs Point to Long-Term Strength While XRP remains under pressure in the short term, the broader outlook is improving. Institutional entry via the Tracker Fund, possible ETF approvals, and a potential settlement with the SEC all point to increasing confidence in XRP‚Äôs long-term viability. For now, price may be in a holding pattern‚Äîbut behind the scenes, the building blocks for a breakout are falling into place. $SUBBD Token: Your VIP Pass to the Future of AI-Powered Content The content creator economy is worth $85B‚Äîand $SUBBD is aiming to flip it on its head.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.555, resulting in a correction to $1.408. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network‚Äôs largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito‚Äôs price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there‚Äôs no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO up today? JTO‚Äôs price gained buying demand and it now aims for a hold above $1.7. Will JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $1.7 level, we might see a strong recovery toward $2. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin‚Äôs prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

New Roadmap Sparks 4% Surge Amidst Mixed Reactions,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-pi-network-breakout-coming-new-roadmap-sparks-4-surge-amidst-mixed-reactions/,"The post Is Pi Network Breakout Imminent? New Roadmap Sparks 4% Surge Amidst Mixed Reactions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network price has surged over 4% in the past 24 hours following the launch of its Migration Roadmap. Although the token is showing some signs of recovery across several indicators, it is too soon to confirm an uptrend. Although technical indicators like the Ichimoku Cloud and RSI hint that price might be recovering, it‚Äôs still facing strong resistance that is blocking a clear breakout. Besides, many in the Pi Community are frustrated that the new Migration Roadmap is not clear enough which adds another layer of uncertainty about where the price is headed next. Users Frustated Over Lack Of Details Pi Network released its Mainnet Migration Roadmap , but it lacks specific dates and clear details, leaving users frustrated. The roadmap outlines three phases, but no timelines are given, causing uncertainty. Some users noticed discrepancies in their coin balances, with no way to resolve them. Additionally, the claim that all tokens were minted at genesis has sparked debate, raising concerns about the project‚Äôs transparency. With 108.9 million tokens unlocked this month, users are unsure how the migration will unfold. These issues are weakening trust in the Pi Network. Pi Network Still Faces Resistance It is trading just below the Ichimoku Cloud, a key resistance area which signals that buyers are trying to push the price up. Although the price has been making some higher lows and hinting at a possible recovery, it still has not broken the resistance yet. Besides, the market is still not strongly bullish yet, showing that the short-term momentum is weaker than the medium-term trend, hence its not a clear signal to buy. Traders are being cautious and are waiting for stronger signs before making any big moves. Also, the Ichimoku Cloud is getting thicker and more tilted, which suggests that bigger price swings may be imminent. If Pi breaks above the cloud, it could signal a strong upward trend. However, until thay happens, Pi remains in a vulnerable position with a risk of rejection still likely. Pi Network‚Äôs RSI has bounced back to 53.77 from 32.34, signaling recovery. However, after peaking at 57.25, it has cooled slightly, weakening bullish momentum. The RSI is in neutral-bullish territory, showing moderate strength but still far from overbought levels. If momentum builds, there‚Äôs potential for growth, but caution is stil needed as the trend is not yet solid. Key Resistance Levels Pi Network (PI) is testing key resistance at $0.66. A breakout could push the price to $0.789 and $0.858, possibly reigniting bullish momentum. A successful breakout could possibly push PI to $1.23 or $1.79. However, frustrations over the unclear Migration Roadmap add uncertainty. If PI fails to break $0.66, it may dip toward $0.54 or $0.40. The next few sessions are crucial for determining the token‚Äôs direction, heavily influenced by both technical signals and community sentiment, awaiting a clear breakout or drop. Focus on Consensus 2025 Next With the Consensus 2025 fast approaching, excitement is building in the Pi Network Community. Analyst Dr Altcoin notes that this event is a major chance to promote Pi Network especially as the Pi founder Nicolas Kokkalis is set to share the stage with personalities like Bo Hines and Eric Trump. Consensus 2025 Summit is a huge opportunity to promote Pi Network‚Äîand one of the best so far! I call upon the Pi Core Team to expedite at least the following before the summit: 1. Approve all KYB applications currently on hold 2. Officially deploy all DApps in the Pi ecosystem‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/c0fGbdpVqB ‚Äî Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 19, 2025 Game Changer for Pi Coin? Dr. Altcoin believes that Consensus 2025 could be a game-changer for Pi Network, only if the Pi Core Team acts fast. He‚Äôs urging them to approve all KYB applications and officially launch DApps in the Pi ecosystem before the event to maximise the opportunity on the global spotlight and boost Pi‚Äôs credibility and growth. The Pi Core Team has under a month to approve KYB and launch DApps before Consensus 2025, as delays have driven some projects to other blockchains.

43566850,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64546,1745139262,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Consolidation Is Nearing an End. Here‚Äôs the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-consolidation-is-nearing-an-end-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has released a new chart-based projection for XRP, suggesting that the digital asset is about to complete a significant consolidation phase. In a tweet that captioned a detailed price chart, Dark Defender stated that XRP‚Äôs ongoing consolidation appears to be in its final stage within the broader monthly structure. As the chart outlines, this phase has been characterized by many lower highs and relatively steady support zones, forming a descending triangle formation that now seems close to a breakout. According to the chart and commentary provided by Dark Defender, the asset is showing signs of preparing for a major impulsive move. The chart starts with a label ‚ÄúImpulsive Wave 1,‚Äù implying the initial move in a five-wave Elliott Wave structure. These projected waves, as drawn in the chart, anticipate a sharp bullish trend, with a notable breakout beyond resistance levels, followed by a strong upward continuation toward higher price targets. Hi all! I hope you are well! #XRP consolidation is nearing an end, and I call this the Final Consolidation, of the Monthly Structure! We can expect the 5 Waves as highlighted below. Resistances: $2.22, $2.30 (Orange Line) Supports: $1.88, $1.63 Targets: $3.75, $5.85‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IfmJlal7Vu ‚Äî Dark Defender (@DefendDark) April 18, 2025 Key Resistance and Support Levels Identified The resistance levels that have been emphasized include $2.22 and $2.30, both aligned with the descending trendline shown in orange. These levels represent key thresholds that XRP must surpass to confirm the beginning of the upward movement. On the downside, support zones are identified at $1.88 and $1.63, reliable floors during the asset‚Äôs consolidation. These technical levels are considered critical to validating the breakout scenario outlined in the chart. If XRP can breach the $2.30 resistance zone with volume and maintain above it, the path toward the higher Fibonacci extension targets becomes more probable. Conversely, a breakdown below the identified support levels would invalidate the bullish outlook and potentially indicate a continuation of the consolidation structure. Projected Wave Structure Targets $3.75 and $5.85 Dark Defender has also outlined longer-term targets based on this projected wave structure. Specifically, the chart indicates potential price levels of $3.75 and $5.85, with the latter corresponding to the 261.80% Fibonacci extension level. These targets are not presented as guarantees, and the tweet includes a disclaimer emphasizing that the information shared is not financial advice and is intended for educational and informational purposes only. The visual analysis shows that the breakout is expected to initiate shortly after XRP completes its current retest of the lower boundary of the consolidation range. The chart suggests that the first impulsive breakout will encounter resistance near $2.30 for a rapid rally toward $3.75. A brief correction is expected afterward, followed by a push toward the $5.85 level, completing what is labeled ‚ÄúWave 5.‚Äù Final Monthly Consolidation May Be Ending Dark Defender refers to this stage as the ‚ÄúFinal Consolidation‚Äù in the monthly chart, indicating a belief that the asset‚Äôs lengthy period of price compression is reaching its endpoint. This viewpoint aligns with the visual cues presented in the chart, particularly the tightening price action near long-term resistance and the growing likelihood of a breakout. Overall, Dark Defender‚Äôs analysis emphasizes a technically driven outlook for XRP , with clearly defined resistance and support levels, and specific price targets should the forecasted impulsive waves materialize. While the chart does not guarantee outcomes, it offers a structured roadmap for how XRP may behave in the coming weeks, based on historical price action and technical indicators.

Network activity is hemorrhaging, and momentum is slipping. Ethereum has become locked in a fight for its future. Without meaningful change, Ethereum risks becoming inaccessible to the builders and users it needs to thrive. Ethereum needs fresh ideas to bolster the ecosystem out of its slump, unify it, and genuinely support innovation. Enter based applications (bApps), which are any application or service that uses the Ethereum validator set for security. Inspired by the based movement, bApps enable any project to bootstrap directly from the Ethereum layer 1 (L1), enabling interoperable, scalable and cost-effective development. High stakes and high costs The recent decline in network activity highlights a deep issue across Ethereum, and it boils down to UX. The race to scale a blockchain isn‚Äôt just about TVL and transactions per second (TPS). It‚Äôs about the experience of users and developers who co-create the ecosystem. Ease of development and interoperable developer ecosystems and applications are paramount. Improving the developer experience is crucial for improving user experience, which drives adoption. Today, builders are presented with two options. The first and more popular one is restaking, which has become the default mechanism for bootstrapping new services by locking up validators‚Äô withdrawal keys or large amounts of capital for security. That leaves teams with only one other inconvenient alternative: self-bootstrapping. Building a validator set from scratch is resource-heavy, technically complex and often starts off centralized. Both choices are limiting for builders and don‚Äôt solve the fragmentation problems we see today in Ethereum. It is not just builders but validators that are affected by this system. In the current restaking setup, validators who want to earn more yield by supporting new services must restake , lock up their withdrawal keys, and take on additional risk. By locking up withdrawal keys to secure applications with slashable capital, validators are exposed to cascading risks, which, at scale, could affect Ethereum itself ‚Äî a core departure from Ethereum‚Äôs founding vision. bApps are more secure bApps provide a third, more accessible option for self-bootstrapping and restaking. Using based security infrastructure drastically lowers entry barriers for any size protocol to build securely and sustainably, all while preserving the traditional network effects of Ethereum. Validators are incentivized to join through risk-free yield opportunities; developers can affordably access security to build; and users benefit from a unified and interoperable ecosystem. Recent: SSV Network to create ‚Äòbased‚Äô apps infrastructure for Ethereum Mission-critical services like rollups, bridges and oracles don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel. They simply plug into an existing, trusted security model. Using Ethereum validators as a primary security base, any out-of-protocol service can inherit the Ethereum L1‚Äôs decentralization and Sybil resistance. It‚Äôs also possible to extend this paradigm beyond Ethereum, enabling other L1 validators to secure bApps. This potentially turns bApps into a marketplace for multichain security, dramatically reducing the complexity (and cost) for developers and raising the bar for the entire ecosystem, offering a ‚Äúbased‚Äù path forward. bApps empower validators to earn more with their existing stake. By primarily using the validator principle as non-slashable security, validators can opt into many services through their existing Ethereum validator role without needing to restake or supply extra stakes. This would encourage broader validator participation, especially from smaller or more risk-averse operators, which is excellent considering solo stakers are an important ecosystem pillar. bApps unlock scalability bApps also revolutionize Ethereum‚Äôs current bootstrapping ecosystem, which relies heavily on slashable capital. In restaking, one participant‚Äôs gain may directly correspond to another‚Äôs loss, creating a zero-sum model. Building a competitive dynamic where participants must add or reallocate resources instead of sharing them, consequently working against new entrants by creating competition for limited attention and resources. The based economy, conversely, promotes an infinite-sum game, transforming competition for resources into a synergistic environment where new applications, services and participants increase the overall value of the platform. Each new validator increases security for bApps, and each new bApp provides new opportunities for validators. This infinitely scalable model breaks free from the limitations of a zero-sum model, enabling seamless bootstrapping, rewarding innovation and building more secure, inclusive and resilient ecosystems. Unifying Ethereum‚Äôs fractured ecosystem For Ethereum to grow, fragmentation has to be addressed. Builders need building blocks, which need to be secure, low-cost, interoperable and scalable. Think about what cloud computing did for Web2. BApps offer just that ‚Äî by introducing an infinite-sum game, they unlock scalability and provide a safe and affordable way to bootstrap with Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake network. If Ethereum is to be the foundation of tomorrow‚Äôs decentralized world, it must empower the builders of today. The way forward is to solve Ethereum‚Äôs user and developer experience problem with a based infrastructure. Going based is the clear solution. Opinion by: Alon Muroch, founder of SSV Labs.

The broader market remains under pressure as global uncertainty escalates, largely fueled by ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Last week, US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China, intensifying concerns about an extended trade conflict that could destabilize global financial markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades At Bear Market Lows: Fundamentals Signal Major Undervaluation In this high-stakes environment, Ethereum‚Äôs price action is drawing close attention from investors and analysts. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that historically, the best Ethereum buying opportunities have emerged when the price drops below the lower MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Price Band‚Äîa level that signals potential undervaluation. Notably, ETH is now trading precisely in that zone. This alignment between technical conditions and macroeconomic instability suggests that Ethereum could be entering a phase of accumulation, with long-term investors looking to capitalize on discounted prices. However, sustained upward momentum will depend on whether bulls can overcome immediate resistance and whether macro conditions improve. The coming days could prove pivotal for ETH as it tests both technical and psychological thresholds. Ethereum Dips Into Historical Opportunity Zone Ethereum is currently trading below key resistance levels after enduring several weeks of selling pressure and weak market performance. Since losing the crucial $2,000 support level, ETH has fallen roughly 21%, a clear indication that bulls have yet to regain control. Broader macroeconomic pressures, especially rising global tensions and uncertain trade conditions between the US and China, have further dampened market sentiment. These conditions have driven many investors to exit riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to elevated volatility and reduced market participation. Despite this downtrend, some analysts believe Ethereum could be nearing a pivotal turnaround zone. According to Martinez, one of the best historical signals for Ethereum accumulation has been price action dipping below the lower bound of the MVRV Price Band‚Äîa metric that compares market value to realized value to assess whether an asset is over- or undervalued. Currently, Ethereum is trading beneath that lower band. Martinez emphasizes that this positioning has typically preceded strong upside reversals, especially during periods of extreme market pessimism. While short-term volatility may persist, ETH‚Äôs entry into this zone could present a rare opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate at historically discounted levels‚Äîif market conditions stabilize and sentiment shifts. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Offload 180 Million ADA In 5 Days ‚Äì Smart Profit-Taking? ETH Stalls In Tight Range Ethereum is currently trading at $1,610 after nearly a week of low volatility and sideways action. Since last Tuesday, ETH has remained locked in a tight range between $1,550 and $1,630, reflecting the market‚Äôs uncertainty and hesitation to take a clear directional stance. This narrow trading zone highlights a period of price compression, often a precursor to a larger move in either direction. For bulls to regain momentum and shift sentiment, Ethereum must reclaim the $1,700 level and push decisively above the $2,000 mark. These levels not only serve as key psychological barriers but also represent critical zones of previous support that have now turned into resistance. A breakout above $2,000 would likely trigger renewed buying interest and set the stage for a potential recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stalls In Tight Range ‚Äì Big Price Move Incoming? However, if bearish pressure builds and the $1,550 floor is breached, Ethereum could quickly test the $1,500 support zone. A breakdown below that level would confirm further downside risk, potentially accelerating sell-offs and deepening the current correction. Until a breakout or breakdown occurs, traders should prepare for more consolidation and volatility as the market awaits a macro or technical catalyst.

Artificial intelligence has become a powerful force in the finance ecosystem, offering faster, data-driven insights that promise to improve investments, lending, and risk management. From AI advisors that personalize financial strategies for both companies and individuals to highly advanced trading systems that make data-driven decisions in microseconds, the financial AI sector has a lot of room to grow. You might also like: AI is creating a new class of entrepreneurs, and you‚Äôre either in or out | Opinion But there‚Äôs one major problem: bias. Despite offering speed, precision, and what seems like objectivity, financial AI systems carry the same bias that the industry has been trying to eliminate for decades. For example, according to Lehigh University, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 Turbo large language models‚Äîsimulating an AI mortgage advisor or decision system‚Äî required certain demographics of applicants to have 120 credit points higher than white applicants to receive the same approval despite having the same income, credit history, and debt levels. This bias doesn‚Äôt just affect the traditional financial markets but also the decentralized finance and crypto ecosystems. Take AI-powered market forecasting platforms, for example. Since their data is based on price history, news sentiment, or social trends, these platforms could sometimes overreact to market anomalies‚Äîcrypto is full of black swan events like the Terra collapse, FTX crash, or large penalties from the regulators. Consequently, these prediction tools can become over-aggressive or even overweight social trends and chatter, leading to poor signals and predictions. Blockchain, XAI to the rescue The limitations and opaque nature of many AI systems prevent them from becoming fully transparent and accountable. Some even call them black boxes since AI models usually have little to no transparency. Notably, the decisions made by AI tools within the crypto space are not usually explainable‚Äîthis makes it hard for users to understand how decisions are made. The absence of standardized auditing protocols for AI systems would also result in inconsistent assessments and potential oversight of critical issues.‚Äã Integrating blockchain technology with Explainable AI, or XAI for short, can tackle this issue by providing the immutability and transparency that come with decentralized ledgers‚Äîpotentially improving the auditing methods as well since the auditors will have complete access to the platform‚Äôs data and underlying algorithms. XAI models are already getting increased attention since they ensure the decision-making process is fair and ethical in addition to being efficient. Blockchain technology can complement XAI‚Äôs fairness by creating immutable records of AI decision-making processes, ensuring that every action is traceable and verifiable. This will promote trust and accountability. Blockchains operate in a trustless manner. This doesn‚Äôt mean the technology cannot be trusted, but it suggests that third parties or central authorities won‚Äôt be needed to confirm any decisions. Decentralization removes the need for a centralized entity to oversee the processes, thanks to the smart contracts that function autonomously. When a model changes or outputs a decision, the lack of logs and version control can cause trust issues with most of the AI platforms. Blockchain technology timestamps the records and data on an immutable ledger. FICO, a credit scoring company, has used blockchain to log AI model decisions, so regulators can trace how decisions like credit approvals were made. The company received the ‚ÄúTech of the Future‚ÄîBlockchain and Tokenisation‚Äù award at the Banking Tech Awards in London last year. From theory to practice Blockchains and decentralized finance protocols have the opportunity to bake fairness, transparency, and accountability into AI models‚Äîsomething traditional financial companies have been struggling with. Combining XAI with on-chain verification can transform how decisions are made and trusted in the web3 ecosystem. For example, using XAI to explain the voting of decentralized autonomous organizations could help users have a better understanding of the consequences of their choices. A more advanced utility would be using XAI for risk assessment in lending DeFi protocols. Mixing XAI with blockchain technology could also be a powerful on-chain surveillance and manipulation detection tool. AI is good at analyzing patterns of sandwich attacks, MEV exploitation, or wash trading. This could help in finding market anomalies. Some web3 projects are already trying to enhance AI transparency. SingularityNET, for instance, focuses on making AI processes auditable. Another platform called Ocean Protocol tracks the origins of the data, ensuring trustworthiness and traceability. Conclusion At this point, it‚Äôs just the beginning of the integration of blockchain and AI. Researchers are now exploring hybrid models that combine blockchain‚Äôs integrity, XAI‚Äôs clarity, and bias-detection tools into systems that can monitor and potentially correct themselves. But technology alone won‚Äôt fix this. It will also need attention from regulators, scrutiny from users, and humility from the developers building these systems. If the 2008 financial crisis taught us anything, it‚Äôs that blind trust in complex and centralized tools is dangerous. Most notably, smart doesn‚Äôt always mean fair. As the era of mainstream AI surfaces, users must also look for transparency in addition to efficiency. Read more: Who controls your digital identity?

Nearly 90% of Bitcoin ( BTC ) service providers registered in El Salvador are not operating, according to a recent report by El Mundo, which cited data from the Central Reserve Bank, showing that out of 181 companies officially registered to offer Bitcoin services in the country, 161 are marked as ‚Äúnon-operating.‚Äù That‚Äôs about 89% of the total. Only 20 firms are still active. These include the government-backed Chivo Wallet, among others. El Mundo adds that at least 22 of the inactive providers may have failed to meet the regulatory standards outlined in Article 4 of the Bitcoin Law Regulation, which requires crypto businesses to operate with ‚Äúhigh standards of integrity and honesty.‚Äù Providers are supposed to have anti-money laundering programs, clear records of assets and liabilities, and cybersecurity systems adapted to the nature of the services offered. It‚Äôs unclear how many others are behind on compliance, or whether enforcement is underway. Breaking paradigms of past The numbers paint a stark picture of the current state of Bitcoin in El Salvador. Back in 2021, the country became the first in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. It was a move that drew global headlines and crypto industry praise, but also concern from traditional financial institutions. President Nayib Bukele, a self-described ‚ÄúCEO of El Salvador,‚Äù argued that the policy would attract tech investment, lower remittance costs, and bring banking services to the unbanked. Como toda innovaci√≥n, el proceso del #Bitcoin en El Salvador tiene una curva de aprendizaje. Todo camino hacia el futuro es as√≠ y no se lograr√° todo en un d√≠a, ni en un mes. Pero debemos romper los paradigmas del pasado. El Salvador tiene derecho a avanzar hacia el primer mundo. ‚Äî Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 6, 2021 The law made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. It also required all businesses to accept it as payment, unless they lacked the means to do so. The government even launched its own digital wallet, Chivo, and handed out a $30 bonus in BTC to citizens who signed up. Still, things didn‚Äôt go smoothly. The wallet faced technical issues, adoption was limited, and a year later, studies suggested that most Salvadorans had stopped using it altogether. In a commentary for crypto.news, Hon Ng, chief legal officer of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, which also secured crypto license in El Salvador, agreed with the data from El Mundo, saying it ‚Äúhighlights some significant challenges in the rollout of the Bitcoin Law.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith over 88% of Bitcoin-related companies still non-operational, it‚Äôs evident that there are infrastructural and institutional hurdles to address. While the legislation shows El Salvador‚Äôs vision to become a ‚Äòcrypto hub,‚Äô further regulatory development may be required to effectively support the local ecosystem.‚Äù Hon Ng You might also like: IMF now officially tracks Bitcoin in cross-border finance ‚Äî just weeks after warning El Salvador to scale back IMF‚Äôs opposition By 2022, the Bitcoin Law had become a major sticking point in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ‚Äî an essential financial backer for El Salvador ‚Äî as the country sought a $1.3 billion agreement. The IMF, in turn, made no secret of its concerns over the policy. It warned of risks to financial stability, consumer protection, and the country‚Äôs overall fiscal health. In a public statement, the IMF recommended that El Salvador ‚Äúnarrow the scope of the Bitcoin law by removing Bitcoin‚Äôs legal tender status.‚Äù For a while, the Bukele administration resisted. But eventually, the country‚Äôs Legislative Assembly introduced quiet but significant changes. The state was no longer required to be involved in Bitcoin transactions. Businesses were no longer required to accept BTC. In effect, Bitcoin stopped being enforced as legal tender, although the government didn‚Äôt say it in so many words. Still, the government hasn‚Äôt backed away from Bitcoin completely. Quite the opposite. President Bukele has continued to publicly announce Bitcoin purchases, and says the country now holds more than 6,100 coins ‚Äî valued at over $500 million. He recently claimed the portfolio was in the green. But the exact source of funding remains murky. Critics worry that the state may still be using public funds for purchases, something the IMF had reportedly asked El Salvador to avoid. Questions to be answered Now, with the majority of registered Bitcoin providers inactive, it‚Äôs unclear how much of the country‚Äôs crypto infrastructure remains functional. The registry data doesn‚Äôt explain why so many firms have gone quiet. Bitget‚Äôs Hon Ng told crypto.news that the low low rate of active providers might be a ‚Äúcombination of several factors, with a significant issue being the gap between the legal framework and the actual business environment in El Salvador.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlthough the Bitcoin Law is intended to be progressive, some aspects may not fully appreciate how startups and mid-sized financial service providers operate in the country.‚Äù Hon Ng Ng went further to note that the Bitcoin Law mandates that companies establish tailored cybersecurity programmes, adding that many crypto firms, especially small-medium sized firms, ‚Äúlack the resources to meet these standards, particularly with the current uncertainty in user demand.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis, combined with regulatory ambiguity and limited mainstream adoption, can lead to situations where companies initially engage with optimism but later become inactive as they encounter practical challenges.‚Äù Hon Ng The government‚Äôs Bitcoin Office is still promoting the initiative online, and there are still plans ‚Äî at least officially ‚Äî for the so-called Volcano Bonds, a Bitcoin-backed tokenized bond offering backed by stablecoin issuer Tether. But those plans have been delayed multiple times. And outside of Chivo and a few private platforms, there‚Äôs little sign of a vibrant ecosystem. El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin story may not be over. But nearly three years in, with just 20 providers still running and many others falling short of regulatory standards, the country‚Äôs big crypto experiment looks a lot smaller than it once did.

In a new interview with Raoul Pal on the Real Vision YouTube channel, Silbert says that he‚Äôs created a new venture called Yuma, which exclusively focuses on Bittensor ( TAO ), a decentralized blockchain-based network built for a global, collaborative marketplace for artificial intelligence (AI). Says the Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO, ‚ÄúI started looking across the whole decentralized AI space and started digging in on Bittensor, and I very quickly came to the conclusion that from a theme or era perspective, this was the next big era for crypto. You had the Bitcoin and the Ethereum and the NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and you had the layer 2s and DeFi (decentralized finance)‚Ä¶ I think this is the next big investment theme for crypto, and there are a number of projects that have launched. We‚Äôve backed a number of them, but the one that over the past year or year and a half that has reached escape velocity is Bittensor, and so I decided last year, we‚Äôre going to do with Bittensor ‚Äì try to do with Bittensor what we did with Bitcoin. We‚Äôre going to invest in it, we‚Äôre going to build on it, we‚Äôre going to help educate, create awareness, create access. We launched a new business in the fall of last year call Yuma, that I‚Äôm putting my jersey back on, and I‚Äôm the CEO of Yuma ‚Äì I‚Äôm still running DCG ‚Äì but I‚Äôm back in the game and I‚Äôm now building this busines Yuma that‚Äôs focusing exclusively on this thing Bittensor.‚Äù Bittensor‚Äôs ecosystem includes ‚Äúsubnets,‚Äù which are like independent segments dedicated to a certain AI task or service. Silbert says Yuma has focused on developing an ‚Äúaccelerator‚Äù to easily build new subnets on Bitensor. He also says one of his investment goals is finding the ‚ÄúCoinbase,‚Äù ‚ÄúBitgo,‚Äù or ‚ÄúChainalysis‚Äù of the Bittensor ecosystem.

The firm acquired 2,949 BTC, signaling renewed institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency amid global trade tensions and an approaching Easter weekend. According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain , which cited Arkham Intelligence data, Abraxas‚Äô latest purchase included over $45 million in Bitcoin from Binance on April 18 alone. MicroStrategy‚Äôs $285M Bitcoin Buy Sets the Stage for Institutional Accumulation The acquisition follows closely behind MicroStrategy‚Äôs announcement that it had bought $285 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $82,618 per coin. The move by Michael Saylor‚Äôs company further reinforced the bullish stance held by major corporate players. The broader accumulation trend among institutional investors and crypto whales is continuing. Recent data shows that these large holders are collectively buying up more than three times the amount of new Bitcoin being mined each year. Despite such accumulation, analysts are keeping a close eye on medium-term holders‚Äîthose who typically hold Bitcoin for three to six months‚Äîwho have recently released over 170,000 BTC into circulation. Whales/Institutions continue to accumulate $BTC ! Abraxas Capital related wallet withdrew another 505 $BTC ($42.64M) from #Binance 9 hours ago.

The past two weekends have seen notable disruptions in the crypto markets. On April 13, the price of Mantra (OM) plunged over 90% in a single day, sparking manipulation concerns. A week earlier, Bitcoin had dipped below $75,000 as global investors reacted to a record $5 trillion sell-off in the S&P 500. As reported, 10x Research‚Äôs head of research Markus Thielen has argued that Bitcoin may be entering a period of extended consolidation . In a recent market note, Thielen warned that short-term technical signals are painting a more cautious picture, even as many analysts forecast new all-time highs by mid-year. Thielen pointed to the Bitcoin stochastic oscillator, a technical indicator that measures momentum, suggesting the market is displaying traits more consistent with a late-cycle top than the beginning of a new bull run. Lyn Alden Says Bitcoin Would Be Higher if Not for Trump‚Äôs Tariff Shock Prominent macroeconomist Lyn Alden believes Bitcoin is on track to finish 2025 above its current price of around $85,000. ‚ÄúBefore all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,‚Äù Alden said during a recent interview . While she still expects Bitcoin to post gains by year-end, Alden noted that the tariffs introduced in February have tempered her earlier bullish outlook. Alden explained that a major liquidity boost could push Bitcoin toward more ambitious targets. Such a scenario might occur if the U.S. bond market faces a crisis, prompting the Federal Reserve to respond with quantitative easing or yield curve control. Despite current macro headwinds, Alden believes there is still a ‚Äúgood chance‚Äù Bitcoin surpasses the $100,000 mark in 2025. However, she warned that global market volatility remains a key obstacle, especially because Bitcoin trades continuously ‚Äî unlike traditional equity markets with limited trading hours. ‚ÄúBecause it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,‚Äù she said.

While Cardano, priced at $0.61, has built a solid foundation for smart contracts, Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining attention for its innovative dual-lending model and DeFi potential. Phase 4 presale is currently offering tokens at $0.025, with strong investor support driving the acquisition of over 8,400 buyers, raising a total of $6.9 million. Investors participating in this phase stand to earn a 140% profit when the token reaches $0.06 at its exchange launch. So, MUTM is the better bet offering long-term stability or the chance to capitalize on a fresh, high-growth opportunity. Mutuum Finance Presale The investor support for Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale continues to grow steadily throughout its development cycle. Those investing in the platform due to its sustainable DeFi solution which uses a development scale beyond meme coin market volatility. Phase 4 has collected more than $6.9 million from investors while gathering over 8,400 token holders up to this point. Early participants find Phase 4 tokens highly appealing because they are available at $0.025 during the ongoing presale. The platform launch will raise token prices to $0.06 thereby delivering a 140% profit to Phase 4 investors who purchased at $0.025. The analysts anticipate MUTM will achieve a listing price of $3 which would significantly enhance its market value. Phase 5 investors can anticipate another price enhancement to $0.03 which indicates future price growth for MUTM. The updated dashboard of Mutuum Finance presents a leader ranking of token holders where participants who stay in their position earn bonus tokens to boost long-term investor interest. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance delivers a top-notch decentralized lending platform which allows complete user ownership of assets. The non-custodial liquidity protocol lets users receive passive income through its borrowing participants who can access funds by providing assets worth more than their loan amounts. The platform implements an automatic interest rate control system which helps operate the ecosystem in a sustainable and optimized manner. Mutuum‚Äôs unique dual-lending framework combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems for maximum flexibility: P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: The decentralized framework removes middle actors to establish peer-to-peer lender-borrower linkages that grant borrowers and lenders total freedom and command over the process. Mutuum Finance gives security and transparency complete priority status in its platform operations. Open-source smart contracts linked with third-party audits secure full transparency on the platform operation. The MUTM token delivers dual benefits including price growth together with passive income streams through a strategic buyback program that secures long-term value increase. To expand accessibility and liquidity, Mutuum Finance plans to implement multi-chain support, including both EVM and non-EVM blockchains. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance seeks to boost community expansion by providing a $100,000 giveaway that distributes $10,000 MUTM tokens to ten fortunate participants. Through its referral system Mutuum Finance encourages members to recruit new participants which helps the community grow organically while stimulating natural growth. Early investors and users obtain unique rewards together with additional benefits because of the ecosystem growth which results from their participation. While Cardano (ADA) offers scalability and smart contracts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a high-growth DeFi opportunity with its dual-lending model. MUTM‚Äôs presale has raised over $6.9 million, and early investors stand to gain 140% ROI. MUTM offers a promising path for long-term growth, making it a compelling choice for those seeking high returns in DeFi.

According to the head of the blockchain investment firm, the push from the BIS to isolate crypto markets is dangerous. According to Perkins, the controversial recommendations made on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and stablecoins pose a danger to the entire financial ecosystem. ‚ÄúMany of their recommendations and conclusions ‚Äî perhaps due to a mix of fear, arrogance, or ignorance ‚Äî are completely uninformed and, frankly, dangerous,‚Äù Perkins said. Perkins was replying to an April 15 report by the BIS, titled ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance: Functions and Financial Stability Implications.‚Äù CoinFund president says BIS recommendations expose TradFi to risks In his post on X, the CoinFund president mentioned that crypto is not communism, pushing back against the call by the BIS for a containment approach to isolate crypto from the traditional finance sector and the broader economy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the new internet that provides anyone with a connection access to financial services. You cannot control it anymore than you control the internet,‚Äù he said. The @BIS_org just published a new paper, ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and decentralised finance: functions and financial stability implication.‚Äù The good news is that the authors finally realize that advancements in crypto (including the growth of ETFs, stablecoins and tokenized real world‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Christopher Perkins ü¶Öüåé‚öìÔ∏èNYC (@perkinscr97) April 19, 2025 The CoinFund president noted that the containment approach proposed by the BIS toward digital assets could open the traditional finance system to massive liquidity risks of unimaginable scale, noting that the crypto market operates 24/7, while traditional finance systems shut down after trading hours. ‚ÄúIf implemented they will cause‚Äìnot mitigate‚Äìthe systemic risk they seek to prevent,‚Äù Perkins added. The BIS report warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and DeFi have reached a critical mass, with investor protection becoming something of a concern for regulators globally. The report also mentioned that the size of the crypto market shows that authorities need to be worried about the stability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy. The bank also highlighted stablecoins as a means through which users have been transferring value within crypto. Industry participants push back on the BIS report The CoinFund president also slated the BIS‚Äô claims that the decentralized finance sector presents a significant challenge. He argued that it represents a big improvement over the opacity and imbalances of the traditional finance system. Discussing the BIS‚Äô claims of the anonymity of developers, Perkins questioned its relevance. ‚ÄúSorry, but when was the last time a TradFi company published a list of its developers? Sure, public companies provide a degree of disclosures and transparency, but they seem to be dying off in favor of private markets,‚Äù he said. He also criticized the concerns around stablecoins, especially the fact that the report mentioned that it could lead to macroeconomic instability in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe. ‚ÄúIf there is demand for USD stablecoins and it helps improve the condition of anyone in the developing world, perhaps that is a good thing?! Are you suggesting that the economic conditions in countries like this are acceptable and should be perpetuated? No, people across the world deserve access to basic financial services,‚Äù he said. The CoinFund president was not the only one who had issues with the report, with Lightspark co-founder Christian Catalini also weighing in. He criticized the report, giving compelling arguments on some loopholes he found in the report. Discussing stablecoins, he said, ‚ÄúThe paper frets, regulators pace, and developers keep building. With sensible rules, a digital dollar can settle on weekends and chat with smart contracts‚Äîperks that make CBDC pilots look like dial‚Äëup internet.‚Äù He summed up the report with an analogy: ‚ÄúThink: writing parking regulations for a fleet of self‚Äëdriving drones ‚Äî earnest work, two technological leaps behind.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Bitcoin has largely moved within a narrow 2% band between $83,000 and $85,000 this week. The relative calm follows sharp swings earlier in April, when Trump‚Äôs tariff announcements drove Bitcoin to multi-month lows under $75,000. Meanwhile, one new project has managed to outperform the broader market. The project drawing attention is CartelFi , the new cartel-themed yield farming protocol. The project‚Äôs presale has already raised over $1 million. CartelFi: the project generating buzz in the market CartelFi is generating buzz for a simple reason: it‚Äôs finally addressing a longstanding inefficiency in crypto markets that no one else has solved. Meme coins, despite their speculative appeal and viral price action, have always been considered dead weight between rallies. In the current DeFi landscape, earning yield usually requires selling volatile assets like PEPE or DOGE and reallocating to more stable, ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù assets like stablecoins, ETH, or blue-chip tokens. Because of this, billions in capital are locked up, with no yield and no productive use, while DeFi protocols built for stablecoins and blue chips rake in consistent returns for more risk-averse capital. Yield farming for meme coins has been a theoretical ambition for years, but no one‚Äôs executed it at scale. CartelFi‚Äôs core innovation is creating liquidity pools tailored for these meme tokens, offering yields as high as 300% on names like PEPE ‚Äî numbers unheard of in conventional DeFi. CartelFi presale: prices to rise soon The CartelFi presale shows no signs of losing momentum, with over $1 million already raised as investor interest continues to build. Structured across 30 incremental stages, each with a 5% price hike, the presale model is designed to reward early participation while maintaining sustained buy pressure. At its current price of $0.0336, it offers early backers immediate paper gains and the potential for significantly larger returns once CARTFI lists on public markets. The CartelFi price is set to increase within two days. What‚Äôs fueling this traction is CartelFi‚Äôs distinctive pitch: converting the idle meme coin capital into productive, yield-generating assets. CartelFi is positioning itself as a functional, revenue-generating DeFi platform built on meme culture‚Äôs speculative DNA. With presale stages closing fast and capital inflows accelerating, CartelFi‚Äôs campaign is becoming one of the more notable early-stage offerings in a market primed for high-risk, high-reward plays. Broader crypto market The cryptocurrency market held steady in subdued trade on Sunday, with Bitcoin struggling to reclaim the $85,000 mark and most major altcoins posting negligible moves. XRP, ETH, and other large-cap tokens stayed rangebound, reflecting broader risk-off sentiment across global markets. The global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.68 trillion, down 0.53% over the past 24 hours. Total market volume in the same period rose 2.47% to $45.39 billion. Caution continued to dominate as investors monitored developments around the US administration‚Äôs new trade policies. With few specifics on the scope or effective timelines, market participants remained hesitant to make decisive moves. Amid this cautious backdrop, the ongoing presale for CartelFi stood out. The project‚Äôs ability to attract capital despite broader market hesitancy underscores both its unique positioning and investors‚Äô ongoing appetite for asymmetric early-stage opportunities.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , a meme coin, is drawing significant attention in its presale. As macro uncertainty, fueled by US policies like Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs, drives interest in decentralised assets, Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs unique positioning makes it a project worth considering. Here‚Äôs a closer look at why BPEP could be the best crypto to buy as BTC shows resilience. Analysts on Bitcoin and crypto: is this the best time to buy? Market analysts are increasingly optimistic about projects tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs ecosystem, especially as BTC demonstrates strength in volatile conditions. A recent post from QCP Capital on X highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to weather macro pressures, suggesting that assets leveraging its infrastructure could see upside. Bitcoin Pepe , positioned as the only Bitcoin meme ICO, may gain from this dynamic. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, it merges Bitcoin‚Äôs security with scalability features similar to Solana. This setup enables fast, secure, and scalable transactions, addressing common pain points in meme coin trading. Bitcoin Pepe shines in presale Since its presale launch, Bitcoin Pepe has gained massive traction. While well-known meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have faced significant declines, Bitcoin Pepe has sustained its upward momentum since its presale launch in mid-February, offering solid returns for early investors. Structured across 30 stages, the presale features incremental price increases of approximately 5% per stage. The token is structured to hit $0.0864 by the end of the presale, implying potential gains of over 300% for early participants. Unlike many viral tokens that rely solely on hype, BPEP aims to create a broader ecosystem, including a decentralized exchange and NFT marketplace. These features position Bitcoin Pepe as a project with long-term ambitions, not just a fleeting trend. Why could BPEP be a good crypto to buy today? Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs, imposing massive duties on major trade partners, have shaken traditional markets, amplifying economic uncertainty. As stocks wobble and trade tensions simmer, investors are turning to decentralized assets like Bitcoin and its ecosystem for stability. Bitcoin Pepe, with its ties to BTC‚Äôs secure network and its appeal to meme coin enthusiasts, is well-placed to capitalize on this shift. The project‚Äôs timing is notable. As Bitcoin rallies, speculative capital often flows into adjacent projects with strong narratives. While short-term volatility persists, Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs fundamentals‚Äîtransparent tokenomics, a clear roadmap, and a focus on scalability‚Äîsuggest it could thrive as crypto adoption grows. For investors looking to diversify beyond traditional assets, BPEP offers a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. In the world of trade wars and market jitters, Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs presale presents a chance to invest in a project that blends Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience with meme coin momentum.

A confirmed break below $84,600 could pave the way for a deeper slide toward $83,340. On the other hand, a push back above $85,500 would invalidate the bearish thesis and restore bullish momentum. Trade Setup: Short Entry: Below $84,600 Targets: $83,990 ‚Üí $83,340 Long Entry: Only above $85,500 with volume confirmation Stop Loss: Above $85,500 (shorts), below $84,000 (longs) With macro headlines heating up and institutional players entering the fray, traders should tread carefully.

BTC Bull Presale Crosses $4.82M as Staking Yields Hit 85%‚ÄîNext Price Hike Near With Bitcoin hovering around the $85,000 level, investor interest in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to grow.

What makes BTC Bull stand out is its real utility: every time Bitcoin hits key price milestones, $BTCBULL holders receive airdropped rewards in real BTC. This unique feature has attracted crypto-native investors looking to align their meme coin exposure with actual Bitcoin upside. Stake BTCBULL for 85% APY + Real Bitcoin Rewards BTC Bull‚Äôs high-yield staking program remains a top driver of demand. Investors can earn 85% APY by staking their $BTCBULL tokens and still retain the ability to unstake at any time‚Äîoffering both yield and flexibility.

The falling wedge pattern is a classic bullish signal. They often precede a bull run beginning near the time when the trend lines converge on the chart.¬†Solana‚Äôs 2025 falling wedge shows up on the 1Y view starting in late January. The trend lines of support tracing low price outliers came in higher as the weeks go on, while the trend lines of resistance tracing high price outliers came in lower.¬†They converge right around the time of Solana‚Äôs mid-April price rally. Furthermore, Solana prices also threw up a cup and handle signal on the 1M window, concurrent with the bullish flip out of the falling wedge trend. It also exhibits the classic declining daily trade volume during the handle formation. The 10-day little teapot formation began on Wednesday, Apr. 2 and ended Saturday, Apr. 12, followed by the textbook downward drifting side channel for a 4-day handle until Wednesday, Apr. 16, followed by a bullish test to rally mid-week. The April chart for SOL tokens also features a neat 4-day mini-cup and handle within the handle of the 10-day teapot. So the market technical indicators are beautifully bullish this month. 2.

Blockchain insights firm Glassnode noted on Apr. 15 that the median cost basis, or the price at the most recent trade that shows up for the most SOL tokens, was $129.79. That median cost basis near the average trading price mid-April could work as an investor bias and market price ratchet locking in support for more growth at current price levels, the blockchain intelligence firm noted. ‚ÄúThis zone could act as a support during future drawdowns, reflecting high investor engagement at this price level,‚Äù Glassnode wrote. 3.

In April, Janover hired former Kraken C-execs to build a corporate stockpile of Solana, following the financial strategy set by Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy with corporate Bitcoin financing.

On the regulatory front, Slovenia plans a 25% crypto tax by 2026, and New Hampshire advances a bill to hold Bitcoin reserves. Let‚Äôs dig deeper. Bitcoin JPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin has failed to meet expectations as a safe-haven asset , as gold and traditional assets attract inflows amid global uncertainty. Business Spar has become the first supermarket in Switzerland to begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC), marking a significant milestone in the country‚Äôs progressive approach to digital asset adoption.

Coin value has decreased up to a $5.27 low in the last 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency shed a minor 1.86% of its value today.

Uniswap price analysis on a daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed a declining trend for the day. UNI/USD price has decreased to $5.27 throughout the day. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a slow downswing. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the volatility.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $6.115. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $4.669. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is situated in the neutral region. Currently at 42.06 and slowly moving downwards, this marks a bearish trend. This declining movement is represented by a bearish slope. The selling activities have been growing since the start of the trading session, leading to continual decline. Uniswap price analysis on a 4-hour chart In contrast to the 1-day price chart, the four-hour price analysis of the Uniswap coin confirms an upward trend in the market. Cryptocurrency value has appreciated to a high of $5.31 in the past four hours. However, the prevailing volatility levels indicate a higher chance of reversal.

Uniswap price analysis gives out a bearish prediction with respect to the ongoing market events. The UNI/USD value has decreased to $5.27 following the latest bearish turn. The cryptocurrency lost up to 1.89% of its value through the day. Technical indicators give out a strong bearish verdict regarding the market conditions; the price charts are also in support of sellers. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.59 level by 2027 and above $48.41 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a decreasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. The cryptocurrency lost more than 1.89 percent of its value over the last 24 hours, and its price has decreased to $5.27. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $11.17, while the average price is expected to be around $9.31. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading near the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $48.41 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

It quickly rose to $7.00 before reaching an all-time low of $1.03 (CoinGecko) or $0.4190 (CoinMarketCap) on the same day. UNI ended the year at $5.00 after a gradual recovery during the 2020 bull run. In 2021, UNI surged 400% in January to $20. By March, it hit $28; on May 3, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $44.93. It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6. After mid-May, it faced selling pressure, falling to $0.14 by July 31. It stabilized in August at around $5 and traded above $6 at the start of September. In October, UNI reached a peak of $8, and November saw a peak price of $13.58. In December, UNI soared to $18.60.

AI Companions ( AIC ) tokens jumped by over 40% to $0.2120, its highest point since March 30 and 70% above its lowest point this month.

The total market cap of all AI tokens tracked by CoinGecko has jumped by 5.6% in the last 24 hours to $22.20 billion. These AI tokens jumped after a CoinGecko report showed that AI was one of the most popular themes in the crypto market. The Artificial Intelligence theme had a 14.4% share, while AI agents had 10.1%. Combined, the figure was higher than the meme coin interest of 16.5%. You might also like: EOS price prediction: Is there still hope for this ‚ÄòEthereum killer‚Äô? AI tokens and stocks are losing traction Recently, however, there are signs that the AI theme is losing traction in the stock and crypto market. Popular AI stocks like NVIDIA, AMD, SoundHound, and Bigbear AI have all plunged by over 20% from their peak levels. Similarly, AI tokens like Render, AIC, TAI, WLD, and FET have all plunged by over 50% from their highest points this year. Their decline has mirrored the performance of the broader crypto market. There are concerns that the AI bubble that has been inflating in the past few years is about to deflate. One possible sign for this is that Microsoft has started pausing its data center expansion in places like the United States, India, and Indonesia. Another concern is the oversupply of AI models. While US AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and Grok are the most popular, China has many more, including DeepSeek, Baidu Ernie, Alibaba Qwen, and ByteDance‚Äôs Doubao. It is unclear whether these AI tokens like AI Companions, Tars AI, Worldcoin, and FET will continue rising since this rebound may be part of a dead cat bounce. A sustained recovery will depend on the performance of the crypto market. A strong Bitcoin ( BTC ) rebound, as we predicted , will point to more gains for most altcoins.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto Presale to Join Before It Shoots Up Further,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-makers-early-stages-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-before-it-shoots-up-further/,"Ever looked back at Maker and thought, ‚ÄúDamn, that could‚Äôve been me‚Äù? If you‚Äôve been in crypto long enough, you‚Äôve definitely felt that sting of watching a low-key project transform into a heavyweight. Maker launched with huge ambitions and ended up being a DeFi giant, but most people didn‚Äôt take it seriously until it was already pumping hard. And now that the space is heating up again, the chances of finding another shot at something like that feel pretty slim‚Äîunless you know where to look. That‚Äôs where Qubetics ($TICS) comes in and flips the entire script. While everyone‚Äôs chasing old coins for small rebounds, Qubetics is quietly stacking momentum‚Äîand the presale stats prove it‚Äôs not hype, it‚Äôs math. Unlike those who had to beg for whitelist access back in 2024, you‚Äôve still got a real shot. The Qubetics presale is live, the price is affordable, and the stage-based structure means rewards shrink the longer you wait. The current stage is already the 30th, and with each new round jumping 10% in cost, delay isn‚Äôt just expensive‚Äîit‚Äôs dumb. If you‚Äôre still wondering what the best crypto presale to join is, Qubetics is right there staring you in the face. Qubetics Is Still Early‚ÄîBut Not for Long: The Best Crypto Presale to Join Right Now Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Qubetics started its journey on September 29, 2024 and you missed so many presale stages where prices were incredibly low. But you still have time to do the right thing as the prices are still in your budget. Also, you have a chance to avail of a 10% discount as with every new stage there is a 10% price increase and each stage last only seven days. By the way, Qubetics mainnet launch is scheduled for Q2 2025. Currently, Qubetics is in its 30th stage, selling $TICS at $0.1729. Over 508 million tokens have already been scooped up, and the presale tally has crossed $16.2 million with more than 24,900 holders in the ecosystem. The ROI projections are wild‚Äîif $TICS hits just $1 post-launch, that‚Äôs a 477.85% ROI. But if you‚Äôre playing the long game and the coin climbs to $10 or $15, we‚Äôre talking about 5,678.61% to 8,567.92% ROI. Even a modest target like $6 puts you up over 3,367%. To put it into perspective, a $100 investment today would bag you around 578 tokens, turning into $5,780 at $10, or $8,670 at $15. It‚Äôs not a dream. It‚Äôs a calculated opportunity. The best crypto presale to join right now is the one that‚Äôs structured for serious scalability‚Äîand Qubetics nails that. With over 30 stages and rising demand, it‚Äôs not just about hype. It‚Äôs about math, timing, and utility. This isn‚Äôt another whitepaper fantasy. Qubetics is real, it‚Äôs funded, and it‚Äôs prepping for a powerful mainnet rollout in Q2 2025. And this presale is your only window to grab $TICS at low prices before that train leaves the station for good. If you‚Äôre still hunting the best crypto presale, quit scrolling and make a move. Now let‚Äôs talk utility. One of Qubetics‚Äô standout use cases is its Multi-Chain Wallet. This isn‚Äôt just another digital wallet‚Äîit‚Äôs fully integrated with Visa and Mastercard networks, which means users will be able to make purchases online or in stores with crypto, just like fiat. Think freelancers in Europe receiving crypto and immediately spending it through Apple Pay or Google Pay with Qubetics Wallet. Or an e-commerce brand in Southeast Asia converting $TICS to USDT with stable conversion rates to pay for inventory without worrying about wild price swings. Then there‚Äôs virtual card functionality built into the app‚Äîusers can generate digital cards to spend crypto like cash, and business owners can set up multiple virtual cards for expense tracking or payroll. All of it is tied into real-time analytics, monitoring, and full privacy controls. Whether you‚Äôre a solo digital nomad, a mid-sized brand, or just someone who wants to actually use your tokens instead of sitting on them like collectibles, Qubetics‚Äîhailed by many as the best crypto presale to join right now‚Äîgives you that freedom. Maker‚Äôs Rise Was Predictable in Hindsight‚ÄîBut It‚Äôs Too Late to Enter Cheap Let‚Äôs rewind. Maker was introduced in 2017 with an initial price around $24. Those early days were filled with skepticism, especially because DeFi wasn‚Äôt even a buzzword yet. But the team stayed consistent, and Dai, its decentralized stablecoin, brought Maker into the center of every serious DeFi discussion. Fast forward to its all-time high of over $6,000 in May 2021, and the story becomes clear: if you slept on it early, you missed thousands of percent in growth. What makes it tougher is that Maker didn‚Äôt rise overnight. It built a reputation slowly, gained adoption over years, and rewarded the faithful. There were multiple dips along the way that could‚Äôve been solid entry points, but the biggest multipliers are long gone. Today, it‚Äôs still a respected DeFi project, but not exactly a low-entry moonshot anymore. It‚Äôs mature, with a massive market cap and deep liquidity‚Äîbut also slower upside potential for new buyers looking for aggressive growth. Maker‚Äôs growth story is a great example of what happens when community members back fundamentals early. But the chance to get in at those bottom-floor levels is over. The people looking for the next Maker-style run need to find it somewhere else‚Äîand Qubetics is clearly building that kind of structure from the ground up. But with the price already jumping across 30 presale stages, your delay only pushes that potential further out of reach. Don‚Äôt Repeat the Same Mistake‚ÄîJoin This Crypto Presale Before It‚Äôs Too Late Opportunities don‚Äôt repeat themselves in the exact same way‚Äîbut they do rhyme. Skipping Maker in its early stages was a miss. But skipping Qubetics now? That‚Äôs just irresponsible. The price curve is already steep, the token is actively being bought up, and the mainnet is just months away. With application-ready features and a presale model built to reward early participants, Qubetics isn‚Äôt waiting around for people to ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù catch up. It‚Äôs moving with or without you. If you‚Äôre someone who missed the last few moonshots and you‚Äôre still wondering what the best crypto presale to join is‚Äîthis is your answer. Qubetics is already shaping up to be one of the most talked-about launches of 2025. Between the ROI potential, the real-world utility, and the already proven demand, it‚Äôs got everything you‚Äôd want in a presale. Don‚Äôt sit around watching another coin 10x without you. This is your entry. Join this crypto presale now‚Äîbefore the 31st stage makes it even harder to afford.

This breakout follows several days of sideways movement, during which the Solana price traded within a narrow range between $124 and $135. Related Reading: Whales Swallowing Bitcoin Fast ‚Äî Will This Push BTC Price Up? Although the recent move above this consolidation zone hints at a potential upward continuation, on-chain data reveals that significant resistance awaits near $144, which may serve as the next major test for bulls. Levels That Will Define Next Solana Breakout According to a post on social media platform X by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Solana‚Äôs current trading range between $129 and $144 is very important to how it goes from here. Particularly, Martinez noted that the most important support for the Solana price is at $129, while the key resistance to watch sits at $144. This commentary aligns closely with the data shown in a chart shared by the analyst, sourced from Glassnode‚Äôs UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD): ATH-Partitioned model. The volume bars shown in the URPD data below indicate that Solana‚Äôs price is boxed in between dense clusters of buying and selling activity. The tallest concentration is currently around the $129 to $144 region. The chart highlights that roughly 5.75% of all the current realized volume for SOL occurred near the $129 price point, making this level a strong support zone. Interestingly, its importance was reinforced on April 17, when Solana‚Äôs price rebounded sharply after briefly dipping to this level. Similarly, the $144 level also holds about 5% of the volume, acting as a resistance ceiling in the short term. This price zone previously rejected bullish attempts in the final week of March, confirming it as a short-term ceiling for upward momentum. Together, these two levels form a tightly contested range, and a breakout beyond either boundary will likely dictate whether Solana enters a new bullish leg or retraces further. Image From X: Ali_Charts The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD): ATH-Partitioned Model The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD): ATH-Partitioned is an advanced on-chain metric that maps out where current coin holders acquired their tokens in relation to the all-time high (ATH). When a price level shows a high concentration of realized volume, it implies that a significant number of tokens were bought at that level. These clusters tend to act as psychological support or resistance, since holders may be more inclined to defend breakeven zones (support) or exit at previous loss zones (resistance), depending on market sentiment.

The price could reach there this new week, or a drawdown in sentiment could bring the $129 into focus as the level to hold. At the time of writing, Solana was trading at $139, up by 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

Pepe coin ( PEPE ) token was trading at $0.0000075 on Sunday, a few points above the year-to-date low of $0.000005860. On-chain metrics show that the value of Pepe could surge in the next few weeks.

The MDIA is a popular indicator that looks at the average purchase price of tokens held in current addresses. A surging MDIA figure indicates that holders are not selling their tokens, suggesting they are confident in the coin.

Therefore, the token will likely bounce back, as bulls target the psychological point at $0.000010, up by 35% above the current level.

The meetings will take place during the spring gatherings of the IMF and World Bank, and come as tensions around tariffs, exports, and currency volatility continue to build pressure on Korea‚Äôs economy. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Trade Minister Ahn Duk-geun are set to lead the Korean delegation. They‚Äôll hold consultations with Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Korean Trade Ministry released the schedule on Sunday. Choi and Ahn are traveling to push back against the 25% ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariff announced by President Donald Trump. That tariff was paused temporarily, but Seoul wants it reduced or scrapped completely before it drags the country‚Äôs fragile exports any deeper. The statement didn‚Äôt give any full agenda or confirm what else would be discussed. Ahn is leaving for Washington on Wednesday. South Korea‚Äôs central bank freezes interest rates, warns growth will fall below forecast South Korea‚Äôs central bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), kept its key policy rate unchanged at 2.75% on Thursday. The bank said it needed more time to observe domestic and global changes, especially with tariffs shifting and stimulus efforts kicking in. This decision matched the prediction from a recent Reuters economist poll. In its monetary statement, the BOK said it was facing high uncertainty and couldn‚Äôt make any clear calls on the outlook yet. The bank also warned that economic growth will probably fall below the 1.5% forecast it made in February. The expected drop is tied to slowing exports, weak household demand, and ongoing political instability. On April 15, Korea rolled out a 12 trillion won ($8.45 billion) emergency budget. It included increased support for the semiconductor sector, one of the country‚Äôs most critical industries. But even with that boost, the central bank said it would stick to its rate cut stance, though it wouldn‚Äôt commit to any timing. That decision would be based on both domestic policy shifts and external trade conditions. The BOK also said it was being cautious about exchange rate swings and the possible return of household debt problems if conditions stay loose for too long. Korea‚Äôs currency, the won, has been unstable since Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù remarks on April 3. The currency strengthened to 1,429.52 per dollar on April 4, then crashed to 1,487.3 by April 9, marking a 16-year low. A week later, on April 16, the won strengthened again to 1,411.39‚Äîits highest point since December 2024. With the election coming and U.S. tariffs still a threat, Korea‚Äôs leadership is trying to buy time. Choi told parliament on Tuesday that the country would attempt to delay any implementation of the tariffs as long as possible. ‚ÄúWe want to delay the implementation of tariffs as long as possible,‚Äù Choi said. He added that the goal was to give Korean businesses more stability in a chaotic global market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Artificial Superintelligence Alliance extended its rally for a fourth straight week, climbing to $0.5730. Render (RNDR) rose to $4.32, while Worldcoin added 7% and Tars AI jumped around 60%. The total market cap of AI tokens tracked by CoinGecko increased 5.6% in the past 24 hours to $22.20 billion. The gains followed a CoinGecko report highlighting AI as one of the crypto market‚Äôs most active sectors. Another AI-related project that has been on the radar of investors is PepeX , a next-gen meme coin launchpad aiming to fix persistent problems of fairness, security, and transparency in the meme coin space. The growing interest in AI tokens Artificial intelligence tokens and memecoins dominated crypto market narratives in the first quarter of 2025, accounting for 62.8% of investor interest, according to CoinGecko‚Äôs latest quarterly report. AI tokens led with a 35.7% share, surpassing memecoins, which held 27.1%. Among the top 20 narratives tracked during the quarter, six categories were memecoins, while five were related to AI. ‚ÄúSeems like we have yet to see another new narrative emerge and we are still following past quarters‚Äô trends,‚Äù CoinGecko co-founder and COO Bobby Ong noted in an April 17 post on X. ‚ÄúI guess we are all tired from the same old trends repeating themselves.‚Äù Why PepeX is the token to watch PepeX is positioning itself as a notable player in the meme coin launchpad space, offering a more structured and secure framework compared to existing platforms. As platforms like Pump.fun face scrutiny for enabling poorly designed, exploit-prone tokens, PepeX proposes an infrastructure aimed at improving oversight and project integrity. At the core of its platform is the Moonshot Engine, an AI-powered tool that automates token creation while addressing common inefficiencies in meme coin launches. The platform also leverages AI promotional bots to boost project visibility across social media ‚Äî a key advantage in a market driven by hype. Notably, PepeX enforces a 5% cap on token holdings for project creators and a mandatory $500 launch fee, measures intended to deter opportunistic and bad-faith projects. By introducing these controls, PepeX seeks to bring a degree of fairness, accountability, and investor protection to a space often lacking in both, aiming to establish itself as a long-term, credible launchpad alternative. The presale momentum is strong PepeX‚Äôs presale is gathering momentum, with over $1.4 million raised as investor demand builds for a more reliable, structured alternative to the chaotic and often exploit-prone meme coin launchpads dominating the market. The project‚Äôs tokenomics reflect a focus on utility and long-term sustainability. Of the total supply, 45% is allocated to the presale, 10% to development, 10% for liquidity, 15% for marketing, another 15% for staking and rewards, and 5% reserved for treasury functions. Rather than chasing hype, PepeX is positioning itself with a security-first approach aimed at addressing persistent issues like rug pulls, duplicate projects, and opaque practices. Its emphasis on higher standards for project quality, transparency, and investor protection marks it as a potential long-term contender in a market increasingly frustrated with low-effort, high-risk launches.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said live on NHK that his country will push for ‚Äúfairness‚Äù in every single part of the exchange rate talks, as President Trump continues his tariff campaign against America‚Äôs biggest trade partners. The warning came just days after Trump unexpectedly walked into the first round of US-Japan trade negotiations and said there was ‚Äú big progress .‚Äù What he really wants is for Tokyo to stop what he claims is a deliberate weakening of the yen to help Japanese exporters. Ishiba made clear that currency policy is going to be handled directly by Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, not the leaders. But he was very direct when asked if Japan would help push the yen higher. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to deal with this issue from the standpoint of fairness,‚Äù Scott said, though he didn‚Äôt say how exactly Japan would respond. Ishiba points to energy deals, auto rules, and debt as trade pressure builds As is well documented, the Trump White House has hit Japan with 24% tariffs on goods entering the US, but those have been put on hold until early July. A 10% baseline tariff still applies, and 25% duties on cars are active‚Äîhurting one of Japan‚Äôs most important exports. Even so, Ishiba said Tokyo might be open to changes on non-tariff barriers, including the long-running complaints about Japan‚Äôs auto safety standards. These rules, Washington says, make it nearly impossible for American-made cars to enter the Japanese market. Ishiba didn‚Äôt agree with the accusations, but he didn‚Äôt deny the possibility of change either. ‚ÄúThere are differences in US and Japanese traffic and safety rules that must be taken into account,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we also need to ensure we‚Äôre not told our (safety) rules are unfair.‚Äù His comment follows a report by Nikkei Asia that Japan is considering loosening some of these auto safety requirements as part of its negotiation strategy. Other negotiation pieces are on the table There‚Äôs also the question of US energy exports. Ishiba said Japan could increase imports of American liquefied natural gas, but only if Washington proves it can deliver it without issues. ‚ÄúAs for liquefied natural gas, Australia is the biggest exporter to Japan. I believe the US is in fourth place. It‚Äôs possible we could have this increase. The question is whether the US can deliver (energy) stably,‚Äù he said. Then there‚Äôs Japan‚Äôs US Treasury holdings‚Äîover $1 trillion, the biggest in the world. Some economists think Japan could use that as a pressure point in the talks. But Katsunobu already ruled that out earlier this month, and Ishiba repeated the position. ‚ÄúThis is something that‚Äôs based on trust between the two sides, global economic stability, as well the two countries‚Äô economic stability,‚Äù he said when asked if Japan would use that leverage. Katsunobu is flying to Washington this week to join the G20 finance chiefs‚Äô meeting, which will run alongside the IMF spring summit. Everyone expects him to sit down with Scott to go head-to-head on all the issues‚Äîcurrency, tariffs, energy, and auto rules.

As Ethereum aims to break the $10,000 barrier, there‚Äôs a rising star in its ecosystem that could soar alongside it, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM has already raised over $6.9 million and has attracted more than 8400 holders within days of presale. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. If Ethereum reaches its projected highs, MUTM could follow suit, offering an exciting opportunity for investors seeking high returns in the next bull run. The Muutum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 8,400 investors have participated in the project‚Äôs unique approach through which they poured $6.9 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterwards. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders‚Äô returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. Ethereum (ETH) is set to smash new all-time highs in 2025, potentially surpassing $10,000. As it rises, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its innovative dual-lending model, is positioned to follow suit. With over $6.9 million raised and 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM‚Äôs presale price is set to rise 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5, offering a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Don‚Äôt miss out, secure your MUTM tokens today at just $0.025 and maximize your gains as the DeFi sector booms. Act fast, invest now and be part of the next big crypto revolution.

Crude prices are diving. Russia‚Äôs Urals blend just sank below $55 a barrel. That‚Äôs almost $20 short of what the Kremlin needs to hit its own budget target. Around a third of Russia‚Äôs state revenue comes from oil and gas. That hole is a gaping wound. If prices stay down, the country‚Äôs deficit could almost double this year. Trump‚Äôs trade moves push Russia closer to collapse Peace talks over Ukraine are stalling. Moscow is dragging its feet, hoping battlefield wins will force the U.S. to fold. But that leverage is slipping. Oil prices are crushing the Kremlin‚Äôs budget. If they fall deeper, Putin might be forced to change his war strategy, because the money simply won‚Äôt be there. J.P. Morgan‚Äôs analysts said even though Russia is cut off from most global markets, Trump‚Äôs trade policy will still hit it hard. They called it a ‚Äútsunami‚Äù headed straight for Moscow. Putin‚Äôs government doesn‚Äôt just depend on oil for cash. It relies on it for survival. In the 1980s, falling oil prices helped wreck the Soviet Union. In 1999, when Putin became prime minister, rising oil prices bailed him out. His whole power play stands on that foundation. And right now, that foundation is shaking. The oil industry pumps more than fuel. It lifts other sectors too. When oil does well, steel factories thrive, construction sites boom, and entire towns stay afloat. But when oil drops, everything linked to it drops too. That chain reaction is what economists call a multiplier effect. Trump‚Äôs team knew oil was Russia‚Äôs weak spot. His administration hinted early on that they‚Äôd pressure U.S. and Saudi production up to drag prices down. Keith Kellogg, Trump‚Äôs Ukraine envoy, said in January that if oil fell to $45, it might push Putin to stop the war. When Trump finally released his new global tariffs list, Russia wasn‚Äôt even on it. But that wasn‚Äôt a gift. It was irrelevance. The U.S. said there‚Äôs barely any real trade left with Moscow thanks to years of sanctions. Russia faces multi-dimensional pressure Russia has survived other oil crashes‚Äî2008, COVID‚Äîbut this is different. The war‚Äôs been running for three years. The Kremlin tried to hide the costs by handing out jobs and money. If the economy crashes now, that cover gets ripped off. The Kremlin claims it‚Äôs doing ‚Äúeverything to minimize the consequences for the Russian economy.‚Äù But the numbers don‚Äôt lie. Brent crude could average just $63 this year, Goldman Sachs said. And by 2026, it could hit $58. Since Urals already sells at a discount, that means Russia‚Äôs oil could fall under $50. Coal and metals are also sinking. China‚Äôs slowdown from Trump‚Äôs tariffs adds more pain. Renaissance Capital told clients low oil prices could lead to a ‚Äúhard landing.‚Äù They said if Urals stays at $50 this year, Russia‚Äôs GDP might only grow 0.1%. That‚Äôs nearly flat. Especially bad after the last two years, when military spending boosted GDP by 4% in both 2023 and 2024. That same spending triggered out-of-control inflation. To fight it, the central bank hiked interest rates to 21%. It‚Äôs the highest ever. At the same time, the country‚Äôs losing workers‚Äîeither drafted into the army or fleeing the country. February‚Äôs year-over-year GDP growth was just 0.8%, down from 3% in January. Factory output is down. Car sales are down. Rail cargo shipments are down. Every metric is falling.

However, its failure to break above the $85,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the ongoing recovery may trap bulls. BTC/USD daily price chart.

McGlone argues that risk assets are showing signs of reverting to long-term means, mainly their 200-week moving averages that have historically served as critical floor during major price corrections. Bitcoin and S&P 500 weekly chart comparison. Source: Mike McGlone As of April 20, Bitcoin‚Äôs 200-week moving average was around $46,300, down by about 45% compared to current price levels at around $85,000. Meanwhile, gold has surged to a record high of $3,115 per ounce in April, up over 19% year-to-date.

Source: TradingView According to McGlone, this rotation into hard assets like gold and out-of-high-beta plays like crypto reflects a classic flight to safety. The divergence between gold and Bitcoin is evident in institutional investment trends.

However, not all analysts see gold‚Äôs rally lasting. Veteran trader Peter Brandt pointed to a possible ‚Äú blow-off top ‚Äù for gold, warning that such rapid gains typically end in sharp reversals, though timing the peak remains risky. Some believe that if gold‚Äôs momentum fades, Bitcoin could continue its bull run, providing its history of lagging the precious metal rally by several months. Source: Lawrence Lepard Bitcoin‚Äôs unrealized losses suggest early bear market risk Glassnode data reveals a growing divergence between short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders, hinting at potential early-stage bear market conditions, albeit not a confirmed crash. Notably, short-term holders (STHs)‚Äîthose who acquired Bitcoin within the past few months‚Äîhave been facing substantial unrealized losses relative to the current drawdown. Bitcoin STH unrealizes losses per percent chart. Source: Glassnode This level of loss, normalized by drawdown percentage, is comparable to the early stages of past bear markets, including late 2018 and early 2022. In contrast, long-term holders (LTHs)‚Äîthose holding Bitcoin for over 155 days‚Äîremain broadly in profit. Bitcoin STH vs LTC unrealized loss per percent chart. Source: Glassnode However, the data suggests a growing risk: as BTC top buyers from recent highs age into LTH status, more unrealized losses could shift into the long-term cohort. Historically, most shifts in loss absorption have preceded bear market regimes. Therefore, the risk lies in whether LTH profitability can withstand prolonged market weakness‚Äîor if capitulation sets in as it did during previous downtrends. For now, caution may be warranted, but this data does not yet confirm an outright crash. Bitcoin is still in bull market,¬†PlanB asserts Some analysts view the current dip as a standard correction within a broader bull trend. Among them is pseudonymous analyst PlanB, who argues that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish. According to PlanB‚Äôs Stock-to-Flow (S2F) and 200-week moving average models, Bitcoin‚Äôs current price action mirrors historical consolidation phases seen before major rallies. Bitcoin 200-week moving averages vs 200-week geometric mean chart. Source: PlanB In particular, past cycles show that when the 200-week simple moving average (black line) converges with the 200-week geometric mean (gray line), Bitcoin tends to surge soon after. This convergence is happening again in April. PlanB also highlights the red-dot phase‚Äîrepresenting the 6-month pre-halving to the 18-month post-halving window‚Äîas historically bullish. Bitcoin is now seven months into this period, which has consistently delivered explosive price action in previous cycles.

Adams lauded Solana‚Äôs solid team and clear vision in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). He added that DeFi‚Äôs needs are better served by Solana‚Äôs focus on speeding up and making its layer 1 (L1) cheaper. I‚Äôm all for scaling improvements to L1, the rollup centric roadmap actually requires it The thing I‚Äôm against is confused takes where ethereum is on a ‚Äúrollup centric roadmap‚Äù but all the important things still have to live on L1 and we need L2s to scale but we don‚Äôt support‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Hayden Adams ü¶Ñ (@haydenzadams) April 19, 2025 Adams urged the Ethereum community to double down on its layer 2 scaling roadmap, a strategy he believes is key to maintaining the network‚Äôs dominance. He added that Solana is better suited to do DeFi on its layer 1, given its roadmap and overall approach compared to Ethereum. ‚ÄúEthereum has been working towards an L2-centric/horizontal scaling roadmap for 5+ years,‚Äù Adams noted. ‚ÄúYou want to throw this away at the final stretch because of what reason?‚Äù His statement led to extensive discussions that attracted developers, investors, and crypto fans. Many are now wondering if Ethereum is losing its DeFi crown. Solana advances as Ethereum fights to keep up While Ethereum continues to evolve its L2 ecosystem , Solana is gaining traction with its streamlined layer 1 capabilities. As Ethereum iterates toward its robust L2 ecosystem, Solana takes on its nimble layer 1 approach. Ethereum is still the DeFi king, with almost $47 billion in its ecosystem. Adams said Solana‚Äôs approach makes more fundamental sense for executing DeFi directly on its base layer without the need for separate off-chain scaling solutions. According to Adams, Solana‚Äôs approach is inherently better suited for executing DeFi directly on its base layer, bypassing the complexities of off-chain scaling solutions. Ethereum has been committed to L2 development since 2020, leaning into rollups and modular scaling as gas fees and congestion plagued its layer 1. However, this focus has come under scrutiny, with some community members advocating for renewed investment in base-layer upgrades‚Äîa shift Adams vehemently opposes without clear consensus and direction. There is building frustration with Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem. Just a few months ago, Max Resnick , an Ethereum core developer, left the project for Solana. He cited a ‚Äúrigid developer community‚Äù in Ethereum and slow-scale efforts at Layer 1 as reasons for his decision. Other DeFi platforms on Solana are soaring. Raydium , a Solana-based exchange, overtook Uniswap in the biggest trade volume grab in 2020. Raydium has processed $122 billion of trades over 30 days versus Uniswap‚Äôs $96 billion of trades over the same period, per DeFiLlama. Solana continues to attract users and developers with its low fees and extremely fast speeds of over 4,000 transactions per second. Recent developments include launching a Solana ETF in Canada and staking deposits skyrocketing to boost Solana‚Äôs price beyond $135. Uniswap signals readiness for layer 1-focused scaling The Uniswap founder recently made it clear that he is still open to a pivot towards a layer 1-centric scaling strategy, but only if done intentionally and realistically, with major modifications to the network. He also pointed out that Uniswap‚Äôs biggest market share remains in layer 1, so such a pivot would still represent a strategic victory for the project. That said, he noted that these methods place them on a path towards greater centrality of nodes and reduce the margin for individuals to run full nodes. Ethereum is facing its worst quarterly price performance in nearly a decade as the debate over the network‚Äôs scaling future heats up. ETH now has its sights set on a $1,600 breakout, struggling to remain atop the $2,000 key psychological threshold. In notable news, Tron founder Justin Sun has said he is not selling his ETH holdings following the latest price falls. Instead, he pledged to collaborate with Ethereum developers as they attempt to spur ecosystem growth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While most large-cap assets were stuck in a consolidation range in the last seven-day period, the SOL token enjoyed a good amount of upward bullish momentum. The price of SOL kicked off the weekend with a strong rally toward the $140 level, albeit facing some degree of resistance around this level. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Solana price might have become wedged between two crucial levels. Is SOL Price Gearing For A Breakout Or Breakdown? In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an on-chain insight into the current Solana price setup and its potential future trajectory. The online pundit referenced the ‚ÄúUTXO Realized Price Distribution‚Äù (URPD) indicator, which monitors the amount of a particular cryptocurrency that was acquired at a given level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance At Risk Of Crash To 40%, Why This Is Good For Ethereum, XRP, And Altcoins Usually, the ability of a price level to serve as an on-chain support or resistance zone depends on the number of investors (and coins) with their cost basis around this level. The cost basis of an investor refers to the spot price at which they acquired their tokens or coins. Typically, a price region (beneath the current price) where several investors bought their tokens will likely act as a support level. This is because investors are likely to double down on their position when an asset‚Äôs value falls to their cost basis; this buying activity helps keep the token‚Äôs price afloat. On the other hand, price levels above the current price with significant buying activity would serve as major supply or resistance barriers. The rationale behind this is that investors tend to sell off their assets when the token‚Äôs price rises back to their cost basis, putting downward pressure on price and preventing further upward growth. The chart below shows the distribution of token supply at different Solana price levels surrounding the current price. According to data from Glassnode, the most important support for the Solana price lies around $129, while the major resistance sits at around $144. As Martinez explained, a breakout (above $144) or breakdown (below $129) could determine the fate of the SOL token over the next few weeks. As observed in the highlighted chart, the next significant support for the Solana price sits around the $10 level. Meanwhile, there is no significant resistance for the altcoin till around the $170 price level based on the URPD indicator. Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the SOL token is valued at around $138, reflecting an over 3% price increase in the past 24 hours.

Source: Glassnode This drop in network activity aligns with XRP‚Äôs price decline, as fewer new addresses, a key sign of adoption, often signal weakening investor confidence and can precede further losses. Notably, the declining new addresses comes at a time when XRP‚Äôs technical setup is painting a bearish picture amid ongoing price consolidation. XRP bearish technicals To this end, in an April 17 analysis, cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez observed that XRP is exhibiting a textbook bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The formation shows a clear left shoulder, head, and right shoulder, with the price recently breaking below the neckline around $2.05. A retest of this level has already occurred, often a precursor to continued downward movement. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts This pattern, commonly seen before market reversals, suggests XRP could be headed much lower. If confirmed, the move could drag prices down to the $1.30 and $1.40 range, representing a potential drop of over 30% from current levels. Unless XRP can reclaim the neckline as support, the risk of a deeper sell-off remains high. Meanwhile, as reported by Finbold, pseudonymous analyst CrediBULL noted that for XRP to stage a recovery, it needs to establish a bottom in the $1.60 zone. At the same time, short positions have surged , with bears eyeing levels below the $2 mark. In addition to the bearish technical setup, XRP has also seen a spike in whale transactions. This comes as the asset potentially approaches a major regulatory milestone, with the legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nearing a conclusion.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization ‚Äì excluding Bitcoin ‚Äì has plunged to $950 billion, which reflects a 41% drop from its December 2024 peak of $1.6 trillion. This decline places current valuations even lower than levels seen throughout much of the August 2021 to April 2022 period, suggesting that investor sentiment has sharply deteriorated. Venture Capital Bailing on Crypto The report pointed to global economic headwinds, particularly the resurgence of tariffs and ongoing fiscal tightening, as key contributors to the market‚Äôs decline. These factors have amplified uncertainty and triggered a risk-off attitude across financial markets, which, in turn, has fresh capital inflows into crypto. Despite a modest quarter-over-quarter uptick in venture capital activity during Q1 2025, Coinbase observed that funding remains 50-60% below the heights of the 2021-22 bull cycle. This has especially hurt altcoin projects that rely on speculative inflows. Further adding to the bearish signals, both Bitcoin and the COIN50 index, which tracks the top 50 tokens by market cap, have broken below their respective 200-day moving averages (200DMA), often seen as a technical sign of a prolonged downtrend. As such, Coinbase‚Äôs global head of research, David Duong, believes that these converging indicators echo the onset of prior crypto winters and highlight the need for a ‚Äúdefensive stance.‚Äù While there is cautious optimism for stabilization in mid-to-late Q2 2025, the path to a broader recovery remains clouded by macroeconomic uncertainty and weak performance in traditional equity markets. ‚ÄúFor now, the challenges of the current macro environment require greater caution.‚Äù ‚ÄòNo Demand, No Rally‚Äô Ecoinometrics highlighted similar concerns from an institutional perspective, pointing to weak demand and tightening financial conditions, and the Fed showing no signs of a pivot. This, as per the crypto data platform, is in no way a bullish backdrop. ETF flows reflect this, with persistent outflows since late March and only occasional, modest inflows. Net flows over the past 30 days hover around zero. As such, short-term upside remains limited. This fragile backdrop could leave Bitcoin‚Äôs price vulnerable if market volatility returns.

Over the last few months, there has been an uptick in scams perpetrated in these regions, with the scammers majorly targeting elderly people. According to reports , the majority of the scams being carried out in local counties are related to jury duty and impersonation. These criminals, whom authorities, are yet to uncover, have been using fear and intimidation as a tactic to coerce people into sending funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets for missing jury duty. Most of the time, they forge arrest warrants from local law enforcement departments and send them to their unsuspecting victims, who carry out the instructions in the letter out of fear. Local Lancaster law enforcement reveals an increase in criminal activities According to data from the Lincoln Police Department and the Lancaster County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, since 2020, people in the area have lost millions to scammers as a result of these scams. The office mentioned that most of the people who had lost funds would likely never see it again. The local law enforcement added that since 2020, it had investigated up to 18 cases related to a form of crypto scam, noting that the scams have seen users lose as much as $156,000. LSO Chief Deputy Ben Houchin mentioned how hard it is for the victims. ‚ÄúIt is very sad. It‚Äôs hard to tell them and their reaction is, as you can imagine, devastation,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, the LPD mentioned that they have witnessed multiple victims lose over $1 million to these scammers in the last five years. The police department noted that the highest they have seen within that span is $1.5 million. LPD Sergeant Steve Wiese mentioned that the scammers use several sophisticated methods to carry out their operations. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to give them credit but they are very good at social engineering,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey can get you to start talking and give them information about you that they‚Äôll use later to manipulate you.‚Äù The local law enforcement added that big losses like these happen more frequently than most people think. He added that they fall into the fraud category in their yearly report, with officers from the department responding to about 2,300 calls every year. Crypto scams are on the rise as institutions call for regulations According to Wiese, there isn‚Äôt a notable difference in scam reports across several years, but the method used by the criminals does. He added that most of these scams range from the usual romance scams to ‚Äúhey we‚Äôve met before‚Äù messages on social media. Local law enforcement also added that most of these criminals try to stay in touch with their victims all the way, noting that most of them talk their victims through the process of taking out money and sending it to them. Meanwhile, banks around Lincoln have started picking up most of these signs and are moving to help users who may seem in distress or are being coerced to send money. ‚ÄúOur tellers are trained to look out for some red flags that occur. Some of that is paying attention to that transaction and what the member wants, but also paying attention to their attitude when they come in,‚Äù Angie Schreiner with Liberty First Credit Union said. While most times, the funds are gone, regulators mentioned that if the victims speak up on time, they may be able to do something to help them recover the funds. Meanwhile, institutions and local law enforcement have started urging regulators and lawmakers to do something about the menace that is crypto scams, especially via Bitcoin ATMs . According to reports, several counties have now seen an uptick in the number of crimes like these, with scammers always urging their victims to send money via Bitcoin and other gift cards.

According to the Jan3 CEO, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is yet to exhaust its upside trajectory after he analyzed how altcoin prices would stack up against Bitcoin if their supply were equal. Mow‚Äôs recent forecast for a rise in Bitcoin dominance comes as the ratio has already exceeded the levels that most crypto analysts expected it to reach by late 2024. As at November 2024, Bitcoin dominance dropped to 56%, pushing analysts to predict an altcoin rally, which would see more investments ahead of January 20. According to popular analyst Mikybull Crypto at the time, the market was officially in the altseason. Mow says unit bias is destroying the uninitiated According to his recent post on X, Mow mentioned that new traders are being swayed by the unit bias. ‚ÄúMost alts take advantage of unit bias by utilizing a very high supply, so people can‚Äôt figure out what they‚Äôre buying. ‚ÄòXRP is only $2 but Bitcoin is too expensive at $85,000!‚Äô. Unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated,‚Äù he said. Most alts take advantage of unit bias by utilizing a very high supply, so people can't figure out what they're buying. ""XRP is *only* $2 but Bitcoin is too expensive at $85,000!"" Unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated. #Bitcoin only. ‚Äî Samson Mow (@Excellion) April 19, 2025 In his post, Mow suggested that the unit bias, a psychological method in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually refer to a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size, often causes less experienced investors to feel like altcoins are cheaper and offer better value for money than owning a part of an asset like Bitcoin. He also questioned the value of altcoins on a level playing field. ‚ÄúYou can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000,‚Äù Mow said. He asked, ‚ÄúWhat happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equivalent of 1/21 million?‚Äù He added that according to their prices at the time of publication, Ethereum would be priced at $9,200, signifying a rise of 278,746%, XRP at $5,800, representing a rise of 470%, and Solana at $3,400, representing a rise of 2,327%. He added that there is no way that these altcoins are worth that much. Bitcoin dominance exceeds analysts‚Äô expectations The same sentiment was shared by anonymous Bitcoin proponent, Sunny Po, who said on January 12 that ‚ÄúUnit bias is a core foundational framework of the normie mind. ‚ÄòCheaper better.‚Äô‚Äù Mow added that most altcoins take advantage of this unit bias by implementing a high total supply so market participants can‚Äôt figure out what they are buying. According to Mow, based on his calculations, Bitcoin dominance is going to go much higher. Bitcoin dominance is a metric that is usually used to measure the total share of the crypto market capitalization. Some traders also use it to determine how close Bitcoin is to nearing a price peak. According to previous years, when Bitcoin dominance drops, it presents the perfect opportunity for altcoins to thrive, with analysts often predicting that capital will shift from Bitcoin into altcoins as traders seek higher returns. According to data from TradingView, Bitcoin dominance is presently sitting around 63%. Several analysts were expecting Bitcoin dominance to halt at 60% in 2024, as most of them expected the altcoin season to begin around that period. In August 2024, IntoTheCryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen mentioned that his target for the asset was around 60%. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is going back up to 70%, my target for Bitcoin dominance has been 60%,‚Äù Cowen said.

That's the message from a key volatility indicator called Bollinger Bandwidth. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands set at plus two and minus two standard deviations above and below the 20-period moving average (SMA) of an asset's market price. The bandwidth measures the space between these bands as a percentage of the 20-day moving average. In the case of XRP, the Bollinger bandwidth has narrowed to its lowest level since October 2024 on the 4-hour chart, where each candle represents price action for a four-hour period. The 4-hour chart interval is quite popular in the 24/7 crypto market, allowing traders to analyze and predict short-term price movements. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart mirrors the Bollinger bandwidth pattern in XRP. The long-held belief is that tighter Bollinger bandwidth, reflecting a quiet period in the market, is akin to a compressed spring ready for significant movement. During these calm phases, the market accumulates energy that is eventually released once a clear direction is established, often leading to dramatic rallies or sharp price declines/ Both XRP and bitcoin surged in November-December following an extended range-bound period that left their bandwidth at levels comparable to those observed today. That said, tighter bands do not always indicate a bullish volatility explosion; they can also foreshadow a sell-off. For example, the bands tightened in October 2022 , signaling a significant move ahead, which materialized on the downside after FTX went bust. It remains to be seen whether this latest spring compression will trigger bullish volatility or lead both tokens into a tailspin. The recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell and selling by some whales favor the latter.

Artificial Intelligence tokens like Bittensor, Render, and AI Companions were the top-performing major cryptocurrencies last week as they jumped by double digits. The top cryptocurrencies to watch this week will be Mantra ( OM ), Memecoin ( MEME ), and Pi Network ( PI ). Mantra Mantra is one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week after its plunge last week. The management blamed the crash on liquidations by one large exchange, while Arkham pointed to token sales by it insiders and investors. Mantra has rejected those claims and pledged to execute buybacks and token burns. The OM token has crashed from the year-to-date high of $9.5 to $0.5938, and has slowly formed a bearish pennant pattern. Therefore, while investors may be tempted to buy the dip, it is likely to continue falling, with the next point to watch being the psychological point at $0.50. Mantra price | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Trust in crypto shaken by Mantra collapse, but XRP ETF sparks institutional optimism, analysts say Memecoin Memecoin will be a top cryptocurrency to watch because of its recent performance and the upcoming unlocks. The memecoin will unlock tokens worth over $7.57 million, equivalent to 7.96% of the total in circulation. A token unlock often leads to a lower price as it dilutes existing holders. Memecoin price has done well in the past few days as it jumped from $0.001388 this month to a high of $0.002794. This rebound happened after it formed a large falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish sign. Memecoin has also jumped above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, while the uptrend may continue, there is a risk that the coin will drop ahead of the token unlock and possibly hit the 50-period moving average at $0.0018. Memecoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Pi Network Pi Network will also be in the spotlight as its performance continues to disappoint. The token was trading at $0.60 on Sunday, much lower than the all-time high of $3. A key reason for the plunge is the ongoing supply increase in the network. Data shows that over 1.58 billion tokens will come online in the next 12 months. The average monthly unlocks are 131 million, valued at over $82 million. Also, there are concerns about the concentration of Pi holdings. The developers noted that 65 billion tokens are allocated to community members, while 10 billion are reserved for the foundation, and 20 billion are allocated to the core team.

Bitcoin has surged past $100,000, and analysts are predicting a bull run for altcoins. With institutional interest growing and new technologies emerging, it‚Äôs clear that this year could be pivotal for cryptocurrency.

Qubetics is not just another crypto project; it‚Äôs a game-changer in the making. Let‚Äôs dive into why $TICS is the top crypto to buy for 2025. Hedera: A Missed Opportunity Looking back, Hedera was once hailed as a promising project. Its unique consensus algorithm and enterprise partnerships garnered attention.

At just $0.1729 per token, early adopters are positioning themselves for significant returns. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $1 after the presale, offering a 477% return on investment. Looking further ahead, some forecasts suggest a price of $5 post-mainnet launch, translating to a 2,789% ROI, and even $15 in the long term, equating to an 8,567% return. Real-Life Applications of Qubetics Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about technology; it‚Äôs about making life easier. Imagine a small business owner in the U.S. needing to pay a supplier in Europe.

The project has raised more than $6.9 million and attracted more than 8400 holders. While ETH is now eyeing $10,000 by 2025, early adopters of MUTM are hoping lightning strikes twice, and this time, they‚Äôre ready. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates with Strategic Growth Mutuum Finance is gaining traction as investor demand drives the ongoing Phase 4 presale. With a token price now at $0.025, early investors are boarding before a predicted 20% rise in Phase 5, to $0.03. With predictions of a market listing price at $0.06, strategic investors have the potential to make up to 140% in potential gains on the strength of the platform‚Äôs solid tokenomics and future utility. Thus far, Mutuum Finance has attracted over 8,400 investors and raised more than $6.9 million, indicating high faith in its decentralized lending-sustainable financial mechanics combined model. Sustained Value Through Buy-and-Distribute Innovation One of the particularly compelling long-term features of Mutuum is its Buy-and-Distribute feature. This operation continuously purchases tokens in the market and distributes them to stakers, stimulating steady demand as well as community incentives. In a market notorious for speculation and volatility, this consistent approach instills a welcome touch of order and longevity. To enhance retention of users, the group also announced a freshly constructed dashboard with a top 50 holder leaderboard, the owners of which will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. The game-like tactic encourages retention and strengthens the community base. CertiK Audit Underway to Ensure Maximum Security In a move to drive security and transparency, Mutuum Finance is currently being smart contract audited by CertiK, a leading-blockchain security firm. The outcome of the audit will be posted on Mutuum‚Äôs official social media platforms, highlighting the platform‚Äôs commitment to safeguarding its users. Progressive Tech with mtToken Yield System Mutuum‚Äôs innovation is its mtToken technology through which users can earn passive yield as they tokenize ETH, DAI, and other assets into interest-bearing mtTokens. Those assets remain fully accessible, but liquid, providing an attractive choice for today‚Äôs DeFi users. For borrowers, it provides loans such as $5,000 USDT backed by $7,000 worth of ETH collateral. The digital loan-to-collateral ratio is secure and effective, providing the user with a seamless experience backed by open risk management. A Reliable Alternative in a Volatile Market Unlike a lot of the short-term hype-tokens, Mutuum Finance is building a stable foundation for long-term growth. With its Phase 4 presale winding down to conclusion, the $0.025 level presents a last window of entry opportunity for investors before the next price explosion. Analysts forecast appreciation, with some expecting MUTM to reach significantly higher levels as the project reaches maturity. For forward-thinking DeFi investors, Mutuum Finance provides a unique blend of innovation and reliability. Over $6.9 million raised and 8,400+ early investors have already staked their claim, treating MUTM at $0.025 the way visionaries once viewed ETH under $10. The next phase brings a 20% price jump, before it even hits the open market. While the presale clock ticks down, history may be repeating itself. Secure your position before Phase 5 begins.

43574439,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/bitcoin-price-analysis-quiet-easter-weekend-for-btc,1745153692,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/43574439.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Quiet Easter Weekend For BTC,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/bitcoin-price-analysis-quiet-easter-weekend-for-btc,"Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) price action remained muted as the flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal decline, slipping below $85,000. Bitcoin whales are accumulating BTC at 3x of the daily mined supply. However, this has not led to a price breakout, with BTC facing multiple rejections around the $86,000 level. With markets relatively calm over the Easter weekend, analysts are wondering if the growing pace of accumulation could trigger the next breakout. Whales Accumulating Bitcoin Large institutional investors are purchasing Bitcoin at record levels, leading analysts to speculate the flagship cryptocurrency is on the verge of a price breakout. Market data indicates large holders are acquiring three times the daily BTC mined, with the price at a key level. Data from Glassnode reveals that investors with 100 to 1000 BTC are purchasing the cryptocurrency aggressively. Crypto exchanges are also witnessing a steady outflow of Bitcoin. This means that Bitcoin whales are putting their holdings into long-term storage instead of leaving them in their exchange wallets. Market watchers believe this BTC exodus is a sign of growing confidence in the asset. Bitcoin‚Äôs Mainstream Era Has Begun Bitwise Asset Management believes a monumental shift is underway in the crypto landscape. The firm‚Äôs newly released Corporate Bitcoin Adoption report for Q1 2025 has indicated growing institutional interest. The report reveals that public companies held 688,000 BTC in the first quarter, a 16.11% increase over the previous quarter and accounting for 3.28% of BTC‚Äôs 21 million supply. The total value of these holdings has also spiked, rising to $57 billion, while the number of companies holding BTC on their balance sheets grew to 79. A total of 95,431 BTC was purchased in Q1, making it the largest single-quarter acquisition of the asset to date. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley stated, ‚ÄúBy the end of 2025, people are going to be surprised by how many famous tradfi institutions have crypto products and offerings. The work is underway. The mainstream era has started.‚Äù The growth and mainstream adoption coincide with favorable regulatory developments. Recently, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board‚Äôs decision to allow Bitcoin to be reported at fair value has enabled more transparent accounting, reducing risk for public firms. As a result, several firms have jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon. GameStop is raising $1.5 billion to purchase Bitcoin, while Semler Scientific has also added the asset to the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet has also announced plans to acquire 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. The surge in interest suggests a maturing market poised for long-term integration. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan stated, ‚ÄúWe are no longer entitled to an ‚Äòalt season.‚Äô That concept arose in an era when the primary value of crypto was speculative. We‚Äôve entered into the fundamental era of crypto, which means more dispersion in individual asset returns.‚Äù UK Firm Purchases $250M Bitcoin Crypto investors, whales, and institutions are increasing their Bitcoin holdings ahead of Easter after analysts predicted a quiet weekend with less volatility after weeks of uncertainty driven by escalating trade concerns. A wallet linked to London-based investment firm Abraxas Capital bought 2,949 BTC , worth over $250 million over the four days leading up to the Easter weekend. The latest transaction saw the firm purchase over $45 million worth of Bitcoin from Binance, according to crypto intelligence firm LookOnChain. The purchase comes shortly after Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy announced the purchase of $285 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $82,618 per BTC . Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Despite the continuous accumulation by Bitcoin whales, analysts are hoping for a quiet Easter weekend for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, volatility concerns were raised due to significant movements from the medium-term Bitcoin cohort, which holds coins for an average of three to six months. According to CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet, over 170,000 BTC have entered circulation from the medium-term cohort. The analyst stated, ‚ÄúThe effect of this metric on LTF moves is overstated as large on-chain movement of coins hardly ever affects weekend price action since it‚Äôs not on liquid markets or CEX markets. It is important to note that funding rates remain relatively flat currently. Moreover, US markets are closed as we have a long weekend for Easter, so volatility could be suppressed, barring headlines from the White House.‚Äù However, Marcin Kazmierczak, Chief Operating Officer of RedStone Oracles, believes recent BTC movements could be operational transfers and don‚Äôt suggest immediate selling pressure. BTC faces considerable resistance around the $86,000 mark, having been rejected several times. Despite the resistance at this level, the market has not faced a significant pullback, with the price holding firm above $80,000. However, the sideways price movement suggests strong investor uncertainty. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto provided insight into BTC‚Äôs current price action, identifying three barriers preventing a breakout. The first is a downward trend line formed by BTC‚Äôs consistent lower lows and lower highs as a marketwide correction took hold. Bitcoin bulls must break above this resistance to establish a reversal. Other crucial indicators are the 200-day EMA and the 200-day SMA. Despite BTC‚Äôs struggles to cross $85,000 - $86,000, the ultimate resistance sits at the $90,000-$91,000 price range, a level that served as key support during the bull cycle. If BTC can reclaim this level, it will return to the bullish trading zone. BTC registered considerable volatility towards the end of the previous week, rising over 8% on Wednesday to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,600. It lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 4% to $79,592, but reclaimed $80,000 on Friday after an increase of nearly 5% and settled at $83,370. Buyers retained control on Saturday, with the price registering a rise of 2.41% to $85,378. However, price action turned bearish on Sunday as BTC fell almost 2% to $83,776. The price was back in positive territory on Monday, rising 1.01% to $84,619. BTC raced to an intraday high of $86,533 but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.08% to $83,701. Source: TradingView Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $84,031. The price continued to push higher on Thursday, rising 1.11% to $84,962. Price action remained muted on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline before increasing 0.61% on Saturday to reclaim $85,000 and settle at $85,033. The current session sees BTC down almost 1% and trading at $84,349. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It‚Äôs a signal. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice and central bank are rolling out a crypto trading pilot, backed by one of the world‚Äôs top exchanges. Bybit isn‚Äôt just supporting the move‚Äîthey‚Äôre enabling it, offering the tech stack and compliance safety net to make it work. The news of this collaboration comes after a recent meetup between Bybit‚Äôs CEO and Vietnam‚Äôs Ministry of Finance. The goal of the meeting was to establish a comprehensive legal framework for crypto assets, with Minister Nguyen Van Thang outlining the government‚Äôs plan to launch a pilot sandbox mechanism that will allow regulators to test the issuance of crypto assets within a controlled environment. This is yet another sign of the world waking up to crypto and trying to find common ground to introduce meaningful regulation that safeguards consumer interests. It could help prevent people from becoming overwhelmed by the prospect of cryptocurrency investment‚Äîmaking the decision of finding the best crypto to buy now more important than ever. Robust Compliance Frameworks will Prevent Crypto-Driven Illicit Activities - Vietnam‚Äôs Finance Ministry The primary focus of the meetup was to establish regulatory frameworks aimed at curbing illicit crypto-related activities by creating a comprehensive legal structure for crypto assets. The members discussed the importance of implementing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols. Bybit‚Äôs CEO, Ben Zhou, approached the topic with a measured and responsible stance. He noted that Vietnam‚Äôs forward-thinking regulatory sandboxes are a critical step toward unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology. He assured that Bybit will remain fully aligned with the government‚Äôs focus on investor protection and financial integrity. This readiness to collaborate with authorities shows that many centralized players are willing to play by the rules in an effort to push crypto in a more progressive direction. Best Crypto to Buy Now ‚Äì Top 4 List As global crypto adoption accelerates, certain tokens are emerging as key players in shaping the future of finance. With Bybit backing Vietnam‚Äôs crypto trading pilot, the momentum is undeniable. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now, these tokens could be top contenders to consider. Best Wallet Token As Vietnam launches its first regulated crypto trading pilot with Bybit‚Äôs backing, user-friendly tools are no longer a luxury‚Äîthey‚Äôre a necessity. Best Wallet rises to meet this moment, offering a secure, multi-chain wallet designed for seamless access to digital assets. In a market opening its doors to the masses, Best Wallet makes crypto simple, smart, and ready for everyday use. Best Wallet Token is the native crypto of Best Wallet, which is a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with support for more than 60 blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others.

Its native BEST token aims to reward users immediately, with rewards such as lowered transaction costs, increased staking rewards, and exclusive access to future-looking crypto projects. When Vietnam's residents start venturing into regulated cryptocurrency markets, rewarding platforms like Best Wallet will ensure a connection between newcomers and savvy users. What makes Best Wallet stand out in this moment is its commitment to accessibility. With plans to launch the Best Card‚Äîa crypto debit card enabling real-world spending‚Äîthe platform aligns perfectly with Vietnam‚Äôs push for everyday crypto utility. In a nation on the verge of regulated digital finance, wallets like Best Wallet won‚Äôt just store assets‚Äîthey‚Äôll define how everyday users experience them. Vietnam‚Äôs future with crypto is taking shape, and Best Wallet offers the freedom, flexibility, and control required from day one. Solaxy Vietnam's decision to launch a crypto trading pilot with Bybit‚Äôs technical and risk management backing signals a bold move toward regulated, large-scale crypto adoption. But with such a leap comes a demand for infrastructure that can keep up with ambition, something that Solaxy tries to accomplish for the Solana blockchain. Solaxy (SOLX) , Solana‚Äôs Layer-2 scaling solution, is engineered to solve one of blockchain‚Äôs biggest bottlenecks: congestion. By processing transactions off-chain and batching them before final settlement on Solana‚Äôs mainnet, Solaxy dramatically increases throughput and reduces fees. Backed by over $30 million raised in presale funding, Solaxy has captured attention as a platform built for real-world performance. Its SOLX token powers transactions, governance, and staking across the ecosystem. As Vietnam moves from experimentation to execution, blockchain solutions like Solaxy provide the horsepower to meet institutional and retail demand alike. The $SOLX spaceship is picking up speed! üõ∏ü™ê30M Raised! üî•üî• pic.twitter.com/qvrYUwt2Sy ‚Äî SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 14, 2025 Where Bitcoin laid the foundation and Bybit supports the framework, Solaxy ensures the rails are fast, efficient, and unbreakable. As the market grows, so does the pressure to perform‚Äîand Solaxy is built to thrive in the heat. XRP Vietnam‚Äôs latest step toward crypto regulation‚Äîlaunching a government-supported trading pilot with Bybit‚Äôs backing‚Äîsignals a shift from gray zones to green lights. XRP could shine as a battle-tested, compliance-ready digital asset in this progressive regulatory environment. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, XRP doesn‚Äôt rely on energy-intensive mining. It was built for speed, efficiency, and real-world integration‚Äîtraits that speak directly to Vietnam‚Äôs regulatory goals. It‚Äôs a token engineered not just for speculation, but for systems. Through RippleNet, XRP has facilitated cross-border payments with banks and financial institutions in regions like Asia and the Middle East. This network-first, utility-focused model aligns with Vietnam‚Äôs ambitions: real adoption, minimized risk, and maximum reach. Its consensus protocol enables near-instant settlements at ultra-low costs‚Äîqualities that address the retail and institutional pressure points likely to arise during Vietnam‚Äôs national rollout. XRP doesn‚Äôt just fit into regulated frameworks‚Äîit elevates them. In a space where governments seek security without sacrificing speed, XRP becomes not just viable, but vital. BTC Bull As Vietnam embarks on its crypto trading pilot with Bybit's technical support, a wave of new investors could emerge‚Äîmany of whom may be looking for more accessible assets. In this context, BTC Bull ‚Äîa token designed to follow Bitcoin‚Äôs movements through its unique brand of memetic approach‚Äîcould gain significant traction. BTC Bull tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs price, triggering token burns and Bitcoin airdrops when BTC reaches specific price targets. This mechanism ensures that Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum directly influences BTC Bull‚Äôs value, while also fostering a community that could help drive BTC‚Äôs price even higher. This type of symbiotic relationship between two assets makes BTC Bull one of the best cryptos to buy this year. It‚Äôs not flying under the radar either. BTC Bull has already landed on major crypto analysts' views, including top-tier YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins ‚Äîwhich indicates BTC Bull is generating a buzz across the wider cryptocurrency space. Conclusion Vietnam‚Äôs crypto pilot isn‚Äôt just a regulatory move‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint for the future of digital finance in the country. When governments, tech giants, and communities align, something bigger begins to stir: trust. And with trust comes acceleration. This isn‚Äôt a moment to watch from the sidelines. It‚Äôs a moment to lean in. Because as crypto becomes infrastructure and innovation outpaces regulation, the real question isn‚Äôt if the market will grow‚Äîit‚Äôs who‚Äôs already building what comes next. Those searching for the best crypto to buy now should start paying close attention to these regulatory signals. As cryptocurrencies gain more exposure through formal regulation, new buyers are likely to enter the space‚Äîpotentially triggering a major price rally, provided that market conditions remain favorable.

Christopher Perkins, president of blockchain investment firm CoinFund, labeled the BIS‚Äôs recommendations as ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúuninformed,‚Äù warning that they could backfire on the global financial system.

Perkins countered that DeFi actually offers improvements over traditional finance, including greater transparency and reduced reliance on centralized intermediaries. Addressing the BIS‚Äôs discomfort with anonymous DeFi development, Perkins argued that many TradFi institutions don‚Äôt publish their developer lists either. ‚ÄúSure, public companies provide a degree of disclosure and transparency, but they seem to be dying off in favor of private markets,‚Äù he said. He also took issue with the BIS‚Äôs warnings about stablecoins potentially undermining monetary policy in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe. ‚ÄúIf there is demand for USD stablecoins and it helps improve the condition of anyone in the developing world, perhaps that is a good thing,‚Äù Perkins noted. Perkins wasn‚Äôt alone in his criticism.

The meme coin has experienced regular trading activity throughout while exhibiting zero price actions over recent days. Related Reading: Today‚Äôs $1K XRP Bag May Become Tomorrow‚Äôs Jackpot, Crypto Founder Says Major Holders Hodl Most Of SHIB Tokens According to blockchain tracking site IntoTheBlock, around 74% of Shiba Inu‚Äôs 95 billion circulating tokens are in whale-like large addresses. The concentration is high and puts the token‚Äôs ecosystem into the hands of few wealth investors. Concentration among large holders sends contradictory signals to the market: some analysts interpret it as a confidence vote for SHIB‚Äôs future, while others see it as a double-edged sword that creates an unstable environment wherein the big players would set off cataclysmic price fluctuations should they wish to liquidate their assets. Weekly Transaction Volume Exceeds $120 Million In the same tracking metrics, there have been large trades covering over $120 million with respect to SHIB within the last week (each trade being above $100,000). This substantial trading volume comes despite minimal price action, with the meme crypto having a current price tag of $0.00001226 and showing less than 1% daily change. The volume of transactions provides a glimpse into institutional and whale-scale activity on the platform, a market analyst disclosed. The ongoing high-value transactions indicate sustained interest among large investors, despite the price staying flat. Retail Traders Confronted With Reassurance And Risk The large holding of SHIB tokens by rich investors is a mixed picture for small investors. On the positive side, the investment from such huge investors could assuage retail investors regarding the token‚Äôs stability and long-term worth. But this configuration also creates substantial risk. Any abrupt change of position by these large holders can bring on rapid and steep price action. Market watchers point out that when the ownership is so concentrated, even normal portfolio rebalancing by a handful of large holders can make a huge market disturbance. Crypto Market Watches Whale Behavior For Price Signals Since whale activity usually precedes significant market action, it is closely monitored by the crypto community. With over 70% of the SHIB supply in the hands of moneyed investors and $120 million in recent high transactions, many are keeping tabs for reversals in sentiment from such powerful hands. Related Reading: Whales Swallowing Bitcoin Fast ‚Äî Will This Push BTC Price Up? The current context of SHIB truly depicts a classic case of where a few well-to-do investors can significantly impact price action in cryptocurrency markets. In these circumstances, the very high transaction volumes reflect true interest among institutional investors, while the extreme concentration of holdings must certainly remain a foremost consideration in the assessment of any market dynamics concerning SHIB.

Cardozo added that institutional investment from firms such as Strategy and Tether could speed up Bitcoin‚Äôs traditional four-year halving cycle. He added: ‚ÄúFor the 2024 halving in May, that puts the bottom around Q3 this year and a peak mid-2026, but I think we might see things move it a bit sooner because the market‚Äôs more mature now with more liquidity.‚Äù However, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory remains tied to broader monetary policy, the analyst added. He said a US Federal Reserve rate cut in May or June may ‚Äúpump more money into the system and push Bitcoin up faster.‚Äù The halving is a built-in feature of the Bitcoin network that assures Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity , which is considered one of BTC‚Äôs defining monetary characteristics.

Continued institutional buying, including by Bitcoin ETFs, paired with Bitcoin‚Äôs rising scarcity, may accelerate Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to new highs, he told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúWith growing scarcity triggered by the halving, Bitcoin will likely retest its all-time high if it breaches the $90,000 mark in the coming weeks,‚Äù Usi Zade said. ‚ÄúWhile the halving offers a good basis for growth based on demand and scarcity, the timeline for impact on price can vary over time.‚Äù He noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs growth remains closely tied to traditional financial markets and investor sentiment.

ADA & ETH Price Declines Have Long-Term Holder Buying The Dip,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/blockdag-attracts-millions-with-an-insane-600-bonus-ada-eth-price-declines-have-long-term-holder-buying-the-dip,"It‚Äôs been a rough week for some. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) haven‚Äôt exactly been having a winning streak. The recent Ethereum price decline pushed ETH under $1,560, rattling short-term traders while long-term holders quietly added to their positions. Cardano hasn‚Äôt fared much better, as the ongoing price drop has pulled it dangerously close to the $0.60 level. Yet, while the market leans cautious on these two giants, one presale project is grabbing fresh interest. BlockDAG (BDAG) has become the talk of the week thanks to its BDAG1200 ‚Äìa golden ticket offer‚Äìgranting a massive 600‚ÄØ% bonus and early access to airdropped coins. For many, it‚Äôs already being counted among the best performing crypto today‚Äîespecially when compared to tokens still stuck in red. Ethereum Price Decline Squeezes Bulls at $1,550 The Ethereum (ETH) price decline has dominated chatrooms this week as ETH slides beneath familiar resistance. Traders watched an early slip under $1,600, then a fresh Ethereum price decline cracked the $1,560 intraday floor. Bears now mark $1,535 as the level that might invite a deeper Ethereum price decline toward $1,500. Short‚Äëterm charts show lower highs and a narrow range, hinting that any relief rally will likely stall until ETH reclaims $1,600. Some long‚Äëterm holders quietly add to bags during each Ethereum price decline, convinced that network fees and staking rewards still underpin value even during choppy weeks. Cardano Price Drop Tests The $0.60 Safety Net The Cardano (ADA) price drop extended into a fourth straight session, dragging ADA toward the closely watched $0.60 support. Wednesday opened with yet another Cardano price drop, shaving roughly 5‚ÄØ% off intraday quotes and matching the broader market‚Äôs red candlesticks. Traders eye the $0.60 level as the line between a routine pullback and a slide that forces capitulation. Volume has thinned compared with April‚Äôs rallies, yet each ADA price drop still attracts steady bids from wallets tracking long‚Äëterm staking yields. Bulls argue that oversold signals on daily oscillators could spark a bounce once macro jitters fade, though moving‚Äëaverage resistance around $0.70 remains stubborn. BDAG1200 Golden Ticket: BlockDAG‚Äôs 600% Bonus BlockDAG (BDAG) just sweetened its presale by handing newcomers a golden ticket promo code, BDAG1200. Entering the code multiplies any purchase by six, turning a routine buy into a 600 % bonus stack. At the current price of $0.0248, a $2,500 order that would normally lock in about 100,800 BDAG but balloons to roughly 705,600 BDAG with the new code. Valued at $17,500 on day one from a modest $2,500 buy. Those coins also qualify for an early airdrop, landing in fresh wallets before the wider public and even before the presale window closes‚Äîthough only first‚Äëtime registrants can claim the perk. Demand is evident: funds raised now exceed $215 million, showing 19.2 billion coins spoken for, and early participants enjoy a 2,380 % ROI in batch 27. Fans keep running the math; if BDAG reaches $30 by 2030, today‚Äôs $2,500 ticket could swell beyond $21 million. Extra news lands next week, with updates on testnet results, mainnet timing, and expansion plans. BlockDAG has also confirmed its first in‚Äëperson convention tour, aiming to bring workshops, demos, and meet‚Äëups to multiple cities. Altogether, the BDAG1200 offer adds fresh urgency for anyone seeking exposure to what many already call the best performing crypto today . Traders Are Weighing Risk & Reward The Ethereum price decline wrestles with $1,535 and Cardano price drop clings to its $0.60 support, putting short-term sentiment under pressure, but not everyone is retreating. Some traders are simply adjusting course‚Äîlooking past short-term dips and toward projects showing clearer upside. BlockDAG is currently leading that narrative. Its BDAG1200 offer has flipped interest from cautious to committed, especially with the early airdrop and 600‚ÄØ% bonus exclusively for new users. Compared to coins in a dip, BlockDAG is now seen by many as the best performing crypto today. Those still on the fence may want to pay attention‚Äîvalue often starts where others hesitate to look.

This blockchain-AI integration platform is proving that innovation and real world utility can coexist and deliver value to stakeholders. Ruvi AI stands out with its superapp that uses artificial intelligence to provide functional tools that simplify and enhance business processes. By automating workflows and optimising operations Ruvi AI is giving businesses, developers and creators tangible solutions to real world problems. Unlike other projects that are all concept and no substance Ruvi AI is focused on applied technology. At the heart of the ecosystem is the $RUVI token which powers the platform. Available during the presale for just $0.01 per token it‚Äôs a very accessible entry point for investors. The confirmed listing price of $0.07 per token provides an obvious path to immediate gains and predictions of a valuation up to $1 per token means long term growth that few other projects can match. Presale is a Huge Success Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale has already proven its potential. Within days of launch over 10 million tokens were sold, raising $100,000 and making Ruvi AI one of the most talked about blockchain projects among analysts and investors. Unlike other presales Ruvi AI incentivises participation further with unique rewards for early backers, with tiered benefits that amplify investment returns. VIP Tier 5 has caught everyone‚Äôs attention with the most value. Investors who commit $10,000 get 1,000,000 RUVI tokens at the presale price and the reward structure includes a 100% bonus. This means participants get an additional 1,000,000 tokens, for a total of 2,000,000 tokens. With the listing price at $0.07 per token this investment is worth $140,000, a 1,400% return on investment. If the token reaches $1 it would be worth $2,000,000, a 18,900% ROI. These numbers are why Ruvi AI is being called the most lucrative investment opportunity in the blockchain space. Incentives for Top Contributors Ruvi AI‚Äôs leaderboard rewards program adds another layer of attraction. Investors who are in the top 10 contributors during the presale will get an additional 500,000 RUVI tokens each, which would be worth $500,000 if the $1 valuation is reached. The tiers go all the way down to the top 50 and top 1,000 so rewards are distributed to all early supporters. A Smart Choice for Investors Tron‚Äôs global settlement network shows the vision of the ecosystem and TRX‚Äôs price increase shows the market is behind it. But long term success is often about tangible results and that‚Äôs yet to be seen. Ruvi AI on the other hand offers immediate innovation and financial opportunity. Its practical application of blockchain and AI and unmatched investor incentives makes it stand out in the tech landscape. With a low entry price of $0.01, confirmed listing of $0.07 and a $1 valuation on the horizon Ruvi AI has a clear path from speculation to profitability. For investors looking for high return opportunities backed by utility and forward thinking innovation Ruvi AI is the clear choice. Timing is everything in investment and acting early on Ruvi AI could mean extraordinary results that will make traditional options and even competitors like Tron seem tame in comparison.

This positions Sonic as a pioneer in cross-chain solutions, addressing interoperability challenges that have long plagued the blockchain industry. ‚Äã Cardano: Strengthening Community and Technological Growth Cardano continues to make significant strides in the blockchain space, focusing on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. The platform‚Äôs commitment to peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methods has fostered a strong and growing community. Recent upgrades have enhanced Cardano‚Äôs smart contract capabilities, enabling more complex and diverse decentralized applications. These developments position Cardano as a leading platform for building decentralized solutions with a focus on security and scalability.‚Äã Understanding Interoperability in Blockchain Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange information seamlessly. This capability is crucial for the growth and adoption of decentralized technologies, as it allows for the transfer of assets and data across disparate platforms. Effective interoperability solutions enable developers to build applications that leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains, creating more robust and versatile decentralized solutions.‚Äã Key Aspects of Blockchain Interoperability: Cross-Chain Communication: Facilitates the exchange of data and assets between different blockchain networks.‚Äã Shared Security Models: Ensures that assets and data remain secure during cross-chain transactions.‚Äã Scalability Solutions: Enhances the capacity of blockchain networks to handle increased transaction volumes.‚Äã The Crypto Updates Standardized Protocols: Establishes common frameworks that different blockchains can adopt for seamless interaction.‚Äã Understanding these aspects is essential for businesses, professionals, and individuals looking to navigate the evolving blockchain landscape effectively.‚Äã Conclusion In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about emerging projects and technological advancements is crucial.

According to Ripple Pundit, legal proceedings have been temporarily paused for 60 days , a development that allows the SEC additional time to produce a critical report. While this move does not signify a resolution, it marks a notable pause in active litigation and offers a window for progress toward a settlement. The pause appears to have had a favorable impact on market sentiment surrounding XRP. Ripple Pundit notes that the asset has appreciated by 13% over the past week. He links this increase not only to the temporary easing of legal pressure but also to Ripple‚Äôs ongoing business activities, including new strategic alignments. As the legal situation remains in flux, Ripple is simultaneously moving ahead with its business agenda, particularly focusing on institutional collaborations in the U.S. banking sector. Ripple‚Äôs Corporate Activity and Institutional Expansion Ripple Pundit says this legal hiatus has opened Ripple to active expansion. He points to the company‚Äôs acquisition of Hidden Road , a prime brokerage, clearing, and financing company, as a catalyst for increased transaction volumes on the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to the commentator, this acquisition could have a material effect on network activity and utility. Additionally, Ripple is engaging in further strategic partnerships, including a recent association with Chipper Cash, a financial technology firm with growing influence in African markets. These moves suggest that Ripple focuses on broadening the use case for XRP despite the unresolved legal backdrop. While the SEC‚Äôs final decision remains a key variable, Ripple appears to capitalize on the current pause to strengthen its infrastructure and global presence. Ripple Pundit also states that forward movement on any potential settlement will require the endorsement of SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Price Movements and Market Indicators At the time of Ripple Pundit‚Äôs analysis, XRP was trading at $2.10. He observed that the asset showed signs of consolidation, with technical indicators offering mixed signals. Specifically, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows the potential for bullish momentum, although overall buying pressure remains neutral. Ripple Pundit identifies $2.20 as a key resistance level, suggesting that a break above it could lead to further upward movement. Conversely, a decline below $2.00 may expose the asset to increased bearish sentiment. As of press time, updated data from CoinMarketCap places XRP‚Äôs price at $2.07, reflecting a slight decline of 0.74%. This movement underscores the continued volatility and uncertainty in XRP‚Äôs near-term outlook. Despite positive developments on the corporate side, market participants remain cautious as the legal narrative has not yet reached a definitive conclusion.

43578045,https://nulltx.com/?p=148136,1745160560,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin‚Äôs Resilience Amid Macro Uncertainty: Has the Bottom Been Reached?,https://nulltx.com/bitcoins-resilience-amid-macro-uncertainty-has-the-bottom-been-reached/,"In an era of macroeconomic uncertainty and tightening liquidity, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to surprise many with its performance. Concerns regarding inflation and the global economic state, as well as a Federal Reserve that is still sending mixed signals and in much expected ‚Äúwait and watch‚Äù mode, have done little to keep BTC down. In fact, it has punched through all-time-high levels to sit right now at a price above $84,000 and a market cap well above $1.5 trillion. The big question now is whether this ascent can continue. Key Indicators Pointing to Bitcoin‚Äôs Bottoming Out Sjuul presents a data-based viewpoint, detailing why the present price movement of Bitcoin might signal the conclusion of its bearish cycle. Here are the main points he makes: 1. Actualized capital losses reach record highs. A crucial indicator of market sentiment is the Realized Cap‚Äîa metric that accounts for the value of Bitcoin at the price it was last moved. When Bitcoin is traded at a loss, the Realized Cap shows how much of the market is currently underwater. Recently, Bitcoin‚Äôs Realized Cap in loss reached an all-time high (ATH) of $410 billion. According to Sjuul, this is significant because it reflects a broad swath of investors who are sitting at a loss, particularly those who bought BTC after its peak in November. Historically, when this metric hits new highs, it signifies the point at which most investors become unwilling to sell at a loss, often marking the capitulation phase. 2. Short-Term Holder (STH) Losses Reflect the Levels of FTX Mishap Another indicator pointing toward Bitcoin‚Äôs potential bottoming out is the state of Short-Term Holders (STH). Typically, these holders have acquired Bitcoin within the past six months. They often capitulate during the formation of a market bottom. Currently, the unrealized losses for these short-term holders have reached levels that are comparable to those seen during the FTX crash. In fact, after looking at charts of unrealized losses, it seems clear that during the crash of August 2024, unrealized losses among STHs were lower than what we are seeing now. When short-term holders are forced to sell at a loss, it often signals that the bottom is in and the price is about to go back up. 3. The Slowdown of Retail Selling Even though Bitcoin has declined from its peak of $109,000 to its current price of $84,000, retail investors are not leading the charge in selling. According to data from CryptoQuant, our smaller investors‚Äîthat‚Äôs the term they use‚Äîare often referred to as shrimps. These are investors who hold less than 1 Bitcoin. They have been our primary sellers. In fact, on average, these shrimps have been selling about 480 Bitcoin daily. They haven‚Äôt been just holding; they have been selling. Meanwhile, our whales‚Äîinvestors holding over 1,000 Bitcoin‚Äîhave only been selling around 70 Bitcoin per day. This disparity suggests that retail investors are leading the market to a possible capitulation point. 4. Coinbase Premium is Recovering. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has witnessed the revival of its Bitcoin premium after it bottomed out in February. The premium is the price difference of Bitcoin traded on Coinbase versus other exchanges. When the premium starts to rise, it is often seen as a sign that institutional investors are returning to the cryptocurrency market and that demand is rising. This recovery is also reminiscent of a similar pattern seen in Q3 2024 when Bitcoin began to move upward after hitting a bottom. We are also seeing fairly steady inflows into Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which also can only serve to increase demand for the asset. 5. Whales Are Accumulating Aggressively Right now, a select number of individuals are amassing vast amounts of supply. Indeed, a current on-chain analysis demonstrates that these individuals have been purchasing and stashing their assets at an aggressive rate. Maybe the clearest sign of a potential bottom is the behavior of whales, large investors who hold massive amounts of Bitcoin. Smart money typically sells at the top and buys at the bottom. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs price fell under $85,000, though, these large players have been on the buying side, accumulating aggressively. In just the past six weeks, they have picked up 100,000 BTC, worth a staggering $8.45 billion. Such accumulation‚Äîobviously a sign of confidence on the part of the buyers‚Äîis a sign not just of potential bottoming behavior but also of a likely uptrend in the relatively near future. The Macro uncertainty is at its highest level. Liquidity is getting drained from the economy, and the FED is still in wait and watch mode. Yet, BTC is trading above $84,000 and outperforming global assets. Here's why I think BTC has bottomed out. A thread: pic.twitter.com/K0ake2abYq ‚Äî Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) April 18, 2025 Conclusion: A Gradual Climb Ahead All these pointers together seem to convey that Bitcoin has possibly already reached its nadir or is almost there. Even though the price of Bitcoin may not explode to reach $100,000 next week, the market is presenting a nature of rising back toward a bullish condition again. If the price does break above what seems to be a commanding stuck price point of $100,000, there is a consensus that altcoins will also start rising again back toward their all-time highs. Currently, the indications seem to favor those who think that Bitcoin‚Äôs bear market has ended. The next few months should see us move toward a recovery. However, it looks like the recovery may be slow and will likely be punctuated by some volatility. Like always, we need to keep an eye on the overall economy, as these big trends shape the crypto space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) pullback might appear minor in the broader scheme, deeper market signals hint at something more complex brewing beneath the surface, possibly the onset of a new crypto winter.

43578163,https://nulltx.com/?p=148131,1745160779,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$FUR Faces Price Struggles Amid Market Shift: Hype Isn‚Äôt Enough Without Smart Money Support,https://nulltx.com/fur-faces-price-struggles-amid-market-shift-hype-isnt-enough-without-smart-money-support/,"Cryptocurrency price movements can be as turbulent as the assets themselves. One token that has recently peaked the interest of traders is $FUR, which has witnessed a hefty drop after a big run-up. And this is despite all of the notable price action ($FUR went up quite dramatically before coming down just as quickly). The real reasons for this sort of price action are obviously not clear, but the usual suspects‚Äîsocial media hype, dished out with a side of FOMO, seems to be driving the $FUR train for now. FUR‚Äôs recent performance exemplifies an important lesson in the crypto space: hype alone cannot sustain a token‚Äôs price. The coin, which has seen a sharp drop after its earlier surge, now faces a challenging road ahead. On the price chart, a bearish engulfing pattern points to the possibility of a reversal while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently indicates that the asset is oversold. This shows that a rebound could be on the horizon. However, while these two indicators present a somewhat favorable situation looking forward, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is still bearish and hints that the downward momentum might not be over just yet. Even with apparent technical signs, the falling price of $FUR highlights a grim reality: the cryptocurrency market is now largely influenced by the same big players and social media forces that dominate the stock market. The $FUR situation underscores this crucial point: Market moves are really made by large, well-informed, and well-capitalized players ‚Äî what some call ‚Äúsmart money.‚Äù Without the involvement of these ‚Äúbig boys,‚Äù¬†market moves that are supposedly driven by social media hype or Twitter FOMO can go only so far. The Power of Hype Versus the Impact of Smart Money $FUR has become a hot topic on Crypto Twitter in the past few months, with many users now sporting the token‚Äôs logo as their profile picture. This was all supposed to lead into a price rally for $FUR, given that we have seen similar situations play out where a social media event pushes the price of a cryptocurrency up. But here we are, a few weeks past the peak of the $FUR hype cycle, and not only is the price down, but $FUR also seems to be in a bit of free fall. This isn‚Äôt just from the recent top, either; when we look at the situation from the past few months, it‚Äôs clear that the price serves as a pretty decent indicator of the supposed ‚Äúinterest‚Äù in a token. This emphasizes a shared occurrence in the cryptocurrency market: the focus on Crypto Twitter is frequently of short duration. Even though the platform is a center of gravity for crypto discourse and has‚Äîin some instances‚Äîhelped spur certain tokens to newfound prominence, its influence barely registers in the space-time continuum of the average crypto investor. The same users who blast off tweets about the next ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù can, with just as much volume and intensity, move on to the next trend. And for coins that barely existed before and are totally reliant on hype, these phenomenon aren‚Äôt exactly great for investors. Smart money, not online communities, drives long-term price movement. Who is smart money? It‚Äôs substantial investors like hedge funds, institutional players, and whale investors. They have the resources to cause significant price shifts, meaning their moves are more directly felt in the market. They tend to take a more calculated, long-term approach, using the types of fundamental analysis that many in the crypto space regard as antiquated. And when they move, they certainly can (and do) use social media as a cover. In their absence, lights set on a price increase driven by social media attention become more ephemeral. This principle lies at the very heart of FUR‚Äôs recent problems. Despite the enthusiasm displayed on Crypto Twitter, we haven‚Äôt seen any sizable investments from either institutional players or crypto whales that would provide the token with the kind of price support you would expect in a healthy market. Without that price support, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a reason for anyone to feel FOMO (fear of missing out), and as a result, we don‚Äôt seem to have much in the way of a sustained uptick in the token‚Äôs price. A Market Cap Decline and Dwindling Holder Base Long-term backing from big-name investors has been lacking, and it shows in the current state of $FUR. Right now, the token has a market cap of a little under half a million dollars‚Äî462K, to be exact‚Äîwhich is down almost 93% from its all-time highs of about 7 million dollars in early 2022. This cap does not inspire confidence, and it‚Äôs evident in the now 3,536 fewer holders we have since last July. Of course, it‚Äôs not just this drop in market cap that has some former holders having second guesses. Quite a few of us seem to be in the same boat. $FUR is proof that even if thousands of accounts on Crypto Twitter switch their profile pictures to the logo, it still doesn‚Äôt move the price. Attention on CT is short-lived. What truly moves price isn‚Äôt just hype ‚Äî it‚Äôs smart money. No smart money, no FOMO, no pump. Right‚Ä¶ https://t.co/rOTnop0gb3 pic.twitter.com/4rFIAujH0C ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 19, 2025 The decline in holders is a worrying sign. It shows there is not much belief from the community. In the cryptocurrency world, a large and dedicated holder base is usually a good sign of a project with long-term prospects. The moment holders start to leave, it can set off a toxic cycle that is destructive for the project‚Äôs prospects. It goes like this: Holders exit, which reduces the price; reduced price also reduces confidence; reduced confidence also reduces the number of new buyers; and in the world of cryptocurrency, a project needs new buyers to keep going. While downward pressure continues to affect FUR, the question is: what will it take for the token to regain upward momentum? The RSI being oversold indicates there could be room for a short-term rebound. However, the bearish MACD points toward sustained downward pressure until smart money starts flowing back into the token. Unless the token can lure in more institutional investors or whales to push up its price, it seems unlikely to reclaim any of its recent highs, no matter how much or little conversation it generates on social media. Conclusion: The Importance of Fundamentals Over Hype The recent drop of $FUR is a reminder that a project can only be taken so far in the world of cryptocurrencies by hype and attention on social media. While Twitter may give a project some short-term life, when it comes to movement in the actual price of a cryptocurrency, far more serious factors are at work‚Äîfar more serious factors like who is backing the project and what kind of investment strategy is being employed by that backing. In the case of $FUR, it lacks significant backing by serious investors, and as a result, it has dropped far and fast in both price and number of holders. To enable $FUR to recover and maintain its value, it will require more than mere online banter; it will require substantial, long-term investment from individuals whose financial clout can truly affect the market and bring about the kind of stability that allows for growth. For the time being, however, $FUR exists as a warning‚Äîdon‚Äôt get sucked into a trend with no real underpinning and no real possibility of long-term growth.

In the middle of this price uncertainty, there are still signs that a solid buying opportunity is coming together. The price of Ethereum has been approaching a well-known threshold, the lower Market Value to Realized Value Price Band, where significant previous dips in its price have occurred. This band is a pretty good indicator of an asset‚Äôs price level being in the vicinity of a really strong buying opportunity. The reason is that the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator in itself measures the difference between an asset‚Äôs price and the price at which it was last moved. So it‚Äôs a pretty good gauge of whether an asset‚Äôs price level is overbought, being a very good buying opportunity sign when its price is en route to hitting this lower band. The best #Ethereum $ETH buying opportunities have historically occurred when price dips below the lower MVRV Price Band, and that‚Äôs exactly where it is now! pic.twitter.com/qVg9R2ewpe ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2025 Now that Ethereum is trading in this lower MVRV band, it could signal that the cryptocurrency is undervalued compared to its realized price. This is an appealing factor for any investor looking to enter the Ethereum market at a discount. As the chart shows, there have been instances when Ethereum has dropped below this level only to reverse and quickly trade well above this MVRV. Buying pressure tends to build from both retail and institutional investors. Whale Activity Continues to Fuel the Market Despite some recent turbulence in the wider market, Ethereum whales have been as active as ever, accumulating vast amounts of ETH. This continued accumulation hints at something much more persuasive than mere confidence in a crypto project. It telegraphs institutional and high-net-worth investor confidence in Ethereum at its current price. A whale just six hours ago bought 2,400 ETH worth about $3.85 million at the time of the transaction. This was part of a broader accumulation by this same whale that has now netted them 12,010 ETH worth a total of $18.39 million over the past 10 days. What is particularly interesting about this is that the average price paid for the ETH over the last 10 days is $1,531. A whale bought another 2,400 $ETH ($3.85M) 6 hours ago. This whale has bought 12,010 $ETH ($18.39M) at an average price of $1,531 in the past 10 days. https://t.co/calmuM1Cvi pic.twitter.com/WfUm2Q9yCj ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 19, 2025 Whale buying is a strong indicator of institutional confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term prospects. When we see these big players coming in and accumulating, that is very bullish for the price of Ether. Why? Because they are able to absorb a tremendous amount of Ether without moving the price, suggesting we are in a price-discovery phase, and they are expecting a breakout to the upside at some point in the not-too-distant future. What‚Äôs Next for Ethereum? With Ethereum now placed between two important supply zones, the $1,540 and $1,630 levels, its immediate future depends largely on which side of this range it breaks out from. A move above $1,630 could trigger renewed buying pressure and possibly drive Ethereum into the next major resistance levels, marking a shift into a bullish trend for the asset. On the other hand, if Ethereum fails to hold above $1,540 and dips below that level, it could see price levels much lower than where it currently trades. Ethereum‚Äôs present situation makes for interesting viewing. In what is generally perceived to be a lower MVRV condition‚Äîwhere the market value is below the realized value‚Äîaccumulation by large holders of the asset (whale accumulation, in crypto parlance) has been going on across much of the past year. Whale watchers, or at least those who track large holder accumulation, see this MVRV condition and the whale accumulation as precursors to possible significant upward momentum in the asset‚Äôs price. Bullish Sentiment Building Despite Market Volatility Despite the recent wider market volatility, Ethereum seems stable, holding its price in key supply zones. This appears to be an investor-built wall of support on the way down and a stopping point on the way up in price action. At the very least, Ethereum‚Äôs plumbing seems to be working efficiently, with price movements transferring well through its key part of the market. This is also hopefully setting it up for a continued hopefully upward bias. For traders, the current price action purports a delicate balancing act. On one side, Ethereum is approaching what could be an almost perfect buying opportunity, considering not just the almost flawless MVRV conditions but also the buoyant activity from some of the biggest players in the market‚Äîthose whales. On the other side, traders must continue to exercise a good deal of caution, as price is still very much in a range that could flip in either direction depending on what the next market catalyst is (or isn‚Äôt). To conclude, Ethereum stands at a crucial crossroads of pricing. With heavy activity from crypto whales, MVRV conditions that strongly favor price appreciation, and vital support at critical price levels, the potential for substantial upside exists if Ethereum can manage to break through its current supply zones. Market participants of all shapes and sizes will, of course, need to remain vigilant, watching both the technical action and the broader macroeconomic picture to A: navigate these next moves effectively. Whether Ethereum price carries on with its present credentials and heading or falls back into more of a neck-and-neck consolidation pattern than it has observed for most of this year, B: the cautious-to-optimistic outlook for holders of tokens seems to remain intact.

Per recent data, wallets with between 10 and 10,000 BTC now hold approximately 67.77% of all the Bitcoin in existence. This sizable concentration of holdings suggests that the top stakeholders are feeling ever more confident about Bitcoin‚Äôs prospects ‚Äî especially in the wake of the apparent stabilization of its price after the significant volatility experienced during the month of April. One of the current Bitcoin market‚Äôs most noteworthy traits is the steady accumulation by these major stakeholders. Since March 22nd, over 53,600 BTC have been added to their balances, which implies that these entities see long-term worth in the digital asset even though its price is bumping around in the short term. These whale moves are a critical indicator of the market‚Äôs health and direction; large wallets, after all, can and do significantly influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Bitcoin's key stakeholders comprised of wallets holding between 10 & 10K BTC currently hold 67.77% of the entire supply of crypto's top market cap asset. During the April volatility, these wallets continue to accumulate, and have now added over 53.6K BTC since March 22nd. pic.twitter.com/eCalVW0FQf ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 19, 2025 Whale Activity Reaches New Heights The increase in Bitcoin accumulation is part of a more widespread development we‚Äôve observed over the past couple of months. When we analyze the data closely, we find that since early March, more than 60 new wallets have emerged that hold over 1,000 BTC. This marked uptick in the number of large-holding wallets not only signals intensified accumulation at the top but also points to a probably unprecedented level of whale activity and institutional interest. These new entrants could be either institutions or high-net-worth individuals, all of whom seem to be positioning themselves in what looks to be a may-issue asset. Over 60 new wallets holding more than 1,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have appeared since early March. A strong signal of growing whale activity! pic.twitter.com/kMR3ZhXDAH ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2025 Whale accumulation‚Äîespecially when the market is volatile‚Äîis often viewed as a vote of confidence. These big holders have the capacity to absorb quite a lot of dip; they‚Äôre generally seen as a kind of wall serving to prop up the market underpinnings. The fact that these acculators have continued to swell, even while the Bitcoin price was recently wobbling, is taken by some as a bullish sign. Also, the increasing number of wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC suggests that the appeal of Bitcoin is widening beyond just early adopters and long-time holders. It suggests that an increasing number of investors are becoming comfortable with the idea of Bitcoin as a store of value or as an inflation hedge. The upshot is that if these so-called whales are using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, then it ought to lead to a Bitcoin market that‚Äôs less volatile and more stable. Exchange Inflows Show Patience Amidst Volatility Another vital measure for evaluating market sentiment is the inflow volume momentum of Bitcoin. This is the movement of Bitcoin from wallets to exchanges. It typically occurs before selling, when prices are dropping. But if inflows are dropping too, this can mean the opposite of what it says on the surface. It can mean that instead of investors flooding the market with their coins, they are holding those coins in their wallets. The Accumulation Trend Score shows buying pressure behind #Bitcoin $BTC is starting to build at current levels. Early signs of renewed interest. pic.twitter.com/cctDcxmVZk ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 19, 2025 At present, Bitcoin‚Äôs exchange inflow volume momentum indicates that the market is in a wait-and-see mode. Whale activity and accumulation suggest anything but a lack of enthusiasm among big players, yet these same big players seem content to let things unfold. The market is noncommittal right now, seemingly unwilling to make any large moves that would give the price a discernible direction. Meanwhile, all the small fish with Liquid Bitcoin continue to merrily swim in and out of exchanges. This conservative strategy is especially clear when one looks at Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price ups and downs. Although the market has taken big swings in both directions, many investors seem to be holding back, waiting for the market to provide clearer signals before deploying much more in the way of fresh investments. If we look at Bitcoin‚Äôs price as consolidating and its trading volumes as stabilizing, we can view both of these phenomena as portents of an impending price rally. Accumulation Trend Score Signals Building Pressure The Accumulation Trend Score for Bitcoin is an indicator that tracks the buying pressure of large holders and market participants. It is starting to show some early signs of increased interest and demand for Bitcoin. Large wallets (or addresses) that hold a significant amount of Bitcoin are continuing to add to their positions. This is often used to gauge overarching market sentiment. The rising Accumulation Trend Score indicates that the pressure behind Bitcoin is mounting and that we might see an upswing in buying activity at today‚Äôs price levels. If this accumulation trend continues to build, it could suggest that we are nearing a pivot point where the market starts shifting back to the bulls, with renewed buying pressure pushing BTC back up and in the direction of all-time highs. This trend is particularly important because it reveals the increasing conviction that Bitcoin is presently undervalued or on the verge of a breakout. The calm and collected gathering of Bitcoin by mega stakeholders suggests that these investors are setting themselves up for a future growth phase and are willing to endure a volatile Bitcoin price in the interim. What Does This Mean for the Market? Recent developments surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs whale activity and the Accumulation Trend Score indicate a market that could be on the verge of its next wave of growth. Large wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin at an impressive rate, and the number of them entering the space, as well as the number of individuals with next-generation wealth who now own Bitcoin, is up significantly. These principal interested parties are continuing to hold and amass even more BTC. And it seems they‚Äôre doing this not just to ride through the next short-term bump but to really get set up for the next major BTC price surge. And if we could quantify the likelihood of this actually happening, I‚Äôd say betting on it has a bullish overall sentiment right now. The potential for substantial price changes in the very near future should keep investors on their toes. The accumulation phase we‚Äôre in could trigger a move one way or the other, and all the signs and signals‚Äîwhether from on-chain or market analysis‚Äîare pointing toward an impending outcome. This isn‚Äôt to say we‚Äôre guaranteed to break out to the upside, but there‚Äôs no question that Bitcoin‚Äôs most important stakeholders have been upping their bet on the future of the asset.

Food is a common, universal ground across the planet. It should come as no surprise then that the agricultural industry is enormous. In 2023, the European Union alone imported 154 million tonnes of agricultural products and exported 134 million tonnes more. The market is growing too, projected to expand by 3.45% annually from this year to reach $5.52 trillion by 2029. Yet, farmers and agricultural traders are confronted with a serious problem. They need to export food abroad and interact with foreign currencies. The financial system ‚Äî particularly in Africa ‚Äî is, however, underdeveloped. Inefficiencies in their trade result in high transaction costs, delayed cross-border payments, and high interest rates for loans. Large corporations can better navigate financial hurdles, but this isn‚Äôt always the case for small farmers, who suffer the most from outdated banking systems. Blockchain technology and stablecoins promise to smooth unstable waters for agricultural traders. Eliminating intermediaries and providing financial inclusion, the technology gives farmers direct access to global markets. With Africa‚Äôs food and agriculture market predicted to be valued at $1 trillion by 2030, stablecoins stand to be much more than simply another financial trend for the industry. Cross-border payments are hiding significant costs Cross-border payments are the beating heart of agricultural trade, central to accessing resources, such as equipment and seeds, or engaging in trade between countries. International transactions are vital to African agriculture, as exports within Africa represent only 17% of total African exports. Local banking systems are, however, underdeveloped and impede these payments to a shocking degree. A huge sticking point is that traditional banking systems are expensive ‚Äî they charge farmers between 3% and 6% in fees. This is no small matter when profit margins are already thin. In transactions, the demand for an intermediary currency, typically the US dollar, leads to even more exchange rate losses, often falling within the 3%-10% range. This affects small businesses in Africa, which can pay nearly 200% more than larger companies to clear their transactions through formal channels. As if the expense wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the process is also painfully slow. Farmers can expect to wait up to 120 days for payment settlements. These delays are devastating for businesses relying on quick access to funds. They are forced to take out high-interest loans with no immediate liquidity, further eroding their earnings. Stablecoins can fix agricultural trade Frustratingly outdated financial systems hamper the global agricultural industry, but a glimmer of hope is arriving in the form of stablecoins . Poised to reshape the agricultural trade, crypto offers farmers three key pillars of transformation. Stablecoins mean farmers and traders can bypass banking inefficiencies. With intermediaries taken out of the picture, they can transact instantly and with lower costs. Farmers save between 3%-6% per payment, and funds are received in minutes rather than in painful waits of weeks or months. The result? These players have the working capital needed to stay in business. Traders can forget about unstable local currencies. By pricing their goods in a stable digital asset, they can gain access to global markets. Fluctuating exchange rates will become a problem of the past. Businesses operating in countries with volatile currencies will feel that relief most acutely, as sudden devaluations in a currency have the power to wipe out profits overnight. Recent: Web2 is failing vertical farms ‚Äî they need DePIN to survive The agricultural trade is crippled by immense, systemic fraud and supply chain inefficiencies, with global food fraud costing $40 billion annually and global trade in fake goods another staggering $500 billion. Stablecoins could be transformative in reducing the original movement of counterfeit goods across supply chains, making the industry far more efficient. Results are already being seen in African agribusiness. Zimbabwe-based conglomerate Parrogate, for example, is committing to blockchain to streamline payments to its suppliers while improving cross-border trade efficiency. The company, which prides itself on growth and development across the continent, is just one of numerous African businesses getting behind stablecoins and reaping the benefits. Agriculture still faces global challenges Stablecoins should be music to the ears of those working in agriculture. The road there could, however, be rocky. Significant regulatory uncertainty, especially in Africa, is one hurdle. Many nations have strict capital outflow controls, so farmers and traders must comply with local regulations or face legal issues. Another limitation is technological barriers and an education gap across the industry, which prevent some farmers from fully grasping and using the technology. European farmers, who need stablecoins less because infrastructure is pretty well established, will also not have full access to these stable mechanisms for facilitating trade. There are barriers, but the demand for stablecoins in African agriculture is undeniable. There is a strong willingness within the agricultural community to get on board with compliant stablecoins that support cross-border liquidity. The mass adoption of stablecoins won‚Äôt happen overnight, but that‚Äôs not to say that this industry isn‚Äôt progressing toward the digital. The offer of stablecoins is tantalizing ‚Äî instant transactions, lower fees and enhanced financial access. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before more farmers make the switch. Agricultural traders struggling under the weight of an outdated and intrusive banking system are ready for greater financial inclusion. And we should be, too. This industry connects us all and will be lifted by stablecoins. The tech will be transformative for the field ‚Äî not just as an innovation, but as an essential evolution.

Thanks to its innovative on-chain lending protocol and newly launched Top 50 Holder Dashboard, where loyal investors are rewarded in bonus tokens for staying in the leaderboard, Mutuum Finance is doing more than turning heads. Many believe it could deliver gains Ethereum can‚Äôt match in the short term. The project is in Phase 4 presale. Investors acquired are more than 8400 presale tokens to produce a dynamic level of investor support worth $6.9 million. Mutuum Finance Phase 4 has already launched. Those entering now can expect 140% returns worth $0.06 during the exchange launch period. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors show growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because they continue to support its project development. During the pre-sale phase investors achieved an outstanding milestone by providing more than $6.9 million in funding for reaching 8400 participants. The token value of Mutuum Finance tokens showed growth during Phase 4 initial stages and continues increasing toward its launch price expectation of $0.06. Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework which combines Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish straight loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P exchanges because this system represents a superior way of managing worldwide assets. Users benefit from automated security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing (staking rewards) mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings of new exchanges will improve inter-user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its first users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. As analysts identify 2025‚Äôs potential millionaire-makers, Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out for different reasons. DOGE continues to benefit from community strength, XRP appeals to institutional players, and MUTM is quietly building serious momentum in the DeFi space. Over 8,400 investors have already contributed more than $6.9 million to the MUTM presale, signaling strong early conviction. The current Phase 4 price of $0.025 offers investors the potential for 140% returns at the projected launch price of $0.06. A powerful dual-lending protocol, secure smart contract audits, and community reward features like the Top 50 Holder Dashboard reinforce its value proposition. Investors looking to get ahead of the next wave should consider entering before Phase 5 introduces a price increase and broader market awareness takes hold.

The United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs meme coin has increased in value by more than 8% in the last 24 hours. This positive price spurt came despite the recent unlocking of a significant amount of tokens into open circulation. Project Creators Unlock 40 Million Tokens In First Event On Friday, April 18, the creators of the TRUMP meme coin released 40 million tokens in the first unlock event for the project. The unlocked tokens, which were worth about $310 million at the time of the event, represent just 4% of the total supply, but over 16% of the current circulating supply. Related Reading: Ripple Takes Asia By Storm With New XRP Product, Here Are The Recent Developments The Official Trump meme coin has not been in particularly good form in recent weeks, falling further away from its record high price of $71 reached in January. According to data from CoinGecko, the token‚Äôs price is down from its all-time high by roughly 90% in the past three months. Prior to the unlock event, the TRUMP token was valued at around $7.54 and had been oscillating between $7.46 and $7.83 on the day. However, the impending release of 40 million tokens from a three-month lockup did little to improve the sentiment around the meme coin, as investors predicted an extended period of downward pressure. Historically, large token unlocks are deemed bearish events, as they allow holders to sell off their assets on the open market. With increasing token supply and insufficient demand, the meme coin‚Äôs price was expected to further crumble under the selling pressure. Interestingly, the price of TRUMP seems to be reversing the trend and moving against the crowd‚Äôs expectations after surging by more than 8% to reclaim the $8 mark on Saturday. While the meme coin‚Äôs price has somewhat cooled down, it did climb as high as the $8.60 mark on the day. The Official Trump meme coin was launched earlier in January 2025, a few days before the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States. The launch was met with some criticism in the industry, especially as President Trump also promoted the cryptocurrency. The April 18 unlock event represents the first among numerous ‚Äúcliff‚Äù releases expected to come at later dates. TRUMP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of TRUMP lies at around $8.33, reflecting an 8.6% increase in the last 24 hours. However, this positive single-day action was not enough to put the meme coin in the green on the weekly timeframe ‚Äî still down by 1.5% in the last seven days.

In the past 24 hours, several notable accumulations have happened across various stories that have caught the eye of market watchers. And these accumulations seem to be somewhat coordinated within certain sectors. From that angle, here‚Äôs what we can see. A clear narrative has emerged from the data smart money accumulations: DeFi protocols and staking platforms keep pulling in attention; AI tokens are scoring some serious institutional momentum; and meme coins, while definitely speculative, still seem to have our community‚Äôs imagination captured. Here are the significant movements in the smart wallets and the tokens that seem to have caught the most attention. DeFi & Staking: $SYRUP Leads the Charge Among the top accretions, $SYRUP, the token for the decentralized finance protocol Maple Finance, has seen significant movement. In the past 24 hours, a smart money wallet racked up over $29,000 worth of $SYRUP. The reason for this accretion isn‚Äôt a mystery; recent moves in the Maple Finance ecosystem have investors‚Äô antennas up. The project is rolling out new staking features that appear to have caught the fancy of the flash loan crowd. Especially when viewed in the light of the protocol revenue buybacks, the token looks like it could be delivering some serious rewards. Wallets containing savvy money‚Äîdefined by their ability to see potential growth not just now but into the future‚Äîappear to be placing bets on the long-term stamina of Maple Finance‚Äôs staking program. The reason could be that the platform, as it offers this feature, is bolstering its overall goal of attracting liquidity and, by extension, providing sustainable yields. At this moment, $SYRUP thus seems a play on DeFi with promise, buoyed by innovations in staking and the DeFi summer that is upon us. AI & Infrastructure: $EIGEN‚Äôs Institutional Momentum Within the AI and blockchain infrastructure realms, $EIGEN is appearing on the radars of smart money wallets. This infrastructure token, powered by AI, has gained immense momentum among institutions and is clearly showing signs of further interest within the space. Slightly under $20,000 worth of $EIGEN was just acquired by one such smart money wallet, bringing the token‚Äôs market cap, now just over $204 million, into the conversation. The increasing amalgamation of artificial intelligence into blockchain infrastructure has provided an opportunity for projects such as $EIGEN to achieve considerable momentum. With AI poised to revolutionize sectors from healthcare to finance, savvy investors are appreciating the prospective value of tokens that can connect the technologies of blockchain and AI. The recent uptick in accumulation of $EIGEN would seem to indicate that these investors foresee a robust future for infrastructure projects that integrate artificial intelligence into their operations; a future in which $EIGEN is set to realize significant gains. Meme Tokens: Community and Speculation at Play Although DeFi and AI may have attracted most of the intelligent investment recently, speculative interest in the market still seems to be captured by meme tokens. This is particularly true for two meme-based cryptocurrencies, $Okintama and $Haminosuke, which have seen impressive accumulation in the last 24 hours. $Okintama, a meme token powered by community enthusiasm, has seen 5 smart money wallets accumulate a total of $29,000. Even though its market cap is a relatively modest $1.8 million, the community-driven growth that $Okintama is seeing makes it seem like a pretty attractive target for savvy investors. It, too, like so many tokens in this space, has benefitted from social media-driven momentum. Its near vertical rise in price over the past week or so is a testament to just how powerful a strong online community can be when it comes to propelling a project into the mainstream. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: DeFi & Staking (8 wallets) AI & Infrastructure (5 wallets) Meme & Community Tokens (8 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $SYRUP -> @maplefinance 's Syrup token is‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/AIMViDYQMA ‚Äî CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 19, 2025 Alternately, $Haminosuke, a meme token with a paltry market cap of only $42,000, has caught the fancy of 3 smart money wallets that just in the last 24 hours decided to accumulate $13,000 worth of the token. This suggests the token has at least that much in buying power backing it up. Beyond these smart money moves is the fact that at this price point $Haminosuke is a potential 100X to 1,000X investment, with the kind of risk/reward payoff that would make it attractive to your average retail gambler. Emerging Tokens and Trends: AI and ZigCoin Beyond the more renowned tokens, $CLANKER and $ZIG have also become noticed by the smart money wallets. $CLANKER is a token linked to Tokenbot, an AI-focused platform that makes token generation easy. One smart wallet has seen fit to amass around $12,000 worth of $CLANKER, which comes at a market cap of $37 million. The project‚Äôs novel use of AI to handle the not-so-simple business of token generation has impressed some investors, with favorable odds put on the blockchain space‚Äôs future AI platforms. At last, $ZIG, or ZigCoin, is displaying bullish price action, with one wallet of smart money accumulating $13,000 worth of the token. With a market capitalization of $104 million, ZigCoin has demonstrated some recently very exciting price spikes, making it a very interesting potential pick for investors looking for tokens that seem to have upward price momentum. The Bottom Line: A Diverse Set of Opportunities The last 24 hours of strategic smart money wallet moves offer a window into the cryptocurrency future. Bets are being placed across many diverse narratives.: ‚Äì DeFi protocols with innovative staking mechanisms ‚Äì AI infrastructure tokens with institutional backing ‚Äì Meme tokens that thrive on community engagement Each one presents its own unique set of risks and rewards, which leads to some interesting conversation and highlights the market‚Äôs versatility. But what‚Äôs even more interesting is that a seriously large crypto wallet has forked out millions across these very different types of tokens. The crypto market keeps on advancing and developing. Within it, these investments made by smart money indicate a trend toward diversification. Capital is being spread across many different areas within the crypto market and beyond, and we‚Äôre seeing a range of tokens with all kinds of investor backing. With technological innovations, community excitement, and institutional momentum, these tokens are set to have an influence in the crypto market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bullish 15-Day Cup and Handle Pattern XRP‚Äôs daily trading price continued in mid-April to trace a 90-day falling flag pattern visible at the 1Y view.¬†Moreover, the indicator exhibits the classic declining trend in daily exchange volume. This pattern often signals an end to corrective bear markets and a reversion to the broader bullish trend. Furthermore, at the 1M view, XRP‚Äôs price rounds out converging trend lines on the falling flag trace with a textbook bullish cup and handle pattern over 15 days from Apr. 2 to Apr. 17. The cup formation spans 10 days from Apr. 2 to Apr. 12 and the slightly downward listing range channel forming the handle appeared from then until Apr. 17, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ripple token trading exhibited declining 24H trade volume from above $16 billion in the cup‚Äôs middle to below $3 billion during the handle portion of the chart technical indicator. According to Investopedia, ‚ÄúThe cup and handle is considered a bullish signal, with the right-hand side of the pattern typically experiencing lower trading volume.‚Äù 2. HNWI Manager: Institutions Quietly Stockpile XRP Major institutions are stacking up #XRP behind the scenes while keeping the public in the dark. The current price is merely a shadow of what‚Äôs coming. When XRP transforms into the foundation of international finance, today‚Äôs hesitation will become tomorrow‚Äôs regret. In my‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) April 10, 2025 There‚Äôs no doubt of institutional interest in XRP because of the spot ETF applications at the SEC and Ripple‚Äôs partnerships with big global financial clearinghouses. But Cheyenne, Wyoming-based family office wealth director Jake Claver had a hot tip for altcoin investors on Apr. 10. He said in a note on X that, ‚ÄúMajor institutions are stacking up #XRP behind the scenes while keeping the public in the dark.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe current price is merely a shadow of what‚Äôs coming,‚Äù Claver added. ‚ÄúIn my opinion, nothing in crypto space offers this level of certainty and potential for massive returns.‚Äù Some repliers challenged Claver to show any evidence of the provocative claim. While part of the claim is that the major players are keeping such evidence scant, one bit of circumstantial evidence is the frequent sightings in 2024 and 2025 by blockchain explorers of tremendous whale-sized XRP transactions. 131,000,000 #XRP (273,945,648 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/CnMiTrxABL ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 15, 2025 More direct evidence would be the public knowledge that banks like Santander, American Express, SBI Holdings, PNC, and Commonwealth Bank use XRP to make large international transfers. That‚Äôs what XRP is built for. 3. XRP ETF Applications Top Ten at US SEC 2x leveraged XRP ETF is *currently* live & trading‚Ä¶ I simply don‚Äôt see this SEC not approving spot XRP ETF. And sooner, rather than later. ‚Äî Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 16, 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price cranked up 166% within two quarters from $27,400 in Oct. 2023 to $73,000 in Mar. 2024. The rally revolved around the first Bitcoin ETF approvals by the SEC in Jan. 2024. In mid-April, XRP had 10 spot ETF applications in the queue at the SEC, according to Paris, France-based blockchain research firm Kaiko. That highlights impending demand for Ripple tokens by institutional investors. The second-most applications out of the crypto segment was five for Solana. Dogecoin and Litecoin had three each pending at the SEC in mid-April. Kaiko projects XRP will be the next blockchain currency to get a spot ETF in the US. 4. X Buzz Over Possible SWIFT Partnership April 16 and April 21 could become the two most important dates in XRP‚Äôs history. And I‚Äôm not saying this for hype. I‚Äôm saying it because of context, data, and a narrative that‚Äôs been building for years. Let‚Äôs start with April 16: It‚Äôs the deadline for Ripple to submit its‚Ä¶ ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 13, 2025 Meanwhile, popular Crypto X provocateur John Squire, ‚ÄúThe Crypto Squire,‚Äù famous to over half a million followers, suggested on Apr. 13 that SWIFT could start using XRP as soon as April. ‚ÄúIn 2023, Ripple already participated in interoperability pilot programs led by SWIFT,‚Äù Squire wrote. ‚ÄúMore recently, SWIFT published a report discussing the integration of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)‚Ä¶ XRP was part of that conversation.‚Äù Popular Crypto X #XRPArmy booster Amonyx fanned the flames with a video of YouTube business podcaster and motivational speaker Patrick Bet-David pumping XRP in terms of SWIFT payments market share. Even without a SWIFT partnership, as Ripple captures any significant portion of forward market share growth in SWIFT‚Äôs trillion-dollar payments businesses, XRP prices are apt to skyrocket once more. 5. XRP Price Support From Froggy Bitcoin Market Finally in this list, there‚Äôs the support for XRP prices from directly adjacent Bitcoin exchange markets that cyclically draw up vast amounts of capital inflows. Brokers make BTC sales to individuals and organizations from all walks of life across the planet, at all levels of wealth from third world laborer individual investors to the US government. Because XRP is a direct trading pair with Bitcoin on dozens of highly liquid currency exchange platforms, BTC generates an enormous long-term support for the former‚Äôs value. While stocks continued to swoon in April over Trump tariffs realigning global trade deals, Bitcoin decoupled from other ‚Äúrisk‚Äù markets and went for a cool mid-month rally. Wall Street Bitcoin ETFs joined the rally in a potential preview of price support from mainstream financial integrations with XRP via the pending Ripple ETFs. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse remarked in April that he sees Bitcoin‚Äôs price topping $200,000 in 2025. Another analyst noted that in March and April, Bitcoin whales have been buying BTC like never before.

With an impressive surge, Uniswap‚Äôs TVL has now crossed $250 million, fueled by new liquidity incentives and user engagement. The campaign‚Äôs effect has been especially clear in Uniswap‚Äôs v4 pools, which have received a large and obvious influx of capital. This has, in fact, brought us to a very clear state of growth not just for the v4 pools themselves but for the overall total value locked (TVL) on the Uniswap platform. And the impact is this. As of now, the v4 pools alone account for over 6% of Uniswap‚Äôs total TVL. TVL Surge Alert: Uniswap v4 & Unichain Since launching its incentive campaign on April 15, @Uniswap 's @unichain TVL has jumped past $250M. Most of the inflow went into v4 pools, which now hold over 6% of Uniswap‚Äôs total TVL. pic.twitter.com/EGynIgaymQ ‚Äî Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 18, 2025 Uniswap‚Äôs incentive campaign and the subsequent increase in liquidity are more than just a successful event; they reflect a wider trend in the DeFi sector. Of the net weekly inflows of $134 million across the Unichain ecosystem, the dominant portion is pretty clearly attributable to Uniswap itself. And if you take a look at Uniswap‚Äôs current supply-side APYs, it‚Äôs not hard to argue that they‚Äôre also the most attractive yield-generating product available on any blockchain right now. Uniswap‚Äôs Incentive Campaign: A Game-Changer for Unichain The inflows were driven by the timing of Uniswap‚Äôs incentive campaign. On April 15, the decentralized exchange (DEX) launched a campaign to persuade liquidity providers (LPs) to increase their staked assets on Uniswap‚Äôs v4 pools. What the DEX got in return from the LPs was unexpected. The v4 pools have a lot more liquidity in them than Uniswap itself expected. And that means not only a lot more TVL in Ethereum‚Äôs DEX now but also another feather in Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized exchange cap. The incentives, aimed at liquidity providers, give out competitive rewards for staking assets in the v4 pools, making them a very appealing offering for users trying to maximize their returns. As the TVL on Uniswap appears to be in the process of growing, it seems to be strengthening Unichain‚Äôs role in the DeFi ecosystem and drawing more attention from investors and liquidity providers. Along with the increase in TVL, Unichain is also gaining in net flows among various blockchains, reporting a consistent $134 million in weekly net flows. That figure puts Unichain in front of capital coming into the DeFi space, which is really indicative of not only attracting liquidity but also of having a dynamic, superb growth environment in the DeFi space. Uniswap‚Äôs powerful incentive arrangement, together with Unichain‚Äôs burgeoning liquidity, has resulted in upswings in participation from three major networks‚ÄîEthereum, Base, and Arbitrum‚Äîthat are also experiencing positive net flows. Much to our pleasure, these chains are making great use of the exciting opportunities and attractive risk/reward profiles available in Uniswap‚Äôs pools. This, in turn, is causing our overall platform liquidity to expand even further. A Mixed Landscape for Other Chains Some chains are reaping the rewards from the rush of new funds, while others are going in the opposite direction. In the past week, both Optimism and Berachain have seen their liquidity absolutely decimated by outflows. Why might this be happening? User sentiment, market conditions, or simply the attractiveness of other DeFi protocols might be driving these two chains in the send-off direction. In spite of the outflows from some chains, the general trend for Uniswap and its Unichain ecosystem is a good one. Uniswap‚Äôs net flows on a weekly basis are positive, with three of its main chains‚ÄîEthereum, Base, and Arbitrum‚Äîperforming the best. This is allowing Uniswap to reestablish itself as a prominent protocol in decentralized finance (DeFi). Additionally, the overall health of the Uniswap platform can be viewed on a cross-chain basis, especially since it can be seen as an alternative liquidity source for DeFi applications. Unichain leads in 7d net flows The launch of the incentives campaign on @unichain has driven weekly net flows to $134M. @ethereum , @base , and @arbitrum are also among the top chains by net flows, while @Optimism and @berachain have seen more outflows this week. pic.twitter.com/X8MA0p5PX0 ‚Äî CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 18, 2025 Looking Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for Uniswap and Unichain? Attracting liquidity, the incentive campaign continues apace, winning new partners almost daily. In fact, it seems almost impossible to fail to trip over a new opportunity to earn some yield, either directly or in leveraged fashion, using Uniswap v4‚Äôs new offering. And, as tend to be the cases with these sorts of things, there‚Äôs also the whiff of rumors recommending the use of Uniswap v4 to What are the overall implications of this situation? And what‚Äôs the good word, as it relates to the use-cases for vault strategies? Similarly robust net inflows are a great marker for the long-term viability of any crypto project above 2M liquidity where 3 core conditions are satisfied: 1. Clearly defined project goals and objectives. 2. Committed development and marketing teams. 3. Real or perceived product-market fit. To sum up, the effect of Uniswap‚Äôs incentive campaign on Unichain‚Äôs liquidity has been nothing short of spectacular. The campaign has, in fact, been a real game changer, injecting all kinds of growth into our chain and, by extension, into the DeFi space. What‚Äôs happening now likens Uniswap to a gravitational force, pulling in capital with ever-increasing intensity and reticulation, and solidifying its power position in the DeFi space.

Speaking to RIABiz , Wurster highlighted a 400% surge in traffic to Schwab‚Äôs crypto-related web pages as clear evidence of investor interest in digital assets. ‚ÄúOur expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur goal is to do that in the next 12 months, and we are on a great path to be able to do that.‚Äù New Schwab CEO Signals Strong Commitment to Expanding Crypto Services Wurster, who took over as CEO in 2025, has consistently expressed interest in expanding Schwab‚Äôs digital asset offerings. In a November 2024 interview with Yahoo Finance , he noted that the firm was eager to offer direct crypto services but was awaiting clearer regulatory guidance before moving forward. Following Donald Trump‚Äôs re-election in late 2024, Wurster cited optimism that the new administration would create a more favorable regulatory landscape for digital assets. The shift could finally enable Schwab to roll out direct trading services, long requested by its client base. In January 2025, Schwab deepened its crypto push by partnering with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) to support the launch of ‚ÄúTruth.Fi,‚Äù a platform combining traditional financial services with cryptocurrency offerings.

Public Companies Boost Bitcoin Holdings by 16% in Q1 2025 Publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. According to crypto asset manager Bitwise, total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin‚Äîrepresenting a 2.2% increase in value. The number of public companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets also rose, from 67 to 79, with 12 firms making their first Bitcoin purchases during the quarter. The adoption of Bitcoin has also found momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active.

Dogecoin‚Äôs current price is hovering between $0.153 and $0.159. Over the past week, it has seen a slight decline of 5.09%. The monthly change shows a drop of 7.17%, indicating a downward trend in the short term. However, looking at the six-month performance, Dogecoin has increased by 7.29%. This suggests that despite recent dips, the coin has potential for growth in the longer term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.14, which is considered neutral, neither overbought nor oversold. The nearest resistance level is at $0.184. If Dogecoin breaks through this point, it could signal a bullish trend, potentially leading to gains of over 10% from its current price range. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.113. A drop to this point would represent a decrease of about 18% from the current price range. Given the neutral RSI and the mixed recent performance, Dogecoin‚Äôs price could move in either direction. Traders will be watching to see if it moves toward the resistance or support levels. A breakthrough above resistance might indicate a rising trend, while falling below support could signal further decline. Conclusion The current market conditions suggest that traditional memecoins like DOGE may offer less short-term potential compared to emerging alternatives. With bullish momentum already present, investors are seeking assets that provide not just hype but also utility.

Amid this market sentiment, two artificial intelligence (AI) models are projecting that the maiden digital currency is likely to edge higher on May 1 and possibly trade slightly above the $90,000 mark. Overall, insights from OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and xAI‚Äôs Grok present a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. AI predicts Bitcoin price ChatGPT predicted that Bitcoin will trade between $91,000 and $96,000 by the beginning of May. The model cited continued momentum from Bitcoin‚Äôs April 2024 halving, which has historically triggered multi-month rallies. It also highlighted sustained institutional interest, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs , which continue to absorb supply during market dips. ChatGPT Bitcoin price prediction for May 1,2025. Source: ChatGPT According to ChatGPT, the technical setup remains bullish following Bitcoin‚Äôs recent breakout above $80,000. The AI tool suggested the next key resistance lies between $90,000 and $95,000, making a short-term rally toward that range plausible. ChatGPT sees the ‚Äúpath of least resistance‚Äù as upward unless an unforeseen regulatory or macroeconomic event derails the current trend. Conversely, Grok provided a slightly more conservative outlook, projecting that Bitcoin will trade between $88,000 and $92,000 on May 1. The model highlighted that Bitcoin‚Äôs technical indicators remain favorable. With a neutral Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) and bullish moving averages , there appears to be room for further upside without the immediate risk of a sharp correction. Additionally, Grok identified strong support between $80,000 and $82,000, while resistance near the $100,000 level could limit short-term gains. Supporting this view, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez noted in an X post on April 12 that Bitcoin‚Äôs key support currently stands at $82,690. At current price levels, approximately 1.98 million addresses holding 2.42 million BTC are in profit, within the $82,690 to $95,620 range, indicating robust buying interest in this zone. However, Martinez also flagged significant resistance at $95,620, where 1.66 million addresses holding 1.66 million BTC are currently in the red. Bitcoin In/Out of money around price chart. Source:Ali_charts This level could prove to be a major hurdle for bullish momentum. Therefore, a decisive break above $95,620 may act as a catalyst for renewed upward pressure, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward the psychological $100,000 mark. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,317, down approximately 1.3% over the last 24 hours.

This surge is likely to impact various altcoins. The article explores which digital currencies stand to gain the most from Bitcoin's potential rise. Discover the altcoins poised for significant growth, offering unique opportunities for investors. SUI Coin Analysis: Short-Term Dip with Six-Month Recovery SUI experienced a near 9% drop over the past month with a weekly decline of roughly 9%. In contrast, the six-month performance shows a recovery of about 6%. This mixed behavior highlights volatility in the short term alongside a medium-term rally that suggests a gradual resurgence. Price swings indicate that the coin has been testing its limits in both bearish and modestly positive conditions. Current trading levels range from $1.74 to $3.03, with clear support at $1.21 and resistance at $3.78, followed by a second resistance at $5.07. Technical indicators show a near-neutral RSI at 46 and a slightly negative moving average sentiment, suggesting a dominant bearish short-term bias. Traders might consider buying near support while monitoring the resistance zone for potential breakout or reversal opportunities. Ondo (ONDO): Steady Month, Rising Six-Month Momentum ONDO prices increased slightly by 0.86% last month, while the six-month performance recorded a solid 10.31% gain. The coin has shown stable behavior recently, with a gradual upward trend observed over the longer term. This resilience in price action reflects a growing confidence among investors, suggesting a positive outlook as the market stabilizes. Current trading sees prices fluctuating between $0.60 and $1.10. Key resistance is established at $1.42, with another level at $1.92, while support is found near $0.41. Market dynamics show neither bulls nor bears gaining a decisive edge, as technical indicators are near neutral. Consider buying closer to support and monitor for potential breakouts above the resistance levels. Ethena (ENA) Price Analysis: Decline and Key Trading Zones Ethena experienced a 16% drop over the past week, a 25% decline in the last month, and a nearly 27% fall over the past six months. These figures indicate a continuous downward move that has kept market sentiment weak throughout these time frames. The price trajectory shows a persistent bearish trend without any significant recovery signs during these periods. Current levels feature a near-term resistance around $0.53 and support near $0.24, with an additional target resistance at $0.68 and a lower support at $0.09. Indicators point to bearish dominance and the absence of a clear upward trend. Traders could consider looking for opportunities to buy near the support, while remaining cautious in the prevailing downtrend. Conclusion If Bitcoin reaches the projected high, SUI , ONDO , and ENA are likely to benefit. SUI may attract attention due to its innovative features. ONDO could see gains with its unique appeal. ENA might also rise, leveraging investor interest and market trends. The next few months could be crucial for these coins as Bitcoin's influence impacts the broader market.

Perkins called its recommendations ‚Äúcompletely uninformed and frankly, dangerous.‚Äù The BIS report , titled ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and decentralized finance: functions and financial stability implications,‚Äù acknowledges cryptocurrency‚Äôs growing importance with the rise of ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. However, Perkins strongly objects to the paper‚Äôs containment approach to cryptocurrency regulation. ‚ÄúGuys, crypto is not communism.

With that experience, he warns that artificially separating traditional finance from cryptocurrency markets could create liquidity risks. Perkins argues that forcing a division between the 24/7 settlement capability of crypto markets and the time-restricted traditional system would ‚Äúlead to the next systemic crisis.‚Äù Instead of containment, Perkins advocates for modernizing traditional financial systems to integrate with blockchain technology. ‚ÄúCapital rules should not ‚Äòcontain‚Äô public blockchains‚Äîthey should encourage them!‚Äù he argued. He suggested that regulation should focus on updating legacy systems rather than isolating new technology. You might also like: XRP price defies good news streak: Can it still hit $5? The CoinFund president also challenged several other conclusions in the BIS report. He particularly focused on its concerns about information asymmetries in decentralized finance (DeFi). Perkins questioned the BIS‚Äôs criticism regarding anonymous developers in DeFi projects. He also noted that traditional financial institutions typically do not publish lists of their developers. Perkins also took issue with the BIS‚Äôs worry that stablecoins would cause macroeconomic instability in nations like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. ‚ÄúIf there is demand for USD stablecoins and it helps improve the condition of anyone in the developing world, perhaps that is a good thing?!‚Äù he wrote. He also added that people worldwide deserve access to basic financial services regardless of their country‚Äôs monetary stability.

The rise in exchange inflows reflects twice the number of new sales coming into the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts widespread enthusiasm through its presale funding drive which has gathered $6.9 million while acquiring 8,400 token holders. The current token price in Phase 4 stands at $0.025 while all investors should prepare for the upcoming 20% price increment to $0.03 during Phase 5. Many investors rush to obtain tokens because they sense the tokens will deliver a 5,700% profit once the platform launches. The cryptocurrency world shows XRP heading slowly compared to the hyped-up potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The dissimilar approaches between these blockchain platforms establish conditions to evaluate their projected 2025 evolution patterns. Ripple (XRP) Struggles Persist Whale selling activities remain a major challenge that causes Ripple (XRP) to struggle in the market. The mass movement of 131 million XRP worth a total of $273 million has caused panic about additional selling pressure. The technical indicators display warning signals because XRP‚Äôs inability to surpass $2.17 makes the coin vulnerable to reach levels between $1.90 and $1.55. Ripple (XRP) could experience a market rally according to the MACD indicator even though the RSI signals potential overselling conditions. In addition to U.S.-China trade tensions and the wobbling stock market XRP faces external pressures from these market forces. ETC approval remains uncertain because of ongoing regulatory challenges that risk impeding its market entry. Hedgers have started investing in projects driven by recognizable momentum because they want to achieve high returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the spotlight through its Phase 4 presale event priced at $0.025. Investors take advantage of the current market opportunity because they expect that Phase 5 will boost the price from $0.03 to $0.03 delivering immediate value appreciation for those who hold tokens currently. The tokenomics system within MUTM ensures return of 140% profit when the exchange lists at $0.06. The market anticipates the token to reach $3.50 after launch stage which represents a 5700% increase from its current value of $0.025. The present $1,000 investment could grow to become $57,000 over the next five years. The team works to build credibility by completing a CertiK smart contract audit which will be released on social media platforms. Current and potential buyers show increasing interest because Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promotes open auditing which signals an approaching sell-out of Phase 4. Innovative Incentives Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduced an innovation through their new dashboard showing the leading 50 holders who get bonus tokens by staying in their positions. Competitive pressure rises when the leaderboard system is introduced which motivates holders to keep their assets. Steady demand exists because the project buys tokens on the market using platform revenue to execute repurchase operations. Tokenomics within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) deliver predictable value through its structured system unlike Ripple (XRP) which depends on external market conditions. Investors keep their faith strong given that the presale collected $6.9 million from the sale of 412 million tokens. Phase 4 consumption time reduces the time available for investors to purchase tokens at their current price of $0.025. What Next? The future of Ripple (XRP) remains uncertain because market turbulence along with massive sales to whales have created conditions for unclear market direction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows great promise because investors believe in its projected 5700% increase. The current price of $0.025 during Phase 4 will vanish soon before MUTM jumps to a new level at $0.03.

CEO, is planning to introduce spot Bitcoin trading for Schwab clients by April 2026. Rick attributed a 400% traffic increase on Schwab‚Äôs crypto website to these plans. A large part of this decision was dictated by the regulatory environment. As per Rick, Schwab was waiting for a more ‚Äòpositive regulatory catalyst‚Äô to offer crypto trading directly to its clients. Read on to know how this development speaks positively about the overall crypto market. We‚Äôll also suggest some of the best cryptos to buy now to make the most of it. The Right Regulatory Catalyst The crypto industry has seen some positive regulatory developments ever since the appointment of Trump as the president. Be it the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve or doing away with the draconian debanking policies, the changes are now starting to bear fruit. In fact, the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in January 2025, right alongside Trump‚Äôs entry. And now, a bunch of crypto-pegged ETFs are pending approval with the SEC. Schwab has also entered into a partnership with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) to assist in offering customized ETF and cryptocurrency services for Truth.Fi. In case you didn‚Äôt know, Truth.Fi is an upcoming project that will blend digital assets with traditional banking. Bitcoin Can Reach $138K After a sluggish couple of months, Bitcoin looks well-positioned to be the dominating force everyone‚Äôs expecting it to be. In an X post , Timothy Peterson, a network economist, predicted that $BTC may reach as high as $138K in the next three months. A very important determinant of the prediction is the US High Yield Index Effective Yield, which now sits at 8%. Since 2010, there have been 38 instances when the monthly rate has crossed 8%. Whenever this has happened, $BTC went up 71% of the time with a median gain of 31%, with the worst-case loss of 16%. This means that the floor price for $BTC should be around $75K, with $138K being the possible high. However, this means that Bitcoin would need to deliver around 60% returns from current levels. This wouldn‚Äôt be an easy climb given the current choppy macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing trade tariff war. Then again, with the probability on the bulls‚Äô side, Peterson‚Äôs predictions may not be ridiculously wrong after all. If you‚Äôre looking to make the most of the upcoming Bitcoin frenzy, this is probably the best time to accumulate some hot new cryptos , like the following. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Crypto to Buy If You‚Äôre Bullish on Bitcoin The king cryptocurrency, Bitcoin itself, doesn‚Äôt come cheap and would require a huge upfront investment before it could make you any noteworthy profits. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) solves that problem. It‚Äôs the best crypto to invest in if you want to benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs upcoming rally in a cost-effective manner. As the first-ever and only crypto to offer free $BTC to token holders, BTC Bull Token has been built to follow Bitcoin‚Äôs coattails. It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that $BTCBULL‚Äôs love for Bitcoin isn‚Äôt the reason it could rally alongside it. That will happen because its $BTC giveaways are scheduled to occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Another reason we‚Äôve predicted $BTCBULL to explode to $0.0096 by 2026 is its deflationary approach. By burning a percentage of the total token supply every time $BTC rises by $25K, the BTC Bull Token developers have ensured the crypto‚Äôs demand stays intact and its price follows an upward trajectory. Luckily for you, BTC Bull Token is currently in presale ($4.8M+ raised), which is why it‚Äôs one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . One token costs just $0.00247. For more info, here‚Äôs a detailed guide on how to¬†buy¬†$BTCBULL . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì Top Altcoin Creating the First-Ever Solana Layer-2 Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the hottest crypto presales on the market right now, and for a very good reason. It‚Äôs a token with real utility ‚Äì Solaxy‚Äôs goal is to revamp Solana and restore its past glory. At the time of writing, Solana is struggling to accommodate the increased number of investors on its network, leading to network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. It will reduce the burden on the network‚Äôs mainnet by offloading a significant number of its transactions onto a sidechain. Solaxy plans to do so by utilizing two leading blockchains: Ethereum and Solana. As a multi-chain token, $SOLX will be able to blend Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity and Solana‚Äôs speed. The best part? You can join Solaxy‚Äôs $30M+ presale by shelling out just $0.0017 per token. Check out our how to buy Solaxy guide for more information. 3. SUNDOG ($SUNDOG) ‚Äì Best Dog Meme Coin on TRON As the biggest dog-themed meme coin on the TRON network, SUNDOG, though a relatively low-cap coin , deserves to be in the same conversation as $DOGE and $SHIBA. Built with the ‚Äòserious‚Äô goal of spreading good vibes and joy on the TRON blockchain, SUNDOG is currently one of the top trending cryptos . It‚Äôs up over 15% in the last seven days , and a closer look at its price action suggests that if it continues to hold the break above $0.0490, it could surge past its recent high of $0.05187. That would result in a gain of over 100%, making SUNDOG‚Äôs current price of $0.04863 an excellent entry point for both short- and long-term¬†investors. Final Thoughts on the Potential of the Best Cryptos The potential of the best cryptos aside, let‚Äôs never forget that this market is subject to high volatility. That‚Äôs why you should tread cautiously, irrespective of your level of conviction. In addition to only investing a small amount, ensure you do your own research before buying cryptos.

Buterin's April 20 proposal outlined several long-term bottlenecks for scaling the Ethereum network including, stable data availability sampling, ensuring block production remains competitive, and zero-knowledge EVM proving. The Ethereum co-founder argued that implementing the RISC-V architecture in smart contracts would keep block production markets competitive and improve the efficiency of zero knowledge functions for the execution layer. Buterin wrote: ""The beam chain effort holds great promise for greatly simplifying the consensus layer of Ethereum, but for the execution layer to see similar gains, this kind of radical change may be the only viable path."" The proposal highlights the Ethereum network's struggle to improve throughput and remain competitive with next-generation monolithic blockchains such as Solana and the Sui networks at a time when investors are losing confidence in the original smart contract blockchain. Buterin provides numbers suggesting that implementing the proposal could lead to efficiency gains of 100x. Source: Vitalik Buterin Related: Vitalik Buterin unveils roadmap for Ethereum privacy Ethereum's scaling woes and a collapse of Ether's price Ethereum's blob fees, transaction fees taken from Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, dropped to a weekly low of 3.18 Ether ( ETH ) during the week of March 30, according to data from Etherscan . Using current Ether prices, the 3.18 ETH collected for blob fees during the period equaled approximately $5,000. In April 2025, Ethereum network fees dropped to their lowest levels since 2020 , averaging around $0.16 per transaction. According to Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan, the dramatic reduction in fees is due to fewer users sending transactions on the Ethereum base layer, opting instead to use smart contracts or one of Ethereum's many layer-2 scaling solutions. Ethereum network weekly transaction fees declined significantly in Q1 2025. Source: Token Terminal Ethereum's layer-2 networks have been described as a double-edged sword that dramatically lowered transaction costs on the base layer but also cannibalized the Ethereum base layer's revenue. Concerns surrounding revenue generation on the base layer and the corrosive effects of layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum's market share have driven the price of Ether to historic lows and could plunge Ether prices further to around $1,100 if investor confidence continues to wane.

Its unique value proposition in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has gained substantial attention from both retail and institutional investors. With its presale nearly sold out and a significant listing price surge expected, Rexas leads the list of the five most talked-about cryptos this quarter. Rexas Finance (RXS) Redefines Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance enables users to tokenize assets like real estate, art, and commodities, giving global investors fractional access. This innovation sets it apart from speculative coins, as tangible assets and real utility back RXS. As a result, market participants are treating RXS as a credible long-term investment rather than a short-term trend. The presale phase has exceeded expectations, raising over $47 million and selling over 91% of the total allocation. The token‚Äôs price increased over sixfold from $0.03 to $0.20, and it is set to list at $0.25. This growth and real-world use have intensified investor interest ahead of the June 19 launch. Rexas Finance also focused on building investor confidence through a full Certik audit, assuring users of its secure infrastructure. Community engagement remains strong, highlighted by a $1 million giveaway with over 1.65 million participants. With momentum building, experts consider Rexas the most promising crypto project of 2025, and adoption is expected to accelerate further. Trust Wallet Token (TWT) Expands Utility Through Growing Ecosystem Trust Wallet Token continues to grow steadily as it crosses 200 million downloads, making it one of the top self-custody wallets. TWT is trading at $0.9021, with minor gains in the past 24 hours and consistent trading activity. The platform‚Äôs decision to remove swap fees on the BNB Smart Chain has increased daily users. Based on current usage metrics, analysts forecast a potential April high of $1.548, indicating a possible 71.61% price surge. However, May might bring a correction with the price averaging near $0.712, offering short-term trading opportunities. Still, rising demand for non-custodial wallets may drive steady long-term performance for TWT. While Trust Wallet shows steady growth, it lacks the innovation edge Rexas Finance brings with RWA tokenization. Rexas‚Äô tangible asset backing and rising presale numbers are drawing investor attention away from speculative utility tokens like TWT. As real-world use cases take center stage, Rexas continues gaining momentum in 2025. Render (RNDR) Leads in Decentralized GPU Sharing for 3D Projects Render offers a blockchain-based GPU marketplace, supporting artists and developers in rendering complex 3D designs affordably and efficiently. The platform enables GPU owners to rent out unused power, monetizing dormant resources while supporting creative industries. Demand for 3D rendering continues rising across gaming, entertainment, and virtual reality sectors. This increased need positions Render as a strong investment option, especially with traditional rendering proving costly and time-consuming. Blockchain simplifies transactions and ensures transparency, making Render‚Äôs platform attractive for both GPU owners and digital creators. It stands out among niche projects but remains largely utility-based. Though Render has carved out a valuable niche, it still doesn‚Äôt match the scale of real-world impact seen in Rexas Finance. Rexas‚Äô infrastructure allows real estate, commodities, and other hard assets to be tokenized and traded globally. This positions Rexas as a more comprehensive solution than sector-specific platforms like Render. Tezos (XTZ) Tezos continues to attract developers and enterprises due to its self-amending blockchain and focus on energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus. The blockchain‚Äôs ability to upgrade without hard forks has allowed continuous innovation without disrupting the network. Furthermore, on-chain voting keeps the network decentralized and community-driven. The protocol‚Äôs strategic partnerships with governments and institutions underline its long-term utility and potential for mainstream adoption. Its expanding ecosystem of dApps and NFTs also supports greater network activity and developer interest. However, growth has been gradual, and the project remains focused on infrastructure development. Unlike Tezos, Rexas Finance presents a clear path to immediate utility by directly addressing traditional finance limitations. Its platform is already active in a multibillion-dollar RWA market, where asset tokenization is expected to scale rapidly. This gives Rexas an edge over infrastructure-focused platforms with slower adoption curves. Toncoin (TON) Rebounds Amid Leadership Clarity and Growing User Base Toncoin recently regained traction following the release of Telegram founder Pavel Durov from French custody after legal scrutiny. TON has regained investor trust with 3‚Äì5 million active wallets and monthly trading volumes approaching $700 million. Additionally, $1.4 billion worth of USDT issued on the network boosts its credibility. The TON blockchain continues growing within Telegram‚Äôs ecosystem, offering seamless integration with messaging services and financial tools. While still 25% down year-to-date, the token posted an 8.3% gain in the past week following favorable news. Investors are cautiously optimistic as legal hurdles appear resolved. However, compared to TON, Rexas Finance is building from a more transparent and secure foundation with community-driven growth. Certified audits, successful presales, and real-world asset integration offer Rexas a stronger narrative for Q2 2025. Among all discussed projects, Rexas remains the most comprehensive and high-potential investment.

In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin‚Äôs smallest unit‚Äîthe Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can‚Äôt help but speculate on Ordi‚Äôs price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030?

Before that, ORDI had reached a high of $27.71 earlier in the year.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing fear among investors. On the charts, it is in consolidation and shows signs of breaking out upwards on the shorter timeframe. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market‚Äôs correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is currently trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the sats ordinals price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi‚Äôs price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Recent news Managing 1Sat Ordinals non-fungible tokens gets easier as blockchain data explorer and indexer WhatsOnChain supports the protocol with a set of APIs in beta testing. Developers can build tools to inscribe individual tokens and collectible series and retrieve any other relevant metadata. The development shows growing support for digital tokens built on the Ordinals principles.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI‚Äôs dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI‚Äôs popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $7 in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-20 16:19:48

This follows a new trader profile feature on Binance Square that allows users to disclose their digital asset holdings. Most users viewed this as a confidence boost amid the present market downturn taking a toll on crypto prices. Bitcoin Account For 1.32% According to the disclosure, the Binance CEO‚Äôs portfolio includes BNB, Bitcoin (BTC), EURI, and USDT. The Binance native asset accounts for 98.48% of holdings, while BTC accounts for 1.32%. EURI and USDT make up 0.17% and 0.03%, respectively. BNB leading the pack was expected, but the low Bitcoin share drew attention. For some community members, the amount of Bitcoin should have been more considering its utility and market cap. It has been argued that Bitcoin is the safest bet after stablecoins in the crypto market with higher projections as institutional volumes surge. Binance has also seen increased institutional interest in the asset after it soared to multiple all-time highs last year. The revelation by CZ comes after BNB donations for victims of Test and BROCOLLI rose to $1 million. On Feb 22, CZ asked for the community‚Äôs input on what to do with the newly added funds after previously donating $100k. ‚Äú I donated $100k (150 BNB) from this address. Now the address has received more than $1m back. I will not keep any of coins/tokens for myself. What should I do with it? Add to an LP pool? Airdrop? Donate to a charity? Send to a burn address? Any other ideas? Serious question. Limiting replies to people I follow to avoid spam. Will unfollow any spammers.‚Äù Stablecoin Volume Soars Although CZ holds a small amount of stablecoins compared to BNB, overall volumes have been on the rise. This follows a spike in general adoption both in institutional and retail players. Institutional holders see stablecoins as a safe asset when dabbling into the crypto market. This is due to the underlying asset, unlike other crypto with high volatility. Furthermore, stablecoins are utilized as bridge assets on several networks to expose users to decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens. Last year, stablecoin transaction volumes spiked 20.3% reaching a new high of $1.41 trillion. As expected, USDT accounted for a majority of gains at 79.2%.

However, Bittensor (TAO) and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) are operating in the overbought zone, making them susceptible to a possible significant reversal. Indeed, these assets have shown short-term rallies that may tempt traders into chasing green candles. Still, the overbought conditions often precede a stall or pullback. Notably, these conditions are highlighted by the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) readings. The RSI measures recent price momentum on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 signals overbought conditions, suggesting a potential slowdown or pullback. While not a guaranteed reversal, it often serves as a warning for traders to proceed cautiously or consider taking profits. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance FET, currently trading at $0.615, has surged 12.64% over the past 24 hours. However, its 12-hour RSI is 75.42, well above the overbought threshold of 70. FET price and RSI chart. Source: Coinglass Despite the short-term gains, the high RSI suggests that buying pressure has likely peaked, and a correction may be on the horizon. FET‚Äôs rally aligns with the broader momentum surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) tokens. These assets have seen significant buying interest during the recent market dip, partly spurred by a CoinGecko report highlighting AI as one of the most popular crypto themes. The report showed that AI tokens had a combined market interest of 24.5%, surpassing meme coins and fueling this short-term rally. Bittensor Meanwhile, Bittensor currently has a 12-hour RSI of 75.05, which also signals a potential slowdown in momentum. Despite a 9.47% gain over the past 24 hours, the elevated RSI suggests the recent rally may be losing steam. TAO price and RSI chart. Source: Coinglass Similar to FET, TAO‚Äôs surge follows renewed interest in AI-related tokens. However, with momentum indicators flashing warnings, traders may want to wait for a pullback or clearer confirmation before entering new positions. While technical indicators point to a cautionary picture, fundamentals around both assets suggest they may continue gaining momentum in the short term. As it stands, AI tokens are benefitting from renewed enthusiasm sparked by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang‚Äôs visit to Beijing, where he reaffirmed the company‚Äôs commitment to the Chinese market despite U.S. export bans on its H20 chip. The move reassured investors and boosted confidence in the broader AI sector. Nevertheless, beyond both technicals and fundamentals, the next trajectory for FET and TAO will also depend on the direction of the broader crypto market.

In a forecast shared on X, Brandt presented two possible year-end valuations for the digital asset, casting doubt on any near-term breakout to new highs. His outlook contrasts with more optimistic assessments recently offered by other analysts. And everyone's favorite, $XRP pic.twitter.com/Ftqo9njDzw ‚Äî Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 18, 2025 XRP‚Äôs Recent Price Movements XRP experienced a significant price surge at the start of the year, building on strong gains from late 2024. The asset rose over 500% from early November to a multi-year high of $3.39 in early January. The asset closed above $3 for 16 consecutive days and closed January at $3.0354, the highest monthly close in history. However, the asset has since experienced a notable pullback. The decline began in early February due to market uncertainty caused by Trump‚Äôs tariff threats . The decline continued in the following months, with the asset reaching a low point of $1.614, over 52% lower than its January peak. XRP has recovered from the dip and shows signs of consolidation, currently trading at $2.08. Brandt‚Äôs Bearish Outlook Brandt‚Äôs recent chart indicates two possible market capitalizations for XRP by year-end‚Äîapproximately $116.67 billion or slightly above $60 billion. Based on these valuations, he sees the price settling between $1.98 and $2.00, or closer to $1.02 and $1.07. He had previously identified these same levels during an earlier technical analysis, where he noted a potential head-and-shoulders pattern forming on XRP‚Äôs daily chart. In that context, $2 was identified as a major support level, while a breakdown could push XRP toward the $1.07 mark. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He also identified $3 as the level to invalidate the pattern, but the asset failed to reach this threshold. Brandt spent the early weeks of 2025 sharing bullish predictions for XRP . However, the market has shifted, and his outlook suggests that the asset may either consolidate around current levels or retreat further if key support zones fail to hold. Diverging Views from Other Analysts Despite Brandt‚Äôs bearish forecast, other analysts and financial institutions continue to project a far more bullish trajectory for XRP. According to Standard Chartered, XRP is expected to reach $5.50 by the end of 2025, with a longer-term target of $12.50 by 2028 . Even XRP skeptics like Davinci Jeremie have predicted that the digital asset could rise to $24 this year . While Brandt‚Äôs analysis presents a cautious outlook, other experts are confident that a price increase is coming soon.

Over the last three months, the premier cryptocurrency has traded as low as $74,000, representing a devaluation of over 32.5%. Although there has been a notable price bounce in April, an ever-present market uncertainty means speculation remains abound on the viability of the present bull cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance At Risk Of Crash To 40%, Why This Is Good For Ethereum, XRP, And Altcoins $49,000 As Key Price Level For Bitcoin ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why In an X post on April 18, Severino has identified the $49,000 price region as the make-or-break zone for the Bitcoin market. With the help of a weekly trading chart, Severino highlights that Bitcoin remains on an ascending trendline stretching as far back as Q3 2023. An ascending trendline represents a sustained uptrend in price action, typically confirmed by the formation of successive higher highs and higher lows. It typically demonstrates a persistent buying pressure and sufficient underlying demand, thus ensuring a prolonged price rally. Generally, the higher lows reflect the strength of an ascending trend. Therefore, any fall below the previous higher low undermines the bullish momentum and indicates a likely change in market sentiment. According to Severino‚Äôs chart, the last higher low on Bitcoin‚Äôs ascending trendline stands at $49,140. Therefore, this level represents a key support region, any price fall below which would invalidate the present bull run and signal a new market cycle. At the time of writing, Bitcoin remains in consolidation trading between $83,000 and $86,000 as seen over the past week. The market appears to be finding stability with accumulation now on the rise. Amid the US 90-day pause on new tariffs, the likelihood of a sharp downside catalyst is relatively low. However, the potential for a decisive price breakout remains uncertain, as broader market sentiment continues to face key resistance barriers at $86,000 and $91,000 price regions.

Interestingly, the asset‚Äôs trading volume is up 19.77% and valued at $15.26 billion. According to price prediction firm Coincodex, market sentiment among investors is neutral. However, there remains a significant level of caution with the Fear & Greed Index standing at 37. In forecasting Bitcoin fortunes, Coincodex anticipates a full bullish market reversal with projections of $108,296 in five days and $111,236 in a month.

Overall, institutional sales remained strong due to high Bitcoin (BTC) numbers, although altcoins traded in the opposite direction. Analysts expect a surge in altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) with the influx of fresh institutional capital. This month, the wider market has traded sideways, wiping out previous gains. Altcoins Outpace Bitcoin Data from CoinShares Digital Asset Weekly Flows shows a general bearish sentiment in crypto assets last week. XRP institutional inflows gained $38.3 million in the previous seven days, up from monthly inflows of $68.9 million. This increase comes despite a major market selloff, restating bullish sentiments. XRP became an institutional favorite last year after speculation about a major price jump due to certain factors. Large-scale investors flock around altcoins linked to a spot ETF, as seen in Ethereum last year. These products are huge market drivers, opening up a new investment window for traditional players. XRP whales accumulated assets after institutional signals continued to soar. Aside from ETFs, an easing in US regulations set the tone for larger inflows. Following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, XRP price soared from under the $1 mark to $3, hitting levels not seen in months. The asset temporarily displaced USDT as the third-largest crypto after its market cap soared above $140 billion. Currently, year-to-date (YTD) flows to XRP stand at $200 million due to a bullish January. Ethereum recorded $3.7 million in inflows, a slight increase compared to the total monthly gain of $789 million. This follows a sharp price drop below the $2,700 level after the infamous Bybit incident. YTD inflows are now over $984 million, with bulls looking to extend figures past the $1 billion mark. Solana and Cardano posted $9 million and $0.1 million inflows, respectively. Bitcoin Products Fall Short Bitcoin was the most affected digital asset from last week‚Äôs negative trading. Institutional exits totaled $571 million while overall net flows hit $508 million. Recent poor performance lowered sentiment as the price dipped below $100K. At this level, BTC traders hope to recover lost positions, but global macro factors pose a threat to bulls. ‚Äú We believe investors are exercising caution following the US Presidential inauguration and the consequent uncertainty around trade tariffs, inflation, and monetary policy. This is also evident in trading turnover, which has fallen considerably from US$22bn 2 weeks ago to US$13bn last week.‚Äù",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-20 16:34:58

Certain alternative cryptocurrencies are set for remarkable growth, and a modest $500 could potentially become $2 million. Among these digital coins, one unexpected option stands out. This exploration reveals how strategic altcoin choices could yield astonishing returns in the coming years. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse‚Äôs potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project‚Äôs estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 ‚Äì $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 ‚Äì $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings ‚Äì If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth ‚Äì Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions ‚Äì If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Chainlink (LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts to securely access external data sources, APIs, and systems. It bridges the gap between blockchain technology and the real world, enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world applications. Chainlink uses oracles to retrieve data, aggregates it to ensure accuracy, and delivers it securely to smart contracts. The LINK token is vital to this ecosystem, rewarding node operators for providing data, supporting staking for network security, and serving as payment for data services. The technology behind Chainlink expands the potential of blockchain applications by integrating both on-chain and off-chain architectures for efficient data processing. On-chain components manage data requests, while off-chain ones fetch external data. This allows smart contracts to respond to real-world events, enhancing their utility across various industries. The LINK token‚Äôs role in incentivizing data providers and maintaining decentralization contributes to the system‚Äôs reliability. As blockchain solutions continue to evolve, Chainlink‚Äôs approach positions it as a significant player in advancing smart contract functionalities. Introduction to Polkadot (DOT): Enhancing Interoperability in Blockchain Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol that facilitates secure communication between different blockchains. It enables the transfer of value and data across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. This interoperability is achieved through its unique architecture involving parachains, which are specialized blockchains that run parallel to the main chain. Parachains enhance speed and scalability, allowing Polkadot to process transactions more efficiently than traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is integral to Polkadot‚Äôs network functions. It is used for governance, giving holders the ability to participate in decision-making processes regarding the protocol‚Äôs development. Additionally, DOT is utilized for staking, which helps validate transactions and secure the network. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-creator of Ethereum, and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. Its technology addresses key challenges in the blockchain space, such as scalability and interoperability. In the current market cycle, Polkadot‚Äôs approach to connecting various blockchains highlights its role in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Solana (SOL): A Fast and Scalable Blockchain Platform Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with Ethereum and Cardano, it aims to process transactions faster and offers flexible development options in several programming languages. SOL is Solana‚Äôs native cryptocurrency. It is essential to the platform, used for transactions, running programs, and rewarding network supporters. SOL holds value by supporting the Solana ecosystem and giving access to various projects. Unlike some platforms, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it seeks to attract developers and investors with a high-capacity network capable of handling high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana‚Äôs focus on speed and scalability makes it notable in the blockchain community. TRON (TRX): A Blockchain Platform for Content Creators and Developers TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system established by the Tron Foundation in 2017. Initially, TRX tokens were launched on Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens but moved to their own network a year later. TRON aims to provide full ownership rights to digital content creators by facilitating direct interaction with consumers. This eliminates intermediaries like YouTube or Apple, allowing creators to receive greater rewards for their work. The platform supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps), enabling developers to build and share content without significant transaction fees. TRON‚Äôs technology has the potential to reshape the digital content industry by empowering creators and promoting a decentralized internet. As an alternative to platforms like Ethereum, TRON allows anyone to create dApps and offer content in exchange for digital assets. Its use of a transaction model similar to Bitcoin ensures transparency, with all transactions recorded on a public ledger. In the current market cycle, TRON presents an option for those interested in blockchain solutions focused on content creation and decentralized applications. Conclusion While LINK, DOT, SOL, and TRX are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin uniting fans and targeting massive growth.

On Friday, HashKey announced the launch of its HashKey Tracker Fund, designed to track the performance of Ripple‚Äôs cross-border payments token XRP. HashKey Capital Launches XRP Tracker Fund In Asia The new fund will be available to professional investors who want exposure to XRP without the hassle of directly managing or owning the asset. It will offer investors the ability to buy shares via cash or in-kind subscriptions and to subscribe or redeem them every month. According to the official announcement, Ripple is backing the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund as both an early and anchor investor. Ripple‚Äôs involvement is pivotal in bringing traditional finance and Web3 innovation. ‚ÄúXRP stands out as one of the most innovative cryptocurrencies in today‚Äôs market, attracting global enterprises who use it to transact, tokenize, and store value,‚Äù posited Vivien Wong, Partner, Liquid Funds at HashKey Capital, in a statement. ‚ÄúWith the first XRP Tracker Fund available in the region, we simplify access to XRP, catering to the demand for investment opportunities in the very best digital assets.‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs partnership with HashKey is part of a wider push to bring more regulated crypto products to institutions within Asia. CF Benchmark will serve as the new fund‚Äôs benchmark provider. ‚ÄúInstitutional investors are eager to access regulated products around the world, and this is exactly what the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund will deliver in the Asia-Pacific region,‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs Managing Director APAC, Fiona Murray, said. XRP-Based Investment Products Gain Significant Traction The debut of HashKey‚Äôs XRP Tracker Fund comes as investment vehicles tied to XRP gain ground across the globe amid a more favorable regulatory environment for these products and widening acceptance among retail and institutional investors. As you may recall, Brazil was the first country in the world to greenlight a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is listed on the country‚Äôs B3 stock exchange. In the United States, multiple asset managers, including Bitwise , 21Shares , Franklin Templeton , and Grayscale , have submitted paperwork for spot XRP funds. XRP is the fourth-biggest digital asset with a $121 billion market cap as of publication time. Earlier this month, asset manager Teucrium debuted the first leveraged XRP ETF on the NYSE Arca, which saw ‚Äú respectable‚Äù first-day trading volumes. While Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst said it was ‚Äúvery odd‚Äù to see a new asset‚Äôs first ETF come in leveraged form, he emphasized that the odds of a U.S.-listed spot XRP product being given the nod by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remain ‚Äúpretty high.‚Äù",Cryptocurrency|News|Asia|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-20 16:49:19

However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform‚Äôs adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market‚Äôs growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM‚Äôs all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let‚Äôs dive into Sonic‚Äôs price predictions for 2025 and beyond.

The price is currently hovering near the middle band of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting indecision among traders. The RSI indicator sits at approximately 45.73, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions and aligning with a sideways movement. Additionally, the candlesticks reflect reduced volatility and tightening price action, which often precedes a breakout. A move above the upper Bollinger Band around $0.53 could signal a bullish trend, while a drop below $0.42 might confirm bearish continuation. Traders should monitor volume and momentum indicators for clearer direction. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart Sonic/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Sonic (formerly FTM) shows signs of mild bullish momentum amid a broader consolidation phase. The price currently trades near the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting market indecision, while the MACD histogram is flatlining with slightly converging lines, pointing to weakening momentum. The Balance of Power indicator shows a recent spike toward bullish territory at 0.87, indicating a possible increase in buyer strength. However, price action remains range-bound between $0.457 and $0.477, and a decisive breakout above the upper Bollinger Band is necessary to confirm an upward shift. Until then, short-term sideways movement with slight bullish bias persists.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Sonic (formerly FTM) is exhibiting a consolidative pattern with signs of weakening bullish momentum. On the 1-day chart, the price remains below the middle Bollinger Band, reflecting ongoing bearish pressure, while the RSI hovers near the neutral 45 level, suggesting indecision. On the 4-hour chart, the Balance of Power indicator has surged into bullish territory, and MACD lines are narrowing, indicating possible accumulation. However, the price continues to oscillate within a tight range. Unless Sonic decisively breaks above resistance around $0.48, the near-term outlook remains neutral with potential for short-term upward attempts. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $1.03 price by 2025 and $6.99 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and an assessment of personal risk tolerance are essential steps for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $5 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $5.39. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic can approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $10. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast that prices could reach between $5.89 and $6.99, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

The meme coin faithful built a legacy, but heads are turning to Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) ‚Äîits presale‚Äôs live at $0.0000001907, and it‚Äôs poised to lead a new meme coin revolution. As the first crypto for the $25 billion influencer economy‚Äîset to hit $48 billion by 2027‚ÄîINPEPE‚Äôs the spark SHIB holders are chasing. Here‚Äôs why. INPEPE‚Äôs Presale Ignites Meme Coin Fever The vibrant community surrounding SHIB is well aware of what it takes to identify a winning opportunity, and they are now setting their sights on INPEPE‚Äôs presale, which is currently priced at an enticing $0.0000001907. This presale is structured to progress through 60 stages, making it an exciting prospect for investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing in the crypto space. With a staggering total supply of 380 trillion tokens, a significant portion‚Äî104.5 trillion tokens, or 27.5%‚Äîis available for purchase. For just $50, investors can acquire a whopping 276 million INPEPE tokens today. If the token experiences a remarkable surge of 100X, reaching a price of $0.00001808, it would result in a market cap of approximately $6.87 billion, bringing it close to SHIB‚Äôs current market capitalization. A more ambitious 150X increase, pushing the price to $0.00002712, would elevate the market cap to around $10.31 billion. Furthermore, if INPEPE manages to capture just 5% of the $48 billion influencer market by the year 2027, which translates to a potential market value of $2.4 billion, the price could soar to $0.0000304. This would represent an astonishing 168X increase, resulting in a market cap of $11.55 billion, making it a highly attractive investment opportunity for those looking to get in early. INPEPE‚Äôs Revolutionary Edge SHIB capitalized on the wave of meme hype, but now we have INPEPE, which is making its mark as the very first cryptocurrency designed specifically for the booming $48 billion influencer economy. This innovative digital currency is set to facilitate seamless payments across popular social media platforms such as X, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Imagine the possibilities: X tips for creators, TikTok collaboration splits, campaign fees on Instagram, or revenue shares from YouTube content. Additionally, staking INPEPE at an impressive 5300% APY not only rewards holders but also locks up supply, potentially reducing circulation by a significant one-third. Furthermore, a substantial 20% of the total supply, which amounts to 76 trillion INPEPE, is strategically allocated to fuel influencer hype across these platforms, reaching millions of users. While SHIB remains a classic in the crypto space, INPEPE is poised to be the revolutionary force driving the future of influencer-driven transactions! Why SHIB Investors Are Pivoting In 2020, SHIB‚Äôs investment of $50 at a price of $0.00000006 soared to a peak value of $13,750. For INPEPE, a $50 investment at $0.0000001907 could yield $4,989 at 100X leverage and $7,484 at 150X by 2026, assuming influencer support. With 15% (57 trillion INPEPE) allocated for liquidity and 10% (38 trillion) for development‚Äîenvisioning creator payment platforms‚ÄîINPEPE is designed to take the lead. SHIB investors are eager for the next big opportunity‚ÄîINPEPE is that opportunity! FOMO Fuels the Revolution SHIB‚Äôs turning heads‚ÄîINPEPE‚Äôs presale at $0.0000001907 is live, and $48 billion‚Äôs in sight. Influencers are hyping it up online, which could make it the new meme coin leader. Every stage hikes the price as the Q3/Q4 2025 launch looms. Don‚Äôt wait, head over to the presale now and buy INPEPE using ETH, BNB, USDT, or card before FOMO hits. SHIB is the past; INPEPE‚Äôs the future‚Äîgrab it now! Visit the Influencer Pepe website.

This time, Kiyosaki has forecasted a $1 million Bitcoin price by 2035. U.S. Debt Crisis In a recent post on X, Robert Kiyosaki stated that the U.S. is currently deep in debt, which has soared to all-time highs ‚Äî both the national debt and credit card debt. The financial educator also noted that the level of unemployment is on the rise, and pension funds (401 Ks) are losing money as the US dollar continues to lose value to inflationary monetary policies. ‚ÄúThe USA may be heading for a greater depression,‚Äù he warned. Kiyosaki reminded his followers that he had predicted all that in his book Rich Dad‚Äôs Prophecy, released in the early 2000s. The book was about ‚Äúthe coming biggest stock market crash in history‚Ä¶.that is here now.‚Äù Like many sound money champions, Kiyosaki has continually cautioned of an upcoming financial crash spurred by expansionist monetary policies and fiscal irresponsibility. Bitcoin maximalists contend that loose monetary policy will catapult the BTC price to seven figures. Kiyosaki Sees Bitcoin Price at $1 Million Kiyosaki has long asserted that assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin are crucial hedges against inflation and critical to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles. Investing in these assets, Kiyosaki thinks, may help an investor ‚Äúcome through this crisis a very rich person.‚Äù It will be too late for those who wait until after this giant crash. The pundit said he strongly believes that a single Bitcoin would be worth $1 million by 2035, and gold and silver would reach a price of at least $30,000 and $3,000, respectively. ‚ÄúIt will be the easiest money you ever made,‚Äù Kiyosaki says. Bitcoin has declined since it set a new all-time high in January. It has been trading sideways this month, and is roughly 22% off its record high near $109,000, set on Jan. 20, the day of U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only financial expert predicting a $1 million price tag for the premier cryptocurrency. Ex-Twitter CEO and now founder and backer of several crypto projects, Jack Dorsey, previously said Bitcoin will go as high as $1 million by 2030. Ark Invest founder and CEO Cathie Wood has even taken it a step further, forecasting the top asset will reach $1.5 million by 2030 .",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Robert Kiyosaki,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-20 16:52:31
43582086,https://coinpedia.org/?p=445538,1745168088,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) and 2 More Altcoins You Can‚Äôt Afford to Miss in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/dogecoin-doge-and-2-more-altcoins-you-cant-afford-to-miss-in-2025/,"The post Dogecoin (DOGE) and 2 More Altcoins You Can‚Äôt Afford to Miss in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) showed strong market growth by reaching $0.1569 while increase and 3.3% within 24 hours because of open interest that jumped 5% to reach $1.54 billion. The XRP price at $2.12 has succeeded in surpassing significant resistance points which indicates it may reach $27-$30 within the near future. The Mutuum finance project (MUTM) continues to attract investors during its phase 4 presale which has reached $7 million mark through 415 million token sales at $0.025 to over 8,400 holder addresses. Let‚Äôs explore these promising gems. Dogecoin‚Äôs Meme-Powered Surge Dogecoin (DOGE) marks an optimistic period at its current exchange rate of $0.1569. The market for Dogecoin futures continues to surge after platform businesses including Binance and OKX witnessed leveraged traders bet with their stakes reaching 9.87 billion DOGE. Open interest dramatically increased by 5% during this period. Technical analysts agree that rising prices are anticipated because of the falling wedge pattern. The forecast on Dogecoin predicts $0.29 as the most likely short-term value while analysts believe it may reach $5.60 eventually. If 21Shares successfully files for a Dogecoin Exchange-Traded Fund then institutional capital would likely drive up its price. The future sustainability of DOGE remains questionable because the currency heavily depends on social media popularity and it does not have a limited supply. XRP‚Äôs Technical Breakout XRP maintains a trading price of $2.12 as it breaks through its 50-day and 200-day averages. The technical analyst Rianenenpai identifies Bitcoin historic rally patterns while observing XRP rise through all-time high resistance. XRP has potential to move from its current position to $27-$30 through two intermediate targets of $2.99 and $4.58. Recent movements of 70 million XRP and indications from a new 2x Long Daily XRP ETF exchange-traded fund demonstrate that both institutional investors and retail clients are increasingly investing with confidence in whales on the network. Exchange market data shows fewer tokens indicate that holders expect future long-term profitability. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Momentum The MUTM token issued by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the fourth phase of its eleven-stage presale before reaching its final value of $0.025. Mutuum Finance managed to raise $7 million by vending 415 million tokens to acquire 8,400 holders. The current selling stage (phase 4) is moving rapidly while phase 5 introduces a 20% price increase to $0.03 which will automatically benefit existing investors with a 20% profit. The tokenomics ensure a $0.06 listing price for MUTM tokens which gives investors a 140% profit. Market analysts predict MUTM will reach $2.50 after launch which would provide a 9,900% return on investment for earliest willing investors. The team is completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts which will be released to social platforms to enhance credibility. Innovative Lending Model and Investor Incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers innovative investor benefits through its decentralized lending service model. The platform combines overcollateralized loans with mtTokens that earn interest continuously as they provide both income generation and liquidity features. Platform-generated revenue streams allow the buy-and-distribute system to repurchase MUTM tokens which provide rewards to stakers and stimulates market demand. A new dashboard presentation of the top 50 holders now offers bonus tokens to users for staying within the leader ranking. The $100,000 MUTM token giveaway attracts investors through its ten $10,000 prize winnings. Phase 4 offers investors the entry price of $0.025 since it marks the lowest point before the upcoming price increase to $0.03. Investors stay invested through the combined rewards of a referral program and stake-exclusive features. FOMO effect is intensifying because MUTM currently has 8400 holders among the incoming phase 5 launch. MUTM‚Äôs focus on real-world DeFi applications, unlike DOGE‚Äôs hype or XRP‚Äôs market swings, positions it for explosive growth. The initial investors who enters into MUTM before its exchange launch will capture substantial gains. Seize the Opportunity Three cryptocurrency projects have established unique directions within the projected crypto market of 2025: Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). DOGE depends on public enthusiasm while it fails to establish concrete technical elements. System analysts confirm that XRP displays technical breakout potential but its market performance remains erratic. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as a presale winner through excellent tokenomics and decentralized finance (DeFi) utility which delivers predicted profits.

In a new interview on CNBC Squawk Box, Warren says that it would be disastrous for US markets if Trump somehow manages to force Powell out. ‚ÄúIf Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it would crash the markets in the United States. The infrastructure that keeps this stock market strong and therefore a big part of our economy strong, and therefore a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independent of the politics, that somebody is making their best decisions economically and independently. We understand that if the New York Stock Exchange, if interest rates in the United States are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn‚Äôt distinguish us from any other two-bit dictatorship around the world where everyone knows what your really big investment risk is w ill that dictator wake up in the morning and have a tummy ache and decide to cause this problem, or favor that friend? That‚Äôs why we need to strengthen the infrastructure.‚Äù Recently, Reuters reported that Trump is ‚Äústudying‚Äù to see if he can fire Powell, who has served as the Fed Chair since 2018 and was appointed by Trump during his first term. Despite being Trump‚Äôs appointee, Powell‚Äôs relationship with Trump has been strained as of late due to conflicts in interest rate outlook. Trump wants the Fed to immediately cut interest rates, but Powell has determined that the right course of action is to be patient and keep rates steady.

The halving, which reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, appears to have triggered not only scarcity-driven optimism but also speculation around a faster market cycle. Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Global Tensions Since the May 2024 halving, Bitcoin has surged over 33%, even as fears surrounding a global trade war between the U.S. and China have escalated. ‚ÄúSo, even though Bitcoin‚Äôs showing resilience, I think the mix of past experiences, economic uncertainty, and this selling pressure is keeping investors on the sidelines, waiting for a stronger green light before they jump in,‚Äù said Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken. Cardozo believes institutional players could influence the timing of this cycle. ‚ÄúFor the 2024 halving in May, that puts the bottom around Q3 this year and a peak mid-2026, but I think we might see things move a bit sooner because the market‚Äôs more mature now with more liquidity.‚Äù Monetary Policy Could Shape BTC‚Äôs Next Leg Up Cardozo also pointed to potential monetary policy moves as a catalyst. A U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut, possibly in May or June, could inject additional liquidity into markets and help push Bitcoin higher. The halving mechanism itself is a built-in feature of Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy, designed to reduce supply and maintain scarcity. This supply shock, when paired with heightened demand, has historically preceded bull runs. Institutional Demand and ETFs Alter the Playing Field Another analyst, Vugar Usi Zade of Bitget, suggested the market cycle might be accelerating due to institutional adoption and ETF activity. ‚ÄúWith growing scarcity triggered by the halving, Bitcoin will likely retest its all-time high if it breaches the $90,000 mark in the coming weeks,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWhile the halving offers a good basis for growth based on demand and scarcity, the timeline for impact on price can vary over time.‚Äù Zade emphasized that Bitcoin‚Äôs growth remains closely tied to broader financial markets and investor sentiment. New All-Time High Came Quicker Than Previous Cycles Recent price action supports the idea of a compressed cycle. According to data from trader Jelle, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $109,000 on January 20‚Äîjust 273 days after the 2024 halving. That‚Äôs a significant acceleration compared to previous cycles: the 2021 halving took 546 days to peak, and the 2017 cycle needed 518 days. As the ecosystem matures with institutional players, ETFs, and evolving market dynamics, many analysts believe Bitcoin may no longer follow its traditional four-year pattern. Instead, the cryptocurrency could be entering a new era of accelerated, liquidity-driven growth.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-20 16:59:50

In simple terms, the metric is the income miners can expect per unit of computing power, denoted by per petahash (PH/s). It can be denominated in U.S. dollars or BTC, although it's most commonly quoted in USD for practical comparison. At present, hashprice sits at $44.00 PH/s, only slightly above its August 2024 low, when bitcoin reached $49,000 amid the yen carry trade unwind. Currently, bitcoin is trading around $84,000. Despite the higher BTC price, miner revenue is dwindling, which paints a dire picture of the mining industry as a whole after the recent halving event cut the rewards by half. Rising competition, higher mining difficulty, lower transaction revenue, and spiking energy costs have added more pressure to the revenue. However, it's not all bad. At around $44.00 PH/s levels, depending on what type of mining machines miners are using, miners can still be near or at breakeven, although far from 2021's mining bull run. Looking ahead, deteriorating market conditions, stagnant bitcoin prices, and geopolitical uncertainty, such as potential tariffs affecting mining operations, could create further headwinds for the industry. This is reflected in the performance of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), which is down 50% year-to-date while BTC fell about 10%, underscoring the challenging environment facing the mining sector. It makes sense that miners are increasingly pivoting into other revenue streams, such as reallocating computing power for artificial intelligence.

This token that was launched with so much hype earlier this year has lost around 90% of its value from its all time high. And to make things worse a $300 million token unlock just happened and flooded the market with tokens and is causing concern among investors. With token unlocks until 2028 Trump Coin‚Äôs inflationary tokenomics has left its holders in a precarious position. While Trump Coin is making headlines for all the wrong reasons, there‚Äôs another project that‚Äôs making waves for all the right reasons. Ruvi AI , a fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence is redefining what it means to invest in the crypto space. Why Ruvi AI is Revolutionary Ruvi AI sits at the intersection of technology and usability, offering AI powered tools through its superapp for creators, businesses and developers. Whether it‚Äôs automating workflows, generating content or optimizing decision making Ruvi AI will bring tangible benefits to its users. Its $RUVI token anchors the ecosystem, ensuring secure and transparent transactions and huge growth potential for early investors. Unlike Trump Coin‚Äôs inflationary model that dilutes value, Ruvi AI is designed to reward participants meaningfully. The presale has already smashed expectations, selling over 10 million tokens and raising $100,000 in just days of its launch. With a presale price of $0.01 per token and a confirmed listing price of $0.07 per token Ruvi AI is offering unprecedented opportunities for its early adopters. VIP Tier 4 Ruvi AI‚Äôs carefully crafted VIP tiers offer investors significant bonuses, encouraging early participation. Among these VIP Tier 4 is an excellent opportunity for those who are willing to make a bigger commitment. To qualify for VIP Tier 4 an investor must buy 200,000 RUVI tokens, that‚Äôs an initial commitment of $2,000 at the current $0.01 presale price. The bonus in this tier is an impressive 80%, that‚Äôs an additional 160,000 tokens on top of the original purchase At $0.07 these 360,000 tokens would be worth $25,200. But that‚Äôs not all. Industry experts predict Ruvi AI‚Äôs post listing value to go to $1 per token which would be $360,000 for Tier 4 holders.

This intriguing project, codename: Pepe crypto, sets itself apart as a stark contrast to the pretenders in the market. With the crypto market witnessing a flourishing period, readers are eager to uncover the opportunities Codename: Pepe crypto presents. This coin promises a unique blend of humor and high returns, making it one to watch closely. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents ‚Äîshady operators promising ‚Äúnext-gen intelligence‚Äù while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That‚Äôs why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains.

Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Pepe Cryptocurrency Overview Pepe is a cryptocurrency inspired by the viral meme of Pepe the Frog, created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. This digital currency is a meme coin using Ethereum‚Äôs ERC-20 standard. It‚Äôs designed to be simple and transparent, with a strong community focus. The project‚Äôs development is divided into three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. Pepe does not aim for lofty promises but instead keeps things fun and straightforward, staying true to its meme origins. Currently, Pepe is one of the top meme coins, with significant competition from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its market position is notable, ranking within the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, its price can be volatile. Predictions vary widely regarding its future value, with some analysts suggesting potential growth while others anticipate challenges. Pepe‚Äôs market performance depends largely on continued community engagement and general market trends. Conclusion With the bull run in full swing, coins like PEPE may offer limited potential in the short term. Codename:Pepe crypto, however, stands out by unleashing true intelligence to maximize profits. By employing advanced AI for market analysis and automated trading, Codename:Pepe crypto helps investors navigate the meme coin market. Its community-focused approach and capped supply make it a promising option. Early participation could secure a significant advantage in this innovative project.

It found solid ground and recovered above $0.01. After a short break, it is showing signs of strength again daily. After months of wide correction, Jasmy located support at $0.0082 earlier this month and marked the above price as its lowest trading level in a year. Luckily, the level bolstered, and the price increased daily until it reached a high of $0.0178, posting a 100% gain within a week. This led to a notable break above a falling descending trendline, serving as resistance for four months. Unfortunately, the buying stopped due to a rejection, and the price fell. That triggered a slight pullback, but the broken trendline provided support, and the price climbed back yesterday. It appears strong today amid rising demand. A surge above last week‚Äôs high should set the stage for more gains in the coming days. While the mid-term outlook is still considered bearish, selling pressure may return if the price falls back under the falling trendline. However, it is important to note that its trading landscape has technically changed as the crypto bias turns bullish on the daily chart. Looking at the latest price actions, it may rally into the $0.03 level anytime soon. JASMY Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview In a fresh surge, Jasmy is trying to reclaim the $0.0178 resistance level, rejected last week. Surpassing this resistance could rally the price to the $0.025 level and potentially $0.035 in the future. The $0.0134 level is currently supporting the latest surge. If it fails to hold well, it may navigate the key $0.01 level for support, along with the yearly $0.0082 low. Key Resistance Levels: $0.0178, $0.025, $0.035 Key Support Levels: $0.0131, $0.01, $0.0082 Spot Price: $0.0153 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Van de Poppe stated that despite the losses he experienced, he developed new strategies and made some changes to rebalance his portfolio. He explained that he sold his $20,000 position in the ENS token and directed this capital to different altcoins.

Van de Poppe said that the value losses experienced in altcoins are not only specific to crypto, and that macroeconomic developments are also effective in these declines, and that developments such as the weakening of the Chinese yuan (renminbi) against the dollar increase the pressure on risky assets. He also said that current market interest is at its lowest levels in the last three years, describing this as a ‚Äúclear indicator of a bear market‚Äù: ‚ÄúInterest in crypto has fallen to August 2023 levels. This means the lowest interest in the last 2.5 years.‚Äù Although the current picture is bleak, Van de Poppe argued that this environment also presents great opportunities. The analyst said he plans to rebuild a strong portfolio by maintaining his strategy over the next 6 to 12 months. *This is not investment advice.

While established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, the real action is happening in high-potential projects that are solving real-world problems. This week, Qubetics is leading the charge, with its groundbreaking Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace and TICSScan setting the stage for blockchain adoption at an unprecedented scale. Meanwhile, Monero remains a top privacy-focused crypto, and Cosmos is expanding its cross-chain interoperability capabilities. If you‚Äôre looking to position yourself early in the next big wave of crypto winners, these projects deserve your attention. Qubetics: The Game-Changer for RWA Tokenization One of the biggest problems in traditional finance is the difficulty of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) into blockchain-based digital assets. The current financial system is slow, fragmented, and filled with intermediaries that drive up costs. Whether it‚Äôs real estate, luxury goods, or intellectual property, moving these assets into the digital economy is a challenge‚Äîuntil now. Qubetics is revolutionizing asset tokenization by creating a seamless, decentralized marketplace where users can tokenize, trade, and invest in real-world assets on the blockchain. Imagine a world where a high-end real estate property in New York, a rare art piece in Paris, or a manufacturing plant in Tokyo can be fractionalized and bought by anyone worldwide in a few clicks. This opens up an entirely new level of investment accessibility, making previously illiquid assets tradeable 24/7. For small business owners, it means accessing global capital without relying on slow, outdated banking systems. For retail participants, it means owning a share of high-value assets with ease. The Best Altcoins to Invest in Now are those solving major real-world problems‚Äîand Qubetics is doing just that. Qubetics‚Äô Presale: The Opportunity of 2025? Qubetics is quickly proving it‚Äôs no ordinary presale. With over $16.2 million raised, 508 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 24,900 holders already on board, it‚Äôs clear momentum is building. At just $0.1729 per token in Stage 30, each presale phase wraps every Sunday at midnight‚Äîfollowed by an automatic 10% price jump. Those jumping in early? They‚Äôre already sitting on gains before the token even hits exchanges. A $100 buy-in today could turn into $477.85 at $1, and over $8,500 if $TICS reaches $15. With a real Web3 product and mainnet launching in Q2 2025, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just buzz‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the best crypto presales with actual staying power. With its Q2 2025 mainnet launch in sight and a growing use case in tokenizing real-world assets, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another presale‚Äîit‚Äôs being flagged as the best crypto presale opportunity to get ahead of. Monero: Privacy Remains King Monero (XMR) continues to dominate the privacy coin sector, standing strong despite increasing government scrutiny on anonymous transactions. With privacy concerns growing, Monero‚Äôs ring signatures and stealth addresses make it one of the most secure cryptocurrencies for financial anonymity. Recently, Monero‚Äôs daily transaction volume has surged, indicating growing adoption in the privacy-focused sector. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a transparent ledger, Monero allows users to send and receive funds without revealing transaction details. This has made it a preferred choice for those prioritizing financial privacy. With regulators clamping down on centralized exchanges, Monero‚Äôs decentralized and private nature is making it more valuable than ever. As privacy concerns continue to rise, XMR could see significant price appreciation in the coming months. Cosmos: The Interoperability Powerhouse Cosmos (ATOM) has cemented itself as a key player in blockchain interoperability, enabling seamless communication between independent blockchains. As more projects aim to integrate cross-chain capabilities, Cosmos‚Äô Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is gaining widespread adoption. Recent developments have expanded Cosmos‚Äô ecosystem, bringing in new partnerships and increased staking activity. With ATOM staking yields reaching competitive levels, more community members are locking up their tokens, reducing circulating supply and driving up demand. As the multi-chain future unfolds, Cosmos‚Äô technology could become a crucial infrastructure layer, making it one of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now for exponential returns. Conclusion: The Next Big Crypto Boom Is Here Crypto markets are full of opportunities, but only a handful of projects have real long-term potential. Qubetics, Monero, and Cosmos are among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now for exponential returns, each offering unique advantages that could drive significant growth. Qubetics is redefining asset tokenization and blockchain transparency, positioning itself as a top Web3 disruptor. Monero‚Äôs privacy features continue to make it a go-to choice for anonymous transactions. Cosmos is expanding blockchain interoperability, ensuring seamless communication across networks. For those seeking early-stage gains, Qubetics‚Äô crypto presale is still open, but time is running out. With weekly price increases, now is the moment to join the Qubetics presale before the next price jump.

43582937,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=712735,1745169316,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43582937.jpeg,Warren Buffett thinks market chaos is a gift for investors who keep their heads on straight,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-warren-buffett-thinks-of-market-chaos/,"Warren Buffett told investors to stay calm during times of extreme market panic, and now, in the middle of one of the most chaotic periods in recent memory, his words are being tested again. The advice first came during Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs annual meeting back in 1997, when he brought up the meltdown of 1974, a year that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average collapse by 52% from its 1972 high. That market crash came during a storm of rising inflation, a global oil crisis, and political chaos fueled by the Watergate scandal. ‚ÄúThe country didn‚Äôt disappear or anything,‚Äù Warren said at the time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just people behave in extreme ways in markets. And over time, that‚Äôs very good for people that keep their heads.‚Äù Earlier this month, the S&P 500 briefly dropped over 20% from its February high, slipping into bear market territory before managing a slight bounce. The Dow dropped 1,500 points two days in a row, something that hasn‚Äôt happened since the index was first created in 1896. Those dips didn‚Äôt spook Warren. The 94-year-old investor is almost certainly watching the downturn as a shopping opportunity. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, is sitting on $334 billion in cash as of the end of 2024 ‚Äî the most it has ever held ‚Äî which now makes up 30% of total assets. With two weeks to go before his company‚Äôs next big shareholder meeting, many expect Warren to show where he might spend some of that pile. Warren holds cash while others sell under pressure Warren treats stocks like ownership in full businesses, not just numbers on a screen. ‚ÄúThe stock market is there to serve you, and not to instruct you. And that‚Äôs a key to owning a good business, and getting rid of the risk that would otherwise exist in the market,‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make any difference to us whether the volatility of the stock market averages a half a percent a day or a quarter percent a day or 5% a day. In fact, we‚Äôd make a lot more money if volatility was higher, because it would create more mistakes in the market.‚Äù Those mistakes are already piling up on Wall Street. Two weeks after Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff stunt, all major indexes finished another brutal week. Both the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite dropped over 2%, while the S&P 500 slid more than 1%. Markets were shut down on April 18 for Good Friday, but the mess stayed. Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said the worst-case tariff scenario is likely over. ‚ÄúWe know the worst case scenario with tariffs, and we know that they‚Äôre being negotiated,‚Äù Jay said. ‚ÄúSo the impact that people were fearful of when we sold off ‚Äî the worst case seems to be done.‚Äù Jay added that what happens next depends on how deep the longer-term effects go. ‚ÄúNow we have to see where we land, and what kind of longer term impact it will have on the market, on the stocks that drive this market.‚Äù He said he‚Äôs watching the 5,130 level on the S&P 500, calling it a key Fibonacci retracement point. It could be a bottom, but he‚Äôs not sold yet. ‚ÄúI still think we have a lot of work to do to sound the all-clear signal, that‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù While stocks churn, analysts are eyeing earnings. More than 120 S&P 500 companies are expected to report results next week. That includes big names like Alphabet and Tesla, part of the Magnificent Seven group of market movers. So far, 72% of companies that have reported beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The entire altcoin market is expected to ride the wave, and some tokens could multiply far more dramatically than ETH itself. Ripple (XRP), once a legal underdog, is now targeting $15 as utility and adoption align. Cardano (ADA), building quietly but steadily, may finally see its breakout moment, with $10 in sight. And then there‚Äôs Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi upstart that analysts say could explode to $8, positioning it as one of 2025‚Äôs most surprising success stories. MUTM‚Äôs real-world lending utility, plus a just-launched leaderboard dashboard is rewarding its top 50 holders with bonus tokens. The Mutuum Finance team is currently having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a crucial step in ensuring security and trust. Once completed, the official audit report will be published on their social media channels. Mutuum Finance Presale Speeds Up with Investor Enthusiasm Growing Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized finance through its groundbreaking dual-lending architecture, which has fast become a favorite among DeFi users. The project has already raised $6.9 million from more than 8,400 presale investors, a clear indication of growing confidence. With Phase 4 at a price of $0.025, the projected 20% boost in Phase 5 creates a better incentive for early profit. In appreciation of its out-of-the-box lending mechanisms as well as burgeoning market demand, analysts believe that MUTM might be among the most under-valued DeFi tokens, forecasting it to reach more than $8 during its launch. Redefining Lending in a Dual-Model Framework Mutuum Finance is different from the rest for its hybrid structure for DeFi lending, putting together the strongest features of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Through the P2C model, clients passively earn returns by providing USDT to liquidity pools facilitated by smart contracts. Concomitantly, the P2P model enables bilateral trading of assets between clients without third-party mediation, offering maximum freedom and transparency. By amalgamating both models, the platform becomes more efficient and secure, suited for DeFi clients in need of high-yielding investment avenues. Mutuum Finance is further developing an all-collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain, once again demonstrating its concern for financial stability. As compared to algorithmic stablecoins, this token will be backed with excess reserves for risk minimization and long-term stability. Its audited smart contracts and open-source nature build investor confidence a step further by eliminating common risks that affected other DeFi platforms. Sparking Community Expansion With Rewards To fuel community expansion, Mutuum Finance has launched incentive reward programs. There will be ten winners in a $100,000 giveaway that will each win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. On top of this, a referral reward program with flexible rewards motivates users to recruit new members. Early investors enjoy additional privileges such as access to exclusive staking pools, governance, and VIP updates, entrenching them in further fueling the growth of the project. Smart Tokenomics for Sustainable Expansion The project tokenomics are strategically designed to mix scarcity with value appreciation over time. Controlled distribution of presales and deflationary mechanisms serve to create scarcity, enhancing the value of the tokens in the long term. Staking incentives, conversely, drive intensive community interaction and ensure long-term token viability in the Mutuum ecosystem. If Ethereum hits the $20,000 mark, the altcoin market won‚Äôt just follow, it could explode, and few tokens are better positioned to capitalize on that momentum than Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and especially Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With $6.9 million already raised from over 8,400 investors and a presale price of $0.025, analysts are eyeing a potential $8 valuation post-launch. As investor enthusiasm accelerates and Phase 5 approaches, now is the time to act before the next price jump solidifies Mutuum Finance as 2025‚Äôs DeFi dark horse.

Notably, Ethereum (ETH) is facing pressure from Solana (SOL) in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Solana‚Äôs Fast L1 Gains vs. Ethereum L2 Commitment Hayden Adams, founder of Uniswap, believes that for Ethereum to stand a chance against Solana, the blockchain needs to focus on Layer-2 scaling. In an update shared on X, Adams maintains that Ethereum‚Äôs best chance in the DeFi space is to continue its Layer-2 scaling development. Solana has a better roadmap, team, and and approach if the plan is to do defi on L1 /vertical scaling Ethereum has been working towards L2 centric / horizontal scaling roadmap for 5+ years You want to throw this away at the final stretch because of what reason? ‚Äî Hayden Adams ü¶Ñ (@haydenzadams) April 19, 2025 For perspective, Ethereum and Solana have adopted different approaches to scaling. Ethereum is focused on Layer-2 scaling or horizontal scaling. That is, it allows separate networks like Optimism and Arbitrum to handle transactions and reflect the data on Ethereum. Conversely, Solana operates vertical or Layer-1 scaling, and everything happens fast on a high-performance chain. Adams acknowledges Solana‚Äôs strengths but believes Ethereum needs to complete its L2-focused roadmap. Layer-2 Maturity Could Be Ethereum‚Äôs Turning Point Notably, Ethereum pivoted to L2 in 2020 after assessing the challenges of L1. However, after five years on this route, the community calls for reconsidering its approach. Some insist that L2 solutions are pulling value away from the Ethereum mainnet. However, the Uniswap founder is defending the Ethereum path, noting that this approach is nearing completion. ‚ÄúYou want to throw this away at the final stretch because of what reason?‚Äù he asked. Adams urges the community to remain confident and patient with Ethereum‚Äôs long-term plan. He suggests that the blockchain‚Äôs L2 scaling strategy is about to mature fully. Community Frustration Mounts Amid ETH Price Slump Meanwhile, as the scaling direction debate continues, ETH faces one of its worst quarterly performances in 10 years. ETH has not been able to shake off its downward plunges for some time. In fact, since March 27, 2025, the coin has not been able to breach the $2,000 resistance level. According to CoinMarketCap data, ETH has been trading down by 1.60% to $1,573.06 in the last 24 hours. Although the community remains bullish with an 11.05% uptick in trading volume to $7.6 billion, many desire an upward price trajectory.

Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A crypto analyst, Ali, reveals that a striking 72.13% of Binance users are long on Dogecoin ( DOGE ) futures, dwarfing the 27.87% short positions, while Surf flags a volatile chart pattern. As this bullish bias unfolds, altcoins like Minotaurus (MTAUR) ride the market‚Äôs hum. Are DOGE supporters onto a breakout, or is their optimism a setup for a shakeout? A Lopsided Bullish Bet Ali‚Äôs highlights a 2.59 long/short ratio for DOGE on Binance over a 4-hour span, with 72.13% of users holding long positions versus 27.87% short. The Coinglass chart illustrates this skew vividly: stacked bars show long positions (dark gray) towering over shorts (light gray) across the period, with a white line tracking the ratio‚Äôs climb above 1.0. Most Binance traders are bullish on Dogecoin | Source: X At 06:00, the ratio hit 2.59, meaning longs outnumber shorts by over 2.5 to 1. This heavy bullish tilt suggests people expect a near-term price surge, possibly toward $0.21-$0.29, as Ali‚Äôs past posts hinted. Yet, such an imbalance risks volatility, liquidations could amplify a drop, making their confidence a double-edged sword.

Diverging trendlines, upward-sloping lows, and downward-sloping highs connect widening price swings, signaling growing indecision. Higher highs near $0.22 and lower lows around $0.13 define the pattern. Broadening formations often precede reversals after trends, with breakouts dictating direction. A push above the upper trendline could spark a rally to $0.29 or beyond, aligning with the 72% long bias. However, a break below $0.13 risks a slide to $0.06.

Hurry up and buy Minotaurus here . Final Thoughts: Are Dogecoin Supporters Ahead of the Curve? The 72.13% long positions and expanding formation suggest a DOGE breakout, supported by whale activity, with 800 million tokens gathered, anticipating ETF prospects. However, the imbalanced ratio could face a correction if support around $0.13 weakens. Minotaurus‚Äô ascent highlights the potential of altcoins, indicating that their optimism may spread. Regardless of being insightful or overly scrutinized, DOGE‚Äôs $0.1560 position serves as a critical juncture ‚Äî either a breakout or a breakdown is imminent.

The 4-hour chart shows price consolidating between the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.0707 and lower Bollinger Band support at $2.0448. With shrinking Bollinger Bands, volatility is fading, hinting at a brewing breakout . Price action is range-bound, with no dominant momentum yet. This indecision signals traders are waiting for a directional trigger, likely to come soon. 4-Hour MACD Shows Weak Momentum and Buyer Hesitation The MACD (12, 26) on the 4-hour chart is flat lining, with the MACD line slightly below the signal line and histogram bars hovering near zero. This reflects a weak trend, with neither buyers nor sellers fully in control. The fading green bars show that buying pressure is losing steam, and unless volume picks up, the market may remain stagnant. However, the setup also suggests that the next breakout, once it arrives, could be sharp due to the prolonged buildup. 1-Hour Chart Reveals Bearish Tilt Amid Sideways Action In the 1-hour timeframe, XRP trades within a narrow band between $2.04 and $2.07. Recent candles show lower highs and frequent touches at the lower Bollinger Band, signaling slight bearish pressure. The MACD remains beneath the zero line, reinforcing short-term downside bias. Still, volume remains light, and there‚Äôs no aggressive selling. This setup often indicates quiet accumulation. Traders should stay alert for a break above the 20-SMA, which could flip short-term sentiment bullish. 15-Minute Chart Builds Pressure for Explosive Move The 15-minute chart shows classic signs of compression . Bollinger Bands are extremely tight, and the price is locked between $2.05 and $2.06, moving within a narrow channel. The MACD lines are converging, with the histogram flat (a sign of pure market indecision). Such tight ranges often lead to a sharp move in either direction. A volume spike will likely determine the breakout direction, making this timeframe crucial for scalpers and short-term traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Support and Resistance Zones to Watch Support lies at $2.0448, near the lower Bollinger Band on the 4-hour chart. A break below this level could drive XRP toward $2.01‚Äì$2.00, a critical psychological and technical support zone. Resistance stands at $2.0967. A clean move above this level, especially with volume confirmation, may open a rally toward $2.12. With the current price near mid-range, XRP remains vulnerable to both sides (highlighting the importance of breakout confirmation). Market Conditions and Sentiment Check The broader crypto market is consolidating, and XRP is reflecting that mood. Bitcoin‚Äôs sideways action is stalling altcoin momentum, while no major news has stirred XRP-specific interest. MACD readings across timeframes confirm a lack of conviction, but that doesn‚Äôt negate potential. Often, periods like these are followed by high-impact moves. Traders should remain watchful, especially as low volatility across the board hints at an upcoming shift. 8-Hour Price Prediction: Breakout Watch Given current conditions, XRP is projected to trade between $2.04 and $2.08 over the next 8 hours.

Investors are eager to understand what to anticipate and how to prepare. The analysis suggests that these cryptocurrencies could experience significant developments. Find out which factors could drive this trend and what steps holders might consider. Ethereum Shows Significant Decline Amid Ongoing Bearish Pressure Ethereum has shown a downtrend with a 19.07% fall over the past month and a 39.81% drop over the past six months. Prices have steadily declined with a weekly drop of 2.44%, reflecting weakening sentiment. This past performance points to increasing seller pressure and a consistent drop over both short and longer periods. Current prices range between $1538.94 and $2325.86, with resistance around $2829.45 and another hurdle near $3616.37. Support is visible at $1255.61, with further backing near $468.69. Bears seem to dominate as no clear trend has emerged. Traders might consider testing the $1255.61 support for any potential bounce or waiting for a break above resistance while managing risks effectively. XRP's Rollercoaster: Sharp Decline, Massive 6-Month Surge, and Defined Key Levels Over the past month, XRP 's price has slipped nearly 15%, while a significant surge of about 280% was observed over the last six months. This period demonstrates notable volatility, with a dramatic rebound contrasting sharply with the recent decline. The recent behavior reflects the coin's extreme swings, highlighting bearish pressure in the short term and a substantial long-term recovery. The current price hovers between $1.66 and $2.77, with resistance around $3.45 and support at approximately $1.23. Both bulls and bears influence the market as the price action remains uncertain and lacks a clear trend. Trading within these levels may see buyers entering near support, while those shorting may focus on the resistance area for potential pullbacks. Conclusion ETH and XRP holders may see positive price movements in May. Staying informed about market trends and upcoming events will be crucial. Monitoring key support and resistance levels can help in making timely decisions. It is advisable to keep an eye on trading volumes and any major news affecting these coins. While the market can change, current indicators suggest potential growth ahead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The trades happened during the first quarter of 2025, as tension built around the White House‚Äôs next economic move. According to Bloomberg, names like Mark Zuckerberg, Safra Catz, and Jamie Dimon all dumped massive blocks of stock while prices were still high. By the time Trump rolled out new tariffs on April 2, tech stocks had already started bleeding. Every one of those early sellers dodged a bullet, and the timing is loud as hell. Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares of Meta through his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and its connected nonprofit. Those sales brought in $733 million before Meta‚Äôs stock took a 32% nosedive. The trades happened in January and February, when shares were still above $600. On February 14, Meta hit a high of over $736, the same day Zuckerberg‚Äôs net worth peaked at $259 billion. As of the last count, he‚Äôs down to $178 billion, still ranked third in the world behind Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Catz didn‚Äôt wait around either. The Oracle CEO exercised and sold off 3.8 million shares in January, worth $705 million total. At the time, Oracle‚Äôs stock was trading above $180, but it has since dropped more than 30%. Bloomberg listed her net worth at $2.4 billion for the first time, mostly from this sale and her remaining holdings. Public filings showed the trades followed a 10b5-1 plan, which she typically uses when her options are set to expire. Her personal stake in Oracle is smaller now, but her bank balance isn‚Äôt. Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan boss, pulled out $234 million from the market in Q1. His first big trade happened on February 20, right after the bank‚Äôs stock hit a 2025 high. Bloomberg said he has a net worth of $3 billion, and his selling didn‚Äôt stop in Q1. On April 14, he dumped another 133,639 shares worth $31.5 million, bringing his total this year to over $265 million. Executives sold billions as Trump‚Äôs tariffs loomed The first quarter wasn‚Äôt quiet. Trump‚Äôs team hinted at sweeping tariffs leading up to April 2, a day he branded as ‚Äú Liberation Day .‚Äù That threat shook investors. By the time the announcement dropped, billions had already been erased from global markets. The tech world felt it the hardest. Elon Musk reportedly lost $129 billion this year as stocks tied to phones, chips, and software kept slipping. A few billionaires are already buying the dip, but plenty have already made their exit. The Washington Service tracked a total of 3,867 people who sold stock in Q1 2025, totaling $15.5 billion. That‚Äôs lower than Q1 2024, when 4,702 people sold $28.1 billion worth of shares. That wave last year was led by Bezos, who sold $8.5 billion in Amazon stock in February. This year, the exits were more balanced. Ten people sold over $3.8 billion combined. Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, dumped 2.36 million shares worth over $432 million. He‚Äôs been exercising stock options at the beginning of each month under a 10b5-1 plan from March 2024, and filings show he‚Äôs continued selling through April. His total take this year is now more than $565 million, with over $100 million in exercise costs. Max de Groen, a Nutanix board member from Bain Capital, sold 5.5 million shares worth $409 million. Bain converted a note last summer that gave them 16.9 million shares. De Groen said at the time that Bain didn‚Äôt plan to sell, but eight months later, they flipped about a third. Nutanix‚Äôs stock climbed more than 56% between the note conversion and the sale on March 4. Since then, it‚Äôs dropped 20%. Chuck Davis, co-CEO at Stone Point Capital, sits on the board of Axis Capital Holdings, a Bermuda insurance firm. Axis repurchased $400 million worth of its own stock in February and March from an investment vehicle run by Stone Point. Davis‚Äôs name is tied to 4.37 million shares sold for just under $400 million. Stock dump continued across tech, banking, and healthcare Stephen Cohen, president of Palantir , got out with $337 million in Q1. His shares were sold under a 10b5-1 plan, part of a larger wave. Palantir insiders offloaded $4 billion last year, and 2025‚Äôs off to a similar start. The company‚Äôs stock doubled between mid-January and mid-February, and it‚Äôs still up 24% year-to-date. Cohen‚Äôs personal worth now sits at $3.3 billion, most of it tied to Denver-based Palantir options. Eric Lefkofsky, CEO of Tempus AI, sold 4.05 million shares worth $231 million. Tempus went public in June, and shares have climbed more than 9% since. A rep from the company said some of the sales covered IPO costs. Lefkofsky has a 10b5-1 plan that lets him sell 1% of his stake every quarter. Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, sold 199,063 shares for nearly $195 million on January 30. He used $21 million to exercise the options, which expire between 2026 and 2032. He‚Äôd set up the 10b5-1 plan back in October. Travis Boersma, co-founder of Dutch Bros, sold 2.5 million shares for $189 million in February. The shares were held in trusts under his control. He launched the Oregon coffee brand with his late brother in 1992. He used to be a dairy farmer, and became a billionaire in 2021 when the company went public.

This increasingly narrowing range comes off a wider downside consolidation move since the beginning of April, which has led to the creation of a triangle pattern on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: Today‚Äôs $1K XRP Bag May Become Tomorrow‚Äôs Jackpot, Crypto Founder Says As it stands, Dogecoin is trying to recover from earlier losses in April, and a recent higher low points to growing bullish activity that could send it pushing above the upper trendline of the triangle pattern in the coming week. Analyst Notes Classic Market Indecision In Dogecoin Structure Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently brought attention to Dogecoin‚Äôs current price structure in a post shared on the social media platform X, noting a converging triangle formation that reflects growing indecision in the market. According to his analysis, Dogecoin‚Äôs price action has transitioned from a clear downtrend (visible throughout late March and extending into the first week of April) into a state of consolidation that has persisted over the past two weeks. Looking at the resulting triangle formation on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart, it is easy to infer that both buyers and sellers are exercising caution. Buyers are reluctant to enter at higher levels, while sellers seem unwilling to push prices lower, creating a narrowing band of price action since April 15. The result is a compression of volatility, which could break out in either direction. Image From X: Trader Tardigrade What Comes After The Indecision Phase? As shown in the Dogecoin price chart above, the memecoin is now approaching the tip of the triangle. In this particular case, the structure leans toward a bullish breakout, with market behavior showing signs of upward pressure building beneath the surface by a 2.77% increase in trading volume in the past 24 hours. Trader Tardigrade projected an uptrend that cancels out the downtrend in late March, following the classic pattern of a downtrend, indecision, and a resulting uptrend. A strong bullish candle that closes above the upper trendline of the triangle is important to validate the predicted uptrend. Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs projection shows that if such a move occurs, Dogecoin could reclaim the $0.20 level within a relatively short time frame before the end of the month. Dogecoin opened the month of April at $0.166. As such, a clean upside breakout followed by a sustained close above $0.20 would mark a positive finish for Dogecoin in April.

Price action is tight, holding above major support but struggling to gain bullish momentum. By Edris Derakhshi XRP Price Analysis: The USDT Chart XRP is holding just above the $2.00 support zone and the 200-day moving average, located around the same price mark. The $2.00 level has acted as key demand throughout April, with multiple wicks into that zone being bought up quickly. However, bullish follow-through has been weak, and the price remains compressed between $2.00 and the $2.40‚Äì$2.60 resistance zone. Momentum is neutral as the RSI hovers around the 50 mark. Bulls need to reclaim $2.60 to confirm strength and open the way toward the $3.00‚Äì$3.10 resistance. If the 200 DMA fails to hold, the next major supports are at $1.40 and $1. Source: TradingView XRP Price Analysis: The BTC Paired Chart XRP is still in a downtrend against BTC, with a clear sequence of lower highs since the peak in January. The price is now just above the 2,400 SAT level but well below the 2,800 SAT resistance zone. The 200 DMA near 2,100 remains a key level to watch if the decline continues. This pair continues to show relative weakness, and reclaiming 2,800 SAT is critical to shift the short-term trend.

This lack of volatility and momentum suggests a state of uncertainty, with neither buyers nor sellers showing dominance. Such conditions often precede significant moves, as the market builds up energy awaiting new supply or demand. From a technical standpoint, bearish sentiment dominates the current price action. Should renewed selling pressure emerge, a decisive break below the $1.5K mark could trigger a cascade toward the $1.1K level. Still, a short-term corrective retracement toward the $1.8K resistance zone remains a possibility before sellers mount another attempt to breach the $1.5K support. The coming days are crucial, as price action around this level will likely dictate the direction of Ethereum‚Äôs next major trend. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum‚Äôs tight-range consolidation is clearly visible. The price is currently trapped between the $1.5K support and the upper boundary of the descending channel at $1.6K, reflecting a market in equilibrium. This balance suggests hesitation from both buyers and sellers. A breakout from this narrow range will be pivotal. If Ethereum manages to breach the $1.6K upper boundary, a short-term rebound toward $1.8K could materialize. Conversely, a breakdown below the $1.5K level will likely spark a significant downward move, potentially driving the price toward $1.1K in the mid-term. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan The funding rates metric serves as a crucial indicator of sentiment in the futures markets. Analysing its recent behaviour offers key insights into Ethereum‚Äôs potential next moves. Notably, both the price and the funding rates have been mirroring the patterns observed during the September to November 2024 period, a phase marked by prolonged consolidation and deep corrections that ultimately preceded a strong bullish rally. Such market conditions often reflect smart money accumulation, as informed investors take advantage of panic-driven selling and widespread distribution among retail participants. Currently, funding rates have dropped to near-zero values and are consolidating, suggesting that the market may once again be entering an accumulation phase. However, it is important to note that within such phases, further downside remains possible. The price may dip lower before a meaningful rebound occurs, offering even more attractive levels for accumulation by long-term investors.

Two altcoins, one established and one emerging, are gaining traction fast. Cardano (ADA) at the price of about $0.62 keeps gathering steam with actual world applications and impending upgrades. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rising as a favorite among high-risk, high-return investors. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs stage four presale has become active and costs $0.025 and has secured $6.9 million. The next presale stage will increase MUTM‚Äôs cost to $0.03 while attracting more than 8400 investors. The first to invest here will get a 140% return on launch price increase to $0.06. As much as the future of XRP‚Äôs next move is uncertain, these two may well offer an easier path to the upside. Why Cardano (ADA) Deserves a Second Look as XRP Traders Hesitate As Ripple (XRP) traders wrestle with conflicting signals, Cardano (ADA) is quietly shaping up to be a more stable bet in the altcoin arena. With ADA holding steady around $0.62, its focus on academic research, energy efficiency, and scalable smart contracts gives it a fundamentally different appeal than XRP‚Äôs legal-driven volatility. While XRP‚Äôs next move remains uncertain, ADA‚Äôs roadmap. For investors seeking balance between innovation and reliability, ADA stands out and those chasing higher risk may also have their eyes on emerging names like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance: A DeFi Giant in the Making Mutuum Finance is changing the face of decentralized lending with its innovative dual-model system and paving the way for mainstream acceptance. Its fresh approach has already picked up quite a bit of interest, over 8,400 investors participated in its presale round, and the project collectively raised $6.9 million. Currently, in Phase 4, MUTM is worth $0.025, with the expectation of a 20% increase in Phase 5, with massive profit potential. Experts project that once the token goes live at $0.06, it could reach more than $1 within a few months. Dual Lending Model: The Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance provides a hybrid lending framework by integrating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. Through the P2C system, users are able to reap passive yields from providing USDT to automated liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. While the P2P system enables direct, intermediary-free lending transactions, giving users full control over assets. By providing these two models in tandem, Mutuum Finance introduces greater efficiency and security in decentralized lending while giving investors diversified opportunities for higher returns. Community Growth Through Strategic Incentives To speed up the platform‚Äôs adoption and growing its user base, Mutuum Finance has launched an ambitious rewards program. Ten investors are rewarded with a total of $100,000 in the form of $10,000 units of MUTM tokens each. The company also offers a referral program where users are rewarded for successfully recruiting new investors. The early joiners are offered exclusive benefits in the form of access to staking pools, governance, and VIP updates, adding to their activity and influence further in the ecosystem. Long-Term Value Sustainable Tokenomics Mutuum Finance tokenomics are structured to increase long-term value appreciation and ensure supply stability. The project limits token circulation and employs anti-inflationary features to induce scarcity, maximizing the potential of the token to grow in value. Additionally, users are incentivized when they stake their tokens, rewarding ecosystem health and increased involvement with the platform native asset. As Ripple (XRP) continues to battle market indecision, investors are setting their sights on assets with clearer upside potential, namely Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance has already raised $6.9 million from over 8,400 investors, with its token currently priced at $0.025 in Phase 4 of the presale. Now is the time to position yourself before the next price increase in Phase 5.

His April 20 suggestion aims to transform the execution layer in a bid to make Ethereum faster and more scalable. Buterin argues that the transition is necessary in order to address Ethereum‚Äôs longer-term challenges such as competitive block production, sampling of data availability, and zero-knowledge EVM proving efficiency. ‚ÄúThis sort of radical change may be the only one which will do the trick,‚Äù Buterin wrote, referencing the need for the execution layer to match consensus layer simplifications. Competing with Solana and Sui Ethereum‚Äôs legacy infrastructure is being surpassed by newer, high-performance blockchains like Solana and Sui. These monolithic chains are much more performant, and they put pressure on Ethereum to innovate or be left behind. The RISC-V architecture, already pervasive in hardware, could bring better optimization opportunities for Ethereum clients and rollups, resulting in improved performance and more efficient zero-knowledge proofs. Fee Collapse Highlights Usage Decline Buterin‚Äôs suggestion is also timely for Ethereum. Network fees are at their lowest since 2020, averaging a mere $0.16 per transaction in April 2025. Blob fees‚ÄîEthereum layer-2 charges‚Äîare down to a paltry 3.18 ETH ($5,000) for the week ending March 30. Experts attribute the fall to reduced base-layer usage as customers shift to layer-2 solutions. While the rollups reduce costs, they also shave revenue on the base layer, raising concerns regarding the future viability of Ethereum. Market Confidence Erodes Ethereum‚Äôs shrinking fee income and rising competition have dented investor confidence. Ether (ETH) has fallen to $1,580, with some analysts warning of a further drop to $1,100 if confidence erodes further. Buterin‚Äôs ambitious RISC-V proposal might offer an escape route‚Äîbut also emphasizes the necessity for Ethereum to innovate in a rapidly evolving blockchain world.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-20 18:33:59

The incident has raised concerns about market manipulation on centralized exchanges. According to reports , the incident led to VOXEL/USDT 24-hour trading volume to soar to $12.72 billion, far above Bitcoin‚Äôs $4.76 billion trading volume within that period. While some believe it could be due to market manipulation,¬†crypto analyst Dylan believes it is likely due to a bug in the exchange trading bot . Although the issue is now under control, some users could profit from the incident once they discovered that the bot executed trades between $0.125 and $0.138. Dylan noted that some users made six-figure profits using just $100. While the issue is now under control, CoinMarketCap data shows that VOXEL is trading at $0.09131, 40% higher than its value earlier today. However, it has fallen from its peak of $0.1645. Voxel is the in-game token for blockchain-based game Voxie Tactics, and it is tradable on several exchanges. The token has a market cap of just $23 million, and 79% of its total 300 million token supply is already in circulation. BitGet says the incident is under investigation Meanwhile, BitGet has acknowledged the abnormal trading and is investigating the incident. The exchange spokesperson Xie Jiayin said on X that the issue did not affect any other functions on the platform. He said: ‚ÄúWe will synchronize more specific information as soon as possible. Some users may be subject to risk control. If you have any questions, please contact the online customer service in the App. Currently #Bitget trading, deposit and withdrawal functions are all normal.‚Äù The spokesperson added that every platform experiences issues and challenges such as this during its development phase, but how they resolve those matters is key. He promised the investigation report would be available within 24 hours. Nevertheless, the exchange has temporarily suspended all these functions for some accounts it claimed engaged in market manipulation during the incident. An update from BitGet claimed that this market manipulation triggered its risk control systems. It said: ‚ÄúCertain accounts were found to have potentially engaged in market manipulation, triggering our risk control system. Affected accounts have been temporarily suspended from trading, deposit, and withdrawal functions.‚Äù The exchange added that it would restore the function for these accounts over the next 24 hours and roll back all the irregular trades that occurred within that period. Those who traded the VOXEL/USDT contract within that period will receive compensation. Crypto community criticizes BitGet However, the decision to temporarily suspend function for accounts, unilaterally roll back profits, and forcibly settle VOXEL positions has attracted criticism from many who believe it sets a dangerous precedent. One user, Cody , said the exchange handling of the incident was immature and unprofessional, while also criticizing its hybrid custodial risk pool. He wrote: ‚ÄúIts handling of VOXEL incidents was immature, unethical, and unprofessional, resulting in user losses and raising serious doubts about its integrity.‚Äù Cody‚Äôs comment appears to be aimed at BitGet CEO Gracy Chen, who criticized decentralized exchange Hyperliquid with similar statements a few months ago. However, it echoes the opinion of many users who believe the exchange is blaming them for its fault. One user noted that retail users did not manipulate the market, and the issue was clearly from the market makers. They warned BitGet that it could lose users because of how it handled the incident.

According to a report, 89% of Bitcoin service providers registered in the Central American country have become non-operational. Only 20 of 181 Bitcoin Firms in El Salvador Still Active The Central Reserve Bank data shows that only 20 companies from 181 officially registered to offer Bitcoin services are functional. This includes the government-backed Chivo Wallet. The other remaining 161 companies have been tagged ‚Äúnon-operating.‚Äù Out of the 161 companies, at least 22 have not met with regulatory requirements as spelt out in Article 4 of the country‚Äôs Bitcoin Law Regulation. Part of the law stipulates that companies must operate by upholding high standards of honesty and integrity. This involves clear records of assets and liabilities, anti-money laundering programs, and efficient cybersecurity systems. Hon Ng, chief legal officer of Bitget cryptocurrency exchange, commented on the recent development and noted a need to address infrastructural challenges. Ng maintained that El Salvador might need to rethink its regulatory guidelines and infrastructural support. Bukele‚Äôs Experiment Faces Mounting Technical and Global Pressure Interestingly , President Nayib Bukele acknowledged that El Salvador would undergo a learning curve at the adoption of BTC as legal tender . President Bukele maintained that this would not be achieved quickly but insisted that the country make a significant shift. Despite launching the Chivo Wallet and offering a $30 incentive to citizens who signed up, adoption has not been seamless. Reports indicate that the Chivo Wallet encountered technical challenges, and most citizens have stopped using the initiative. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has pressured El Salvador to stop acquiring Bitcoin. The concern came after the country secured a $1.4 billion loan facility in December 2024. El Salvador should scale back on the Bitcoin acquisition as part of the deal , but it has continued to grow its treasury to 6,105 BTC. Hope Remains for a Bitcoin Reset Analysts opine that despite these developments, El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin adoption story is far from over. With 20 providers still operational, the country can rejig the ecosystem and rekindle BTC adoption. How the Central American nation achieves that remains a thing of interest to bitcoiners globally.

According to the inmate database of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving time at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Terminal Island. The 33-year-old was previously held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, but the BOP moved him to a series of locations. FCI Terminal Island houses more than 900 low-security male inmates. Last month, Bankman-Fried was brought to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, which houses inmates who are being transported through the prison system. He was then taken to a medium-security federal prison in Victorville, California, before his subsequent move FCI Terminal Island. The former crypto golden boy was sentenced to 25 years in prison after he was found guilty of charges arising from the misuse of FTX customer funds. The multi-billion-dollar collapse of the crypto exchange marked the height of the 2022 digital asset bear market. Bankman-Fried is set to be released in December 2044, but his parents are taking action to reduce his sentence. Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried reportedly met with people connected to US President Donald Trump earlier this year to discuss potential clemency for their son.

43585998,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64579,1745174845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,100 Million Shiba Inu (SHIB) Could Yield $1 Million By This Date,https://timestabloid.com/100-million-shiba-inu-shib-to-yield-1-million-by-this-date/,"As Shiba Inu experiences slowed momentum following its brief recovery earlier this month, investor interest remains high. Despite its recent underperformance, many speculate about SHIB‚Äôs potential to deliver massive returns. One popular projection involves a scenario where holding 100 million SHIB tokens could yield a $1 million portfolio. SHIB saw a modest rebound after falling to $0.00001031 on April 7, recovering to approximately $0.00001219. However, its price has remained relatively stable since then, failing to build upon its short-lived momentum. Despite the stagnation, on-chain data shows that most SHIB holders remain committed to long-term gains. According to IntoTheBlock , approximately 77% of addresses have held SHIB for over a year, reflecting investor confidence in the token‚Äôs future potential. Meanwhile, 21% have held the asset for less than a year but more than a month, and only 2% are categorized as short-term holders. Interestingly, although around 85.5% of holders are currently at a loss, optimism persists within the community, with many recalling SHIB‚Äôs impressive gains during the 2020‚Äì2021 bull cycle. What It Takes to Turn 100M SHIB Into $1M With SHIB trading at $0.00001212 as of April 20th, acquiring 100 million tokens would cost approximately $1,212. For this investment to reach a value of $1 million, SHIB would need to appreciate to $0.01 per token‚Äîan increase of nearly 82,000%. If such a price were to be achieved without reducing the current circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens, Shiba Inu‚Äôs market capitalization would surge to approximately $5.89 trillion. This valuation would significantly surpass the total value of the entire cryptocurrency market, which is currently estimated at around $2.69 trillion, making this outcome extremely difficult under present conditions. Expert Projections and Potential Timeline Some analysts believe that SHIB could reach $0.01 in the future, although with substantial challenges. Crypto exchange Changelly projects that Shiba Inu may attain this price milestone by January 2050. Their forecast suggests a trading range between $0.0103 and $0.0127, with an average estimate of $0.0109 for that year. Prominent community figures and crypto enthusiasts have echoed similar views. For example, Luis Delgado (Del Crxpto) remains confident in SHIB‚Äôs future growth, arguing that dramatic price increases are not unprecedented in the crypto landscape. In addition, public figures like Yazan and Jason Williams have speculated that SHIB could surpass even the $0.01 mark during the ongoing bull cycle, predicting a potential peak of $0.05 by the end of 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meanwhile, AI forecasts suggest moderate optimism. ChatGPT estimates a 75% probability that SHIB could reach $0.0194 by 2050, with a 60% chance that it may cross the $0.01 threshold as early as 2040. Token Burns and Broader Adoption To hit $0.01, SHIB would likely need a substantial decrease in its circulating supply. The Shiba Inu development team has implemented token-burning mechanisms like Shibarium to help achieve this. Although over 55 billion SHIB tokens have already been burned through this system, this represents only a small fraction of the total supply. Further large-scale burns and increased utility would be essential to sustain upward price momentum. Transforming a $1,219 SHIB investment into $1 million is theoretically possible, but would require extreme market conditions or significant changes to SHIB‚Äôs tokenomics. While some projections offer optimistic timelines extending to 2050, the path to such growth depends on long-term investor patience, strategic supply reductions, and broader ecosystem development.

The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan‚Äôs SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $5.18 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price decreased to $0.6377 losing 0.94% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.37 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2030. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts‚Äô price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don‚Äôt expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $6.97, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.95 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3.

In August 2024, the SNX token‚Äôs price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38.

Security and fair play measures The quintessence of the online gambling world rests not only in the grandeur of its offerings but also in the sanct ity of its operational measures. In the realm of crypto casinos, where digital transactions form the crux of interactions, the imperatives of security and fair play are heightened. This section meticulously dissects these imperatives, casting light upon the mechanisms platforms employ to foster an environment of trust and integrity. In an age governed by digital interactivity, the fortifications erected by these platforms are paramount. Advanced SSL encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage solutions are just the tip of the cybersecurity iceberg. By employing these, online crypto casinos like CryptoGames ensure that user assets and personal data remain impervious to external vulnerabilities. Random number generation and game fairness Beyond the virtual walls safeguarding data, the integrity of the games themselves is a matter of prime concern. Platforms such as Gxmble and Mystake utilize sophisticated random number generators, ensuring that each game outcome is entirely arbitrary and devoid of manipulation. Such mechanisms are periodically audited by independent entities, further bolstering their credibility. Transparent transactional records The ethos of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is rooted in transparency. Platforms like Mega Dice and CloudBet embrace this spirit by maintaining transparent ledgers of transactions. Every wager, win, or withdrawal is recorded on these immutable ledgers, granting users unfettered access to their transaction history, ensuring accountability and engendering trust. Protective measures against problematic gaming Responsibility in gaming is a doctrine ardently upheld by premier online crypto casinos. Mechanisms to limit deposits, loss limits, and self-exclusion protocols are in place across platforms. These measures and collaborations with organizations dedicated to responsible gambling illustrate the industry‚Äôs commitment to user well-being. User education and empowerment While technical measures are indispensable, user empowerment remains a key facet of security and fair play.

Amidst the choppy price action, Bitcoin whales appear to be increasing their holdings, perhaps in anticipation of future price gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready To Reclaim $90,000? BTC‚Äôs ‚ÄòNext Big Move‚Äô Could Come Next Week Bitcoin Whales Add 53,600 BTC, Now Hold 68% Of Supply In an X post on April 18, prominent blockchain analytics firm Santiment has provided valuable insight on the recent behavior of the major Bitcoin stakeholders. Despite the BTC market still displaying significant levels of uncertainty, Santiment reports a strong confidence level among investors holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC. The analytics firm states that these key Bitcoin holders have accumulated 53,600 BTC from March 22, and now control 67.77% of Bitcoin in circulation. During the period of this accumulation spree, the BTC market has failed to establish a clear price direction with significant swings in either direction mediated by periods of tight consolidation. Notably, BTC dropped by 13% in early April, twice retesting the $74,000 support level before rebounding to reach a high of $88,000 on April 15. Since then, it has entered a consolidation phase, fluctuating within a range of $83,000 to $86,000. The ongoing accumulation trend among Bitcoin whales amid this price uncertainty signals growing market confidence, as major holders appear to be positioning for a potential rally. For retail traders, this behavior serves as a strong bullish indicator, suggesting that there is sufficient underlying demand to drive and sustain further price appreciation.

Following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January, Bitcoin has fallen victim to the macroeconomic factors as new tariff policies have caused significant market panic among investors. Since hitting an all time high around $109,000 on January 20, the premier cryptocurrency slipped into market correction to trade as low as $74,000 on April 7 and 9. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency produced a price rebound from these market lows, as the US Government announced a 90-day new tariff pause. However, the ongoing consolidation that has lasted over the past week indicates the lack of a bullish market catalyst. Bitcoin enthusiasts will hope for positive developments, including a potential Federal Reserve rate cut following recent pressure from Trump. For multiple analysts, Bitcoin must cross the $91,000 resistance to validate any potential for a sustainable bullish uptrend. If this price gain occurs, the leading cryptocurrency is tipped for a return to its all-time high and perhaps new price discovery. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $85,226, reflecting a price gain of 0.72% in the past day.

From memecoin mania to AI-powered innovation, analysts suggest Cardano, Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Lightchain AI could be among the next millionaire makers. Table of Contents Could these altcoins deliver massive gains? Experts weigh in the strengths of memecoins and utility tokens Is Lightchain AI becoming the dark horse in the millionaire maker debate? As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors and analysts are focusing on the next round of potential millionaire-makers for 2025. Among the top contenders are Cardano (ADA), Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Lightchain AI (LCAI) ‚Äî each bringing its own narrative, community, and unique strengths. While Cardano is praised for its scientific approach and roadmap discipline, meme-driven tokens like PEPE and SHIB still command massive followings with high-risk, high-reward potential. However, Lightchain AI stands apart as a rising star built on real innovation, already raising $19.3 million in its presale. With disruptive AI infrastructure like the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, it‚Äôs quickly becoming a favorite among experts. Could these altcoins deliver massive gains? With 2025 shaping up to be a pivotal year for the crypto space, investors are zeroing in on altcoins with breakout potential. Cardano, Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Lightchain AI have all emerged as hot contenders. While Cardano benefits from steady institutional support and a research-first approach, memecoins like PEPE and SHIB have proven their power to rally retail interest. Still, massive gains often favor those who identify fundamentally sound projects at their lowest price points. That‚Äôs why the excitement around Lightchain AI, currently priced at $0.007, is rising fast. Its distinct position at the intersection of AI and blockchain could make it the unexpected front-runner for a significant breakout.

Memecoins, such as Shiba Inu and PEPE, thrive on hype, virality, and social‚ÄÇmedia momentum ‚Äî factors that have without a doubt turned people into overnight millionaires in previous cycles. However, utility tokens such as Cardano and Lightchain AI create real-world use cases and‚ÄÇtechnological backbone which deliver long-term value. Analysts who take the project‚Äôs fundamentals, scalability, and governance into account are turning to utility tokens. To this end, Lightchain AI shines with solutions like its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). As volatility is part of the crypto landscape, many experts are turning to‚ÄÇtokens with established development roadmaps and some degree of disruption. Is Lightchain AI becoming the dark horse in the millionaire maker debate? While Cardano, Shiba Inu, and PEPE dominate headlines due to their recognition, Lightchain AI is quietly gaining ground. Its presale has already raised $19.3 million, and it‚Äôs not based on hype alone, it‚Äôs backed by unique blockchain architecture for decentralized AI computation. Features like the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and the PoI consensus mechanism provide a blueprint for actual solutions. Lightchain AI is building out infrastructure to support long-term ecosystem growth. It‚Äôs this blend of low market entry, forward-thinking tech, and strategic appeal that positions Lightchain AI as a candidate for significant growth.

It also includes replacing veteran diplomats with loyalists of President Trump. The 16-page document obtained by The New York Times began circulating among current and former officials on Saturday. It directs a ‚Äúdisciplined reorganization‚Äù to cut ‚Äúwaste, fraud and abuse.‚Äù If signed, the order would give the department until Oct. 1 to implement the changes. However, Congress must be informed of mass closures, and lawsuits are expected. The document said that the Bureau of African Affairs would disappear, and embassies and consulates in sub‚ÄëSaharan Africa would be closed down. Moreover, a small special envoy office reporting to the National Security Council would focus only on counterterrorism and resource trade. Diplomats would visit the continent on brief ‚Äúmission‚Äëdriven‚Äù trips rather than live there. Headquarters offices devoted to democracy, human rights, refugees, climate, and public diplomacy would close. The posts of the Under Secretary who supervises them and the Special Envoy for Climate would be cut. A new under secretary for transnational threat elimination would oversee counternarcotics and related work. A Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance would absorb what remains of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Traditional regional bureaus would be replaced by four ‚Äúcorps.‚Äù The Eurasia Corps would cover Europe, Russia, and Central Asia; the Mid‚ÄëEast Corps would span Arab nations, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan; the Latin America Corps would take Central; South America and the Caribbean; and the Indo‚ÄëPacific Corps would run from East Asia through the Maldives. On the other hand, Canada would move into a smaller North American affairs office, and the embassy in Ottawa would be ‚Äúsignificantly reduced.‚Äù Education and diversity programs will narrow, and the foreign service entrance exam will end The document also orders that the foreign service entrance exam will end. Applicants would pick a region at the start and must show ‚Äúalignment with the president‚Äôs foreign policy vision.‚Äù Large numbers of staff would be offered buyouts through Sept. 30, placed on paid leave, or given termination notices. Officials familiar with the plan said the department would start placing employees on ‚Äúhome leave‚Äù with pay as soon as May, a step often used before layoffs. Notices of separation could follow in midsummer. The memo says career civil servants would face the same buyout offers as foreign service officers. Those offers run through September. The draft also orders the department to ‚Äúgreatly expand‚Äù artificial intelligence for drafting documents, reviewing policy, and operational planning. Education and diversity programs would narrow. Fulbright awards would go only to master‚Äôs students working on national security. Howard University‚Äôs contract to recruit Rangel and Pickering fellows would end, and the fellowships themselves would be terminated. Separate internal papers, quoted by officials, propose cutting the department‚Äôs budget nearly 50% and closing 10 embassies and 17 consulates. Those moves match the Oct. 1 timeline in the draft order. Trump hasn‚Äôt signed the order yet Some of the proposed changes‚Äîclosing missions, eliminating bureaus, restructuring the diplomatic corps‚Äîrequire advance notice to Congress and are certain to be challenged in court. Many officers have begun consulting lawyers about possible violations of federal personnel rules. White House review could add changes to parts of the document before the president decides to sign it. After the Times report appeared, Secretary Rubio posted a two‚Äëword response on social media: ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù If the order is issued, the State Department would undergo its largest shake‚Äëup in decades, shrinking its global footprint while concentrating authority in the White House and a handful of new offices. Supporters say the plan would streamline diplomacy and align it with the president‚Äôs goals. Critics warn it would erase expertise built over generations and leave Africa, climate policy, and human rights work largely unattended. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Analysts expect a quiet easter weekend but are divided about the next directional move in Bitcoin. Network economist Timothy Peterson said that the US High Yield Index Effective Yield has gained over 8%. There have been 38 such instances since 2010, and Bitcoin has risen 71% of the time three months later. Bitcoin recorded a median gain of 31% and the worst loss of -16%. Based on historical data, Peterson anticipates Bitcoin to trade between $75,000 and $138,000 within 90 days. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Not everyone shares a bullish view. Bloomberg‚Äôs Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone said in a post on X that Bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index may drop toward their respective 200-week simple moving average , which historically acts as a floor during major corrections. Bitcoin‚Äôs 200-week SMA is close to $46,000. What are the critical support and resistance levels in Bitcoin? What cryptocurrencies may rally if Bitcoin breaks above its overhead resistance? Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin has stayed above the 20-day exponential moving average ($83,704) for the past several days, but the bulls have failed to challenge the 200-day simple moving average ($88,098). BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The failure to start a rally could put pressure on the BTC/USDT pair in the near term. If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls have given up. That opens the gates for a drop to $78,500 and subsequently to the vital support at $73,777. If buyers want to prevent the downside, they will have to swiftly push the price above the 200-day SMA. That indicates the corrective phase may be over. The pair may surge to $95,000 and eventually to the psychological level of $100,000. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been trading inside a tight range between $83,000 and $86,000. Failing to break above the overhead resistance may have tempted the short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the price below the moving averages. Trading inside the range is likely to remain random and volatile. A break and close below the range could start a downward move to $80,000 and then to $78,500. On the other hand, a break and close above $86,000 could propel the pair to $89,000. BNB price analysis BNB ( BNB ) is facing resistance at the downtrend line, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If buyers drive the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $644. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the downtrend line, it signals that the bears are active at higher levels. A break below $576 could keep the pair inside the triangle for some more time. BNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has reached the downtrend line, where the bears are expected to pose a strong challenge. The crucial support on the downside is the 50-SMA and then $576. If the price rebounds off the support, it indicates buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a break above the downtrend line. The pair may then climb to $620. On the contrary, a break and close below $576 signals that the buyers have given up. That could pull the price down to $566, extending the stay inside the triangle for a while longer. Hyperliquid price analysis Hyperliquid (HYPE) rose and closed above the $17.35 overhead resistance on April 19, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns up from $17.35, it suggests that every minor dip is being bought. That clears the path for a rally to $21 and thereafter to $25. Alternatively, a break and close below $17.35 signals that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls. The next support on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($15.32). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to overcome the obstacle at $17.35. The optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the HYPE/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the moving averages. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has dropped to the breakout level of $17.35. If the price rebounds off $17.35 and rises above $18.54, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That enhances the prospects of a rally to $21. Conversely, if the price skids below $17.35, it suggests that the bears are trying to regain control. The 50-SMA is the critical support to watch for on the downside because a break below it indicates that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may then descend to $14.65.

TAO/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the TAO/USDT pair is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($249). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA improves the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. The pair could then surge to $360. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears remain in control. The pair may then slump to the $222 support, where the buyers are expected to step in. TAO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The RSI has risen into the overbought zone, suggesting a short-term pullback is possible. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it signals a positive sentiment. That increases the possibility of a break above the downtrend line. There is minor resistance at $313, but it is likely to be crossed. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA indicates that the short-term buyers are booking profits. That may pull the pair to the 50-SMA. Render price analysis Render ( RNDR ) has broken out of the overhead resistance at $4.22, signaling that the bulls are attempting a comeback. RNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A close above the $4.22 level will complete a bullish double-bottom pattern. There is resistance at $4.83, but it is likely to be crossed. The RNDR/USDT pair could then travel toward the pattern target of $5.94. The 20-day EMA ($3.72) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the moving averages indicates that the markets have rejected the breakout above $4.22. That could open the doors for a drop to the support at $2.50. RNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has cleared the overhead hurdle at $4.22, indicating an advantage to buyers. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and will try to pull the price back below the breakout level. If the price rebounds off $4.22 with strength and rises above $4.48, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The pair may then start an up move toward $5. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it suggests that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then drop toward the critical support at $3.60.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With a sports-fueled narrative and a $13m presale, XYZVerse could be the memecoin to replicate Dogecoin‚Äôs early success. Table of Contents Market positioning: A memecoin with thematic focus Comparative overview: XYZVerse and Dogecoin Strategic advantages of XYZVerse Risks and considerations Final assessment Memecoins have become a prominent fixture of the crypto landscape. From Dogecoin‚Äôs unexpected rise to the multitude of spin-offs that followed, they represent a recurring trend; community-driven assets with little to no initial utility that occasionally deliver significant returns. However, XYZVerse is positioning itself as a memecoin with a different narrative. Rather than relying solely on internet culture or celebrity endorsement, the project is aiming to fuse the emotional resonance of global sports fandom with the viral nature of memecoin dynamics. With a presale already raising over $13 million and a planned listing price of $0.10, XYZVerse warrants closer attention. Market positioning: A memecoin with thematic focus While Dogecoin‚Äôs identity was rooted in randomness and humor, XYZVerse is introducing thematic structure by building around sports ‚Äî arguably one of the most culturally and commercially significant global industries. The project markets itself as the first all-sports memecoin, and early strategic choices reflect that positioning. These include a partnership with Bookmaker.XYZ, a decentralized sportsbook and casino, and plans for a play-to-earn application ‚Äî an approach that offers utility from day one. Thematically, XYZVerse is tapping into three core drivers of sports engagement; tribal identity, competition, and loyalty. If executed effectively, this could enable broader cultural adoption than the typical memecoin. Comparative overview: XYZVerse and Dogecoin Metric / Feature XYZVerse (XYZ) Dogecoin (DOGE) Launch Phase In presale (Stage 12 of 15) Launched in 2013 Initial Pricing $0.003333 Supply Model Capped, deflationary Inflationary, unlimited Primary Theme Sports Internet meme Utility at Launch Bookmaker.XYZ integration, P2E roadmap None Airdrop Mechanism 10% of supply reserved None at inception Community Sentiment 95% bullish votes on CMC 86% bullish votes on CMC You might also like: Dogecoin supporters are 72% long ‚Äî do they know something we don‚Äôt? Strategic advantages of XYZVerse While both DOGE and XYZVerse are fundamentally community-first projects, XYZVerse distinguishes itself in several key areas: Tokenomics: Unlike Dogecoin, which suffers from long-term inflation risk due to unlimited issuance, XYZVerse has a capped supply with no future minting. This makes the tokenomics inherently more sustainable for speculative investors focused on scarcity. Utility integration: XYZVerse offers defined use cases at launch. With integrations such as Bookmaker.XYZ, it opens immediate pathways for real-world interaction. In contrast, DOGE‚Äôs utility came later and remains largely limited to tipping and basic merchant acceptance. Targeted airdrop campaign: Allocating 10% of the total supply to airdrops not only promotes wider distribution but may help bootstrap network effects, incentivizing early participation in a structured way. Market timing: The project enters at a time when macro conditions in crypto are shifting favorably. With many analysts anticipating a new bull cycle in 2025, early-stage memecoins with novel narratives and traction could benefit from renewed speculative capital. Risks and considerations As with all memecoins, volatility and sentiment-driven movement dominate the landscape. The success of XYZVerse will depend heavily on its ability to sustain community interest and deliver on its ecosystem roadmap. Market entry during a bullish period could provide tailwinds, but speculative assets in this category remain high-risk regardless of timing. Furthermore, while the sports vertical is massive in both audience and capital, bridging that into a crypto-native environment remains unproven at scale. Execution will be critical. Final assessment XYZVerse is an early-stage asset with characteristics that could appeal to speculative investors looking to capture memecoin upside ‚Äî but with more structured foundations than historical peers like DOGE. Its capped supply, early utility integration, and strong presale performance set it apart from many recent memecoin launches. If the sports narrative gains traction and ecosystem development continues post-listing, XYZVerse could carve out a new niche in the memecoin segment. However, investors should approach with caution, understanding that performance will likely be driven by sentiment, community engagement, and the project team‚Äôs ability to deliver under scrutiny.

The report suggests that the growing risks of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) call for stricter controls to protect the wider financial system. Many believe the BIS misunderstands the technology and say the report is misleading and dangerous. BIS Pushes for Tighter Rules as Crypto Connects with TradFi The BIS report is titled ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and decentralised finance: functions and financial stability implications.‚Äù It discussed how DeFi is becoming more connected to the traditional financial system. This happens through digital investment products like crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized real-world assets. As crypto and TradFi mix, the BIS wants stronger rules to ensure problems in the crypto world do not spread into the wider economy. The BIS suggests creating stricter rules to prevent crypto problems from spreading to banks, companies, and regular people instead of calling for the outright ban of crypto. BIS Warns About Crypto Scams and User Safety The report pointed out many problems in the DeFi space. One big issue is that users often do not have enough information to know which projects are safe and which ones might be scams. Even though blockchain data is open to everyone, the BIS emphasized that many DeFi platforms can still confuse or trick users. The authors believe crypto‚Äôs transparency is not enough to protect users. The authors argued that just because DeFi uses open code does not mean it is safe. The report asserted that scammers have been able to trick users for long periods without getting caught. Since many crypto users and developers stay anonymous, bad behavior is harder to stop. The report suggests DeFi should be treated like traditional finance and follow the same rules because it offers similar services, like lending and trading. These include clear and honest information about products, know-your-customer (KYC) rules, and professional standards for platform operators. The goal is to avoid risks spreading from crypto into the broader economy. Crypto Leaders Strongly Disagree Many crypto industry leaders have criticized the BIS report. In a recent X post , Christopher Perkins, president of CoinFund, said the report is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and shows a lack of understanding. He believes the open and clear nature of DeFi is better than traditional systems, which can be harder to understand. He disagreed with the idea that users are at a disadvantage in DeFi. Open-source code makes everything visible and reduces the risk of hidden problems. Curve founder Michael Egorov responded even more bluntly in an X post . His comments showed his strong rejection of the report‚Äôs suggestions.

Jupiter (JUP) , Cronos (CRO) , and SEI are catching attention for their resilience and income-generating prospects. This article delves into why these coins stand out and how they can be beneficial in the short term. Jupiter Faces Key Resistance and Support Levels Amid Ongoing Trends Jupiter faced a sharp decline with monthly drops around 23% and half-year losses nearing 60%. The price action displayed volatility with sustained markdowns, indicating a persistent weakening trend over an extended period. Declines and consistent pressure have underscored the coin‚Äôs struggle to regain momentum, reflecting a challenging environment for holders. Currently, Jupiter trades between $0.27 and $0.72 while testing resistance at about $1.01 and finding support near $0.13. Bears dominate as the price remains range-bound, with the RSI close to neutral at 47 and a low momentum reading of $0.04. Trading ideas focus on potential bounces near the support level or breakouts past the resistance, with caution advised in this uncertain terrain. Cronos (CRO) Market Performance Snapshot Cronos experienced modest gains of about 3.89% over the last month, with a six-month increase of roughly 6.83%. A recent weekly decline of 8.10% underscores short-term volatility despite an overall upward trend. Price fluctuations have shown a mix of hesitation and cautious optimism among traders, with the coin gradually recovering after a recent dip. Current trading ranges between $0.07 and $0.12. Immediate resistance aligns at $0.15, while a second barrier comes in near $0.20, and support holds near $0.04. Oscillators and momentum readings suggest a bearish tilt, with an RSI around 44, indicating subdued buying power. Traders may find opportunities within these levels while awaiting a breakout to signal stronger bullish momentum. SEI Faces Key Levels Amid Recent Declines SEI experienced a 10.77% drop in the past month and a steep 59.50% plunge over the last six months. The price moved within a range of about $0.13 to $0.24, reflecting a clear period of weakness. Price volatility and a downtrend defined its recent history as selling pressure dominated long-term movement. The coin now trades between $0.13 and $0.24, with key support emerging near $0.10 and the first resistance at $0.31, followed by a higher challenge at $0.42. Bears are prominent around the resistance areas while a neutral RSI near 49 suggests no strong trend. Trading ideas include cautious bullish entries at support with tight stops and bear strategies aimed at the resistance levels. Conclusion Jupiter (JUP) , Cronos (CRO) , and SEI have potential for short-term income in a bearish market. Each coin offers unique features that can appeal to different segments. JUP provides secure communication solutions. CRO supports a growing ecosystem of products and services. SEI focuses on user-friendly financial applications. These coins can help diversify portfolios and capitalize on short-term opportunities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43588007,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64597,1745178802,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse‚Äôs Decade-Long Advocacy for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouses-decade-long-advocacy-for-xrp/,"Brad Garlinghouse, who assumed the role of Ripple CEO in 2016 after joining the company as Chief Operating Officer a year earlier, has consistently promoted the use and relevance of XRP . Over the past decade, he has used various media platforms, conferences, and interviews to emphasize the asset‚Äôs potential in the global financial ecosystem. A community account known as XRP Investing recently compiled a series of Garlinghouse‚Äôs most prominent remarks concerning the token. These statements, gathered from past and recent engagements, reflect his long-standing commitment to advancing the digital asset‚Äôs utility and value. Highlighting Functional Advantages Garlinghouse has regularly discussed XRP‚Äôs strength, particularly in cross-border transactions. During an early Ripple Swell conference, he stated that the asset was uniquely designed to handle large-scale international payments efficiently. This, he explained, distinguishes it from many other digital assets lacking similar utility. In a 2018 Yahoo Finance Summit appearance, Garlinghouse linked Ripple‚Äôs growing involvement in solving global payment issues with the increasing relevance of XRP. He suggested that the firm‚Äôs expansion into cross-border financial services would increase demand for the asset in multi-trillion-dollar markets. Later that same year, during a Ripple Swell interview with Cheddar , he underscored XRP‚Äôs superior transaction speed and cost efficiency. According to him, the asset processes transactions significantly faster and at a lower cost than Bitcoin, making it more practical for real-time use. Clarifying XRP‚Äôs Legal and Structural Standing Garlinghouse has also addressed XRP‚Äôs regulatory and structural status. In an August 2019 discussion about a class action lawsuit against Ripple in 2018, he expressed confidence that XRP does not qualify as a security. He referenced regulatory opinions from jurisdictions like the United Kingdom to support this stance. He has also emphasized the token‚Äôs operational independence from Ripple. In a 2017 interview with Fortune Magazine‚Äôs The Ledger, Garlinghouse stated that XRP could continue functioning without Ripple‚Äôs involvement, pointing to the asset‚Äôs decentralized nature. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In a 2018 Stanford Legal Podcast, Garlinghouse shared the story of XRP‚Äôs creation, highlighting how early Bitcoin contributors developed it to address Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability and energy consumption issues. The asset, he said, was built as a more efficient digital currency from the outset. Financial Transparency and Future Outlook Garlinghouse has not avoided speaking on Ripple‚Äôs business model either. In a 2020 interview with the Financial Times, he acknowledged that the company‚Äôs profitability and positive cash flow have partially depended on sales of its XRP holdings. Presently, Ripple holds over 41 billion XRP, valued at approximately $82 billion. More recently, Garlinghouse has expressed optimism about XRP‚Äôs future within the financial industry. In October 2024, during an interview with Bloomberg , he indicated that he believes XRP will inevitably be included in exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings, highlighting its growing legitimacy. In January 2025, amid broader discussions around digital assets suitable for a potential U.S. crypto reserve, Garlinghouse disclosed that he holds XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. He advocated for a diversified reserve model that does not rely on a single cryptocurrency. For a decade, Brad Garlinghouse has passionately advocated for XRP, highlighting its potential to revolutionize financial systems. From highlighting its transaction capabilities to defending its regulatory status and forecasting its institutional future, his leadership has helped shape XRP‚Äôs global narrative and Ripple‚Äôs strategic direction.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.26. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.30 and an average forecast price of $5.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an ‚ÄúEthereum Killer‚Äù, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.635 Market Cap $1B Trading Volume $114.14M Circulating Supply 1.56B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.6502 24-hour Low $0.6197 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 12.36% 50-Day SMA $0.598542 14-Day RSI 51.04 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 37 (Fear) Green Days 19/30 (63%) 200-Day SMA $0.677092 EOS price analysis: Downturn results in loss below $0.635 low TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downtrend at $0.635. Cryptocurrency lost 0.33% of its value. EOS coin prices seek support at $0.5293. On 20 April, 2025, EOS price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. Coin value has dropped down to a low of $0.635 in the last 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency lost a noticeable 0.33% of its value today. This creates discouraging circumstances for the investors, as the bears are now ruling the market. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of EOS coin confirmed a declining trend in the market. EOS/USD value has decreased to a $0.635 low through the day. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a rising selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is undergoing a reduction, leading to a decrease in volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.8317. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.5293. EOS/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is hovering within the neutral area. The indicator‚Äôs value has dropped down to index 49.90 today. This decline confirms an imbalance in the trading setup. If the selling activities continue to intensify, the RSI can recede below the neutral area. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin confirmed an upward trend in the market. EOS/USD value has spiked up to a $0.6358 high in the last four hours. The decreasing volatility levels indicate a lower chance of reversal. The Bollinger Bands are shrinking, resulting in a receding volatility. This reduction in the volatility signifies a low market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.6406 high, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to a $0.6148 low, securing the support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is hovering within the neutral region for now.

EOS price analysis gives out a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has deteriorated to a $0.6357 low in the last 24 hours. This decline refers to an imbalanced trading setup for now. From an overall view, the currency lost up to 0.33% of its value today. Technical indicators, however, give out a neutral verdict with respect to the market scenario. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin‚Äôs price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? EOS is in descent with bearish pressure. The coin decreased to $0.6357 in the past 24 hours. EOS price will decrease further if further pressure from the sellers is experienced. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2031. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin‚Äôs market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.30 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a ‚Äúvery risky choice.‚Äù The publication says EOS‚Äôs future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block‚ÄîOne blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.30 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS‚Äôs cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS‚Äôs price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02‚Äã. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token‚Äôs value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.67 level at the start of April.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-20 19:55:00

According to recent analysis, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing stronger performance metrics, faster community growth, and a leaner DeFi model that could deliver outsized returns in 2025. MUTM presale is in Phase 4, following the rapid sellout of Phase 3 ahead of schedule. So far, over 6.9 million has been raised, with more than 8400 investors securing their share. The current price sits at $0.025, but demand is rising fast, as Phase 5 will see an increase to $0.03. Buyers in this phase stand to gain 140% when the token launches at $0.06. MUTM could hit $2 with projection after launch. While SHIB and ADA maintain strong followings, this rising token is quietly earning its place in smart portfolios. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending with its innovative dual-lending model, fueling rapid adoption. The project has already attracted over 8400 investors, raising $6.9 million during its presale. Currently priced at $0.025 in Phase 4, the token is set to increase by 20% in Phase 5, presenting a prime opportunity for investors. With strong market demand and unique lending mechanics, analysts consider MUTM one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to exceed $2 post-launch. Mutuum Finance operates distinctively as it combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users can obtain USDT passive income through automated lending of smart contracts within platform liquidity pools under the P2C model. Users maintain complete asset ownership and conduct unmediated transactions under the P2P model since it operates without intermediaries. Through its hybrid operation model Mutuum Finance provides secure and efficient decentralized service which establishes it as the more suitable choice for DeFi investors who want high yielding opportunities. Establishing a Secure and Resilient Ecosystem As part of stability reinforcement Mutuum Finance will introduce a secured stablecoin tied to US dollars on Ethereum blockchain. The asset uses excess collateral to establish long-term reliability since it goes above the minimum required threshold. The framework includes audited smart contracts alongside an open financial architecture which builds investor confidence as it solves key problems from previous DeFi projects. Incentivizing Early Investors and Strengthening the Community Mutuum Finance works to broaden its community base through multiple desirable incentive programs. Ten participants can receive $10,000 Mutuum Finance tokens in the $100,000 giveaway and users can earn rewards through a referral program that adds new investors to the platform. Early adopters who participate with Mutuum Finance get to access unique staking pools along with governance rights as well as VIP update access to maintain continuous engagement with the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Lasting Growth Tokenomics management by the project controls supply while building continuous value appreciation. Mutuum Finance improves price appreciation through limited token release during presale events and proven deflationary elements which promote token rarity. Through its staking mechanism the project provides better incentives that lead to increased system participation and assures token sustainability in its ecosystem. Mutuum Finance has positioned itself as a major DeFi player by attracting more investors than established tokens SHIB and ADA while delivering new innovations to the market. The strong market confidence can be measured through the $6.9 million funding and 8,400+ participant who joined the presale. Phase 4 investors purchase Mutuum Finance at $0.025 while initial investors may experience 140% gains during launch and analysts predict the token could reach $2 at post-launch. Mutuum Finance provides investors who look ahead with superior investment opportunities through its hybrid lending structure and secure systems alongside community-based incentives. Invest in Phase 5 because prices will rise during that phase.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Blockworks says that Hyperliquid now accounts for nearly 80% of perpetual futures trading volume in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space. According to the crypto insights platform, Hyperliquid is massively outperforming its competitors due to an effective token-listing strategy and top-notch user experience (UX). ‚ÄúHyperliquid‚Äôs success stems primarily from rapid, relevant token listings and superior UX for users and market makers. Currently, it is the only DEX that has been able to compete with CEX (centralized exchange) volumes. Over the past three months, the platform has averaged $6.4 billion in daily trading volume, which sits just above 50% of the daily trading volumes of Bybit and OKX. ‚Äú Source: Blockworks/X Blockworks notes that Hyperliquid‚Äôs trading engine, HyperCore, has given the project sufficient capital to initiate huge token buybacks. ‚ÄúFees generated on HyperCore are divided between the HLP (Hyperliquidity Provider) and the assistance fund.

This isn‚Äôt about who exports more goods‚Äîit‚Äôs about who controls the flow of money, credit, and investments around the world. Howell believes the Federal Reserve must prioritize financial stability above everything else , including interest rates or inflation control. That means continuously providing liquidity‚Äîessentially, ensuring there's enough money flowing through the system‚Äîso markets don‚Äôt break down when debt needs to be refinanced. This issue is urgent because the global financial system is extremely fragile. One major reason is the existence of the ‚Äúshadow banking system,‚Äù which includes hedge funds and non-bank financial institutions that operate with very high levels of leverage‚Äîsometimes 50 to 100 times their capital . That means a small change in market conditions can trigger huge losses and potentially a domino effect across the system. We saw this kind of collapse during the 2008 financial crisis, and Howell says the risk hasn‚Äôt gone away‚Äîit‚Äôs just shifted into more hidden corners of the market. A key point he makes is that debt levels are rising rapidly and need to be rolled over regularly , meaning governments and companies have to constantly borrow new money to pay back old debt. If there's not enough cash (liquidity) available, this creates a crisis. Howell notes that $70 trillion in global debt needs to be refinanced each year , and with higher interest rates today, this is becoming more expensive and riskier. One surprising winner during recent market stress has been Bitcoin. While not perfectly stable, it has held up better than expected, suggesting that liquidity conditions haven‚Äôt been as bad as feared. Howell explains that liquidity has actually increased lately for three reasons: A weaker U.S. dollar encourages borrowing and spending globally. China‚Äôs central bank has injected over $600 billion into its economy. The U.S. Treasury has been drawing money from its cash reserves at the Fed, unintentionally boosting short-term liquidity. But this may not last. The real concern is what happens later this year, especially as the U.S. tries to refinance about $9 trillion in Treasury debt while also covering another $2 trillion in new deficit spending. If interest rates keep rising, the cost of this debt skyrockets. Howell warns that if the Fed doesn‚Äôt step in to manage bond markets, it could lose control over the very heart of the financial system. This is where gold enters the picture. China, for example, is selling U.S. Treasuries and buying gold , possibly as a strategy to weaken the dollar‚Äôs dominance and protect its own economy. If more countries do this, gold becomes the new ‚Äúsafe asset,‚Äù replacing the U.S. government bond. Howell believes this is already happening, noting that gold prices are increasingly being set in Shanghai, not London‚Äîa major shift in global finance. He forecasts that if debt keeps growing at its current pace, the price of gold could double to $7,000 per ounce within the next 10 years . This is because as monetary inflation (money supply growing faster than the economy) continues, real assets like gold tend to rise to reflect that loss in currency value. Howell also discusses Bitcoin as a kind of digital gold. While it‚Äôs more volatile and affected by investor risk appetite, over the long term, it behaves similarly to gold‚Äî acting as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement . He notes that Bitcoin tends to be driven by three factors: Global liquidity (most important) The gold price Stock market risk sentiment Interestingly, Howell points out a generational divide: younger investors are more likely to trust and invest in Bitcoin, much like younger Germans in the 1920s shifted from bonds to stocks during hyperinflation. He suggests we may be witnessing a similar generational wealth shift today , as traditional safe assets like bonds become riskier in a world drowning in debt. When it comes to bonds, Howell is cautious. In the short term, bonds might perform well during a recession, but over the long term, they are likely to lose value due to rising inflation and higher interest costs . Instead, he recommends holding assets that benefit from monetary inflation, such as gold, Bitcoin, and certain stocks. He explains that the benchmark for asset returns is now about 8% per year , matching the pace of U.S. debt growth. So, investors should aim for returns above that just to keep their purchasing power intact. Equities, particularly in sectors like technology or those benefiting from inflation trends, may still offer those returns, while bonds and cash likely won‚Äôt. Looking forward, Howell believes the Federal Reserve must clearly define how it plans to use its balance sheet to support markets ‚Äînot just through interest rates, but through direct liquidity support if needed. The longer it waits, the greater the risk of a market breakdown, especially if countries like China continue to challenge the U.S. by offloading Treasuries and promoting alternatives like gold. He concludes with cautious optimism: the U.S. still has time to act , and past crises show it eventually does the right thing‚Äîthough often after trying everything else first. But the financial system is on thin ice, and the choices made this year could shape the next decade of global finance.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-20 20:04:24

Despite a modest price rebound in April, the premier cryptocurrency is yet to display a strong intent to resume its bull rally amidst a lack of positive market factors. However, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. has highlighted a promising development that could signal major upside potential for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Looking To Halt Selling Pressure In a recent post on X, Adler Jr. shared an important update in Bitcoin long-term holders (LTH) activity, which could prove significantly positive for the broader BTC market. Using on-chain data from CryptoQuant, the renowned analyst reports that selling pressure by long-term holders, i.e. amount of LTH holdings on exchanges, has now hit its lowest point at 1.1% over the past year. This development indicates that Bitcoin LTH are now opting to hold on to their assets rather than take profits. Adler explains that a further decline in these LTH exchange holdings to 1.0% would signal the total absence of selling pressure. Notably, this development could encourage new market entry and sustained accumulation, creating a strong bullish momentum in the BTC market. Importantly, Alder highlights that the majority of the Bitcoin LTH entered the market at an average price of $25,000, Since then, CryptoQuant has recorded the highest LTH selling pressure of 5.6% at $50,000 in early 2024 and 3.8% at $97,000 in early 2025. According to Adler, these two instances likely represent the primary profit-taking phases for long-term holders who intended to exit the market. Therefore, a resurgence in selling pressure from this cohort of BTC investors is unlikely in the short-term, which supports a building bullish case as long-term holders currently control 77.5% of Bitcoin in circulation. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $85,226 following a 0.36% gain in the past day and a 0.02% loss in the past week. Both metrics only reflect the ongoing market consolidation as BTC continues to struggle to achieve a convincing price breakout beyond $86,000. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs performance on the monthly chat now reflects a 1.97% gain, indicating a potential trend reversal as the market correction ceases. Nevertheless, BTC remains in need of a strong market catalyst to ignite any sustainable price rally. With a market cap of $1.67 trillion, Bitcoin is ranked as the largest digital asset, controlling 62.9% of the crypto market.",Bitcoin|Axel Adler Jr|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|LTH exchange holdings|Selling Pressure,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-20 20:30:24

The company's most recent acquisition of 3,459 BTC , valued at over $285 million at the time of purchase, on April 14, brought Strategy's total holdings to 531,644 BTC, valued at over $44.9 billion. Saylor followed up on the BTC chart, which he typically posts on Sundays to signal an imminent BTC acquisition, with a breakdown of investor exposure to the company. The executive wrote in an April 20 X post : ""Based on public data as of Q1 2025, over 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts hold MSTR directly. An estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios."" Strategy's growing popularity among retail and institutional investors is significant due to the company siphoning capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into the company accumulating and holding more BTC, slowly increasing the price of the supply-capped digital asset. Strategy‚Äôs chart of Bitcoin acquisitions.

Michael Saylor's stock market-to-BTC pipeline Strategy issues corporate debt and equity to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions , giving holders indirect exposure to BTC and feeding capital from traditional financial markets into the Bitcoin market. In December 2024, Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 , a weighted stock market index that tracks the 100 largest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq exchange. The inclusion of Strategy in the Nasdaq 100 will draw in even more capital to BTC from passive investors holding the tech-focused index in their portfolios. Strategy‚Äôs stock is currently trading at around $317.

The analyst added that Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $2.4 billion in capital flows year-to-date, helping to cushion the price of the digital asset.

Each coin offers unique features and growth potential, but which one is the better investment right now? This article delves into the strengths and future prospects of both cryptocurrencies, guiding readers toward a more informed decision. Cardano Shows Mixed Performance: Gains and Recent Declines ADA dropped 12.55% in the last month and fell 5% over the past week. However, the half-year performance saw a significant increase of 74.17%. These mixed short-term losses coupled with a strong long-term recovery indicate that while the coin can rebound, it is currently facing selling pressure. Traders have experienced fluctuations that highlight both potential risks and opportunities. ADA is currently trading between $0.47 and $1.02, with resistance at $1.37 and support at $0.27. Momentum indicators show a slight bearish sentiment in the short term, yet the overall trend is still unclear. Traders may find buying opportunities near the support level while considering profit-taking close to resistance, which suggests a cautious approach in the current market environment. Polkadot Market Snapshot: Recent Swings and Key Levels Past month activity shows a near 11 percent drop while the six-month performance is down about 10.5%. DOT experienced a slight rally over one week with a 5.38% gain, yet overall figures reveal a cautious market and varied price reactions. Current prices range from $3.38 to $4.96 with support at $2.73 and resistance at $5.89, while a further barrier exists at $7.47. The market lacks a clear trend as oscillators point to a balanced fight between bulls and bears. Traders may consider buying near support and taking profit near resistance, keeping positions flexible amid the sideways range. Conclusion ADA and DOT both show strong potential. ADA boasts a robust ecosystem and an active development team focused on innovation. DOT, on the other hand, excels in enabling interoperability and supports a huge number of projects. The choice between them depends on the specific goals and risk tolerance. Those valuing innovation may favor ADA, while those prioritizing range and interoperability might lean towards DOT. Both coins present unique opportunities for different investment strategies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This year‚Äôs celebrations feel extra special, with hopes rising around upcoming Dogecoin ETF approvals. The phrase Dogeday first began circulating in 2021, associating itself with International Weed Day, April 20, a date long associated with pleasure and counterculture. Since then, Dogecoin fans have made it a tradition to use the day to show their support for the coin, share memes, and highlight key milestones in Dogecoin‚Äôs ongoing journey. Originally starting as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies. It is now the eighth largest by market cap, with a valuation of roughly $23.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGEUSDT 15-minute price chart. Source: TradingView Dogecoin‚Äôs success comes down, in large part, to its sense of community, experts say. Its model, adding around 5 billion new coins yearly, keeps it low-cost to the average new investor. ‚ÄúBitcoin or Ethereum has a fixed supply, while Dogecoin‚Äôs inflation allows small investors to hold large amounts,‚Äù said Anndy Lian, a blockchain‚ÄÇadvisor. On this year‚Äôs Dogeday, hashtags such as #Dogeday2025 and #DogecoinToTheMoon trended on X. There were memes of Doge in space suits, jokes about ‚Äúbecoming billionaires,‚Äù and videos celebrating the resilience of Dogecoin . Investors pin hopes on Dogecoin ETF approvals As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) analyzes several exchange-traded funds (ETF) applications associated with the meme coin, the Dogecoin community remains optimistically focused. Major players, including Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares , and Osprey Funds, have proposals pending. The decision on its Dogecoin ETF comes as soon as May 18. Grayscale‚Äôs application has a May 21 deadline, although the SEC could still push back a final decision until October. The 21Shares and Osprey Fund‚Äôs filings are still waiting on a response date. This is why the approval of a Dogecoin ETF would be monumental. This would essentially expose more conventional investors to the meme crypto in the stock markets. The SEC recently delayed its decisions on several crypto ETF proposals. However, since the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, there‚Äôs cautious optimism for meme coins, like Dogecoin, to follow. If approved, a Dogecoin ETF would enable conventional investors, such as pension funds and banks, to invest in Dogecoin via regular stock exchanges. This would open up a huge new pool of money to the‚ÄÇDogecoin market and might be enough to increase prices. Elon Musk‚Äôs influence continues to power Dogecoin‚Äôs hype A big reason for Dogecoin‚Äôs continued success is the continued support of Elon Musk. The billionaire who founded the carmaker Tesla and the aerospace company SpaceX has several times called Dogecoin ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs crypto.‚Äù Whenever Musk tweets or jokes about Dogecoin, the coin price usually spikes. When he temporarily switched Twitter‚Äôs logo to the Doge image last year, it sent Dogecoin soaring 20% in hours. In November 2024, after Musk once again endorsed Dogecoin, the world‚Äôs seventh most valuable cryptocurrency surpassed luxury carmaker Porsche‚Äôs overall market value. Critics say Dogecoin‚Äôs dependence on social media buzz is a risky proposition. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks smart contracts, staking, and other technical features. Of course, this is all culture, memes, and community passion. With 2025 looking more and more like the year and the ETF decision looming sooner than we can imagine, there is hope in the $DOGE community. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Buying momentum has turned positive in the past 24 hours, but an interesting technical analysis of the current price action points to a looming downside risk. Related Reading: BNB Weathers The Storm Better Than Altcoins, Stats Show Crypto analyst Xanrox laid out a bearish case for Bitcoin in an analysis on the TradingView platform, arguing that the ongoing falling wedge pattern, often seen as a bullish indicator, may actually be a calculated trap set by whales. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could crash to $67,000 before another strong move upwards. Bitcoin‚Äôs Falling Wedge That Might Not Be Bullish After All Xanrox‚Äôs main argument centers on the widespread belief that falling wedges are bullish reversal patterns. Although this is often true when the wedge forms at the start of a trend, the current wedge is forming at the end of a broader trend, which is a different scenario altogether. The daily candlestick timeframe chart shows the Bitcoin price moving inside a clean wedge structure while trading well below the 20, 50, 100, and 200 daily moving averages. This setup, according to Xanrox, paints the picture of a clear downtrend rather than a setup for a reversal. The bearish outlook is not just about chart patterns; it‚Äôs also about market psychology and the mechanics of liquidity. Such a setup is likely being exploited by whales in institutions and banks with enough liquidity to influence price action. These whales need retail buyers to create enough volume for them to offload or accumulate positions. By painting the illusion of a breakout, they can push retail participants into a false sense of opportunity, only to reverse the market and trigger stop losses across the board. This outlook plays into the growing notion that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming more of an asset among institutions, primarily due to the rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Chart Image From TradingView: Xanrox 20% Price Move For Bitcoin This Week Xanrox predicted a 20% move for Bitcoin this week. A 20% move to the upside from the current $85,000 range would see Bitcoin trading back above $100,000 and somewhere around $102,000. However, this predicted 20% move isn‚Äôt an upside move but a downside move. Particularly, the analyst identified $67,000 as the level Bitcoin is most likely to test in the coming weeks. The $67,000 price level is the primary target if the current wedge fails as expected, as it is the major support on the way down if $75,000 is broken.

XRP holds its ground as one of the most trusted names in cross-border blockchain applications.

From borderless transactions to tokenized assets and smart contract-powered apps, blockchain is solving real problems, especially across Latin America where inflation, limited financial access, and cross-border constraints are part of daily life. For backers eyeing the top cryptos to join now, timing is everything. The biggest gains often go to those who move early‚Äîbefore the headlines, before the hype. Three projects are standing out this week for their ability to blend real-world utility with serious community momentum: Qubetics , Litecoin, and Tezos. One is setting a new benchmark in asset tokenization. The others are long-standing, battle-tested platforms with unique value in the decentralized economy. Let‚Äôs start with the frontrunner. Qubetics ‚Äì Real World Asset Tokenization Made Seamless Qubetics isn‚Äôt trying to copy what others are doing‚Äîit‚Äôs rewriting the rules. Its biggest draw right now is its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace, which is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and everyday buyers to digitize and trade real assets on-chain. Picture this: a small firm in Monterrey wants to tokenize its machinery for leasing agreements. Or a real estate developer in Medell√≠n wants to turn property shares into tradeable, fractional digital tokens. Even independent consultants in Mexico City can tokenize invoice receivables for instant liquidity. Qubetics makes all of that happen‚Äîlegally, securely, and across chains. It‚Äôs not just about blockchain for the sake of blockchain. Qubetics is building tools for people who want to put assets to work, without red tape or banking delays. The marketplace is audit-ready, compliant, and deeply customizable‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre issuing financial instruments or managing tokenized inventory. For Latin American economies, where trust in institutions can fluctuate and access to capital is uneven, this kind of decentralized asset management hits home. That‚Äôs why Qubetics is considered one of the top cryptos to join now. It offers real-world functionality that helps everyday businesses, freelancers, and side hustlers get more control over their finances while opening up new revenue models across borders. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Projections That Matter The current Qubetics crypto presale is in its 30th stage, and it‚Äôs flying. Over 508 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to 24,900+ holders, raising a total of $16.2 million. Right now, community members can still buy in at $0.1729 per token. Those who came in at stage one, when $TICS was just a penny, are now looking at a wild 1629% return. But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîit‚Äôs not too late to enter. Based on current projections, getting in at $0.1729 could still net a 477% ROI if the token reaches $1 post-presale. At $5, that‚Äôs 2789%. At $10? Try 5678%. And if it surges to $15 after the mainnet launch, that‚Äôs a mind-blowing 8567% return. These aren‚Äôt pipe dreams. Analysts are crunching the numbers based on real infrastructure, strong demand, and rising use cases across global markets. The presale‚Äôs still live‚Äîbut spots are getting tighter every day. Qubetics delivers real value, offers extraordinary growth potential, and solves concrete problems for a region that‚Äôs hungry for financial freedom. For anyone asking what are the top cryptos to join now, this one‚Äôs got to be on the radar. Litecoin ‚Äì Speed, Simplicity, and Staying Power Litecoin is a name that‚Äôs been around the block‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs still here. Created in 2011 as a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin, Litecoin has earned a rep as one of the most dependable cryptos in the game. It‚Äôs not flashy. It‚Äôs not hyped. But when people need a network that processes payments quickly and cheaply, they go with Litecoin. It‚Äôs especially popular across Latin America, where folks use it for remittances, peer-to-peer transfers, and even direct merchant payments. Thanks to its fast block time and low fees, Litecoin functions more like a traditional payment rail‚Äîbut without the limitations of banks, borders, or approvals. Behind the scenes, Litecoin has consistently updated its core tech, integrating privacy features like MimbleWimble to give users more control over their transaction data. Plus, it‚Äôs widely accepted across thousands of merchants, online platforms, and payment processors. Litecoin isn‚Äôt trying to do everything. It‚Äôs laser-focused on being sound money‚Äîa digital alternative to cash that people can use with ease. That singular focus has helped it build one of the most trusted brands in the crypto world. Litecoin is one of the top cryptos to join now for those looking to balance high-growth plays like Qubetics with steady, practical blockchain tech that gets real-world usage every day. Tezos ‚Äì Smart Contracts With Self-Upgrading Power Tezos is one of those projects that quietly builds while others make noise. Known for its self-amending blockchain, Tezos can upgrade without forks‚Äîmeaning no community splits or downtime when key features roll out. That‚Äôs rare and powerful in a space often shaken by protocol wars and governance disputes. What makes Tezos attractive to developers and institutions alike is its clean design. It supports smart contracts, NFTs, and scalable apps, all while using a liquid proof-of-stake system that‚Äôs energy-efficient and secure. And the on-chain governance model? It lets token holders vote on upgrades, aligning the project‚Äôs direction with its community. Tezos has found strong adoption in sectors like digital art, real estate, and gaming. From museum-backed NFT collections to blockchain-based property records, it‚Äôs proving that decentralized tech can work hand-in-hand with established industries. In Latin America, where education, intellectual property, and public transparency are hot topics, Tezos offers a blueprint for implementing trust-based systems without relying on centralized entities. Tezos is one of the top cryptos to join now for community members looking to support adaptable blockchain infrastructure that encourages participation and long-term stability without sacrificing innovation. Final Thoughts Finding the top cryptos to join now isn‚Äôt just about chasing hype. It‚Äôs about understanding what works, what‚Äôs scaling, and what offers real return potential. And right now, few projects check all those boxes like Qubetics. Its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace puts practical power in the hands of everyday users. The presale still offers room for strong ROI, and analysts are already mapping multi-thousand percent returns. For early adopters, it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúif‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs about how fast. Litecoin keeps its spot as a workhorse chain for fast, reliable payments. And Tezos is quietly winning the long game with tech that evolves on its own and appeals to both developers and institutional builders. Each project brings its own flavor. But if the goal is joining a movement before the spotlight hits, Qubetics might be the smartest bet this week. Take a close look. Evaluate the numbers. And if the fit feels right, join before the opportunity slips away.

Tezos features self-upgrading smart contracts, on-chain governance, and strong institutional adoption in digital art, gaming, and finance. Can I still join the Qubetics presale?

It helps tokenize physical and financial assets‚Äîlike real estate, equipment, or invoices‚Äîfor easier trade, liquidity, and compliance.

What‚Äôs Next for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu & PEPE After the Correction",https://bitzo.com/2025/04/memecoin-comeback-whats-next-for-dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-after-the-correction,"Memecoins have recently faced a downturn, making many wonder about their future. This article delves into the potential next moves for Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and PEPE after their recent correction. Could they be poised for another surge? This exploration offers insights into whether these popular digital coins are on the verge of a comeback. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Short-Term Dips versus 6-Month Gains DOGE dropped by about 7.27% over the last month while showing an overall gain of roughly 8.88% in the past six months. The coin has experienced short-term declines against a backdrop of more positive midterm recovery. This behavior reflects a period of volatility with recent setbacks outweighing long-term recovery trends. The current price ranges between $0.12 and $0.22 with major resistance near $0.28 and a secondary barrier around $0.38. Support is seen at around $0.08 with a lower level at zero. Short-term indicators and recent weekly losses nearing 6.60% suggest cautious trading. Bears currently dominate the price action, so traders may seek a clear breakout within these key levels before initiating new positions. Shiba Inu Price Action Amid Mixed Trends SHIB has shown a modest drop over the past week at -0.56% and a slight pullback of -3.78% for the month. Over the past six months, the performance reveals a steeper decline of -32.08%. The price has fluctuated within a range from $0.00001024 to $0.00001509. Indicators present a mixed picture, with a modest positive momentum of 0.00000086 contrasted by a negative Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.000000399. Current prices are trading between key support levels at $0.00000811 and $0.00000325, with resistances at $0.00001781 and $0.00002265. The market lacks a clear trend, as oscillators indicate neutrality. However, slight bullish signals from the momentum indicator suggest potential buying opportunities within these defined ranges. Upbeat Pepe Momentum Amid Mixed Trends PEPE price action shows a slight drop over the past month of 1.06% and a sharper decline over the last six months of 25.91%. Price moves have been volatile, reflecting short-term recovery attempts contrasted with a longer-term bearish sentiment. Data hints at alternating pressures with modest weekly gains of 1.48% that have not been sustained to overcome the extended downturn. Current price ranges from $0.0000052 to $0.0000092 with key support identified at $0.0000032 and resistance near $0.0000112. Price action is balanced with near-neutral RSI levels at 54.08, indicating mild buying pressure but no clear trend. Trading within these levels could involve testing the support zone before looking to make moves toward established resistance. Conclusion DOGE , SHIB , and PEPE have shown resilience despite the recent correction. DOGE's established presence keeps interest high. SHIB draws attention through its strong community and frequent updates. PEPE remains popular due to its meme appeal. Future movements depend on broader market trends and continued interest in meme-based tokens. Staying informed about these coins will be key to understanding their next steps.

Standard Chartered predicts it will reach $55 by year end due to its subnet architecture. This is a game changer for scalability and cost reduction. Avalanche is a serious competitor to Ethereum and Bitcoin. After the December upgrade, developer interest in the ecosystem has gone through the roof. Avalanche is on a roll. But while Avalanche is tackling the scalability problem, another project is taking a different approach. Ruvi AI is carving out its own space in the blockchain ecosystem by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver real world impact and tangible benefits to users across industries. Introducing Ruvi AI Unlike Avalanche which is addressing structural inefficiencies, Ruvi AI is combining blockchain with AI to deliver practical and effective solutions. Its superapp is intuitive and supports workflow automation, creative process enhancement and operational streamlining. This makes Ruvi AI a must have platform for creators, businesses and developers to stay ahead of the curve. At the heart of this ecosystem is the $RUVI token , a fundamental part of the platform that enables secure interactions and is a promising investment opportunity. Backed by a transparent roadmap and huge growth potential, $RUVI token is more than just a utility token; it‚Äôs a gateway to a tech driven revolution. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Success The presale of Ruvi AI has been phenomenal, the level of trust and excitement in the market is huge. Within days of launch 10 million tokens were sold, raising $100,000. The token was priced at $0.01 during presale and will be listed at $0.07, making it a very attractive opportunity for investors. Forecasts suggest the token could hit $1 post listing, which makes Ruvi AI one of the best investment in the blockchain space today. VIP Tier 3 Benefits One of the best things about Ruvi AI is its VIP tier system, a well thought out system that rewards presale participants with awesome benefits. VIP Tier 3 has gotten a lot of attention especially from mid to high level investors. The minimum investment to qualify for it is 100,000 tokens, which is $1,000 during the presale, participants in this tier get a 60% bonus. This bonus adds 60,000 tokens to the original purchase, making it 160,000 tokens. At the listing price of $0.07 this would be worth $11,200 and if the $1 valuation is hit, the value would be $160,000. The combination of accessibility and high returns makes Tier 3 impossible to resist for those who want to maximize their investment in a game changing innovation. Leaderboard Rewards for Dedicated Investors To further drive participation, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program that rewards top presale contributors with big bonuses. The top 10 most loyal supporters get 500,000 tokens, worth $500,000 at the $1 valuationThe top 50 get 250,000 tokens, worth $250,000 and 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens each, worth $20,000 at peak projections. This rewards system is designed to not only create excitement around the project but also a sense of community and shared vision among Ruvi AI‚Äôs early adopters. Why Ruvi AI Isn‚Äôt Just Another Blockchain Project Avalanche is laying the groundwork for blockchain scalability with its subnet strategy but it‚Äôs focused on structural inefficiencies. Ruvi AI is taking a more practical approach by targeting usability and tangible results for its users. By combining blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI delivers solutions that are not just theoretical but already having real world impact on people and businesses. And with Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP rewards and leaderboard incentives it‚Äôs even more attractive for investors. The roadmap is transparent and focused on short and long term value creation so you get practical innovation not hype. Why RUVI AI is The Future? Avalanche‚Äôs scalability strategy will reshape blockchain infrastructure over the next few years but Ruvi AI is redefining how blockchain can solve real world problems today. With its presale success and VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards, it‚Äôs a leader in blockchain and AI innovation. Now is the time to act. Ruvi AI gives you the opportunity to invest in future thinking technology and be part of a community that‚Äôs driving real change. Don‚Äôt just watch the future happen. Be part of it with Ruvi AI.

Solana (SOL) Faces Stiff Competition During 2021 Solana (SOL) hit unprecedented heights because of its fast blockchain but lost momentum in 2025. The current market price of $126 positions SOL at a disadvantage for reaching previous peak levels since market participants choose alternative investments. The scalability advantage of Solana faces diminishing momentum because Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among other new projects bring innovative DeFi services to the marketplace. Mutuum‚Äôs lending model, with mtTokens accruing interest and a buyback system fueling demand, contrasts with Solana‚Äôs broader focus. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds a loyal user base, it‚Äôs poised to challenge Solana‚Äôs dominance in the altcoin space. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Shines The primary focus of MUTM stands alone from market hype because it provides practical product features.

Seize the Moment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the crypto market through its merger of useful DeFi technology with features that support investors. People should understand that Phase 4‚Äôs entry price of 0.025 USDT will not stay available because Phase 5 will introduce elevated costs for Mutuum Finance (MUTM).
