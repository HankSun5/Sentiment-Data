Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Various attempts to pierce key levels have been unsuccessful, with prices going as low as $0.149 before recovering marginally. Market observers indicate that these short-term setbacks could be a prelude to monumental price swings in either direction. Possible 40% Fall Before The Huge Rally A fresh analysis published on TradingView by SwallowAcademy indicates Dogecoin might see a dramatic drop before any significant price increase. The analyst looked into DOGE‚Äôs price action compared to Tether (USDT) on daily charts, where the meme coin has been known to be extremely volatile. Their plots indicate a sudden spike in the beginning of 2024 followed by a decline from highs around $0.23, then another downslide to $0.09 mid-year before recovering above $0.45. SwallowAcademy thinks that the same trend may develop in 2025. However, their prediction is that Dogecoin may decline another 40% to around $0.09, creating a zone of support before, possibly, skyrocketing 400% to $0.45. The price stands at over $0.15 currently, and the analyst is holding out for the anticipated drop to $0.09. The ‚ÄòFalse Break‚Äô Pattern ‚Äì What It Means A standalone analysis by Trader Tardigrade indicates Dogecoin‚Äôs initial ‚Äúfalse break‚Äù since December 2024. The cryptocurrency has, in general, traced a downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, which are common bearish market indicators. After dropping to $0.13 on April 7, though, the price did bounce briefly before declining once more. Trader Tardigrade reads this as a ‚Äúfalse breakdown‚Äù ‚Äì potentially indicating the end of the downtrend. With prices remaining above the support line for a few days, this pattern may indicate an imminent bullish reversal. Based on their analysis, Dogecoin may aim for $0.42 if the reversal occurs. #Dogecoin Makes a False Break for the First Time Since Dec 2024 üî• It‚Äôs staying above the support line for days, confirming the characteristics of a false break.

According to the firm‚Äôs data, activity on the XRP Ledger has fallen by 80% since its peak in December, reaching unprecedented lows in recent months. This decline is not limited to on-chain data. A similar decline is also observed in the XRP futures market. There has been a decrease of approximately 70% in open interest, with these levels last seen in November 2023. In addition, funding rates are also in a downward trend and have turned negative at times. According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs assessment, XRP‚Äôs estimated leverage ratio is also on the decline. This ratio is calculated by dividing open positions by the XRP reserves on an exchange and reflects the average leverage usage of users. Related News: Senior Analyst Claims Bitcoin Price ‚ÄúCould Go Much Higher,‚Äù Predicts What Would Happen in This Scenario Despite all this negative data, the XRP price is only down about 35% from its December peak, a more limited decline compared to other major crypto assets like Ethereum, which has lost close to 60% of its value in the same period. Another noteworthy data is the continuous decline in exchange reserves on the XRP Ledger. Exchange reserves, which have fallen to levels last seen in July 2023, may indicate that investors prefer to withdraw their XRP from exchanges and store it for the long term. CryptoQuant claims that this data could be a potential recovery signal for XRP. The relative resilience of the price and the decline in exchange reserves could indicate positive investor sentiment for XRP, even if market conditions remain challenging. *This is not investment advice.

The Westlake, Texas-based firm is already capitalizing on strong engagement with digital assets and is poised to expand its offerings even further, Wurster explained on a recent conference call. According to a transcript, available on Seeking Alpha, the newly appointed CEO pointed to a broad range of available products‚Äîfrom crypto ETFs to Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures‚Äîand a rapidly growing interest from both clients and potential customers, adding: ‚ÄúWe saw a 400% increase in traffic to our crypto site recently‚Äî70% of whom were not clients.‚Äù That spike in traffic, Wurster noted, is a sign that Schwab‚Äôs reputation as a trusted financial brand is resonating with crypto-curious investors who may have previously been hesitant to jump in. ‚ÄúAs people in the industry are thinking about crypto, they‚Äôd love to work with a trusted brand‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre that firm.‚Äù You might also like: Chart of the week: Solana could end crypto market limbo with 10% rally, SOL eyes $150 target Spot crypto trading While Schwab currently enables access to crypto through ETFs, closed-end funds, and futures, Wurster revealed that the firm is actively planning to offer direct access to spot crypto trading.

Wurster framed the expansion as both a response to client demand and a strategic move to maintain the firm‚Äôs role as a top destination for retail and institutional crypto investors alike. As digital assets evolve from fringe fascination to mainstream financial tools, Schwab‚Äôs next chapter may look more Web3 than Wall Street. What‚Äôs the competition like? Several firms already offer spot crypto trading, giving users direct access to buy and sell actual cryptocurrencies. Leading crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Gemini dominate the space, offering robust platforms with a wide range of trading pairs and deep liquidity. These platforms are typically favored by both retail and institutional users for their user experience and advanced trading tools. Traditional finance players are also entering the arena. Fidelity, through its Fidelity Crypto platform, offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, while Robinhood and eToro enable commission-free crypto trades alongside stocks and ETFs.

Referencing a chart from IntoTheBlock, Brett pointed out that the total value locked (TVL) in RWA platforms has now exceeded $10 billion. This chart shows a steady climb in TVL from under $5 billion in mid-2024 to over $10 billion by April 2025, marking more than 100% growth within a year. The upward momentum is important as it reflects expanding confidence and capital inflows into blockchain-based tokenization of traditional assets such as real estate, credit, and government bonds. BOOOOOOOOOOOOM üí•üí•üî• BULLISH: The total value locked in real-world asset ( #RWA ) protocols has surpassed $10 billion, continuing its growth trend. $XRP pic.twitter.com/tdah8kbuxq ‚Äî Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 18, 2025 Implications for XRP in the Tokenization Sector This development carries strong implications for digital assets like XRP, which have been building infrastructure to support tokenized assets. Ripple has made it clear that real-world asset tokenization is a core focus. The company recently partnered with RWA.xyz to allow seamless tracking of tokenized assets and RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and has made significant strides in the tokenization market. As the RWA sector draws in more capital, XRP is best positioned to support the coming wave of tokenized assets. Its infrastructure is already tailored to these needs and is a natural fit for institutions looking to move from pilot projects to real-world implementations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Positioned for Utility-Based Growth The XRPL is engineered for efficiency and interoperability, both vital traits in the tokenization landscape. As traditional financial firms explore blockchain solutions, those with proven scalability will stand out. The XRPL already hosts tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and other assets and has become a popular choice for institutions looking to launch RWAs on the blockchain. WhiteRock, a multi-million dollar tokenized securities platform, recently went live on the XRPL , bringing tokenized stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and other real-world assets into the digital finance ecosystem. The $10 billion milestone shows that tokenization is not a distant concept but is already underway. This rise in locked value across protocols signals that institutional demand is growing, and as Brett pointed out, the market is responding favorably. XRP, one of the few digital assets with existing enterprise solutions for real-world value transfer, could benefit significantly from this adoption curve. If the trend in RWA TVL continues, the digital asset‚Äôs relevance as a settlement asset and infrastructure layer will become even more pronounced. Brett‚Äôs post serves as a timely signal that the tokenization market is accelerating, and XRP is capitalizing on that growth.

The plan suggests cutting stakeholder rewards from 7% to 3.79%, prompting support and opposition across different stakeholders. Aptos Push for Innovation Faces Resistance from Validators According to reports, the main argument behind AIP-119 is to move user focus from passive staking to more active use of capital within the ecosystem. Many supporters believe the current 7% reward encourages holding tokens without driving innovation. According to their position, reducing this yield can free up capital to support activities such as restaking, MEV extraction, and deeper participation in DeFi protocols. Proponents also argue that high-stakes returns are similar to excessive interest rates in traditional finance. The proposal‚Äôs authors describe the 7% as a risk-free benchmark and stress their position by stating that it might be holding the system back from realistic growth. Some, like crypto user Moon Shiesty, believe the drop in staking demand will be balanced out by inflation control and new projects launching in the next half-year. He mentioned that funds saved from staking rewards could be used to support early Layer 1 stablecoins through incentives and lower gas fees. Meanwhile, Aptos recently shifted its focus toward strengthening its NFT and DeFi ecosystem . This aims to attract developers and projects looking for alternatives to Ethereum and Solana. Smaller Validators Fear Getting Priced Out It is worth noting that not everyone agrees. The report also disclosed that smaller validators say the proposal could hurt their ability to remain in the network. Running a validator node on Aptos costs between $15,000 and $35,000 annually. With rewards dropping, some fear they might not break even. The report details that more than 50 validators currently hold less than 3 million APT each. They represent just 9% of the total network but are important for maintaining decentralization. The proposal includes a delegation plan to support these operators by assigning extra tokens to help them stay afloat. Call for Balance in Governance Decisions It is important to add that notable Voices like Yui, COO of Slime Revolution, are urging caution. While speaking on the development, she warned that pushing out smaller players could affect the system‚Äôs health in the long run. Meanwhile, others argue that lowering emissions could lead to price growth, making up for the lower yield. The proposal remains under review, with the community watching closely. In related news, Aptos recently unveiled new upgrades for faster and more scalable blockchain solutions.

Tokyo faces a 24% levy on most exports to the United States, though that rate, like many of President Donald Trump‚Äôs duties, has been paused for 90 days. The temporary freeze is due to expire in early July, and economists warn that a snap‚Äëback could jolt trade in both directions. A 10% universal tariff still applies, and finished cars‚Äîone of Japan‚Äôs biggest money earners‚Äîcarry a separate 25% charge. Because the two countries follow different crash‚Äëtest systems, officials in Tokyo believe they can narrow the gap. Letting U.S. models meet American standards instead of Japan‚Äôs would be offered in exchange for lighter tariffs, unnamed sources told Nikkei . The tariff dispute has shaken markets and stirred fears of a deeper slowdown. Japan is trying to roll back what Trump calls ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù duties that he has imposed on dozens of trading partners. After one of the first round‚Äëtable sessions since the trade offensive began, Trump said Wednesday that the two sides had made ‚Äúbig progress.‚Äù Industry analysts say the wider fight over car tariffs could steer the future of electric vehicles in the United States. Tariffs may slow EV adoption in the US Many lower‚Äëpriced electric cars sold in America are imported. The 25% duty Trump placed on them is expected to raise sticker prices and curb demand. Higher costs and slower sales would squeeze profit margins and leave less money for research and development. ‚ÄúIf they are having to spend more money to either pay for tariffs or move production to the U.S., that‚Äôs significant capex for most of the companies,‚Äù said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funding not going to R&D, which means they‚Äôre not going to be able to innovate and not bring new technologies to market. That will make them less competitive in the global marketplace at a time they‚Äôre already getting shut out of China.‚Äù Affordability is already a hurdle Dealer data company Cox Automotive Inc. says the average transaction price of a new electric vehicle tops $55,000. Buyers also worry about driving range, public chargers, charging speed, grid stability, and a political debate over the cars‚Äô role in cutting emissions. Trump has ordered a review of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that helps consumers. Analysts warn that adding a 25% tariff to imported models‚Äîone tool automakers have used to keep prices down‚Äîcould lift costs by $4,000 to $20,000 per vehicle. Trump is acting under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, saying the country needs a strong manufacturing base and secure supply chain. He argues that the duties will bring jobs home, raise tax revenue, and help reduce the federal debt. The same 25% rate will hit imported auto parts starting May 3. Parts that meet the rules of the United States‚ÄëMexico‚ÄëCanada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2020, are exempt until the non‚ÄëU.S. share can be measured. There may be one bright spot for battery cars. The battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric vehicle. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers subsidies for battery plants in the United States, and billions of dollars are flowing into new factories. Officials say that, once a tracking system is in place, the auto tariffs will cover only the content made outside the country. A car assembled in Mexico but fitted with U.S.‚Äëmade batteries could avoid most of the duty. The administration has not said when that accounting will begin. For now, negotiators hope that a shift in Japan‚Äôs crash‚Äëtest rules will be enough to ease tensions and soften tariffs that have upended trade flows across the Pacific.

Charles Schwab CEO hints spot BTC trading may come in April 2026 Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster said the financial services company is looking at a potential April 2026 target to rollout spot Bitcoin trading to its clients. According to RIABiz , the CEO said that crypto was attracting traffic to the financial service company's crypto-focused website. 70% of that traffic was not Schwab clients and represented potentially new prospects, Wurster said. The Schwab CEO gave a timeline for the rollout: ‚ÄúOur expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto. Our goal is to do that in the next 12 months."" The move comes at a time when many traditional financial institutions are increasingly adopting crypto or offering digital asset products to their clients. Crypto, DeFi may widen wealth gap, destabilize finance: BIS report The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies may pose risks to the traditional financial system and exacerbate wealth inequality, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). In an April 15 report , the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi ) have ‚Äúreached a critical mass,‚Äù with investor protection becoming a ‚Äúsignificant concern for regulators.‚Äù The size of the crypto market signals that authorities should be worried about the ‚Äústability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy,‚Äù the report states, highlighting the role of stablecoins, which the BIS said have ‚Äúbecome the means through which participants transfer value within crypto.‚Äù BIS report on crypto and DeFi‚Äôs functions and financial stability implications.

In its most recent SEC filing dated April 15, the company revealed a paper loss of approximately $41.8 million for the first quarter of 2025. This loss stems from the sharp drop in BTC prices, which slid from $93,500 at the beginning of January to almost $82,000 by March 31. Semler Scientific Sees Steep Losses Despite the downturn , Semler remains heavily invested in the cryptocurrency and holds 3,182 BTC at quarter‚Äôs end. The firm, which ranks as the twelfth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, right above Boyaa Interactive International Limited, continues to double down on its digital asset strategy. CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian reiterated this stance when he affirmed the company‚Äôs dual focus on Bitcoin accumulation and ongoing healthcare innovation. Financially, Semler projected modest revenue between $8.8 million and $8.9 million for the quarter, but operating losses are expected to land between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. As of March 31, Semler reported having about $10 million in cash and cash equivalents. In yet another strategic move, the company also announced plans to issue up to $500 million in securities, the proceeds of which are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including continued cryptocurrency purchases. However, investor sentiment appears wary. The company‚Äôs stock, traded under the ticker SMLR on the Nasdaq, has declined by more than 22% since the start of the year. Agreement With DOJ Semler Scientific announced via a separate 8-K filing that it has reached an agreement-in-principle to resolve longstanding legal concerns with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The company said that it is prepared to pay around $30 million to address allegations that it violated the False Claims Act through improper marketing practices tied to devices billed to Medicare. The DOJ‚Äôs civil investigation dates back to 2017, when it issued a formal demand to examine potential fraud. While this proposed settlement would mark a major step toward resolution, Semler‚Äôs filing noted that a finalized agreement with the agency is not yet guaranteed.

Fast transactions and cross border payments are what XRP is known for and has been a pioneer in displaying the capabilities of blockchain. But as the crypto space matures, the spotlight is shifting to platforms that combine blockchain with other game changing technologies. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a project that will redefine innovation by merging artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Ruvi AI is getting a lot of attention in the crypto space and for good reason. This forward thinking project has already sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised over $100,000 in just a few days of its presale. The excitement around Ruvi AI is not just about the ROI but also the utilities and the vision. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart? Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt launching another cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs launching an entire ecosystem that solves real world problems. At the heart of it is the Ruvi AI superapp, a feature rich platform that allows users to use AI for various tasks, from generating professional level content to creating visuals and multimedia. By holding the $RUVI token, users get access to this ecosystem and benefits including: Access to Premium AI Tools Whether you‚Äôre a marketer, content creator or entrepreneur, Ruvi AI‚Äôs superapp lets you streamline your workflow with AI generated text, images and even multimedia. Passive Income Opportunities Investors can stake their $RUVI tokens to earn rewards, effectively turn their holdings into a steady stream of income. Governance Rights Unlike traditional platforms, Ruvi AI gives token holders a voice in the decision making process of the ecosystem and features. This combination of utility, income and community driven governance makes $RUVI more than just a speculative asset. It‚Äôs a tool for innovation and growth. Limited Time Opportunity before 50% Price Increase The window to get in on Ruvi AI‚Äôs early growth is closing. During the current presale, $RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.01 each. Once this phase is over, the token price will increase by 50%, so now is the time to get in. For those looking to maximize returns, Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP bonus structure offers additional rewards. Through this system, investors can earn extra tokens based on the size of their presale contribution. VIP Tier 2 Example: Big Rewards for Small Investors To show how good the VIP system is, let‚Äôs say an investor puts in a small $500 during the presale. At the current price of $0.01 per token, that‚Äôs 50,000 $RUVI tokens, which qualifies the investor for VIP Tier 2. This tier gets a 40% bonus, which adds 20,000 tokens to their total allocation, making it 70,000 tokens. At the listed price of $0.07 per token, the original $500 investment becomes $4,900, a 880% ROI. That‚Äôs what Ruvi AI is offering to its early supporters. Leaderboard Rewards Add Extra Incentives If the VIP rewards weren‚Äôt enough, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program to recognize and reward its top investors. Throughout the presale , the biggest token holders are ranked and significant bonuses are given based on tiered rankings: Top 10 investors get an extra 500,000 $RUVI tokens (a $35,000 value at the listed price). Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens as a reward. Even broader groups, like the Top 1,000 get 20,000 tokens each. These bonuses stack on top of the VIP tier rewards, so serious investors get even more returns and a community driven environment. While XRP has established itself as a major player in the blockchain space, Ruvi AI is heading into uncharted territory. By combining blockchain with the power of artificial intelligence, this platform is solving real world problems and disrupting industries like digital media and content creation. Market analysts and crypto enthusiasts are raving about Ruvi AI‚Äôs utility, presale performance and vision. The $RUVI token is not just any other cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs an investment in the tools and technologies of the future. Next Steps for Ruvi AI The crypto world moves fast and those who get in early get the biggest returns. Ruvi AI has everything an investor could want in a blockchain project: innovative technology, tangible utilities and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. The first phase will be over soon and the price will increase by 50%. Now is the time to get in. Join the early adopters and get in on Ruvi AI.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging from the shadows with the kind of early metrics and innovation that once defined top-tier projects. Those involved in the altcoin presale are purchasing MUTM tokens at a price of $0.025, with the platform raising a total of $6.9 million so far. The presale has attracted over 8,400 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. If the projections hold, this token may not just catch up to SOL and XRP, it could fly right past them. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform collected more than $6.9 million and accumulated 8,400 members in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of the Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 USD value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. The first users who join gain complete access to unique staking keys together with voting rights along with premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. The Ethereum-based platform achieves price stability by letting users deposit USD funds and operate within it stablecoin system. This transaction system utilizes a resilient solution to eliminate stability problems that typically appear in financial operations. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its two-part crypto lending system that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models to bring users better asset availability with enhanced transparency. Smart contract pools in the P2C model enable stablecoin lending by users so platform users can obtain instant borrowing access with passive income opportunities. Automatic interest rate adjustments enabled through smart contracts provide value to lenders through higher returns and lower costs of borrowing to borrowers. Decentralized lending takes place on the P2P model so users can bypass traditional financial institutions during their transactions. The borrowers and lenders can both negotiate specific loan conditions through this system to create an easier and more personalized process. All parties benefit from platform transparency because it provides users full control over their transactions thereby establishing trust and grants them power in their lending and borrowing activities. While giants like Solana (SOL) and XRP remain strong contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as a serious challenger. With $6.9 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM‚Äôs innovative dual-lending model and growing presale momentum signal massive upside potential. Early investors at $0.025 could see up to 140% ROI by launch. Don‚Äôt miss your window and get in early.

After months of downward pressure, analysts are eyeing a possible breakout toward the long-awaited $1 target. $1 Dogecoin Price Target Closer Than Ever Crypto analyst Master Kenobi believes that the Dogecoin price could reach the highly coveted $1 target before the end of this market cycle. Based on his technical analysis, DOGE is once again mirroring a historical breakout pattern that previously led to an explosive surge in price. Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here‚Äôs What The Experts Say The analyst shared a Dogecoin price chart with two main sections highlighted. The first green box, between September to November 2024, shows a historical breakout that occurred after the meme coin broke above a critical descending trendline. Following this breakout, the price surged significantly over the next 55 days. Notably, the descending trendline has acted as a strong resistance for months. However, with Dogecoin‚Äôs momentum currently building, Master Kenobi believes that a strong breakout is imminent. Looking at DGOE‚Äôs price action, it appears the same conditions for its previous breakout are forming again. Master Kenobi‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that a breakout above the current descending resistance line could spark a similar rally, one that could potentially take Dogecoin from its current price of $0.158 to $0.9 or even $1. Such a move would represent a staggering gain of approximately 533%. Similar to past trends, Dogecoin‚Äôs current chart indicates a projected 55-day move following the breakout, with the green arrow and shaded box indicating a path to the conservative $0.9 target. This would place Dogecoin‚Äôs target window during the first few weeks of June, aligning closely with historical timelines from the last major breakout. Adding to the optimism, Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 43.35 ‚Äî a level typically considered a neutral to oversold zone. The current descending resistance line has already been tested multiple times, meaning a clean daily close above it could spark Dogecoin‚Äôs next major rally. Dogecoin RSI Shifts From Bearish To Bullish Dogecoin is showing promising signs of a bullish reversal after a key breakout of a technical pattern on the 4-hour chart. According to a recent chart analysis by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has exited a Falling Wedge formation and is preparing for an uptrend continuation. The breakout was confirmed as the RSI crossed above the 50 level, signaling a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Before the Falling Wedge breakout, Dogecoin had been trading in a downward channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. This pattern often precedes an upward price movement, and Dogecoin seems to be following through with this trend.

33767162,[object Object],1745100024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Face Deep Losses ‚Äì Early Bear Market Conditions Emerging?,https://bitcoinist.com/short-term-bitcoin-holders-face-deep-losses-early-bear-market-conditions-emerging/,"Bitcoin is trading at a critical juncture after several days of consolidation, ranging between $83,000 and $86,000. Despite brief attempts to break out, the price continues to stall, with neither bulls nor bears able to take full control. This indecision reflects the broader uncertainty gripping global financial markets as macroeconomic tensions, including the ongoing trade conflict between the US and China, keep investors on edge. With no clear catalyst in sight, Bitcoin remains directionless, stuck below key moving averages and unable to reclaim the $90,000 level that many view as the threshold for a confirmed uptrend. At the same time, strong support around $81,000 has held so far, suggesting that long-term holders still provide a strong base of conviction. According to Glassnode, unrealized losses normalized by percentage drawdown reveal that Short-Term Holders are already carrying significant losses‚Äîlevels that resemble early bear market conditions in previous cycles. This data point suggests a fragile market structure where further downside pressure could trigger broader capitulation, or, conversely, a sharp rebound if sentiment shifts. For now, Bitcoin‚Äôs price remains compressed , and traders are watching closely for the breakout that will define the next major move. Bitcoin Consolidation Continues Amid Volatility And Uncertainty Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase after enduring weeks of prolonged selling pressure and heightened volatility. The broader macroeconomic landscape remains hostile, with global tensions deepening as US President Donald Trump continues to escalate his trade war with China. Although a 90-day tariff pause was announced last week for all countries except China, the move has done little to calm investor fears. The standoff between the world‚Äôs two largest economies continues to influence risk appetite, dragging on traditional markets and crypto alike. On-chain data from Glassnode reveals that Bitcoin‚Äôs unrealized losses, when normalized by percentage drawdown, show that Short-Term Holders are already experiencing substantial losses. These levels are consistent with the early stages of previous bear markets, suggesting that downside risk remains elevated. While this does not confirm the start of a full-blown bear market, it highlights the vulnerability in the current structure. Until a major breakout or breakdown occurs, Bitcoin remains in limbo. Bitcoin is currently trading below key moving averages, unable to reclaim momentum despite bouncing from short-term support levels. This signals a market still dominated by uncertainty and lacking a decisive catalyst. The $90K level remains a critical threshold that bulls must reclaim to shift sentiment, while the $81K region is acting as a crucial floor for now. BTC Price Struggles Below Key levels As Market Awaits Confirmation Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,900 after spending several days ranging just below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) around $85,000. Despite holding above the $83,000 support zone, bulls have failed to reclaim key moving averages that would signal renewed momentum. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently around $88,000, remains the primary resistance level that must be cleared for a true recovery rally to begin. The price action suggests indecision as buyers hesitate to commit amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global tensions. BTC‚Äôs inability to close convincingly above the EMA keeps the market in a state of cautious optimism. Bulls need to reclaim both the 200-day EMA and the 200-day SMA to confirm a bullish trend shift and attempt a retest of the $90,000 mark. However, failure to hold above the $83,000 level could trigger a new wave of selling. If bears regain control and push BTC below this zone, a move toward $80,000‚Äîor potentially lower‚Äîbecomes increasingly likely. For now, the market remains in a tight consolidation range, and traders are watching closely for a breakout in either direction. A decisive move will likely shape Bitcoin‚Äôs next major trend.

We will caution that protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial‚Äëmarket stress.‚Äù The IMF announcement , delivered blocks from the White House, opens a week packed with reports that will test the impact of tariffs on global trade. Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 gather in Washington at the same time. Georgieva urged them to seek ‚Äúa more resilient world economy, not a drift to division,‚Äù calling the talks ‚Äúa vital forum for dialogue at a vital time.‚Äù United States and Canada The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book on Wednesday will offer ground‚Äëlevel stories about how firms are coping with higher tariffs and redrawn supply lines. Earlier that day, officials are expected to show a small rise in March new‚Äëhome sales. Mortgage rates have hovered above 6.5 percent since October, so builders have been offering discounts and upgrades to coax buyers. Data on existing‚Äëhome resales follow on Thursday. In Canada, the election campaign enters its last week with Prime Minister Mark Carney‚Äôs Liberals about five points ahead, close to the majority line, even as U.S. trade tension weighs on factories in Ontario and Alberta. Asia‚ÄëPacific China will set its loan prime rates on Monday; economists see no change after stronger first‚Äëquarter growth. Indonesia will post March trade data showing conditions before the U.S. measures took effect, while the Philippines is likely to record another balance‚Äëof‚Äëpayments surplus for the month. On Tuesday, New Zealand will release March trade numbers, and Taiwan and Hong Kong will publish employment data. A day later, Bank Indonesia is expected to keep its key rate steady for a third meeting to support the rupiah, one of Asia‚Äôs worst‚Äëperforming currencies this year. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa Most European markets close on Monday for a holiday, and many central bankers will be in Washington. Euro‚Äëarea consumer‚Äëconfidence data will arrive on Tuesday, followed by the European Central Bank‚Äôs survey of professional forecasters. The ECB wage tracker due Wednesday points to slower pay gains after President Christine Lagarde cut rates last week. Germany‚Äôs Ifo survey of business confidence will arrive on Thursday, showing how companies view the tariff shock and the new coalition agreement. Similar sentiment gauges from France are due Friday. The Swiss National Bank will report its first‚Äëquarter earnings on Thursday, and President Martin Schlegel will address its annual meeting a day later. Latin America Argentina, fresh from a 20 billion‚Äëdollar financing deal with the IMF that brings 12 billion dollars up front, releases February economic‚Äëactivity data on Tuesday. Colombia will post February numbers after January‚Äôs growth surprised analysts and led some to raise 2025 forecasts. Paraguay‚Äôs central bank may lift its policy rate above the current 6 percent after inflation jumped 100 basis points in four months to 4.4 percent. Brazil‚Äôs mid‚Äëmonth inflation report for April is due Friday; if March is a guide, the headline rate could move further beyond the top of the central bank‚Äôs target. Mexico ends the week with February economic‚Äëactivity figures and a mid‚Äëmonth consumer‚Äëprice update. What to expect next? Georgieva says the IMF does not expect a global recession, yet the run of data will give the clearest picture so far of how quickly the tariff fight is filtering through spending, hiring, and prices. Investors and officials will scan every report for clues on whether the world economy can absorb the shock or whether deeper cracks are forming. Markets will react as numbers come into focus soon.

In a detailed post on his Telegram channel, Durov denied the allegations, which he called ‚Äúblatant misinformation,‚Äù and claimed Telegram had been complying with EU law long before the incident. The claims were sparked by a recent French report that suggested Durov‚Äôs detention had ‚Äúfinally‚Äù led Telegram to comply with the EU‚Äôs Digital Services Act (DSA). ‚ÄúThis is wrong,‚Äù Durov wrote, adding: ‚ÄúTelegram has always been compliant with EU law.‚Äù Related News: Ripple (XRP) Network Activity Declines, Whales Withdraw XRP from Exchanges - What Does It Mean?

Durov noted that Telegram, currently the world's second most popular messaging platform, invests millions every year to ensure legal compliance in all jurisdictions.

Back in 2021, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu blew up outta nowhere. They took over Twitter, Reddit, and even made it into conversations at your local panader√≠a. Folks laughed at them at first‚Äîuntil those same coins minted millionaires. That‚Äôs the thing about meme coins: they thrive on culture, community, and pure digital energy. Now here we are in 2025, and meme coins have become more than just speculative assets. They‚Äôre vibrant communities, sometimes even stronger than those around serious DeFi projects. Meme coins represent rebellion, humor, and the underdog spirit‚Äîya sabes, that ‚Äúwe got nothin‚Äô to lose‚Äù attitude. And while some came and vanished faster than a reggaet√≥n summer hit, others left footprints (or pawprints) that made the crypto world sit up and pay attention. Enter Troller Cat ($TCAT). This ain‚Äôt your average meme coin. This fluffy rebel is bringing a whole new game to the table. It‚Äôs got the humor, sure‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also got whispers of play-to-earn utility, potential deflationary mechanics, and early adopters foaming at the mouth with excitement. If you‚Äôve been on the sidelines, scratching your head and thinking, ‚Äú¬øSer√° que esta vez s√≠?‚Äù, this is your moment. The Troller Cat whitelist is open, and let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs pure fuego. The Real Power of Getting in Early Whitelist Imagine it‚Äôs 2010. Bitcoin is under a buck, and you got invited to buy some by a techie friend. You passed. ‚ÄúToo weird,‚Äù you said. Fast forward, and that same friend‚Äôs buying property in Punta del Este or sipping Malbec in Mendoza on a Tuesday. You? Still saying, ‚ÄúNext time.‚Äù Well, guess what. Troller Cat is your ‚Äúnext time.‚Äù Getting on the whitelist of a meme coin like Troller Cat isn‚Äôt just some exclusive club‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic move. Being early gives you access to the token at the lowest price possible. When the presale opens to the public, you‚Äôll already be chilling with bags full of $TCAT, while everyone else is scrambling to catch up. It‚Äôs like showing up to the party before the DJ starts but already knowing the whole setlist. And here‚Äôs the chisme on the street: rumor has it that early holders might get access to exclusive features in the upcoming TrollerCat ecosystem. There‚Äôs talk of a Game Center with play-to-earn vibes, and a deflationary burn system that could make this cat rarer than a good avocado in Bolivia during off-season. Every time players interact with the platform, the supply goes down. People across Latin America have been quietly stacking up their favorite coins during presales. Why? Because they know the game. The big gains? They happen before everyone and their mam√° starts buying. And that‚Äôs the beauty of the whitelist‚Äîyou‚Äôre ahead of the curve, sipping your mate or caf√©, while the rest are just logging in. What Makes Troller Cat Different from Other Meme Coins? Let‚Äôs not pretend. The meme coin space is a circus. Some projects are cool, others‚Ä¶ puro humo. But Troller Cat? This kitty‚Äôs got claws and charisma. It ain‚Äôt just another copy-paste dog coin. Troller Cat is building a full-blown ecosystem where humor meets real use cases. That combo‚Äôs as rare as a good day in traffic on S√£o Paulo‚Äôs Marginal Tiet√™. First off, the branding is top-tier. Troller Cat‚Äôs visuals are cheeky, bold, and dripping with meme culture that hits different. It‚Äôs the kinda character that Gen Z and Millennial investors adore‚Äîfun, rebellious, a little loco, but somehow always on point. It‚Äôs like if Bad Bunny and El Chapul√≠n Colorado teamed up and dropped a coin. Then there‚Äôs the rumor mill. Staking rewards? Yep, people are whispering that early adopters might be in for some juicy APYs. Nothing confirmed yet, but if you‚Äôre on the whitelist, you‚Äôll likely be first in line to benefit. That‚Äôs the kind of alpha you don‚Äôt wanna miss. And this one‚Äôs big: Troller Cat might have a built-in Game Center, letting users earn while they play. That means utility, baby. And it‚Äôs deflationary, too. With each game transaction, some $TCAT gets burned. So while people play, your stack could become more valuable. Imagine playing your way to financial freedom. En serio, that‚Äôs some next-level innovation. We‚Äôve seen communities like Doge and Pepe explode because they were fun and united. But Troller Cat? It‚Äôs leveling up that idea. It‚Äôs got hype, it‚Äôs got memes, and it might just be the most clever cat in the crypto jungle. Latin American Crypto Fans, This One‚Äôs Tailor-Made for You Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîLatin America is low-key one of the most crypto-savvy regions in the world. With unstable currencies, wild inflation, and governments that sometimes dance bachata with corruption, folks here get it. Crypto isn‚Äôt just a flex‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline. A new kind of financial freedom. And meme coins? They‚Äôre like digital underdogs, just like many of us. Troller Cat is speaking your language‚Äîliterally and figuratively. The marketing is spicy, the humor is global, and the vibe is muy picante. Whether you‚Äôre in Buenos Aires, La Paz, Guadalajara, or Santiago, this coin has the kind of edge that resonates with Latin culture. It‚Äôs fun but fierce. It‚Äôs playful but packed with potential. Let‚Äôs not forget community. Latin Americans build fuerte communities around causes they believe in. Crypto is no different. When you jump into the Troller Cat whitelist, you‚Äôre not just buying a coin‚Äîyou‚Äôre joining a tribe. One that values memes, money, and messing with the system. Plus, let‚Äôs be honest. The global North has had the first-mover advantage long enough. It‚Äôs our time to catch the wave early and ride it to el cielo. You‚Äôve seen how fast tokens fly once they hit public listings. Imagine the gains if you got in before that madness even starts. You could be sipping micheladas while your $TCAT stack multiplies. The Whitelist is Heating Up‚ÄîWhat Are You Waiting For? There‚Äôs a saying around here: ‚ÄúEl que no arriesga, no gana.‚Äù If you‚Äôre waiting for the stars to align before getting into crypto, newsflash‚Äîthey already did. Trollercat is gearing up for one of the hottest presales of the year. And the whitelist? It‚Äôs your backstage pass. This isn‚Äôt one of those slow-burn launches. People are already lining up, whispering in Discords and Telegrams, trying to get early access. Don‚Äôt get left out, compadre. Once the public sale drops, prices could pump hard. But the real winners? They‚Äôll be the early cats‚Äîthe ones who believed in the whiskers before the rest saw the claws. Whitelist access gives you primo pricing. You can get your paws on $TCAT before the rest of the world even sees the light. That‚Äôs leverage, pap√°. And if the rumors about staking rewards and play-to-earn burn mechanics are true, you‚Äôll be sitting on a gem while others are still trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on. So stop scrolling, start moving. Head to the official Trollercat site and jump into the whitelist while there‚Äôs still room. We don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll be open. One thing‚Äôs for sure: once this cat jumps, it‚Äôs not coming back down easy. Conclusion Crypto doesn‚Äôt wait for anyone ‚Äî and neither does Troller Cat ($TCAT). We‚Äôve seen this movie before: early adopters stack up during a whitelist, coins go live, prices pump, and latecomers cry into their empanadas. Don‚Äôt let that be you this time. This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. It‚Äôs a cultural movement, a digital rebellion with claws. From rumored staking rewards to a play-to-earn Game Center and a deflationary twist, $TCAT is setting itself up as the meme coin to watch in 2025. This is your redo, bro. Your fresh start.

Posting to X, Farina stated that purchasing $1,000 worth of XRP at its current price of around $2 is equivalent to holding over $50,000, as he expects the asset‚Äôs price to reach $100.

This potential 50x return shows the asset‚Äôs potential and the confidence experts like Farina have in this investment. His message aligns with his past support for the digital asset. Another crypto expert recently described XRP‚Äôs utility as a safe haven for investors, and its use in cross-border payments, tokenization, and institutional finance could help drive adoption and price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions Farina‚Äôs statement drew strong reactions from the XRP community, ranging from enthusiastic agreement to cautious skepticism. One user expressed long-term optimism, saying he would revisit the post when others ask how early investors succeeded. Another commenter supported the idea of holding XRP, mentioning that he was glad to have accumulated the token at $0.50. However, not all responses were optimistic. Some questioned the feasibility of XRP reaching $100 within the next few years. One person remarked that XRP may not hit $10 in the next five years. A lot of skeptics cite concerns about growth pace and external challenges like regulation, but prominent supporters have debunked these claims. Is XRP On the Brink of a Price Surge? Farina previously showed through historical data that XRP always moves fast and aggressively . The asset‚Äôs rapid ascent from $0.5 to $3.39 between November 2024 and early January 2025 supports this belief, and I could experience much quicker growth as the market recovers from the recent downturn. Additionally, the recent dismissal of the SEC‚Äôs appeal against Ripple has removed all regulatory hurdles surrounding XRP. Ripple can freely innovate and offer industry-changing products without the fear of an attack from regulators. While skeptics may debate the timing or possibility of such high valuations, Farina‚Äôs confidence highlights the enduring belief among many investors that XRP is far from reaching its full potential.

The draft bill has been released for public consultation, which will be open until May 5, 2025. This will make Slovenia one of the first European nations to adopt the regulations. Finance Ministry Sets Clearer Rules on Crypto Asset Gains According to reports, the Ministry of Finance in Ljubljana presented the draft on Thursday through its Directorate for the Tax, Customs and Other Public Revenue System. As detailed , the proposal focuses on taxing profits from the sale or use of digital assets. This includes cases where crypto is converted into fiat currency, used to buy goods or services, or transferred to another person. Under the new rule, these are all treated as disposals. It is worth noting that the draft excludes crypto-to-crypto exchanges or transfers between wallets belonging to the same holder. This is seen as an attempt to reduce the reporting burden for users who do not convert their holdings into money or spend it. The proposed law intends to align Slovenia with international tax practices while keeping the paperwork manageable for taxpayers. It was reported that the ministry fixed the tax rate at 25%. Additionally, profits will be calculated by subtracting the crypto‚Äôs acquisition value from its value at the time of disposal. It is important to add that taxpayers must maintain accurate records of their acquisitions and sales. Authorities may ask to see these records at any time. Simplified Option for Taxpayers Included in Draft The proposal also includes a simplified approach. This method allows taxpayers to calculate their tax based on 40% of the total value of their crypto assets as of December 31, 2025. It also considers all disposals from the past five years and helps those without full records avoid calculating profits on each transaction. In related news, Ukraine‚Äôs financial watchdog has proposed taxing certain crypto transactions as personal income , with rates up to 23%. The watchdog aims to align with global standards while meeting local financial needs. Derivatives Also Face the Same Crypto Tax Rate Alongside crypto, the Ministry has included derivative financial instruments in the proposal. These would be taxed at the same 25%, no matter how long the asset was held before being sold. This change supports Slovenia‚Äôs Capital Market Development Strategy for 2023 to 2030, pushing for a more uniform tax system. Meanwhile, a Nigerian court has delayed Binance‚Äôs next hearing in the $2 billion tax evasion case until April 30 , allowing time for the tax authority to respond to a legal objection raised by Binance.

The Chainlink (LINK) price decline made headlines earlier this year, and now it‚Äôs showing signs of life with a 6% rebound. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) update is gaining traction as Soroban smart contracts officially go live, creating new opportunities for developers on the network. Both events have traders watching closely‚Äîbut not everyone is sticking with legacy names. That‚Äôs where Web3 ai is starting to stand out. Built as an all-in-one AI-powered research tool, it takes the guesswork out of finding the next high ROI crypto. Instead of spending hours sifting through documents and forums, users get a full breakdown of project potential‚Äîfrom tokenomics and team credibility to risk factors and vesting schedules. For traders looking to get ahead without drowning in data, it‚Äôs proving to be a real edge. Web3 ai: AI-Driven Research That Cuts Through the Noise If you‚Äôve ever spent an afternoon buried in whitepapers and Telegram links just to figure out whether a presale is worth your time, you already know the pain. Web3 ai‚Äôs ICO & Token Sale Advisor solves that. It uses AI to instantly analyze early-stage crypto projects across multiple chains and categories, including launchpad IDOs, meme coins, and real utility tokens. The tool doesn‚Äôt just score projects‚Äîit explains the reasoning behind its ratings. Want to know if the team is doxxed? How the tokenomics play out long term? Whether there‚Äôs a risky vesting cliff? It‚Äôs all there‚Äîsummarized, contextualized, and easy to understand. That makes Web3 ai a must-have for anyone seriously hunting the next high ROI crypto project. And while the tech is impressive, the economics are just as compelling. The $WAI token powers everything on the platform, from premium access to governance. Users who stake $WAI don‚Äôt just hold it‚Äîthey earn a portion of actual revenue from platform usage. It‚Äôs not just a utility token; it‚Äôs a piece of an AI SaaS ecosystem built to scale. The token is currently in presale across 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267, with a confirmed listing at $0.005242. That‚Äôs a potential 1747% ROI baked into the model for early supporters. In a space full of hype and empty promises, Web3 ai is aiming to deliver both product and value. Chainlink (LINK) Price Decline Shows Signs of Recovery Earlier in 2025, Chainlink (LINK) faced a tough stretch. Prices slid, sentiment wavered, and many questioned what was next. But March marked a turning point. Chainlink launched its Payment Abstraction system on mainnet, enabling users to pay for services like CCIP and automation using assets such as ETH, which then get auto-converted to LINK. Aave was among the first to jump on board, using Chainlink‚Äôs Smart Value Recapture system to improve liquidations. Since then, LINK‚Äôs chart has started to show a slow but steady comeback. It‚Äôs now printing higher lows, and some analysts are watching for a possible bullish reversal. With more focus on fundamentals‚Äîlike MEV protection and cross-chain utility‚ÄîChainlink is positioning itself for a broader 2025 narrative. The question isn‚Äôt whether the price will climb overnight‚Äîit‚Äôs whether the groundwork being laid today can drive sustainable traction later this year. Stellar (XLM) Update: Smart Contracts Bring Fresh Momentum Stellar‚Äôs big move in 2025 came with Protocol 20, which officially brought Soroban smart contracts to mainnet. It‚Äôs a major upgrade for the network, transforming Stellar from a simple payment-focused chain into one that now supports a full range of decentralized applications. The market responded quickly. In mid-March, XLM jumped more than 11% in a single day, outperforming major tokens on the CoinDesk 20 Index. This isn‚Äôt just about price‚Äîit‚Äôs about what‚Äôs now possible. Developers finally have a framework to build dApps on Stellar, and the ecosystem is responding with renewed energy. Tools, SDKs, and documentation are rolling out alongside the protocol update, suggesting Stellar isn‚Äôt just making announcements‚Äîit‚Äôs delivering infrastructure. If adoption follows, this could be the start of a long-term evolution for the chain. Final Take: Big Updates Are Good‚ÄîSmart Tools Are Better Yes, the Chainlink (LINK) price decline was concerning, but the recovery signals show there‚Äôs still life in the project. The Stellar (XLM) update is more than just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs a step toward real developer traction.

Among the most exciting coins making waves in 2025 are Qubetics , Gala, and Hedera. With each of these digital assets carving their own path in the blockchain ecosystem, it‚Äôs clear that the next bull run crypto will be shaped by their unique features and innovative approaches. For anyone who‚Äôs been keeping an eye on the crypto space, the rise of Qubetics in particular is hard to ignore. Not only is it in the midst of a presale that has already raised more than $16 million, but it‚Äôs offering something groundbreaking with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. Meanwhile, Gala has proven itself as a prominent player in the gaming sector, while Hedera continues to push the boundaries of scalability and speed. But with so many options out there, how do Qubetics, Gala, and Hedera stack up against each other in the race for dominance during the next bull run crypto? This article will break down what makes each of these coins stand out and why they‚Äôre on the radar for 2025. Qubetics: Redefining Digital Finance with a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet When thinking about the future of blockchain and digital finance, Qubetics ($TICS) is one project that stands at the forefront. Currently in its 30th stage of presale, Qubetics has already sold over 508 million tokens to 24,900+ holders, raising an impressive $16.2 million. At $0.1729 per token in this stage, the Qubetics crypto presale has garnered significant interest, and the numbers continue to climb. So, what makes Qubetics such a standout in the crowded crypto market? Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet is a game-changer. Unlike traditional wallets that require users to trust a third-party service to hold their assets, Qubetics provides a decentralized solution that puts control back into the hands of the users. For businesses, professionals, and individual users alike, this wallet offers enhanced security, privacy, and flexibility. It supports multiple chains, allowing users to manage various assets seamlessly within one interface. But that‚Äôs not all‚ÄîQubetics has identified key issues in the current blockchain landscape and is solving them head-on. Traditional digital finance systems often suffer from slow transactions, high fees, and lack of interoperability. Qubetics, however, is designed to address these challenges by utilizing a multi-chain approach and offering lightning-fast transactions without the burden of high fees. Looking ahead to the next bull run crypto, analysts predict a massive surge in Qubetics‚Äô price, with estimates suggesting that $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $15 post-mainnet launch, resulting in an ROI of up to 8567%. That‚Äôs not just speculation‚Äîthis project has a clear roadmap, and it‚Äôs gaining traction rapidly. Key Stats for Qubetics: Presale Stage: 30th Tokens Sold: 508 million Total Raised: $16.2 million Current Price: $0.1729 per token Predicted ROI: Up to 8567% after mainnet launch Gala: Revolutionizing the Gaming World with Blockchain If you‚Äôve been into crypto for a while, then Gala is no stranger to you. The project is positioning itself as the key player in the blockchain gaming world. Gala‚Äôs ecosystem is designed to empower game developers and players by integrating blockchain into gaming experiences. From decentralized game ownership to in-game economies powered by crypto, Gala is laying the foundation for the next generation of gaming. One of Gala‚Äôs key innovations is its focus on user control. In traditional gaming, players have no real ownership over their in-game assets. You buy skins, weapons, and characters, but you don‚Äôt truly own them. With Gala, everything is on the blockchain, meaning that players can buy, sell, or trade in-game assets securely and transparently. As the next bull run crypto, Gala is also expanding its reach through partnerships with popular game developers, offering an ever-growing portfolio of games. With its Gala Games ecosystem, Gala is combining NFTs, gaming, and DeFi in a unique way, creating an environment where players, developers, and even spectators can participate in an entirely new digital economy. In 2025, Gala‚Äôs price action will likely be influenced by its ability to onboard new users and game developers. The ongoing integration of blockchain into gaming experiences presents a huge opportunity for Gala, and as more players start engaging with its ecosystem, the demand for $GALA tokens could soar. Hedera: The Fast, Secure, and Scalable Blockchain for Enterprises When it comes to scalability, few blockchain platforms can match Hedera. As one of the most advanced public distributed ledgers out there, Hedera is built to scale while maintaining speed and security. Hedera‚Äôs consensus service, powered by the Hashgraph algorithm, allows for thousands of transactions per second (TPS) without sacrificing decentralization. The Hedera network is perfect for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology for real-world applications. From supply chain management to secure digital identity solutions, Hedera has established itself as a leader in enterprise blockchain. Unlike other networks that suffer from bottlenecks as usage increases, Hedera‚Äôs unique architecture allows it to handle large-scale operations seamlessly. Moreover, Hedera‚Äôs governance model is what sets it apart. Rather than relying on a small group of miners or validators, Hedera‚Äôs governing council is made up of some of the world‚Äôs largest companies, ensuring the network‚Äôs credibility and stability. This makes Hedera a strong contender for adoption by mainstream businesses looking to integrate blockchain technology. In the context of the next bull run crypto, Hedera‚Äôs focus on enterprise adoption and scalability positions it for continued growth. With its robust infrastructure and strong governance, Hedera is set to remain a top player in the blockchain space. Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet: The Future of Digital Finance For anyone using crypto, the idea of managing multiple chains in one wallet might seem like a dream. But Qubetics is turning that dream into a reality. The Qubetics non-custodial multi-chain wallet enables seamless integration with multiple blockchain networks. Users don‚Äôt need to rely on third-party custodians; they‚Äôre in full control of their assets. For businesses and professionals, this wallet simplifies the management of multiple digital assets across various platforms, all from one secure location. Plus, it‚Äôs built with user-friendliness in mind, ensuring that even those new to crypto can navigate the wallet effortlessly. Conclusion The next bull run crypto is undoubtedly going to be exciting, with Qubetics, Gala, and Hedera leading the charge in 2025. Qubetics stands out for its innovative non-custodial multi-chain wallet, offering real-world solutions to blockchain‚Äôs most pressing issues. Gala is reshaping the gaming landscape with its blockchain integration, while Hedera is empowering enterprises with a fast, scalable network. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the potential for these three projects to redefine digital finance and blockchain technology is immense. The presale of $TICS is a great opportunity to get in early before the next bull run crypto takes full effect.

The figures demonstrate the alarming divergence between the two assets from April 2015 and April 2025. In particular, this striking ascent of Bitcoin has caught the eye of investors spread around the globe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Bitcoin Vs. Gold: From Equal Footing To Massive Gap Ten years ago, gold and Bitcoin were at similar prices. In April 2015, Bitcoin moved between $200 and $250, whereas gold was ranging around $1,200 to $1,300 per ounce. The fortunes of these investments have since become totally different. Bitcoin has soared to about $84,000 per coin, up some 33,500% in the ten-year period. The cryptocurrency briefly peaked at nearly $109,000 during the timeframe. If someone tries to tell you gold is better than Bitcoin‚Ä¶ Just show them this: In 2015, 1 BTC = 1 ounce of gold. Today? That same Bitcoin is up 13,693% in 10 years. Let the numbers speak. pic.twitter.com/8JipH5IsNr ‚Äî Ted (@TedPillows) April 17, 2025 Gold, on the other hand, has preserved its image of reliability over volatility, rather than offering spectacular gains. The precious metal increased by only 156% over the same period. From the market onlookers, gold‚Äôs worth proposition is still anchored on its consistent, inflation-proof behavior spanning very long timescales. Historical Context Demonstrates Divergent Patterns Of Growth Going back even farther shows an even greater disparity in the growth rates. According to a market analyst on social media platform X, the price of gold was only $20.67 per ounce in 1933. As for 2025, the price has gone up somewhat to around $3,330 an ounce, which is indeed a steep rise but a gradual increase over a period of almost a century. Ted's analysis on X. Bitcoin has had a completely different history. From a price of $1 in 2011, it came up to $84,000 by 2025. With such rapid appreciation rates, both excitement and skepticism have been brought forth by financial analysts debating the worthiness of such growths. Sheer Disparity In Size According to analyst Belle, a stark contrast in the behavior is due to the sheer difference in the size of their market. Gold has roughly a market capitalization of a little over $22 trillion. Due to this great size, gold provides an element of stability, rendering the market less sensitive to individual transactions or flows of short-term investments. GOLD added $1 trillion to its market cap in one day. That‚Äôs nearly the entire value of #Bitcoin right now. This shows how massive traditional markets are & how early we still are with Bitcoin. Even a small shift into $BTC could send it flying. pic.twitter.com/YsjSgOZKjx ‚Äî Belle (@Bitt_Belle) April 17, 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization is at approximately $1.667 trillion‚Äîlarge but still only a fraction of gold‚Äôs. This reduced size makes Bitcoin more sensitive to capital flows. Gold recently saw an impressive $1 trillion rise in market capitalization over one day, but this was a much smaller percentage move than the same dollar flow would trigger in Bitcoin‚Äôs value.

Base has onboarded 155 million addresses, bridged 1.9 million ETH (representing 1.6% of Ethereum's circulating supply), and currently secures nearly $10 billion in total value. Over the past six months, Base has averaged 93 transactions per second. Ethereum supports L2s through 'blobs,' a low-cost data storage mechanism introduced with EIP-4844. Industry analysis indicates that Ethereum's planned increases in blob capacity, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade to six blobs per block, may not be sufficient to meet rapid L2 transaction growth. Simulations suggest that a tenfold increase in L2 transactions could push average transaction fees to $0.64, unless blob capacity is expanded to at least 33 blobs per block to keep L2 transaction costs below $0.02.

Powell. ‚ÄúDonald Trump has hurt the credibility of the dollar with his aggressive moves on tariffs, for a long time,‚Äù Lombard told La Tribune Dimanche. ‚ÄúIf Powell is pushed out, this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.‚Äù He warned that higher borrowing costs would follow and a ‚Äúprofound disorganization of the country‚Äôs economy‚Äù would result, forcing Washington to seek talks ‚Äúsooner or later‚Äù to calm tensions. The remarks landed after Trump renewed a threat that has hovered for years: firing the Fed chair he appointed in 2018. On Thursday, speaking in the Oval Office, the president said, ‚ÄúIf I want him out, he‚Äôll be out of there real fast, believe me,‚Äù moments after posting online that ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs termination cannot come fast enough!‚Äù White House officials advise Trump not to fire Powell Investors watched a fresh spike in market nerves as the comments circulated. Inside the White House, advisers have told Trump that breaking with decades of central‚Äëbank independence could rattle already unstable financial markets , according to people familiar with the discussions. They also pointed to unanswered legal questions about whether a president can dismiss a Fed chief without cause. For now, those warnings have tempered action, the people said. Still, the debate is active. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that Trump was ‚Äústudying whether he could fire‚Äù Powell. The chair‚Äôs four‚Äëyear term ends in May 2026. Lombard‚Äôs intervention marked an unusually direct comment on U.S. domestic policy from a French minister. President Emmanuel Macron has clashed with Trump on Ukraine and trade, and has offered French research posts to American scientists whose funding was cut. Tariffs remain a second flash point. This month, the Trump administration imposed 10 percent duties on some European Union imports. Lombard said that level is ‚Äúa huge increase that isn‚Äôt sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade.‚Äù He added that Europe still wants a free‚Äëtrade zone with the United States and urged European chief executives to show ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù by working with their governments to protect the region‚Äôs interests. On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose LVMH group owns Mo√´t & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, and Hennessy, hinted that EU leaders were not pressing hard enough for a tariff accord. The tension around the Fed adds to a rough month on Wall Street, where investors have wrestled with the tariff wars and fears of slowing growth. Many see the central bank as a stabilizer. Undermining it, Lombard said, would shake confidence in the dollar itself. The immediate question is whether the president will act on his threats. As Trump put it, ‚ÄúIf I want him out,‚Äù he can move quickly. Whether markets would stay calm, Lombard suggested, is another matter entirely. Powell has not commented publicly on the latest threats as of yet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

It can handle thousands of transactions per second and is loved by developers and investors alike. But while Solana leads in performance, a new project is emerging that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to disrupt the crypto space, Ruvi AI (RUVI) . Ruvi AI is gaining recognition as the next big opportunity for investors with its presale success and unique blend of blockchain and AI. Early buyers of $RUVI during the presale will see massive returns and analysts are already predicting big price jumps after the token launches. Here‚Äôs why Ruvi AI is all the buzz and you don‚Äôt want to miss out. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Ecosystem: A Game-Changer for Users and Investors Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project. It‚Äôs an ecosystem around a superapp that democratizes artificial intelligence. The platform is designed to help marketers, content creators and entrepreneurs to use AI for tasks like generating professional text, creating visuals and producing multimedia. But what really sets Ruvi AI apart is its token utility that gives value to investors and users. Holders of the $RUVI token get: Premium AI Tools for streamlined workflows and better output. Passive Income through token staking. Governance Rights to have a say in the platform‚Äôs development. This trifecta of functionality makes Ruvi AI not just a tech platform but also an investment vehicle with tangible returns and utility. Early Presale Success Ruvi AI has caught the attention of investors worldwide, sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised $100,000 in the first few days of the presale . At the current price of $0.01 per token , this is the time to get in. But this offer is time limited. Once the current presale phase is over the token price will increase by 50% , so act fast to get ahead. Exclusive VIP Tier 3 Rewards Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP bonus structure adds another layer of excitement to the presale by rewarding investors based on their contribution. For example, consider the benefits of being in VIP Tier 3. An investment of $1,000 in the pre-sale causes the automatic distribution of $100,000 in RUVI tokens to the investor. Since the token is sold at a price of $0.01 per piece, 100000 token pieces are the result of it and the investor is bumped up to VIP Tier 3. The investor stands to get a bonus of 60% from the group and the total is then 160,000 tokens. Now consider Ruvi AI‚Äôs projected listing price of $0.07 per token . The $1,000 investment becomes $11,200 , a whopping 1,020% ROI . These rewards show Ruvi AI‚Äôs commitment to giving high value to its early backers. What are Ruvi‚Äôs Leaderboard Rewards? To complement the VIP structure, Ruvi AI has introduced a leaderboard rewards program that incentivizes top contributors during the presale. This program gives out token bonuses based on ranking: Top 10 investors get 500,000 additional tokens , worth $35,000 post-launch. Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens , valued at $17,500 . Even the Top 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens , a $1,400 value at the listing price. These leaderboard rewards stack on top of the VIP tier benefits, making the returns even more juicy for dedicated investors. Analysts Predict Big Returns Post-Launch Analysts are very bullish on Ruvi AI‚Äôs post-launch performance. And they have good reason to be: that utility and the momentum Ruvi‚Äôs seen so far in presales are a powerful combination. Many think the $RUVI token could hit‚Äîand stay above‚Äî$0.5 within months of its launch. What does that mean for early investors? If you buy in during the presale at $0.01, here‚Äôs what you can expect to see: For every dollar you invest, your returns would multiply tenfold to $0.50 per token. That‚Äôs a pretty enticing prospect. A VIP Tier 3 investor with 160,000 tokens would see their portfolio grow to $80,000‚Äîa massive 8000% return on investment. That kind of potential makes Ruvi AI one of the most exciting investment opportunities out there right now. Why Solana Investors Should Pay Attention Solana has shown that blockchain can be fast and scalable. But Ruvi AI is different. By combining advanced AI with blockchain‚Äôs transparency and security, Ruvi AI opens up new possibilities. Its ecosystem solves real-world problems in content creation, marketing and more while giving early participants big financial gains. Ruvi AI‚Äôs purpose is clear, its utility is unmatched and its design is innovative. It‚Äôs a must-have in any crypto portfolio. With real use cases and high growth potential, this is a competitor to established tokens like Solana. Conclusion Cryptocurrency markets reward those who position themselves early for the next big thing. With Ruvi AI, the opportunity is clear, from its ecosystem to its presale to post-launch projections. As the presale ends and the $RUVI price is about to rise, there‚Äôs no better time to get in. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor who knows Solana or new to crypto, Ruvi AI is a chance to be part of a game-changing solution that combines blockchain and AI.

Threshold Network powers tBTC, a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that can be used throughout DeFi ecosystems. The project‚Äôs native token, T , is trading at $0.0223 at time of writing, up from $0.0143 one week ago. The 236th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up nearly 48% in the past 24 hours alone. T‚Äôs price surge largely materialized after Threshold Network announced on Thursday that it planned to restructure its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to reduce annual operational costs by approximately $1.1 million. Explains the project, ‚ÄúAdded to the more than $8.5 million in annual savings expected from the elimination of tBTC staking rewards, this sets the stage for significant profitability moving forward. Cost efficiency also allows the DAO to eliminate treasury sales of T tokens, enabling it to strategically reinvest in T token. The DAO treasury will continue to accrue tBTC via bridge fees and T tokens via buybacks as per¬†TIP-54. Threshold has already completed its first purchase of ~30 million T tokens for 5.8 tBTC‚Ä¶ Given the tight economic linkage between T and tBTC, this shift is expected to create a virtuous cycle of growth, where increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and bridge velocity drive T‚Äôs value, attracting further participation and reinforcing the ecosystem‚Äôs expansion.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH), though still a juggernaut, is contending with high gas costs and congestion issues. Optimism (OP) and I njective (INJ) offer their own innovation layers, but neither has yet ignited the type of widespread traction seen in past cycles.

It isn‚Äôt trending on every platform yet‚Äîbut its name is showing up in more investor watchlists and analyst previews than ever before. What‚Äôs driving the movement? Steady user acquisition, consistent expansion in exposure, and technical setups that point to a potential launch beyond expectations. Current modeling from several high-profile trackers has placed a 33x return forecast on the altcoin, citing comparative entry points and trend velocity similar to major 2021 runs. It‚Äôs this kind of momentum shift that‚Äôs pulling in early buyers‚Äîespecially those who missed key windows with tokens like SOL, INJ, or OP.

Solana (SOL) brings high performance and strong branding, yet some argue much of its 2025 potential has already been priced in. Optimism (OP) holds technical value in scaling layers, but adoption hasn‚Äôt caught fire outside niche ecosystems. Injective (INJ), while technically promising, remains in a holding pattern after early volatility. That‚Äôs why MAGACOINFINANCE is being discussed in different circles‚Äînot as the next SOL or XRP, but as something with its own trajectory.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a viral Ethereum-based token, now catching the eye of investors chasing Solana-like upside. With a newly launched leaderboard dashboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, the project has ignited a surge of interest from both whales and everyday traders. The project has raised more than $6.9 million and obtained over 8400 holder accounts. The fourth phase of MUTM offers tokens at $0.025 but the project launch price will begin at $0.06 which provides investors with a valuable 140% return on investment. Mutuum Finance could hit $4 sooner after the launch. MUTM is quickly becoming a serious performer as SOL fights to defend its place among the crypto elite. Surging Interest in the MUTM Presale During phase 4 of the MUTM presale investors have rapidly increased their contributions through 8400 accounts resulting in $6.9 million token deposits throughout the first several purchase days. Investors with hardware wallets can obtain MUTM tokens during pre-sale but they receive the following advantages: they get an opportunity to purchase tokens at $0.06 setting their future value potential. Mutuum Finance tokens will reach prices expected to surpass $4 after their listing date because exchange agreements will improve their value following launch. Mutuum Finance is in the process of a smart contract audit by CertiK, an essential measure to strengthen security and trust. The official report will be published on their social media once the audit is complete. Expanding the Mutuum Finance Ecosystem Mutuum Finance achieves its innovative expansion and sustainable growth objectives through its secure and scalable design which supports expansion potentials and architectural components. Predictive smart contracts optimize the lending mechanisms of the platform that connects various networks because of its platform-independent features. Stakeholders receive periodic rewards which generate passive income throughout their whole investment period. USD stablecoin provides stability to users through system-supported platform assets which establish a new economic direction. Mutuum Finance oriented itself as a top DeFi investment platform by deepening its liquidity operations while building its market positioning prior to its market listing. Exclusive Perks for Early Investors Mutuum Finance conducts an early adopter celebration giveaway that distributes $100,000 MUTM tokens while providing $10,000 MUTM tokens to each participant from the ten members who join. The platform gives users benefits from its referral network because new members earn greater rewards advantages through it. Mutuum Finance delivers foremost decentralized lending solutions through their dual-lending model that includes adjustable capabilities along with optimal operational results. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) platform strengthens both lender and borrower interactions by providing better rates of capital accessibility together with automatic management systems for interest rates. Each user within the Peer-to-Peer model independently establishes their personal loan agreements using the direct operating system provided by the model. Mutuum Finance establishes its place as the top DeFi lending service by implementing its dual-lending system for the market. Solana (SOL) remains a strong performer in 2025, but rising competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hard to ignore. The project has raised $6.9 million from over 8,400 investors, with current Phase 4 pricing at $0.025 and a launch price set at $0.06, offering early buyers up to 140% gains. A $100,000 giveaway, Top 50 Holder rewards, and a CertiK audit boost its credibility. Analysts see MUTM hitting $4 post-launch, making it a serious threat to legacy tokens.

Over the past week, the crypto market leader moved only between $84,000 to $86,000, forming a tight range-bound market. However, amidst these struggles, Martinez states that Bitcoin short-term holders realized the price lies at $91,275, indicating the pivotal resistance to the recent market resurgence lies ahead. For context, the short-term holders‚Äô realized price is the average price at which new buyers (i.e, new investors of Bitcoin over the past 155 days) acquired their BTC. It is an important technical indicator used to evaluate short-term market sentiment and behavior. When a market price is above the STH realized price, it indicates a bullish momentum as recent buyers are in profit and are likely to hold. In this case, the STH realized price serves as a strong support level, with new market entrants often defending their entry zone. However, when Bitcoin‚Äôs price is below the STH realized price as currently seen in the market, the realized price forms a significant psychological price resistance. This is because many short-term holders may choose to exit once the market breaks even, increasing the selling pressure around that zone. Therefore, Bitcoin reclaiming $91,275 is essential to validate a sufficient bullish potential to fuel a complete price reversal.

Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency is down by 1.34% on its monthly chart as bearish pressure continues to wane. While a major market resistance lies at $91,000, Bitcoin faces an immediate opposition at the $86,000 price zone, breaking past which could spur a sharp price rise to $91,000. However, a price fall below the support at $84,500 could result in a further price slide to $84,000 with the potential to trade as low as $83,300.

Kiyosaki said he expects Bitcoin, gold, and silver to soar as the dollar loses strength because of inflation and the growing‚ÄÇtotal of government and debt. ‚ÄúI firmly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will exceed over $1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,‚Äù he wrote . Kiyosaki is famous for recommending hard asset investing, specifically gold and silver. In recent years, he has included BTC on that list, dubbing it ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù and a primary tool for preserving wealth. Kiyosaki says the American economy is heading for dangerous territory. As it stands, rising credit card debt, growing national debt, increased unemployment, and weakened retirement savings are a few red flags he points to. He thinks that the U.S. may be nearing what he calls a ‚Äúgreater depression.‚Äù In his post, he stated that in 2025, credit card debt had reached all-time highs, U.S. debt was at record levels, unemployment was rising, 401(k) plans were losing value, and pensions were being stolen. For him, the answer is not to place trust in traditional financial systems. Instead, he advises building wealth using assets governments can‚Äôt dilute or tinker with ‚Äî like Bitcoin. Experts predict Bitcoin will hit $1 million Kiyosaki isn‚Äôt the only one who believes that BTC will spike in the near future. Many famous investors and financial leaders have made statements with similar predictions of Bitcoin in the millions over the next 10 years. In May last year, Twitter co-founder millionaire Jack Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin would reach a million dollars by 2030. He said decentralized finance was the future and that Bitcoin would prosper with increasing mistrust in central banks. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raised her forecast in February 2025, arguing that Bitcoin could surpass $1.5 million by 2030. She said her expansion outlook is driven by demand growth, particularly from institutions and nations looking at crypto for use as a financial reserve. Eric Trump spoke at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi in December 2024. He said that its fixed supply and growing global interest make Bitcoin a powerful hedge against inflation ‚Äî and its value could soar to $1 million per coin. Others argue the price of BTC could be heavily affected by the actions of the U.S. government. If the U.S. started buying Bitcoin as part of a national reserve strategy, Blockstream CEO Adam Back hinted, prices could go to the moon. In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order that permits federal agencies to seize unused or confiscated crypto and to allow these assets to be converted into a strategic Bitcoin fund. The step was intended to bolster the country‚Äôs standing in a shifting global economy. Investors view Bitcoin as a shield against inflation Kiyosaki‚Äôs prediction is based, at its core, on his belief that inflation will keep eating away at the value of fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. He and others believe that Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized architecture, serves as a hedge against that risk. With increasing distrust in financial institutions globally, Bitcoin appeals to an increasingly broader range of investors ‚Äî retail and institutional. While critics identify potential volatility and regulatory obstructions, the general sentiment from many financial corporations is quite straightforward: Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term future looks bright. Whatever the outcome of this increasingly popular price target, several analysts hold that Bitcoin is transforming the global economy and will continue to do so in the years ahead.

The new tokens represented 4% of the project‚Äôs one billion token limit but boosted the circulating supply by 20%, from 200 million to 240 million. Traders had expected selling pressure; instead, the market price climbed from about $7.54 before the unlock to roughly $8.30, leaving the meme coin up 8.5 percent on the day and well above holiday‚Äëweekend lows. Data posted by CoinMarketCap shows that only $1.3 million volume can still nudge the price 2 percent on the largest exchanges, a sign of thin Easter weekend liquidity that can increase volatility. Token unlock events normally put a lot of pressure on digital coins because early holders can sell their bags. Thursday‚Äôs allocation belonged to the project‚Äôs creators and to CIC Digital LLC, the corporate entity that manages Trump‚Äôs licensing deals, the memecoin‚Äôs website states. Online forums buzzed with rumors that Trump is planning a gathering for major token holders. However, no details or confirmation have surfaced. The coin‚Äôs purpose is still unclear Beyond bets on the price action and movements, the coin‚Äôs purpose remains unclear. The project‚Äôs website says the tokens are ‚Äúan expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ‚Äò$TRUMP‚Äô and the associated artwork,‚Äù and stresses they are ‚Äúnot intended to be ‚Ä¶ an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.‚Äù Blockchain data by Dune shows that 636,000 wallets hold TRUMP, but only 12,285 control more than $1,000 worth. Research firm K33 labeled the tokenomics ‚Äúpoor‚Äù in a January note when the coin briefly touched its record $71. Regulatory scrutiny has followed the hype. Three days before taking office, Trump promoted the Solana‚Äëbased token on social media. The watchdog group Public Citizen urged authorities to investigate the endorsement. Reuters reported in February that entities behind the coin collected nearly $100 million in trading fees within two weeks, citing estimates from three blockchain‚Äëanalysis companies. Government concern has also spilled into lawmaking. Last month, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, R‚ÄëArk., said the Trump family‚Äôs growing crypto activity is complicating congressional efforts to craft stable‚Äëasset rules. It includes links to the decentralized‚Äëfinance venture World Liberty Financial and its planned stablecoin. Trump is listed as manager, president, secretary, and treasurer of CIC Digital LLC, which has already licensed his likeness for several NFT collections.

Recent statistics indicate that these large holders, or ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù are acquiring around three times the amount of daily Bitcoin produced by miners as the cryptocurrency sits at key price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Whales Purchase At Record Levels While Exchanges Witness Outflows According to Glassnode information, investors possessing between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoins are buying up the cryptocurrency aggressively. These giant holders are at present taking on over 300% of the annual supply emission of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, large crypto exchanges are seeing steady outflows of Bitcoin. This indicates that increasing numbers of whales and large holders are taking their assets to long-term storage instead of leaving them on hand for trading. Market observers view this exodus from exchanges as a sign of improving confidence in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. Most of these large investors have persisted in buying when prices drop, viewing downturns as opportunities to increase their positions rather than sell. Onchain analysts have reported that this activity is reminiscent of trends during Bitcoin‚Äôs 2020 bull cycle. Technical Indicators Reflect Key Resistance Points Bitcoin is now testing its 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages as points of resistance. Based on previous examination by analysts, these levels are approximately $85,500. A pullback could occur if Bitcoin does not manage to breach the technical barriers. The next important support lies at about $80,000 on the upper trendline of the current wedge formation. A narrow price range has existed for some time, between about $75,000 and $85,000. This period of lackluster volatility, combined with substantial buying pressure, may well suggest that accumulation is occurring behind the scenes in anticipation of a large price move.

The price has seen a drop of nearly 30% since then. According to analysts, this drop follows the typical trend of previous bull markets. A decrease of 25-35% occurring midway through the cycle would usually denote a situation from which the prices would then continue up once again.
