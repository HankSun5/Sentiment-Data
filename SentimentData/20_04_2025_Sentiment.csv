Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Various attempts to pierce key levels have been unsuccessful, with prices going as low as $0.149 before recovering marginally. Market observers indicate that these short-term setbacks could be a prelude to monumental price swings in either direction. Possible 40% Fall Before The Huge Rally A fresh analysis published on TradingView by SwallowAcademy indicates Dogecoin might see a dramatic drop before any significant price increase. The analyst looked into DOGE‚Äôs price action compared to Tether (USDT) on daily charts, where the meme coin has been known to be extremely volatile. Their plots indicate a sudden spike in the beginning of 2024 followed by a decline from highs around $0.23, then another downslide to $0.09 mid-year before recovering above $0.45. SwallowAcademy thinks that the same trend may develop in 2025. However, their prediction is that Dogecoin may decline another 40% to around $0.09, creating a zone of support before, possibly, skyrocketing 400% to $0.45. The price stands at over $0.15 currently, and the analyst is holding out for the anticipated drop to $0.09. The ‚ÄòFalse Break‚Äô Pattern ‚Äì What It Means A standalone analysis by Trader Tardigrade indicates Dogecoin‚Äôs initial ‚Äúfalse break‚Äù since December 2024. The cryptocurrency has, in general, traced a downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, which are common bearish market indicators. After dropping to $0.13 on April 7, though, the price did bounce briefly before declining once more. Trader Tardigrade reads this as a ‚Äúfalse breakdown‚Äù ‚Äì potentially indicating the end of the downtrend. With prices remaining above the support line for a few days, this pattern may indicate an imminent bullish reversal. Based on their analysis, Dogecoin may aim for $0.42 if the reversal occurs. #Dogecoin Makes a False Break for the First Time Since Dec 2024 üî• It‚Äôs staying above the support line for days, confirming the characteristics of a false break.

According to the firm‚Äôs data, activity on the XRP Ledger has fallen by 80% since its peak in December, reaching unprecedented lows in recent months. This decline is not limited to on-chain data. A similar decline is also observed in the XRP futures market. There has been a decrease of approximately 70% in open interest, with these levels last seen in November 2023. In addition, funding rates are also in a downward trend and have turned negative at times. According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs assessment, XRP‚Äôs estimated leverage ratio is also on the decline. This ratio is calculated by dividing open positions by the XRP reserves on an exchange and reflects the average leverage usage of users. Related News: Senior Analyst Claims Bitcoin Price ‚ÄúCould Go Much Higher,‚Äù Predicts What Would Happen in This Scenario Despite all this negative data, the XRP price is only down about 35% from its December peak, a more limited decline compared to other major crypto assets like Ethereum, which has lost close to 60% of its value in the same period. Another noteworthy data is the continuous decline in exchange reserves on the XRP Ledger. Exchange reserves, which have fallen to levels last seen in July 2023, may indicate that investors prefer to withdraw their XRP from exchanges and store it for the long term. CryptoQuant claims that this data could be a potential recovery signal for XRP. The relative resilience of the price and the decline in exchange reserves could indicate positive investor sentiment for XRP, even if market conditions remain challenging. *This is not investment advice.

The Westlake, Texas-based firm is already capitalizing on strong engagement with digital assets and is poised to expand its offerings even further, Wurster explained on a recent conference call. According to a transcript, available on Seeking Alpha, the newly appointed CEO pointed to a broad range of available products‚Äîfrom crypto ETFs to Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures‚Äîand a rapidly growing interest from both clients and potential customers, adding: ‚ÄúWe saw a 400% increase in traffic to our crypto site recently‚Äî70% of whom were not clients.‚Äù That spike in traffic, Wurster noted, is a sign that Schwab‚Äôs reputation as a trusted financial brand is resonating with crypto-curious investors who may have previously been hesitant to jump in. ‚ÄúAs people in the industry are thinking about crypto, they‚Äôd love to work with a trusted brand‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre that firm.‚Äù You might also like: Chart of the week: Solana could end crypto market limbo with 10% rally, SOL eyes $150 target Spot crypto trading While Schwab currently enables access to crypto through ETFs, closed-end funds, and futures, Wurster revealed that the firm is actively planning to offer direct access to spot crypto trading.

Wurster framed the expansion as both a response to client demand and a strategic move to maintain the firm‚Äôs role as a top destination for retail and institutional crypto investors alike. As digital assets evolve from fringe fascination to mainstream financial tools, Schwab‚Äôs next chapter may look more Web3 than Wall Street. What‚Äôs the competition like? Several firms already offer spot crypto trading, giving users direct access to buy and sell actual cryptocurrencies. Leading crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Gemini dominate the space, offering robust platforms with a wide range of trading pairs and deep liquidity. These platforms are typically favored by both retail and institutional users for their user experience and advanced trading tools. Traditional finance players are also entering the arena. Fidelity, through its Fidelity Crypto platform, offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading, while Robinhood and eToro enable commission-free crypto trades alongside stocks and ETFs.

Referencing a chart from IntoTheBlock, Brett pointed out that the total value locked (TVL) in RWA platforms has now exceeded $10 billion. This chart shows a steady climb in TVL from under $5 billion in mid-2024 to over $10 billion by April 2025, marking more than 100% growth within a year. The upward momentum is important as it reflects expanding confidence and capital inflows into blockchain-based tokenization of traditional assets such as real estate, credit, and government bonds. BOOOOOOOOOOOOM üí•üí•üî• BULLISH: The total value locked in real-world asset ( #RWA ) protocols has surpassed $10 billion, continuing its growth trend. $XRP pic.twitter.com/tdah8kbuxq ‚Äî Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 18, 2025 Implications for XRP in the Tokenization Sector This development carries strong implications for digital assets like XRP, which have been building infrastructure to support tokenized assets. Ripple has made it clear that real-world asset tokenization is a core focus. The company recently partnered with RWA.xyz to allow seamless tracking of tokenized assets and RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and has made significant strides in the tokenization market. As the RWA sector draws in more capital, XRP is best positioned to support the coming wave of tokenized assets. Its infrastructure is already tailored to these needs and is a natural fit for institutions looking to move from pilot projects to real-world implementations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Positioned for Utility-Based Growth The XRPL is engineered for efficiency and interoperability, both vital traits in the tokenization landscape. As traditional financial firms explore blockchain solutions, those with proven scalability will stand out. The XRPL already hosts tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and other assets and has become a popular choice for institutions looking to launch RWAs on the blockchain. WhiteRock, a multi-million dollar tokenized securities platform, recently went live on the XRPL , bringing tokenized stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and other real-world assets into the digital finance ecosystem. The $10 billion milestone shows that tokenization is not a distant concept but is already underway. This rise in locked value across protocols signals that institutional demand is growing, and as Brett pointed out, the market is responding favorably. XRP, one of the few digital assets with existing enterprise solutions for real-world value transfer, could benefit significantly from this adoption curve. If the trend in RWA TVL continues, the digital asset‚Äôs relevance as a settlement asset and infrastructure layer will become even more pronounced. Brett‚Äôs post serves as a timely signal that the tokenization market is accelerating, and XRP is capitalizing on that growth.

The plan suggests cutting stakeholder rewards from 7% to 3.79%, prompting support and opposition across different stakeholders. Aptos Push for Innovation Faces Resistance from Validators According to reports, the main argument behind AIP-119 is to move user focus from passive staking to more active use of capital within the ecosystem. Many supporters believe the current 7% reward encourages holding tokens without driving innovation. According to their position, reducing this yield can free up capital to support activities such as restaking, MEV extraction, and deeper participation in DeFi protocols. Proponents also argue that high-stakes returns are similar to excessive interest rates in traditional finance. The proposal‚Äôs authors describe the 7% as a risk-free benchmark and stress their position by stating that it might be holding the system back from realistic growth. Some, like crypto user Moon Shiesty, believe the drop in staking demand will be balanced out by inflation control and new projects launching in the next half-year. He mentioned that funds saved from staking rewards could be used to support early Layer 1 stablecoins through incentives and lower gas fees. Meanwhile, Aptos recently shifted its focus toward strengthening its NFT and DeFi ecosystem . This aims to attract developers and projects looking for alternatives to Ethereum and Solana. Smaller Validators Fear Getting Priced Out It is worth noting that not everyone agrees. The report also disclosed that smaller validators say the proposal could hurt their ability to remain in the network. Running a validator node on Aptos costs between $15,000 and $35,000 annually. With rewards dropping, some fear they might not break even. The report details that more than 50 validators currently hold less than 3 million APT each. They represent just 9% of the total network but are important for maintaining decentralization. The proposal includes a delegation plan to support these operators by assigning extra tokens to help them stay afloat. Call for Balance in Governance Decisions It is important to add that notable Voices like Yui, COO of Slime Revolution, are urging caution. While speaking on the development, she warned that pushing out smaller players could affect the system‚Äôs health in the long run. Meanwhile, others argue that lowering emissions could lead to price growth, making up for the lower yield. The proposal remains under review, with the community watching closely. In related news, Aptos recently unveiled new upgrades for faster and more scalable blockchain solutions.

Tokyo faces a 24% levy on most exports to the United States, though that rate, like many of President Donald Trump‚Äôs duties, has been paused for 90 days. The temporary freeze is due to expire in early July, and economists warn that a snap‚Äëback could jolt trade in both directions. A 10% universal tariff still applies, and finished cars‚Äîone of Japan‚Äôs biggest money earners‚Äîcarry a separate 25% charge. Because the two countries follow different crash‚Äëtest systems, officials in Tokyo believe they can narrow the gap. Letting U.S. models meet American standards instead of Japan‚Äôs would be offered in exchange for lighter tariffs, unnamed sources told Nikkei . The tariff dispute has shaken markets and stirred fears of a deeper slowdown. Japan is trying to roll back what Trump calls ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù duties that he has imposed on dozens of trading partners. After one of the first round‚Äëtable sessions since the trade offensive began, Trump said Wednesday that the two sides had made ‚Äúbig progress.‚Äù Industry analysts say the wider fight over car tariffs could steer the future of electric vehicles in the United States. Tariffs may slow EV adoption in the US Many lower‚Äëpriced electric cars sold in America are imported. The 25% duty Trump placed on them is expected to raise sticker prices and curb demand. Higher costs and slower sales would squeeze profit margins and leave less money for research and development. ‚ÄúIf they are having to spend more money to either pay for tariffs or move production to the U.S., that‚Äôs significant capex for most of the companies,‚Äù said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funding not going to R&D, which means they‚Äôre not going to be able to innovate and not bring new technologies to market. That will make them less competitive in the global marketplace at a time they‚Äôre already getting shut out of China.‚Äù Affordability is already a hurdle Dealer data company Cox Automotive Inc. says the average transaction price of a new electric vehicle tops $55,000. Buyers also worry about driving range, public chargers, charging speed, grid stability, and a political debate over the cars‚Äô role in cutting emissions. Trump has ordered a review of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that helps consumers. Analysts warn that adding a 25% tariff to imported models‚Äîone tool automakers have used to keep prices down‚Äîcould lift costs by $4,000 to $20,000 per vehicle. Trump is acting under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, saying the country needs a strong manufacturing base and secure supply chain. He argues that the duties will bring jobs home, raise tax revenue, and help reduce the federal debt. The same 25% rate will hit imported auto parts starting May 3. Parts that meet the rules of the United States‚ÄëMexico‚ÄëCanada Agreement, which Trump signed in 2020, are exempt until the non‚ÄëU.S. share can be measured. There may be one bright spot for battery cars. The battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric vehicle. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers subsidies for battery plants in the United States, and billions of dollars are flowing into new factories. Officials say that, once a tracking system is in place, the auto tariffs will cover only the content made outside the country. A car assembled in Mexico but fitted with U.S.‚Äëmade batteries could avoid most of the duty. The administration has not said when that accounting will begin. For now, negotiators hope that a shift in Japan‚Äôs crash‚Äëtest rules will be enough to ease tensions and soften tariffs that have upended trade flows across the Pacific.

Charles Schwab CEO hints spot BTC trading may come in April 2026 Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster said the financial services company is looking at a potential April 2026 target to rollout spot Bitcoin trading to its clients. According to RIABiz , the CEO said that crypto was attracting traffic to the financial service company's crypto-focused website. 70% of that traffic was not Schwab clients and represented potentially new prospects, Wurster said. The Schwab CEO gave a timeline for the rollout: ‚ÄúOur expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto. Our goal is to do that in the next 12 months."" The move comes at a time when many traditional financial institutions are increasingly adopting crypto or offering digital asset products to their clients. Crypto, DeFi may widen wealth gap, destabilize finance: BIS report The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies may pose risks to the traditional financial system and exacerbate wealth inequality, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). In an April 15 report , the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi ) have ‚Äúreached a critical mass,‚Äù with investor protection becoming a ‚Äúsignificant concern for regulators.‚Äù The size of the crypto market signals that authorities should be worried about the ‚Äústability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy,‚Äù the report states, highlighting the role of stablecoins, which the BIS said have ‚Äúbecome the means through which participants transfer value within crypto.‚Äù BIS report on crypto and DeFi‚Äôs functions and financial stability implications.

In its most recent SEC filing dated April 15, the company revealed a paper loss of approximately $41.8 million for the first quarter of 2025. This loss stems from the sharp drop in BTC prices, which slid from $93,500 at the beginning of January to almost $82,000 by March 31. Semler Scientific Sees Steep Losses Despite the downturn , Semler remains heavily invested in the cryptocurrency and holds 3,182 BTC at quarter‚Äôs end. The firm, which ranks as the twelfth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, right above Boyaa Interactive International Limited, continues to double down on its digital asset strategy. CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian reiterated this stance when he affirmed the company‚Äôs dual focus on Bitcoin accumulation and ongoing healthcare innovation. Financially, Semler projected modest revenue between $8.8 million and $8.9 million for the quarter, but operating losses are expected to land between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. As of March 31, Semler reported having about $10 million in cash and cash equivalents. In yet another strategic move, the company also announced plans to issue up to $500 million in securities, the proceeds of which are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including continued cryptocurrency purchases. However, investor sentiment appears wary. The company‚Äôs stock, traded under the ticker SMLR on the Nasdaq, has declined by more than 22% since the start of the year. Agreement With DOJ Semler Scientific announced via a separate 8-K filing that it has reached an agreement-in-principle to resolve longstanding legal concerns with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The company said that it is prepared to pay around $30 million to address allegations that it violated the False Claims Act through improper marketing practices tied to devices billed to Medicare. The DOJ‚Äôs civil investigation dates back to 2017, when it issued a formal demand to examine potential fraud. While this proposed settlement would mark a major step toward resolution, Semler‚Äôs filing noted that a finalized agreement with the agency is not yet guaranteed.

Fast transactions and cross border payments are what XRP is known for and has been a pioneer in displaying the capabilities of blockchain. But as the crypto space matures, the spotlight is shifting to platforms that combine blockchain with other game changing technologies. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a project that will redefine innovation by merging artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. Ruvi AI is getting a lot of attention in the crypto space and for good reason. This forward thinking project has already sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised over $100,000 in just a few days of its presale. The excitement around Ruvi AI is not just about the ROI but also the utilities and the vision. What Sets Ruvi AI Apart? Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt launching another cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs launching an entire ecosystem that solves real world problems. At the heart of it is the Ruvi AI superapp, a feature rich platform that allows users to use AI for various tasks, from generating professional level content to creating visuals and multimedia. By holding the $RUVI token, users get access to this ecosystem and benefits including: Access to Premium AI Tools Whether you‚Äôre a marketer, content creator or entrepreneur, Ruvi AI‚Äôs superapp lets you streamline your workflow with AI generated text, images and even multimedia. Passive Income Opportunities Investors can stake their $RUVI tokens to earn rewards, effectively turn their holdings into a steady stream of income. Governance Rights Unlike traditional platforms, Ruvi AI gives token holders a voice in the decision making process of the ecosystem and features. This combination of utility, income and community driven governance makes $RUVI more than just a speculative asset. It‚Äôs a tool for innovation and growth. Limited Time Opportunity before 50% Price Increase The window to get in on Ruvi AI‚Äôs early growth is closing. During the current presale, $RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.01 each. Once this phase is over, the token price will increase by 50%, so now is the time to get in. For those looking to maximize returns, Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP bonus structure offers additional rewards. Through this system, investors can earn extra tokens based on the size of their presale contribution. VIP Tier 2 Example: Big Rewards for Small Investors To show how good the VIP system is, let‚Äôs say an investor puts in a small $500 during the presale. At the current price of $0.01 per token, that‚Äôs 50,000 $RUVI tokens, which qualifies the investor for VIP Tier 2. This tier gets a 40% bonus, which adds 20,000 tokens to their total allocation, making it 70,000 tokens. At the listed price of $0.07 per token, the original $500 investment becomes $4,900, a 880% ROI. That‚Äôs what Ruvi AI is offering to its early supporters. Leaderboard Rewards Add Extra Incentives If the VIP rewards weren‚Äôt enough, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program to recognize and reward its top investors. Throughout the presale , the biggest token holders are ranked and significant bonuses are given based on tiered rankings: Top 10 investors get an extra 500,000 $RUVI tokens (a $35,000 value at the listed price). Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens as a reward. Even broader groups, like the Top 1,000 get 20,000 tokens each. These bonuses stack on top of the VIP tier rewards, so serious investors get even more returns and a community driven environment. While XRP has established itself as a major player in the blockchain space, Ruvi AI is heading into uncharted territory. By combining blockchain with the power of artificial intelligence, this platform is solving real world problems and disrupting industries like digital media and content creation. Market analysts and crypto enthusiasts are raving about Ruvi AI‚Äôs utility, presale performance and vision. The $RUVI token is not just any other cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs an investment in the tools and technologies of the future. Next Steps for Ruvi AI The crypto world moves fast and those who get in early get the biggest returns. Ruvi AI has everything an investor could want in a blockchain project: innovative technology, tangible utilities and massive ROI potential. But time is running out. The first phase will be over soon and the price will increase by 50%. Now is the time to get in. Join the early adopters and get in on Ruvi AI.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging from the shadows with the kind of early metrics and innovation that once defined top-tier projects. Those involved in the altcoin presale are purchasing MUTM tokens at a price of $0.025, with the platform raising a total of $6.9 million so far. The presale has attracted over 8,400 participants, and many anticipate that the token price will rise to $0.03 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 140% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. If the projections hold, this token may not just catch up to SOL and XRP, it could fly right past them. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform collected more than $6.9 million and accumulated 8,400 members in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of the Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 USD value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. The first users who join gain complete access to unique staking keys together with voting rights along with premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. The Ethereum-based platform achieves price stability by letting users deposit USD funds and operate within it stablecoin system. This transaction system utilizes a resilient solution to eliminate stability problems that typically appear in financial operations. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its two-part crypto lending system that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models to bring users better asset availability with enhanced transparency. Smart contract pools in the P2C model enable stablecoin lending by users so platform users can obtain instant borrowing access with passive income opportunities. Automatic interest rate adjustments enabled through smart contracts provide value to lenders through higher returns and lower costs of borrowing to borrowers. Decentralized lending takes place on the P2P model so users can bypass traditional financial institutions during their transactions. The borrowers and lenders can both negotiate specific loan conditions through this system to create an easier and more personalized process. All parties benefit from platform transparency because it provides users full control over their transactions thereby establishing trust and grants them power in their lending and borrowing activities. While giants like Solana (SOL) and XRP remain strong contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as a serious challenger. With $6.9 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM‚Äôs innovative dual-lending model and growing presale momentum signal massive upside potential. Early investors at $0.025 could see up to 140% ROI by launch. Don‚Äôt miss your window and get in early.

After months of downward pressure, analysts are eyeing a possible breakout toward the long-awaited $1 target. $1 Dogecoin Price Target Closer Than Ever Crypto analyst Master Kenobi believes that the Dogecoin price could reach the highly coveted $1 target before the end of this market cycle. Based on his technical analysis, DOGE is once again mirroring a historical breakout pattern that previously led to an explosive surge in price. Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here‚Äôs What The Experts Say The analyst shared a Dogecoin price chart with two main sections highlighted. The first green box, between September to November 2024, shows a historical breakout that occurred after the meme coin broke above a critical descending trendline. Following this breakout, the price surged significantly over the next 55 days. Notably, the descending trendline has acted as a strong resistance for months. However, with Dogecoin‚Äôs momentum currently building, Master Kenobi believes that a strong breakout is imminent. Looking at DGOE‚Äôs price action, it appears the same conditions for its previous breakout are forming again. Master Kenobi‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that a breakout above the current descending resistance line could spark a similar rally, one that could potentially take Dogecoin from its current price of $0.158 to $0.9 or even $1. Such a move would represent a staggering gain of approximately 533%. Similar to past trends, Dogecoin‚Äôs current chart indicates a projected 55-day move following the breakout, with the green arrow and shaded box indicating a path to the conservative $0.9 target. This would place Dogecoin‚Äôs target window during the first few weeks of June, aligning closely with historical timelines from the last major breakout. Adding to the optimism, Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 43.35 ‚Äî a level typically considered a neutral to oversold zone. The current descending resistance line has already been tested multiple times, meaning a clean daily close above it could spark Dogecoin‚Äôs next major rally. Dogecoin RSI Shifts From Bearish To Bullish Dogecoin is showing promising signs of a bullish reversal after a key breakout of a technical pattern on the 4-hour chart. According to a recent chart analysis by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has exited a Falling Wedge formation and is preparing for an uptrend continuation. The breakout was confirmed as the RSI crossed above the 50 level, signaling a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Before the Falling Wedge breakout, Dogecoin had been trading in a downward channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. This pattern often precedes an upward price movement, and Dogecoin seems to be following through with this trend.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund is expected to cut its global growth outlook. ‚ÄúOur new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession,‚Äù Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday. She added, ‚ÄúWe will also see markups to the inflation forecasts for some countries. We will caution that protracted high uncertainty raises the risk of financial‚Äëmarket stress.‚Äù The IMF announcement , delivered blocks from the White House, opens a week packed with reports that will test the impact of tariffs on global trade. Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 gather in Washington at the same time. Georgieva urged them to seek ‚Äúa more resilient world economy, not a drift to division,‚Äù calling the talks ‚Äúa vital forum for dialogue at a vital time.‚Äù United States and Canada The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book on Wednesday will offer ground‚Äëlevel stories about how firms are coping with higher tariffs and redrawn supply lines. Earlier that day, officials are expected to show a small rise in March new‚Äëhome sales. Mortgage rates have hovered above 6.5 percent since October, so builders have been offering discounts and upgrades to coax buyers. Data on existing‚Äëhome resales follow on Thursday. In Canada, the election campaign enters its last week with Prime Minister Mark Carney‚Äôs Liberals about five points ahead, close to the majority line, even as U.S. trade tension weighs on factories in Ontario and Alberta. Asia‚ÄëPacific China will set its loan prime rates on Monday; economists see no change after stronger first‚Äëquarter growth. Indonesia will post March trade data showing conditions before the U.S. measures took effect, while the Philippines is likely to record another balance‚Äëof‚Äëpayments surplus for the month. On Tuesday, New Zealand will release March trade numbers, and Taiwan and Hong Kong will publish employment data. A day later, Bank Indonesia is expected to keep its key rate steady for a third meeting to support the rupiah, one of Asia‚Äôs worst‚Äëperforming currencies this year. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa Most European markets close on Monday for a holiday, and many central bankers will be in Washington. Euro‚Äëarea consumer‚Äëconfidence data will arrive on Tuesday, followed by the European Central Bank‚Äôs survey of professional forecasters. The ECB wage tracker due Wednesday points to slower pay gains after President Christine Lagarde cut rates last week. Germany‚Äôs Ifo survey of business confidence will arrive on Thursday, showing how companies view the tariff shock and the new coalition agreement. Similar sentiment gauges from France are due Friday. The Swiss National Bank will report its first‚Äëquarter earnings on Thursday, and President Martin Schlegel will address its annual meeting a day later. Latin America Argentina, fresh from a 20 billion‚Äëdollar financing deal with the IMF that brings 12 billion dollars up front, releases February economic‚Äëactivity data on Tuesday. Colombia will post February numbers after January‚Äôs growth surprised analysts and led some to raise 2025 forecasts. Paraguay‚Äôs central bank may lift its policy rate above the current 6 percent after inflation jumped 100 basis points in four months to 4.4 percent. Brazil‚Äôs mid‚Äëmonth inflation report for April is due Friday; if March is a guide, the headline rate could move further beyond the top of the central bank‚Äôs target. Mexico ends the week with February economic‚Äëactivity figures and a mid‚Äëmonth consumer‚Äëprice update. What to expect next? Georgieva says the IMF does not expect a global recession, yet the run of data will give the clearest picture so far of how quickly the tariff fight is filtering through spending, hiring, and prices. Investors and officials will scan every report for clues on whether the world economy can absorb the shock or whether deeper cracks are forming. Markets will react as numbers come into focus soon.

He explained that since then, law enforcement requests submitted through proper legal channels have enabled French courts to access the IP addresses of suspected criminals using Telegram. Durov noted that Telegram, currently the world's second most popular messaging platform, invests millions every year to ensure legal compliance in all jurisdictions. He also noted that the company begins preparing for legal changes long before they come into force. *This is not investment advice.

Back in 2021, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu blew up outta nowhere. They took over Twitter, Reddit, and even made it into conversations at your local panader√≠a. Folks laughed at them at first‚Äîuntil those same coins minted millionaires. That‚Äôs the thing about meme coins: they thrive on culture, community, and pure digital energy. Now here we are in 2025, and meme coins have become more than just speculative assets. They‚Äôre vibrant communities, sometimes even stronger than those around serious DeFi projects. Meme coins represent rebellion, humor, and the underdog spirit‚Äîya sabes, that ‚Äúwe got nothin‚Äô to lose‚Äù attitude. And while some came and vanished faster than a reggaet√≥n summer hit, others left footprints (or pawprints) that made the crypto world sit up and pay attention. Enter Troller Cat ($TCAT). This ain‚Äôt your average meme coin. This fluffy rebel is bringing a whole new game to the table. It‚Äôs got the humor, sure‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also got whispers of play-to-earn utility, potential deflationary mechanics, and early adopters foaming at the mouth with excitement. If you‚Äôve been on the sidelines, scratching your head and thinking, ‚Äú¬øSer√° que esta vez s√≠?‚Äù, this is your moment. The Troller Cat whitelist is open, and let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs pure fuego. The Real Power of Getting in Early Whitelist Imagine it‚Äôs 2010. Bitcoin is under a buck, and you got invited to buy some by a techie friend. You passed. ‚ÄúToo weird,‚Äù you said. Fast forward, and that same friend‚Äôs buying property in Punta del Este or sipping Malbec in Mendoza on a Tuesday. You? Still saying, ‚ÄúNext time.‚Äù Well, guess what. Troller Cat is your ‚Äúnext time.‚Äù Getting on the whitelist of a meme coin like Troller Cat isn‚Äôt just some exclusive club‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic move. Being early gives you access to the token at the lowest price possible. When the presale opens to the public, you‚Äôll already be chilling with bags full of $TCAT, while everyone else is scrambling to catch up. It‚Äôs like showing up to the party before the DJ starts but already knowing the whole setlist. And here‚Äôs the chisme on the street: rumor has it that early holders might get access to exclusive features in the upcoming TrollerCat ecosystem. There‚Äôs talk of a Game Center with play-to-earn vibes, and a deflationary burn system that could make this cat rarer than a good avocado in Bolivia during off-season. Every time players interact with the platform, the supply goes down. People across Latin America have been quietly stacking up their favorite coins during presales. Why? Because they know the game. The big gains? They happen before everyone and their mam√° starts buying. And that‚Äôs the beauty of the whitelist‚Äîyou‚Äôre ahead of the curve, sipping your mate or caf√©, while the rest are just logging in. What Makes Troller Cat Different from Other Meme Coins? Let‚Äôs not pretend. The meme coin space is a circus. Some projects are cool, others‚Ä¶ puro humo. But Troller Cat? This kitty‚Äôs got claws and charisma. It ain‚Äôt just another copy-paste dog coin. Troller Cat is building a full-blown ecosystem where humor meets real use cases. That combo‚Äôs as rare as a good day in traffic on S√£o Paulo‚Äôs Marginal Tiet√™. First off, the branding is top-tier. Troller Cat‚Äôs visuals are cheeky, bold, and dripping with meme culture that hits different. It‚Äôs the kinda character that Gen Z and Millennial investors adore‚Äîfun, rebellious, a little loco, but somehow always on point. It‚Äôs like if Bad Bunny and El Chapul√≠n Colorado teamed up and dropped a coin. Then there‚Äôs the rumor mill. Staking rewards? Yep, people are whispering that early adopters might be in for some juicy APYs. Nothing confirmed yet, but if you‚Äôre on the whitelist, you‚Äôll likely be first in line to benefit. That‚Äôs the kind of alpha you don‚Äôt wanna miss. And this one‚Äôs big: Troller Cat might have a built-in Game Center, letting users earn while they play. That means utility, baby. And it‚Äôs deflationary, too. With each game transaction, some $TCAT gets burned. So while people play, your stack could become more valuable. Imagine playing your way to financial freedom. En serio, that‚Äôs some next-level innovation. We‚Äôve seen communities like Doge and Pepe explode because they were fun and united. But Troller Cat? It‚Äôs leveling up that idea. It‚Äôs got hype, it‚Äôs got memes, and it might just be the most clever cat in the crypto jungle. Latin American Crypto Fans, This One‚Äôs Tailor-Made for You Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîLatin America is low-key one of the most crypto-savvy regions in the world. With unstable currencies, wild inflation, and governments that sometimes dance bachata with corruption, folks here get it. Crypto isn‚Äôt just a flex‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline. A new kind of financial freedom. And meme coins? They‚Äôre like digital underdogs, just like many of us. Troller Cat is speaking your language‚Äîliterally and figuratively. The marketing is spicy, the humor is global, and the vibe is muy picante. Whether you‚Äôre in Buenos Aires, La Paz, Guadalajara, or Santiago, this coin has the kind of edge that resonates with Latin culture. It‚Äôs fun but fierce. It‚Äôs playful but packed with potential. Let‚Äôs not forget community. Latin Americans build fuerte communities around causes they believe in. Crypto is no different. When you jump into the Troller Cat whitelist, you‚Äôre not just buying a coin‚Äîyou‚Äôre joining a tribe. One that values memes, money, and messing with the system. Plus, let‚Äôs be honest. The global North has had the first-mover advantage long enough. It‚Äôs our time to catch the wave early and ride it to el cielo. You‚Äôve seen how fast tokens fly once they hit public listings. Imagine the gains if you got in before that madness even starts. You could be sipping micheladas while your $TCAT stack multiplies. The Whitelist is Heating Up‚ÄîWhat Are You Waiting For? There‚Äôs a saying around here: ‚ÄúEl que no arriesga, no gana.‚Äù If you‚Äôre waiting for the stars to align before getting into crypto, newsflash‚Äîthey already did. Trollercat is gearing up for one of the hottest presales of the year. And the whitelist? It‚Äôs your backstage pass. This isn‚Äôt one of those slow-burn launches. People are already lining up, whispering in Discords and Telegrams, trying to get early access. Don‚Äôt get left out, compadre. Once the public sale drops, prices could pump hard. But the real winners? They‚Äôll be the early cats‚Äîthe ones who believed in the whiskers before the rest saw the claws. Whitelist access gives you primo pricing. You can get your paws on $TCAT before the rest of the world even sees the light. That‚Äôs leverage, pap√°. And if the rumors about staking rewards and play-to-earn burn mechanics are true, you‚Äôll be sitting on a gem while others are still trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on. So stop scrolling, start moving. Head to the official Trollercat site and jump into the whitelist while there‚Äôs still room. We don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll be open. One thing‚Äôs for sure: once this cat jumps, it‚Äôs not coming back down easy. Conclusion Crypto doesn‚Äôt wait for anyone ‚Äî and neither does Troller Cat ($TCAT). We‚Äôve seen this movie before: early adopters stack up during a whitelist, coins go live, prices pump, and latecomers cry into their empanadas. Don‚Äôt let that be you this time. This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. It‚Äôs a cultural movement, a digital rebellion with claws. From rumored staking rewards to a play-to-earn Game Center and a deflationary twist, $TCAT is setting itself up as the meme coin to watch in 2025. This is your redo, bro. Your fresh start.

Posting to X, Farina stated that purchasing $1,000 worth of XRP at its current price of around $2 is equivalent to holding over $50,000, as he expects the asset‚Äôs price to reach $100.

This potential 50x return shows the asset‚Äôs potential and the confidence experts like Farina have in this investment. His message aligns with his past support for the digital asset. Another crypto expert recently described XRP‚Äôs utility as a safe haven for investors, and its use in cross-border payments, tokenization, and institutional finance could help drive adoption and price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions Farina‚Äôs statement drew strong reactions from the XRP community, ranging from enthusiastic agreement to cautious skepticism. One user expressed long-term optimism, saying he would revisit the post when others ask how early investors succeeded. Another commenter supported the idea of holding XRP, mentioning that he was glad to have accumulated the token at $0.50. However, not all responses were optimistic. Some questioned the feasibility of XRP reaching $100 within the next few years. One person remarked that XRP may not hit $10 in the next five years. A lot of skeptics cite concerns about growth pace and external challenges like regulation, but prominent supporters have debunked these claims. Is XRP On the Brink of a Price Surge? Farina previously showed through historical data that XRP always moves fast and aggressively . The asset‚Äôs rapid ascent from $0.5 to $3.39 between November 2024 and early January 2025 supports this belief, and I could experience much quicker growth as the market recovers from the recent downturn. Additionally, the recent dismissal of the SEC‚Äôs appeal against Ripple has removed all regulatory hurdles surrounding XRP. Ripple can freely innovate and offer industry-changing products without the fear of an attack from regulators. While skeptics may debate the timing or possibility of such high valuations, Farina‚Äôs confidence highlights the enduring belief among many investors that XRP is far from reaching its full potential.

The draft bill has been released for public consultation, which will be open until May 5, 2025. This will make Slovenia one of the first European nations to adopt the regulations. Finance Ministry Sets Clearer Rules on Crypto Asset Gains According to reports, the Ministry of Finance in Ljubljana presented the draft on Thursday through its Directorate for the Tax, Customs and Other Public Revenue System. As detailed , the proposal focuses on taxing profits from the sale or use of digital assets. This includes cases where crypto is converted into fiat currency, used to buy goods or services, or transferred to another person. Under the new rule, these are all treated as disposals. It is worth noting that the draft excludes crypto-to-crypto exchanges or transfers between wallets belonging to the same holder. This is seen as an attempt to reduce the reporting burden for users who do not convert their holdings into money or spend it. The proposed law intends to align Slovenia with international tax practices while keeping the paperwork manageable for taxpayers. It was reported that the ministry fixed the tax rate at 25%. Additionally, profits will be calculated by subtracting the crypto‚Äôs acquisition value from its value at the time of disposal. It is important to add that taxpayers must maintain accurate records of their acquisitions and sales. Authorities may ask to see these records at any time. Simplified Option for Taxpayers Included in Draft The proposal also includes a simplified approach. This method allows taxpayers to calculate their tax based on 40% of the total value of their crypto assets as of December 31, 2025. It also considers all disposals from the past five years and helps those without full records avoid calculating profits on each transaction. In related news, Ukraine‚Äôs financial watchdog has proposed taxing certain crypto transactions as personal income , with rates up to 23%. The watchdog aims to align with global standards while meeting local financial needs. Derivatives Also Face the Same Crypto Tax Rate Alongside crypto, the Ministry has included derivative financial instruments in the proposal. These would be taxed at the same 25%, no matter how long the asset was held before being sold. This change supports Slovenia‚Äôs Capital Market Development Strategy for 2023 to 2030, pushing for a more uniform tax system. Meanwhile, a Nigerian court has delayed Binance‚Äôs next hearing in the $2 billion tax evasion case until April 30 , allowing time for the tax authority to respond to a legal objection raised by Binance.

The Chainlink (LINK) price decline made headlines earlier this year, and now it‚Äôs showing signs of life with a 6% rebound. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) update is gaining traction as Soroban smart contracts officially go live, creating new opportunities for developers on the network. Both events have traders watching closely‚Äîbut not everyone is sticking with legacy names. That‚Äôs where Web3 ai is starting to stand out. Built as an all-in-one AI-powered research tool, it takes the guesswork out of finding the next high ROI crypto. Instead of spending hours sifting through documents and forums, users get a full breakdown of project potential‚Äîfrom tokenomics and team credibility to risk factors and vesting schedules. For traders looking to get ahead without drowning in data, it‚Äôs proving to be a real edge. Web3 ai: AI-Driven Research That Cuts Through the Noise If you‚Äôve ever spent an afternoon buried in whitepapers and Telegram links just to figure out whether a presale is worth your time, you already know the pain. Web3 ai‚Äôs ICO & Token Sale Advisor solves that. It uses AI to instantly analyze early-stage crypto projects across multiple chains and categories, including launchpad IDOs, meme coins, and real utility tokens. The tool doesn‚Äôt just score projects‚Äîit explains the reasoning behind its ratings. Want to know if the team is doxxed? How the tokenomics play out long term? Whether there‚Äôs a risky vesting cliff? It‚Äôs all there‚Äîsummarized, contextualized, and easy to understand. That makes Web3 ai a must-have for anyone seriously hunting the next high ROI crypto project. And while the tech is impressive, the economics are just as compelling. The $WAI token powers everything on the platform, from premium access to governance. Users who stake $WAI don‚Äôt just hold it‚Äîthey earn a portion of actual revenue from platform usage. It‚Äôs not just a utility token; it‚Äôs a piece of an AI SaaS ecosystem built to scale. The token is currently in presale across 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and ending at $0.003267, with a confirmed listing at $0.005242. That‚Äôs a potential 1747% ROI baked into the model for early supporters. In a space full of hype and empty promises, Web3 ai is aiming to deliver both product and value. Chainlink (LINK) Price Decline Shows Signs of Recovery Earlier in 2025, Chainlink (LINK) faced a tough stretch. Prices slid, sentiment wavered, and many questioned what was next. But March marked a turning point. Chainlink launched its Payment Abstraction system on mainnet, enabling users to pay for services like CCIP and automation using assets such as ETH, which then get auto-converted to LINK. Aave was among the first to jump on board, using Chainlink‚Äôs Smart Value Recapture system to improve liquidations. Since then, LINK‚Äôs chart has started to show a slow but steady comeback. It‚Äôs now printing higher lows, and some analysts are watching for a possible bullish reversal. With more focus on fundamentals‚Äîlike MEV protection and cross-chain utility‚ÄîChainlink is positioning itself for a broader 2025 narrative. The question isn‚Äôt whether the price will climb overnight‚Äîit‚Äôs whether the groundwork being laid today can drive sustainable traction later this year. Stellar (XLM) Update: Smart Contracts Bring Fresh Momentum Stellar‚Äôs big move in 2025 came with Protocol 20, which officially brought Soroban smart contracts to mainnet. It‚Äôs a major upgrade for the network, transforming Stellar from a simple payment-focused chain into one that now supports a full range of decentralized applications. The market responded quickly. In mid-March, XLM jumped more than 11% in a single day, outperforming major tokens on the CoinDesk 20 Index. This isn‚Äôt just about price‚Äîit‚Äôs about what‚Äôs now possible. Developers finally have a framework to build dApps on Stellar, and the ecosystem is responding with renewed energy. Tools, SDKs, and documentation are rolling out alongside the protocol update, suggesting Stellar isn‚Äôt just making announcements‚Äîit‚Äôs delivering infrastructure. If adoption follows, this could be the start of a long-term evolution for the chain. Final Take: Big Updates Are Good‚ÄîSmart Tools Are Better Yes, the Chainlink (LINK) price decline was concerning, but the recovery signals show there‚Äôs still life in the project. The Stellar (XLM) update is more than just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs a step toward real developer traction. But while both networks are building, the challenge for traders is always the same: how do you spot the right opportunities early? That‚Äôs where Web3 ai delivers. With its AI-driven due diligence system, users can evaluate projects faster and more accurately than ever‚Äîno spreadsheet tabs, no endless social digging. It‚Äôs a tool that does the hard part for you and gives you answers you can actually use. And with its presale running now‚Äîfrom $0.0003 to $0.003267 across 50 stages, and a listing price of $0.005242‚Äîearly users could see up to 1747% ROI. In a market flooded with hype, Web3 ai is earning attention for offering something that‚Äôs harder to find: clarity.

Optimism (OP) and Kaspa (KAS) are rising as well, each bringing fresh narratives to the altcoin scene in 2025. These names are drawing in capital‚Äîbut eyes are turning to a new contender quickly rising from the watchlists. And while the majors hold their ground, one fast-moving altcoin may soon take center stage: MAGACOINFINANCE . HISTORY‚ÄôS BIGGEST GAINS START EARLY ‚Äì 6,000% UPSIDE ‚Äì JOIN NOW MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Under-the-Radar 2025 Altcoin With 40x Potential As digital asset markets rotate into discovery mode, investors are increasingly evaluating early-stage altcoins with scalable impact and social growth. MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as one of the few still sitting in that early growth zone‚Äîquietly expanding its reach while building a community base from the ground up. Momentum is rising across forums, Telegram groups, and research reports. But it‚Äôs not just chatter‚Äîanalyst models are now aligning around a 40x return projection , placing it on par with early movers of past cycles. While the token isn‚Äôt listed on major platforms yet, traders are already calling it one of the most compelling new entries of 2025.

Among the most exciting coins making waves in 2025 are Qubetics , Gala, and Hedera. With each of these digital assets carving their own path in the blockchain ecosystem, it‚Äôs clear that the next bull run crypto will be shaped by their unique features and innovative approaches. For anyone who‚Äôs been keeping an eye on the crypto space, the rise of Qubetics in particular is hard to ignore. Not only is it in the midst of a presale that has already raised more than $16 million, but it‚Äôs offering something groundbreaking with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. Meanwhile, Gala has proven itself as a prominent player in the gaming sector, while Hedera continues to push the boundaries of scalability and speed. But with so many options out there, how do Qubetics, Gala, and Hedera stack up against each other in the race for dominance during the next bull run crypto? This article will break down what makes each of these coins stand out and why they‚Äôre on the radar for 2025. Qubetics: Redefining Digital Finance with a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet When thinking about the future of blockchain and digital finance, Qubetics ($TICS) is one project that stands at the forefront. Currently in its 30th stage of presale, Qubetics has already sold over 508 million tokens to 24,900+ holders, raising an impressive $16.2 million. At $0.1729 per token in this stage, the Qubetics crypto presale has garnered significant interest, and the numbers continue to climb. So, what makes Qubetics such a standout in the crowded crypto market? Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet is a game-changer. Unlike traditional wallets that require users to trust a third-party service to hold their assets, Qubetics provides a decentralized solution that puts control back into the hands of the users. For businesses, professionals, and individual users alike, this wallet offers enhanced security, privacy, and flexibility. It supports multiple chains, allowing users to manage various assets seamlessly within one interface. But that‚Äôs not all‚ÄîQubetics has identified key issues in the current blockchain landscape and is solving them head-on. Traditional digital finance systems often suffer from slow transactions, high fees, and lack of interoperability. Qubetics, however, is designed to address these challenges by utilizing a multi-chain approach and offering lightning-fast transactions without the burden of high fees. Looking ahead to the next bull run crypto, analysts predict a massive surge in Qubetics‚Äô price, with estimates suggesting that $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $15 post-mainnet launch, resulting in an ROI of up to 8567%. That‚Äôs not just speculation‚Äîthis project has a clear roadmap, and it‚Äôs gaining traction rapidly. Key Stats for Qubetics: Presale Stage: 30th Tokens Sold: 508 million Total Raised: $16.2 million Current Price: $0.1729 per token Predicted ROI: Up to 8567% after mainnet launch Gala: Revolutionizing the Gaming World with Blockchain If you‚Äôve been into crypto for a while, then Gala is no stranger to you. The project is positioning itself as the key player in the blockchain gaming world. Gala‚Äôs ecosystem is designed to empower game developers and players by integrating blockchain into gaming experiences. From decentralized game ownership to in-game economies powered by crypto, Gala is laying the foundation for the next generation of gaming. One of Gala‚Äôs key innovations is its focus on user control. In traditional gaming, players have no real ownership over their in-game assets. You buy skins, weapons, and characters, but you don‚Äôt truly own them. With Gala, everything is on the blockchain, meaning that players can buy, sell, or trade in-game assets securely and transparently. As the next bull run crypto, Gala is also expanding its reach through partnerships with popular game developers, offering an ever-growing portfolio of games. With its Gala Games ecosystem, Gala is combining NFTs, gaming, and DeFi in a unique way, creating an environment where players, developers, and even spectators can participate in an entirely new digital economy. In 2025, Gala‚Äôs price action will likely be influenced by its ability to onboard new users and game developers. The ongoing integration of blockchain into gaming experiences presents a huge opportunity for Gala, and as more players start engaging with its ecosystem, the demand for $GALA tokens could soar. Hedera: The Fast, Secure, and Scalable Blockchain for Enterprises When it comes to scalability, few blockchain platforms can match Hedera. As one of the most advanced public distributed ledgers out there, Hedera is built to scale while maintaining speed and security. Hedera‚Äôs consensus service, powered by the Hashgraph algorithm, allows for thousands of transactions per second (TPS) without sacrificing decentralization. The Hedera network is perfect for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology for real-world applications. From supply chain management to secure digital identity solutions, Hedera has established itself as a leader in enterprise blockchain. Unlike other networks that suffer from bottlenecks as usage increases, Hedera‚Äôs unique architecture allows it to handle large-scale operations seamlessly. Moreover, Hedera‚Äôs governance model is what sets it apart. Rather than relying on a small group of miners or validators, Hedera‚Äôs governing council is made up of some of the world‚Äôs largest companies, ensuring the network‚Äôs credibility and stability. This makes Hedera a strong contender for adoption by mainstream businesses looking to integrate blockchain technology. In the context of the next bull run crypto, Hedera‚Äôs focus on enterprise adoption and scalability positions it for continued growth. With its robust infrastructure and strong governance, Hedera is set to remain a top player in the blockchain space. Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet: The Future of Digital Finance For anyone using crypto, the idea of managing multiple chains in one wallet might seem like a dream. But Qubetics is turning that dream into a reality. The Qubetics non-custodial multi-chain wallet enables seamless integration with multiple blockchain networks. Users don‚Äôt need to rely on third-party custodians; they‚Äôre in full control of their assets. For businesses and professionals, this wallet simplifies the management of multiple digital assets across various platforms, all from one secure location. Plus, it‚Äôs built with user-friendliness in mind, ensuring that even those new to crypto can navigate the wallet effortlessly. Conclusion The next bull run crypto is undoubtedly going to be exciting, with Qubetics, Gala, and Hedera leading the charge in 2025. Qubetics stands out for its innovative non-custodial multi-chain wallet, offering real-world solutions to blockchain‚Äôs most pressing issues. Gala is reshaping the gaming landscape with its blockchain integration, while Hedera is empowering enterprises with a fast, scalable network.

The figures demonstrate the alarming divergence between the two assets from April 2015 and April 2025. In particular, this striking ascent of Bitcoin has caught the eye of investors spread around the globe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Bitcoin Vs. Gold: From Equal Footing To Massive Gap Ten years ago, gold and Bitcoin were at similar prices. In April 2015, Bitcoin moved between $200 and $250, whereas gold was ranging around $1,200 to $1,300 per ounce. The fortunes of these investments have since become totally different. Bitcoin has soared to about $84,000 per coin, up some 33,500% in the ten-year period. The cryptocurrency briefly peaked at nearly $109,000 during the timeframe. If someone tries to tell you gold is better than Bitcoin‚Ä¶ Just show them this: In 2015, 1 BTC = 1 ounce of gold. Today? That same Bitcoin is up 13,693% in 10 years. Let the numbers speak. pic.twitter.com/8JipH5IsNr ‚Äî Ted (@TedPillows) April 17, 2025 Gold, on the other hand, has preserved its image of reliability over volatility, rather than offering spectacular gains. The precious metal increased by only 156% over the same period. From the market onlookers, gold‚Äôs worth proposition is still anchored on its consistent, inflation-proof behavior spanning very long timescales. Historical Context Demonstrates Divergent Patterns Of Growth Going back even farther shows an even greater disparity in the growth rates. According to a market analyst on social media platform X, the price of gold was only $20.67 per ounce in 1933. As for 2025, the price has gone up somewhat to around $3,330 an ounce, which is indeed a steep rise but a gradual increase over a period of almost a century. Ted's analysis on X. Bitcoin has had a completely different history. From a price of $1 in 2011, it came up to $84,000 by 2025. With such rapid appreciation rates, both excitement and skepticism have been brought forth by financial analysts debating the worthiness of such growths. Sheer Disparity In Size According to analyst Belle, a stark contrast in the behavior is due to the sheer difference in the size of their market. Gold has roughly a market capitalization of a little over $22 trillion. Due to this great size, gold provides an element of stability, rendering the market less sensitive to individual transactions or flows of short-term investments. GOLD added $1 trillion to its market cap in one day. That‚Äôs nearly the entire value of #Bitcoin right now. This shows how massive traditional markets are & how early we still are with Bitcoin. Even a small shift into $BTC could send it flying. pic.twitter.com/YsjSgOZKjx ‚Äî Belle (@Bitt_Belle) April 17, 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization is at approximately $1.667 trillion‚Äîlarge but still only a fraction of gold‚Äôs. This reduced size makes Bitcoin more sensitive to capital flows. Gold recently saw an impressive $1 trillion rise in market capitalization over one day, but this was a much smaller percentage move than the same dollar flow would trigger in Bitcoin‚Äôs value.

Base has onboarded 155 million addresses, bridged 1.9 million ETH (representing 1.6% of Ethereum's circulating supply), and currently secures nearly $10 billion in total value. Over the past six months, Base has averaged 93 transactions per second. Ethereum supports L2s through 'blobs,' a low-cost data storage mechanism introduced with EIP-4844. Industry analysis indicates that Ethereum's planned increases in blob capacity, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade to six blobs per block, may not be sufficient to meet rapid L2 transaction growth. Simulations suggest that a tenfold increase in L2 transactions could push average transaction fees to $0.64, unless blob capacity is expanded to at least 33 blobs per block to keep L2 transaction costs below $0.02.

Still, the debate is active. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday that Trump was ‚Äústudying whether he could fire‚Äù Powell. The chair‚Äôs four‚Äëyear term ends in May 2026. Lombard‚Äôs intervention marked an unusually direct comment on U.S. domestic policy from a French minister. President Emmanuel Macron has clashed with Trump on Ukraine and trade, and has offered French research posts to American scientists whose funding was cut. Tariffs remain a second flash point. This month, the Trump administration imposed 10 percent duties on some European Union imports. Lombard said that level is ‚Äúa huge increase that isn‚Äôt sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade.‚Äù He added that Europe still wants a free‚Äëtrade zone with the United States and urged European chief executives to show ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù by working with their governments to protect the region‚Äôs interests. On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose LVMH group owns Mo√´t & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, and Hennessy, hinted that EU leaders were not pressing hard enough for a tariff accord. The tension around the Fed adds to a rough month on Wall Street, where investors have wrestled with the tariff wars and fears of slowing growth. Many see the central bank as a stabilizer. Undermining it, Lombard said, would shake confidence in the dollar itself. The immediate question is whether the president will act on his threats. As Trump put it, ‚ÄúIf I want him out,‚Äù he can move quickly. Whether markets would stay calm, Lombard suggested, is another matter entirely. Powell has not commented publicly on the latest threats as of yet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

It can handle thousands of transactions per second and is loved by developers and investors alike. But while Solana leads in performance, a new project is emerging that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence to disrupt the crypto space, Ruvi AI (RUVI) . Ruvi AI is gaining recognition as the next big opportunity for investors with its presale success and unique blend of blockchain and AI. Early buyers of $RUVI during the presale will see massive returns and analysts are already predicting big price jumps after the token launches. Here‚Äôs why Ruvi AI is all the buzz and you don‚Äôt want to miss out. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Ecosystem: A Game-Changer for Users and Investors Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project. It‚Äôs an ecosystem around a superapp that democratizes artificial intelligence. The platform is designed to help marketers, content creators and entrepreneurs to use AI for tasks like generating professional text, creating visuals and producing multimedia. But what really sets Ruvi AI apart is its token utility that gives value to investors and users. Holders of the $RUVI token get: Premium AI Tools for streamlined workflows and better output. Passive Income through token staking. Governance Rights to have a say in the platform‚Äôs development. This trifecta of functionality makes Ruvi AI not just a tech platform but also an investment vehicle with tangible returns and utility. Early Presale Success Ruvi AI has caught the attention of investors worldwide, sold 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised $100,000 in the first few days of the presale . At the current price of $0.01 per token , this is the time to get in. But this offer is time limited. Once the current presale phase is over the token price will increase by 50% , so act fast to get ahead. Exclusive VIP Tier 3 Rewards Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP bonus structure adds another layer of excitement to the presale by rewarding investors based on their contribution. For example, consider the benefits of being in VIP Tier 3. An investment of $1,000 in the pre-sale causes the automatic distribution of $100,000 in RUVI tokens to the investor. Since the token is sold at a price of $0.01 per piece, 100000 token pieces are the result of it and the investor is bumped up to VIP Tier 3. The investor stands to get a bonus of 60% from the group and the total is then 160,000 tokens. Now consider Ruvi AI‚Äôs projected listing price of $0.07 per token . The $1,000 investment becomes $11,200 , a whopping 1,020% ROI . These rewards show Ruvi AI‚Äôs commitment to giving high value to its early backers. What are Ruvi‚Äôs Leaderboard Rewards? To complement the VIP structure, Ruvi AI has introduced a leaderboard rewards program that incentivizes top contributors during the presale. This program gives out token bonuses based on ranking: Top 10 investors get 500,000 additional tokens , worth $35,000 post-launch. Top 50 investors get 250,000 tokens , valued at $17,500 . Even the Top 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens , a $1,400 value at the listing price. These leaderboard rewards stack on top of the VIP tier benefits, making the returns even more juicy for dedicated investors. Analysts Predict Big Returns Post-Launch Analysts are very bullish on Ruvi AI‚Äôs post-launch performance. And they have good reason to be: that utility and the momentum Ruvi‚Äôs seen so far in presales are a powerful combination. Many think the $RUVI token could hit‚Äîand stay above‚Äî$0.5 within months of its launch. What does that mean for early investors? If you buy in during the presale at $0.01, here‚Äôs what you can expect to see: For every dollar you invest, your returns would multiply tenfold to $0.50 per token. That‚Äôs a pretty enticing prospect. A VIP Tier 3 investor with 160,000 tokens would see their portfolio grow to $80,000‚Äîa massive 8000% return on investment. That kind of potential makes Ruvi AI one of the most exciting investment opportunities out there right now. Why Solana Investors Should Pay Attention Solana has shown that blockchain can be fast and scalable. But Ruvi AI is different. By combining advanced AI with blockchain‚Äôs transparency and security, Ruvi AI opens up new possibilities. Its ecosystem solves real-world problems in content creation, marketing and more while giving early participants big financial gains. Ruvi AI‚Äôs purpose is clear, its utility is unmatched and its design is innovative. It‚Äôs a must-have in any crypto portfolio. With real use cases and high growth potential, this is a competitor to established tokens like Solana. Conclusion Cryptocurrency markets reward those who position themselves early for the next big thing. With Ruvi AI, the opportunity is clear, from its ecosystem to its presale to post-launch projections. As the presale ends and the $RUVI price is about to rise, there‚Äôs no better time to get in. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor who knows Solana or new to crypto, Ruvi AI is a chance to be part of a game-changing solution that combines blockchain and AI.

Threshold Network powers tBTC, a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that can be used throughout DeFi ecosystems. The project‚Äôs native token, T , is trading at $0.0223 at time of writing, up from $0.0143 one week ago. The 236th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up nearly 48% in the past 24 hours alone. T‚Äôs price surge largely materialized after Threshold Network announced on Thursday that it planned to restructure its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to reduce annual operational costs by approximately $1.1 million. Explains the project, ‚ÄúAdded to the more than $8.5 million in annual savings expected from the elimination of tBTC staking rewards, this sets the stage for significant profitability moving forward. Cost efficiency also allows the DAO to eliminate treasury sales of T tokens, enabling it to strategically reinvest in T token. The DAO treasury will continue to accrue tBTC via bridge fees and T tokens via buybacks as per¬†TIP-54. Threshold has already completed its first purchase of ~30 million T tokens for 5.8 tBTC‚Ä¶ Given the tight economic linkage between T and tBTC, this shift is expected to create a virtuous cycle of growth, where increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and bridge velocity drive T‚Äôs value, attracting further participation and reinforcing the ecosystem‚Äôs expansion.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH), though still a juggernaut, is contending with high gas costs and congestion issues. Optimism (OP) and I njective (INJ) offer their own innovation layers, but neither has yet ignited the type of widespread traction seen in past cycles. Now, a different contender is drawing attention‚Äînot for what it‚Äôs done already, but for the projections being placed in front of it. Enter: MAGACOINFINANCE . EVERY MILLIONAIRE WAS EARLY ‚Äì 55X TARGET ‚Äì SECURE YOUR SPOT MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Analyst Watchlist Pick With 33x Forecast Few tokens are making the kind of quiet progress MAGACOINFINANCE is accomplishing right now. It isn‚Äôt trending on every platform yet‚Äîbut its name is showing up in more investor watchlists and analyst previews than ever before. What‚Äôs driving the movement? Steady user acquisition, consistent expansion in exposure, and technical setups that point to a potential launch beyond expectations. Current modeling from several high-profile trackers has placed a 33x return forecast on the altcoin, citing comparative entry points and trend velocity similar to major 2021 runs. It‚Äôs this kind of momentum shift that‚Äôs pulling in early buyers‚Äîespecially those who missed key windows with tokens like SOL, INJ, or OP. And while no forecast is a guarantee, the combination of tight supply mechanics and increasing retail discovery is creating real urgency across the board. 2025‚ÄôS TOP COIN ‚Äì 33X WINDOW OPEN ‚Äì JOIN NOW Coin Comparisons Ethereum (ETH) still leads in overall dominance, but its maturity means exponential growth is less likely. Solana (SOL) brings high performance and strong branding, yet some argue much of its 2025 potential has already been priced in. Optimism (OP) holds technical value in scaling layers, but adoption hasn‚Äôt caught fire outside niche ecosystems. Injective (INJ), while technically promising, remains in a holding pattern after early volatility. That‚Äôs why MAGACOINFINANCE is being discussed in different circles‚Äînot as the next SOL or XRP, but as something with its own trajectory. The 33x forecast places it firmly in the category of early momentum movers, not follow-up plays.

In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is still unfolding its narrative‚Äîand with projections pointing toward a 33x valuation , it could soon step into the spotlight as a serious contender.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a viral Ethereum-based token, now catching the eye of investors chasing Solana-like upside. With a newly launched leaderboard dashboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, the project has ignited a surge of interest from both whales and everyday traders. The project has raised more than $6.9 million and obtained over 8400 holder accounts. The fourth phase of MUTM offers tokens at $0.025 but the project launch price will begin at $0.06 which provides investors with a valuable 140% return on investment. Mutuum Finance could hit $4 sooner after the launch. MUTM is quickly becoming a serious performer as SOL fights to defend its place among the crypto elite. Surging Interest in the MUTM Presale During phase 4 of the MUTM presale investors have rapidly increased their contributions through 8400 accounts resulting in $6.9 million token deposits throughout the first several purchase days. Investors with hardware wallets can obtain MUTM tokens during pre-sale but they receive the following advantages: they get an opportunity to purchase tokens at $0.06 setting their future value potential. Mutuum Finance tokens will reach prices expected to surpass $4 after their listing date because exchange agreements will improve their value following launch. Mutuum Finance is in the process of a smart contract audit by CertiK, an essential measure to strengthen security and trust. The official report will be published on their social media once the audit is complete. Expanding the Mutuum Finance Ecosystem Mutuum Finance achieves its innovative expansion and sustainable growth objectives through its secure and scalable design which supports expansion potentials and architectural components. Predictive smart contracts optimize the lending mechanisms of the platform that connects various networks because of its platform-independent features. Stakeholders receive periodic rewards which generate passive income throughout their whole investment period. USD stablecoin provides stability to users through system-supported platform assets which establish a new economic direction. Mutuum Finance oriented itself as a top DeFi investment platform by deepening its liquidity operations while building its market positioning prior to its market listing. Exclusive Perks for Early Investors Mutuum Finance conducts an early adopter celebration giveaway that distributes $100,000 MUTM tokens while providing $10,000 MUTM tokens to each participant from the ten members who join. The platform gives users benefits from its referral network because new members earn greater rewards advantages through it. Mutuum Finance delivers foremost decentralized lending solutions through their dual-lending model that includes adjustable capabilities along with optimal operational results. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) platform strengthens both lender and borrower interactions by providing better rates of capital accessibility together with automatic management systems for interest rates. Each user within the Peer-to-Peer model independently establishes their personal loan agreements using the direct operating system provided by the model. Mutuum Finance establishes its place as the top DeFi lending service by implementing its dual-lending system for the market. Solana (SOL) remains a strong performer in 2025, but rising competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hard to ignore. The project has raised $6.9 million from over 8,400 investors, with current Phase 4 pricing at $0.025 and a launch price set at $0.06, offering early buyers up to 140% gains. A $100,000 giveaway, Top 50 Holder rewards, and a CertiK audit boost its credibility. Analysts see MUTM hitting $4 post-launch, making it a serious threat to legacy tokens.

The premier cryptocurrency is struggling to break out of the $85,000-$86,000 price range following an impressive price rally in the second week of April. However, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified the major price resistance for the current Bitcoin uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters New Phase: Analyst Predicts Positive Movement In 2025 Bitcoin STH Realized Price At $91,000 Presents Major Make-Or-Break Moment In a recent post on X, Martinez states that Bitcoin faces a key resistance level at the $91,275 following a price rebound in early April.¬†Notably, the asset surged by 17.33% after reaching a price low of $75,000 on April 9. However, BTC has since entered a consolidation following this feat, producing no significant price movement in either direction. Over the past week, the crypto market leader moved only between $84,000 to $86,000, forming a tight range-bound market. However, amidst these struggles, Martinez states that Bitcoin short-term holders realized the price lies at $91,275, indicating the pivotal resistance to the recent market resurgence lies ahead. For context, the short-term holders‚Äô realized price is the average price at which new buyers (i.e, new investors of Bitcoin over the past 155 days) acquired their BTC. It is an important technical indicator used to evaluate short-term market sentiment and behavior. When a market price is above the STH realized price, it indicates a bullish momentum as recent buyers are in profit and are likely to hold. In this case, the STH realized price serves as a strong support level, with new market entrants often defending their entry zone. However, when Bitcoin‚Äôs price is below the STH realized price as currently seen in the market, the realized price forms a significant psychological price resistance. This is because many short-term holders may choose to exit once the market breaks even, increasing the selling pressure around that zone. Therefore, Bitcoin reclaiming $91,275 is essential to validate a sufficient bullish potential to fuel a complete price reversal.

Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency is down by 1.34% on its monthly chart as bearish pressure continues to wane. While a major market resistance lies at $91,000, Bitcoin faces an immediate opposition at the $86,000 price zone, breaking past which could spur a sharp price rise to $91,000. However, a price fall below the support at $84,500 could result in a further price slide to $84,000 with the potential to trade as low as $83,300.

Several investment models now project a 5,700% return window , based on recent surges in wallet creation, watchlist adds, and overall trader engagement. Unlike coins already far into their growth curve, MAGACOINFINANCE still has early access pricing, growing social traction, and forward-looking momentum.

Cardano (ADA) : Technically mature but facing skepticism after previous cycles underperformed. Kaspa (KAS) and Arbitrum (ARB) : Active networks with solid use cases, yet neither are projected beyond a 4x window by leading analysts. By contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is pegged with a clear 62x upside potential , making it a high-leverage, early-access opportunity in a field where such setups are increasingly rare. The core difference?

Kiyosaki said he expects Bitcoin, gold, and silver to soar as the dollar loses strength because of inflation and the growing‚ÄÇtotal of government and debt. ‚ÄúI firmly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will exceed over $1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,‚Äù he wrote . Kiyosaki is famous for recommending hard asset investing, specifically gold and silver. In recent years, he has included BTC on that list, dubbing it ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù and a primary tool for preserving wealth. Kiyosaki says the American economy is heading for dangerous territory. As it stands, rising credit card debt, growing national debt, increased unemployment, and weakened retirement savings are a few red flags he points to. He thinks that the U.S. may be nearing what he calls a ‚Äúgreater depression.‚Äù In his post, he stated that in 2025, credit card debt had reached all-time highs, U.S. debt was at record levels, unemployment was rising, 401(k) plans were losing value, and pensions were being stolen. For him, the answer is not to place trust in traditional financial systems. Instead, he advises building wealth using assets governments can‚Äôt dilute or tinker with ‚Äî like Bitcoin. Experts predict Bitcoin will hit $1 million Kiyosaki isn‚Äôt the only one who believes that BTC will spike in the near future. Many famous investors and financial leaders have made statements with similar predictions of Bitcoin in the millions over the next 10 years. In May last year, Twitter co-founder millionaire Jack Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin would reach a million dollars by 2030. He said decentralized finance was the future and that Bitcoin would prosper with increasing mistrust in central banks. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood raised her forecast in February 2025, arguing that Bitcoin could surpass $1.5 million by 2030. She said her expansion outlook is driven by demand growth, particularly from institutions and nations looking at crypto for use as a financial reserve. Eric Trump spoke at Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi in December 2024. He said that its fixed supply and growing global interest make Bitcoin a powerful hedge against inflation ‚Äî and its value could soar to $1 million per coin. Others argue the price of BTC could be heavily affected by the actions of the U.S. government. If the U.S. started buying Bitcoin as part of a national reserve strategy, Blockstream CEO Adam Back hinted, prices could go to the moon. In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order that permits federal agencies to seize unused or confiscated crypto and to allow these assets to be converted into a strategic Bitcoin fund. The step was intended to bolster the country‚Äôs standing in a shifting global economy. Investors view Bitcoin as a shield against inflation Kiyosaki‚Äôs prediction is based, at its core, on his belief that inflation will keep eating away at the value of fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. He and others believe that Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized architecture, serves as a hedge against that risk. With increasing distrust in financial institutions globally, Bitcoin appeals to an increasingly broader range of investors ‚Äî retail and institutional. While critics identify potential volatility and regulatory obstructions, the general sentiment from many financial corporations is quite straightforward: Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term future looks bright. Whatever the outcome of this increasingly popular price target, several analysts hold that Bitcoin is transforming the global economy and will continue to do so in the years ahead.

The new tokens represented 4% of the project‚Äôs one billion token limit but boosted the circulating supply by 20%, from 200 million to 240 million. Traders had expected selling pressure; instead, the market price climbed from about $7.54 before the unlock to roughly $8.30, leaving the meme coin up 8.5 percent on the day and well above holiday‚Äëweekend lows. Data posted by CoinMarketCap shows that only $1.3 million volume can still nudge the price 2 percent on the largest exchanges, a sign of thin Easter weekend liquidity that can increase volatility. Token unlock events normally put a lot of pressure on digital coins because early holders can sell their bags. Thursday‚Äôs allocation belonged to the project‚Äôs creators and to CIC Digital LLC, the corporate entity that manages Trump‚Äôs licensing deals, the memecoin‚Äôs website states. Online forums buzzed with rumors that Trump is planning a gathering for major token holders. However, no details or confirmation have surfaced. The coin‚Äôs purpose is still unclear Beyond bets on the price action and movements, the coin‚Äôs purpose remains unclear. The project‚Äôs website says the tokens are ‚Äúan expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ‚Äò$TRUMP‚Äô and the associated artwork,‚Äù and stresses they are ‚Äúnot intended to be ‚Ä¶ an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.‚Äù Blockchain data by Dune shows that 636,000 wallets hold TRUMP, but only 12,285 control more than $1,000 worth. Research firm K33 labeled the tokenomics ‚Äúpoor‚Äù in a January note when the coin briefly touched its record $71. Regulatory scrutiny has followed the hype. Three days before taking office, Trump promoted the Solana‚Äëbased token on social media. The watchdog group Public Citizen urged authorities to investigate the endorsement. Reuters reported in February that entities behind the coin collected nearly $100 million in trading fees within two weeks, citing estimates from three blockchain‚Äëanalysis companies. Government concern has also spilled into lawmaking. Last month, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, R‚ÄëArk., said the Trump family‚Äôs growing crypto activity is complicating congressional efforts to craft stable‚Äëasset rules. It includes links to the decentralized‚Äëfinance venture World Liberty Financial and its planned stablecoin. Trump is listed as manager, president, secretary, and treasurer of CIC Digital LLC, which has already licensed his likeness for several NFT collections. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Recent statistics indicate that these large holders, or ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù are acquiring around three times the amount of daily Bitcoin produced by miners as the cryptocurrency sits at key price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Whales Purchase At Record Levels While Exchanges Witness Outflows According to Glassnode information, investors possessing between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoins are buying up the cryptocurrency aggressively. These giant holders are at present taking on over 300% of the annual supply emission of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, large crypto exchanges are seeing steady outflows of Bitcoin. This indicates that increasing numbers of whales and large holders are taking their assets to long-term storage instead of leaving them on hand for trading. Market observers view this exodus from exchanges as a sign of improving confidence in the long-term worth of Bitcoin. Most of these large investors have persisted in buying when prices drop, viewing downturns as opportunities to increase their positions rather than sell. Onchain analysts have reported that this activity is reminiscent of trends during Bitcoin‚Äôs 2020 bull cycle. Technical Indicators Reflect Key Resistance Points Bitcoin is now testing its 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages as points of resistance. Based on previous examination by analysts, these levels are approximately $85,500. A pullback could occur if Bitcoin does not manage to breach the technical barriers. The next important support lies at about $80,000 on the upper trendline of the current wedge formation. A narrow price range has existed for some time, between about $75,000 and $85,000. This period of lackluster volatility, combined with substantial buying pressure, may well suggest that accumulation is occurring behind the scenes in anticipation of a large price move. Related Reading: BNB Weathers The Storm Better Than Altcoins, Stats Show Three-Month Correction Follows Typical Bull Market Trend The price of Bitcoin is now back to correction after almost three months since reaching highs near $100,000 earlier in the year. The price has seen a drop of nearly 30% since then. According to analysts, this drop follows the typical trend of previous bull markets. A decrease of 25-35% occurring midway through the cycle would usually denote a situation from which the prices would then continue up once again.

Still, Anthony Pompliano, a long-term BTC bull, continues to believe in the long-term potential of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Pompliano sees the ongoing consolidation in Bitcoin price as a buying opportunity and expects the crypto king to resume its upward trajectory in the months ahead. For investors, even ones restricted in terms of available capital, that should come as good news since Bitcoin tends to drag the rest of the crypto market with it in the same direction. So, if it‚Äôs going to rally, other crypto assets, including meme coins, like CartelFi could also do well in 2025. CartelFi to move in tandem with BTC as it rallies Bitcoin has underperformed gold in recent weeks, but in the trailing 12 months, the performance of both assets has been identical. More importantly, the founder of Professional Capital Management is convinced that Bitcoin will surpass gold in terms of performance as we proceed through the remainder of 2025. ‚ÄúWhat we do see, though, is when gold runs, about 100 days later or so, Bitcoin not only catches up, it usually runs much harder,‚Äù he told CNBC in a recent interview . Pompliano‚Äôs comments indicate better days ahead for Bitcoin. And if they come to fruition, some of the capital, particularly from investors limited in terms of what they can invest, could find its way into CartelFi, given it‚Äôs going for pennies only at writing versus BTC at about $85,000. If you‚Äôd like to learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin, click here to visit its website now. CartelFi‚Äôs narrative is sitting well with the community CartelFi is committed to becoming more than an average meme coin. While others rely purely on hype, CartelFi has set out to offer utility as well. This up-and-coming crypto project aims at transforming idle meme tokens into yield-generating, productive assets. That‚Äôs why the devs are calling this new platform the ‚Äúultimate staking cartel‚Äù. The narrative already seems to be sitting well with investors, considering the meme coin has raised more than $1 million in presale. CartelFi price pops after every presale stage, the next of which is scheduled in 18 hours from now. That‚Äôs helping attract investors even faster to CartelFi in 2025. Put the community interest together with Pompliano‚Äôs remarks that indicate the crypto market will push up with a vengeance after the ongoing consolidation, and investing in CartelFi starts to look like an exciting opportunity.

Analysts tracking wallet activity, user growth, and community engagement have started pointing to MAGACOINFINANCE as a possible high-return altcoin.

Optimism (OP), a player in the scaling space, still faces pressure from fierce competition in the Layer-2 arena. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is just getting started.

Both tokens have become foundational parts of the altcoin landscape. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) and Sei (SEI) are developing steadily, each carving out a niche within interoperability and speed-first applications.

PRESALE SELLING OUT ‚Äì CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Presale Token Projecting a 42x ROI Curve MAGACOINFINANCE has emerged as one of the most closely tracked altcoins among early-stage investors and on-chain analysts. The project is gaining momentum not through short-term hype but through tangible metrics: accelerating wallet creation, surging organic social mentions, and a strong increase in investor retention across platforms. Quantitative analysis from three independent research dashboards places MAGACOINFINANCE on a trajectory toward a 42x ROI curve , based on current entry levels versus forecasted market cap following listing. Analysts cite early-stage tokenomic structure, a highly engaged user base, and sharp pre-listing discovery as critical ingredients behind the model.

MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is gaining real momentum at the ground level.

Rising volumes and stronger sentiment suggest that several digital coins could move sharply in the weeks ahead. Five names‚ÄîNEAR, FET, ONDO, SEI, and a newcomer called Codename:Pepe‚Äîstand out for their recent patterns and news. Analysts and retail traders alike are keeping a close eye on them, waiting to see which one will make the first big jump. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new project that aims to combine two of crypto‚Äôs busiest trends: artificial intelligence and meme‚Äëdriven branding. Many tokens in the market use the word ‚ÄúAI‚Äù but do not offer real tools. Codename:Pepe‚Äôs is built around genuine machine‚Äëlearning features that scan social media feeds and blockchain data in real time. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility , while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. According to the roadmap, the project‚Äôs AI framework will spot new meme coins by watching posts and wallet activity. Measure market mood by checking online chatter and large‚Äëholder moves. Create trading forecasts, risk scores, and early buy‚Äëand‚Äësell signals. Moreover, update automated strategies on the fly so they keep pace with fast markets. The developers plan to keep expanding these tools over time. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors To raise funds, Codename:Pepe is running a community‚Äëdriven presale. The sale uses 28 price stages. In the first stage, the $AGNT token cost $0.003333333. Each stage lifts the price a little, so the first buyers pay the least. The supply on offer is limited, and every tier closes when its allocation sells out. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice The token brings together AI utility and the viral pull of memes. By tying real analytical features to a playful brand, the team hopes to build a broad user base. Supporters point to the small float in presale and the rising price ladder as reasons to enter early. Community channels on the project‚Äôs website, Telegram group, and X account have been growing since launch. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing ‚Äì Join the Mission Now! NEAR Protocol‚Äôs Tenfold Growth: A New Era for Blockchain in 2025 NEAR Protocol enjoyed major user growth in 2023, helped by the release of NEAT inscriptions‚Äîits own twist on non‚Äëfungible tokens‚Äîlast November. The launch drew many first‚Äëtime users. One year earlier, NEAR had partnered with Alibaba Cloud, opening its services to a near‚Äëbillion‚Äëstrong customer base. Although activity dipped after that deal, the chain gained speed again in October and November. Another boost came from KAIKAINOW, an app that lets people read content without unlocking their phones. By late 2024, NEAR‚Äôs market price climbed from under $4 to above $5. On January 23, 2025, CCN forecast that the coin could reach $8.21 during 2025. Longer‚Äërange predictions suggest $15 to $20 by 2030. Fetch.ai: Revolutionizing AI with Blockchain‚ÄîWill FET Soar to New Heights? Fetch.ai, founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh and Toby Simpson, aims to blend artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Their vision is a decentralized world where smart contracts engage with the physical world through Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs). These agents perform tasks like negotiating contracts and managing supply chains autonomously. By combining AI and blockchain, Fetch.ai enhances interoperability between systems. Users benefit from efficient processes, saving time and effort. The platform uses a proof-of-stake mechanism, offering scalability and energy efficiency. Its applications span various industries, including logistics, healthcare, and finance. Historically, FET‚Äôs price remained around $1 until early 2024. Then, it saw a significant rise to $3 within weeks, likely due to increased adoption of AI technology and interest in cryptocurrencies. Analysts speculate that with continued growth, FET could reach $10, considering its past performance and potential. Long-term predictions suggest even higher values. Some experts foresee FET reaching between $30 and $50 by 2050. However, these predictions are speculative, and the volatile nature of crypto markets means outcomes can vary widely. In the current market cycle, Fetch.ai‚Äôs integration of AI and blockchain positions it strongly. Its technology and growing partnerships make it an attractive option for those interested in innovative crypto projects. As industries increasingly adopt AI, FET could be poised for significant growth. Ondo Finance‚Äôs ONDO Token: Bridging Real-World Assets to DeFi Success Ondo Finance is revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) by bringing real-world assets on-chain. With its ONDO token, it offers institutional-grade liquidity solutions. By tokenizing assets like US Treasuries, Ondo makes traditional financial products accessible to all. Launched on January 18, 2024, ONDO‚Äôs price soared, peaking in June. After a downturn, a surge in interest for real-world asset cryptos boosted ONDO to a record high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, the token stood at $1.45, showing resilience. Price predictions are positive. By the end of 2025, ONDO could reach $3.50. Forecasts suggest $6 by 2026 and up to $12 by 2030. These estimates rely on Ondo‚Äôs continued growth and broader adoption. Founded by Nathan Allman and Pinku Surana, Ondo combines blockchain with traditional finance best practices. Investors can easily subscribe, redeem, and transfer synthetic assets. This innovative approach positions Ondo well in DeFi. With strong technology and market potential, ONDO looks attractive now. Its focus on real-world assets and solid leadership indicate future growth. As Ondo integrates further into finance, it could be a bright spot for investors. SEI‚Äôs Fast Track to 2025: Technology and Price Predictions SEI launched in August 2023 with a focus on quick trading. The chain advertises a confirmation time around 250 milliseconds, staking its claim as the fastest in the industry. The project hit its price peak in March 2024 but then slid even after a V2 upgrade in May. On January 23, 2025, SEI traded near $0.3385. Predictions call for an average of $0.75 by the end of 2025 and potentially $2.50 by 2030. SEI employs proof of stake to keep costs low while handling large order flows. By targeting speed, the platform aims to serve traders who need instant execution. With market attention shifting toward efficient infrastructure, SEI‚Äôs technical strengths may gain more notice if volumes rise and fees on older chains stay high. Conclusion Despite positive signals, NEAR, FET, ONDO, and SEI may offer limited short-term gains. Their growth potential might be overshadowed by more dynamic opportunities in the current bull market. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout contender for maximizing profits. Leveraging true artificial intelligence, it delivers valuable trading signals and automated strategies to navigate the meme coin space. With a strong community focus and innovative features, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself to capitalize on explosive market movements.

While the market suffered no major price pullback, the high level of sideways price movement indicates a strong investor uncertainty. Interestingly, popular market analyst with X username Daan Crypto has provided an insightful technical analysis on the BTC market, highlighting the present barriers that are restricting an upward price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Peril? Expert Warns Of China‚Äôs Alleged Scheme To Crash BTC To $40,000 Bitcoin Multiple Barriers: 200-Day EMA, 200-Day MA, And Diagonal Trendline In Focus Since hitting a new all-time high in late January, Bitcoin has slipped into heavy correction, losing over 22% of its market price. The majority of the price loss has been linked to international trade tariff crises, which have forced investors to seek relief in less risky assets. However, a pause in new tariffs and an onset in global negotiations soon accompanied a price rebound seen in early April. Albeit, Bitcoin is now struggling to break out of the $84,000-$86,000, forming a tight consolidation range. In performing a technical analysis on the current BTC market, Daan Crypto has identified the three resistance factors that have been active in the specified price zone. The first price opposition is a diagonal downtrend line formed by Bitcoin‚Äôs consistent lower lows and lower highs amidst the price correction in the past three months. To establish any intent of a trend reversal, Bitcoin bulls must force a convincing price breakout above this long-standing diagonal resistance. Other critical indicators are the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 200-day Simple Moving Average (MA), both of which provide an average of the past 200 days‚Äô prices, with the EMA giving more weight to recent prices. The 200-day EMA is important in spotting medium-to-long-term trend changes as it reacts faster to any price change than the 200-day MA, which is a classic long-term indicator. However, Bitcoin must move above both indicators to break out of its consolidation and perhaps experience a full price recovery. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout Bitcoin Ultimate Resistance At $90,000-$91,000 Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs struggles in the $84,000-$86,000 price zone, Daan Crypto has warned that the asset‚Äôs ultimate test of a price reversal is at the $90,000-$91,000 price range, which served as a key support in the earlier phase of the bull cycle. A successful reclaim of this range would place Bitcoin back into the bullish trading zone, signaling a potential resumption of the broader bull market. At press time, BTC continues to trade at $84,868 following a 0.13% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 42.34% and valued at $12.52 billion.

Perkins warned that a containment approach to crypto would expose the traditional financial system to massive liquidity risks ‚Äúof unimaginable scale,‚Äù especially when the crypto market operates in real-time, 24/7, while traditional financial markets shuts down after trading hours . ‚ÄúIf implemented they will cause--not mitigate--the systemic risk they seek to prevent.‚Äù The report warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and DeFi have ‚Äúreached a critical mass,‚Äù with investor protection becoming a ‚Äúsignificant concern for regulators.‚Äù Source: Michael Egorov Perkins pushed back against the BIS‚Äô claim that DeFi presents significant challenges, arguing instead that it represents a ‚Äúsignificant improvement‚Äù over the ‚Äúopacity‚Äù and imbalances of the traditional financial system. Related: Crypto industry is not experiencing regulatory capture ‚Äî Attorney Responding to the BIS‚Äôs concern about the anonymity of DeFi developers, Perkins questioned its relevance: ‚ÄúSorry, but when was the last time a TradFi company published a list of its developers? Sure, public companies provide a degree of disclosures and transparency, but they seem to be dying off in favor of private markets.‚Äù Perkins also critiqued the BIS‚Äôs concern around stablecoins that it could lead to ‚Äúmacroeconomic instability in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf there is demand for USD stablecoins and it helps improve the condition of anyone in the developing world, perhaps that is a good thing,‚Äù Perkins said. Source: Christopher Perkins Perkins wasn‚Äôt alone in criticizing the controversial report. Lightspark co-founder Christian Catalini also weighed in, posting a series of critiques on X that same day.

43559042,https://nulltx.com/?p=148119,1745124264,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Token Burn Events: A Key Strategy in Crypto Supply Management,https://nulltx.com/token-burn-events-a-key-strategy-in-crypto-supply-management/,"A common practice in the world of cryptocurrency is token burning , which aims to reduce the overall circulating supply of a digital asset. When a digital asset‚Äôs supply is decreased, the price of that asset may increase, benefiting holders of the token. These events, however, do not guarantee immediate price jumps and could even be considered a market manipulative tool for projects that do not have strong fundamentals. In the last few years, however, strong projects with solid fundamentals have conducted meaningful burn events. Here are some of them. Recent Burn Events Across Prominent Crypto Assets In the past few months, several major cryptocurrencies have been engaged in token burning, with some involving large amounts of their fully diluted valuations (FDV). Here‚Äôs a look at the most significant burns that have happened lately. $BGB ‚Äì A Massive Burn on April 17th On April 17, 2025, a leading digital asset in the market, the $BGB token, burned a quite remarkable 2.55% of its FDV. It is nearly 2.5 times the amount of mendacity needed to get on a billionaire‚Äôs radar. Now, this is a part of the show where, ordinarily, I might try to stick a little price forecast in there for good measure, but to be honest, the $BGB token has such a strong community that the result could very easily steer the asset in an upward trajectory. $BNB ‚Äì Consistent Burn Strategy Continues Binance Coin ($BNB), the native token of the Binance ecosystem, has a firm handshake with token burns. On April 16, 2025, Binance burned tokens right in front of their noses‚Äîa burn that, when added up, took out 1.00% of the token‚Äôs FDV. Now, of course, this is the Future Development Value we‚Äôre talking about, and some observers are putting the number to the tune of $800 million for what Binance actually burned. Noting that since the next FDV is never quite the same as the last, our tokenomics friends over at Binance have kept the price level fortuitously stable and increased the runway for long-term growth. And they do this with a wink and a smile. Recent Token Burn Events Token burns help reduce supply and can support price growth. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the latest burn events with % of FDV: $BGB ‚Äì 2.55% of FDV burned on Apr 17 $BNB ‚Äì 1.00% of FDV burned on Apr 16 $ORCA ‚Äì 30.5% of FDV burned on Apr 16 $OSMO ‚Äì 0.01% of‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/BjvxzWB84m ‚Äî CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 18, 2025 $ORCA ‚Äì A Major Reduction in FDV Maybe one of the most zesty burns in current memory happened on April 16, 2025, when the $ORCA token underwent a burn of a staggering 30.5% of its FDV. In terms of amount, in relation to the current circulating supply, and in relation to what it might mean for the short-term and long-term price movements of the token, this is a very big deal. It‚Äôs also obviously a very rare deal. So when something this significant happens, it‚Äôs only natural for investors to start thinking about the underlying reason for such a drastic move. $OSMO ‚Äì A Modest Burn in March On March 9, 2025, the token $OSMO, which powers the decentralized exchange Osmosis, burned only 0.01% of its FDV. Given the current conditions of the crypto economy, this is a comparatively low percentage for a token to be burning. And unlike many other projects that are deflationary by design, $OSMO is not: ‚ÄúUnlike other deflationary tokens, OSMO inflation isn‚Äôt motivated by market arbitrage opportunities; there aren‚Äôt external OSMO governance tokens waiting to be minted that will drive up the price of OSMO. In fact, the only motivation we have for burning OSMO right now is to make OSMO worth more over time.‚Äù $BORG ‚Äì A Tiny Burn with Potential Implications On March 5, 2025, the $BORG token had a tiny burn event, with just 0.04% of its FDV getting taken out of the circulating supply. For context, 0.04% of 67 million is about 28,000. The amount isn‚Äôt large enough to visibly impact price or supply in any meaningful way, but again, it is about the principle of providing the appearance and reassurance that a small, as of yet, not super significant project like $BORG is managing its token well. $CAKE ‚Äì A Significant Burn in February Conducted on February 27, 2025, 4.04% was reduced from PancakeSwap‚Äôs native token FDV due to its most recent token burn. This is one of the more prominent and significant fires happening lately‚Äîhappening in an exchange environment that is serving up a native token to a user base that is poised to notice disappearances in the supply of that token (in this case, by 4.04%). $QUBIC ‚Äì A Smaller Burn to Manage Supply On February 19, 2025, the $QUBIC token witnessed a minuscule 0.08% of its FDV being burned. While this sounds insignificant, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction for maintaining the supply of the token and introducing a little more scarcity into the ecosystem. And when it comes to positive price action, that‚Äôs the direction you want to head in. The Strategic Importance of Token Burns Even though there is a correction in the market currently, we believe it is a great time for HBAR to bring in more people to its ecosystem. We also congratulate HBAR Foundation for conducting HBAR token burns to reduce the number of circulating tokens. Following that, we profess $HBAR is an even more attractive investment option in comparison to many of its direct competitors. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin was stuck between $84,000 and $85,000, while Ethereum was hovering near its lowest point in months. This article provides a forecast for some of the top-performing coins like JasmyCoin (JASMY), Fartcoin, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), and Gala Games (GALA). Jasmy price prediction JASMY price chart | TradingView JasmyCoin is a top cryptocurrency often seen as Japan‚Äôs Bitcoin. It is a mid-cap token that is popular among traders. The Jasmy price bottomed at $0.00826 this month and has slowly made a comeback to the current $0.01538. The rebound happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a highly popular bullish sign in technical analysis. This pattern comprises of two descending and converging trendlines, with a comeback happening when they near their confluence. Jasmy price has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average, and is nearing the key resistance point at $0.01615, the lowest swing in November this year. Therefore, the coin has likely bottomed, and will continue rising, with the next point to watch being at $0.020, the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement point. A break above that level will signal more gains to the psychological point at $0.25. However, a drop below $0.013 will invalidate the bullish sign. Fartcoin price analysis FARTCOIN chart by TradingView Fartcoin has emerged as one of the most popular Solana meme coins in the crypto market. After bottoming at $0.1940 in February, the token rebounded to $0.8530. Fartcoin price has remained above the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pointed upwards. This rebound happened after the token formed a cup and handle pattern, comprising of a rounded bottom and some consolidation. The cup has a depth of approximately 70%, indicating that its primary target is $1.0722. This target is derived by measuring 70% from the cup‚Äôs upper side. It is also the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Read more: Fartcoin price prediction: is this the best Solana meme coin to buy? Gala price technical analysis GALA chart by TradingView Gala is one of the top gaming networks in the crypto industry. Some of the top games in its ecosystem are Town Star, Sweep it Poker, Champions Arena, and Treasure Tapper. Gala price peaked at $0.072 in November as most cryptocurrencies surged. It has then pulled back, moving to its a low of $0.01190, close to its lowest level on record. Gala Games token has formed a falling wedge pattern whose two lines are about to converge. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have formed a bullish divergence pattern. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising, with the initial target to watch being at $0.02620, the 23.6% retracement level. A drop below the support at $0.01120 will invalidate the bullish view. FET price prediction FET chart by TradingView The FET token dropped to a low of $0.3585 earlier this month and has since bounced back to its current price of $0.5700. It has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average, while the RSI and the MACD have pointed upwards. The next point to watch will be at $0.6970, which coincides with the lowest swing on August 5. This price was also the giant double-bottom point whose neckline was at $2.235. A break above that level will raise the possibility of it rising to the psychological point at $1.

43559153,https://nulltx.com/?p=148118,1745124498,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Movements in the Memecoin Market on April 18, 2025: A Day of Outflows",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-movements-in-the-memecoin-market-on-april-18-2025-a-day-of-outflows/,"The memecoin market saw a strong imbalance between inflows and outflows. On-chain activities from smart money indicated they were taking more capital out than putting in. Total volume on the day was only $10.28 million, yet net outflow was a stark $5.16 million‚Äîand seems to suggest a shift in sentiment away from at least some memecoins. That said, some projects classified as memecoins still seem to be pulling in positive inflows. So not all of them are seeing activity that suggests the merry memecoin days are over. Inflow vs. Outflow: A Day of Imbalance Although total inflows came to $2.56 million, outflows were almost three times greater, with $7.72 million departing the market. This was a period when there seemed to be more capital leaving than entering, and that could have been a cautious signal from traders or, more likely, could have been profit-taking behavior in a sector that‚Äôs known for its volatility. Some tokens, despite the market being generally down, found ways to attract new inflows. Take, for instance, $PNUT, $MTN, and $DARK: these were some of the only tokens in crypto that saw any capital inflows. But even they were insufficient to counteract the wave of outflows in the memecoin space. The overall net volume, which was negative at -$5.16 million, was an evident sign of the market not having any significant positive momentum. This showed that there was more selling pressure than buying pressure in the memecoin sector. A potential reflection of the cyclical nature of the memecoin market, with its rapid surges and sharp corrections. Tokens with Positive Inflows: Selective Interest Amidst the Downturn Even when the overall trend is down, some tokens manage to see money coming into them. One of those is $PNUT, a relatively high-profile memecoin at the moment, which saw its capital inflow amount to a hefty $837,000. What does this mean? It could mean investor confidence or even speculative interest in what could be an imminent breakout, as $PNUT is a token whose price could move heavily in one direction or the other based on the amount of social media buzz it is currently generating. Other tokens that received fresh inflows included $MTN, which saw fresh investments totaling $83K; $DARK, which attracted $93K; and smaller amounts into #CHILLGUY ($40K) and $BLOCK ($36K). Investing in these tokens seems much more contained and the amounts much smaller compared to conventional targets. Still, the fresh interest in them is undeniable. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 18/04/25 Yesterday, there was more outflow than inflow Inflow: $2.56M Outflow: $7.72M Volume: $10.28M Net Volume: -$5.16M There was inflow into: $PNUT ($837K) $MTN ($83K) $DARK ($93K) #CHILLGUY ($40K) $BLOCK ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KqGZmvVdNX ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 19, 2025 These inflows suggest that while the memecoin market as a whole might be cooling, certain projects are still attracting niche investors or traders looking for the next big thing. The selective nature of these inflows seems to indicate that traders are being more cautious and returning to a core approach that evaluates opportunities across a smaller range of tokens. Tokens with Notable Outflows: Signs of Profit-Taking and Caution Conversely, a number of tokens experienced significant outflows, which overshadowed the day‚Äôs other activities. The largest outflow hit $FARTCOIN, which saw a huge $4.30 million exit the market. This enormous withdrawal was almost certainly due to profit-taking, especially given the absolutely wild price swings that memecoins tend to have, allowing investors to take profits in a very short time after a huge surge. Significant outflows were seen from other tokens as well, with $WIF, for instance, seeing $139K leave, $JLP experiencing $660K in outflows, and $POPCAT parting with $832K. Again, while it‚Äôs not clear why any one token or another would see outflows, the fact that several in this group do is telling. Either investors are pulling back on the group as a whole or reallocating to something else. Outflows of this nature could be due to traders lessening their exposure in the wake of recent volatility or simply adhering to a market trend that‚Äôs seeing a lot of cautiousness and not much enthusiasm. Whatever the reason, traders seem to be pulling back on their volume with us and are seemingly also pulling back with their volume in the market overall. Looking Ahead: The Future of the Memecoin Market The memecoin market‚Äôs unpredictable characteristics make it hard to forecast whether these outflows will persist or if the inflows into certain tokens will start to reverse the trend. As it stands, the inflows‚Äô selectivity suggests that while memecoins‚Äô appeal hasn‚Äôt waned, investors are now somewhat pickier about which short-lived fads they‚Äôre investing in. It‚Äôs also possible that the current outflow period is part of a larger correction phase within the memecoin sector, where traders are consolidating before re-entering the market. Looking ahead, those who follow the market will be watching very closely to see how well tokens like $PNUT, $MTN, and $DARK perform. Can they keep the kind of momentum going that they‚Äôve got now? If they can and if we‚Äôre not in a totally downsliding market (which we only kind of are, as of this writing), then these tokens might give us a signal that there‚Äôs a new trend in the memecoin space. If, on the other hand, the total market is just sliding downhill, then inflows won‚Äôt matter much, and we can forget about life under the bridge as a way for these tokens to signal anything. So, here‚Äôs to hoping. The defining characteristic of the memecoin space continues to be volatility, and traders should be ready for abrupt mood swings in the market. Can the market shift back to a bullish trend, or will outflows keep dominating? It almost certainly will depend on two main factors: macroeconomic conditions and the actions of key players in the space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Analyst Says Bitcoin Uptrend Remains Intact,https://cryptopotato.com/135k-in-sight-analyst-says-bitcoin-uptrend-remains-intact/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again reclaimed the $85,000 level, the eighth time this week it has touched this comfort zone according to CoinGecko. But don‚Äôt be fooled by the sideways slumber. According to market watcher Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish structure is ‚Äústill intact,‚Äù with a Fibonacci-based target of $135,000 still in play for 2025. The $135K Prophecy The analyst insists that even if BTC pulls back to key support, the megatrend remains bullish. ‚ÄúThe path to higher highs is still open,‚Äù he posted . His bold prediction? Bitcoin is first eyeing $107,000, followed by a launch to $135,000, with or without short-term correction. In another post, he highlighted that the cryptocurrency was ‚Äúprogressing within a megaphone pattern,‚Äù a broadening formation with at least two higher highs and two lower lows, indicating increasing volatility and potential trend reversals. In his estimation, if history repeats, BTC could go up to $186,500, reflecting historical trends where the cryptocurrency‚Äôs megaphone formations preceded significant price movements, such as the 2017 peak near $20,000 followed by a correction. However, there‚Äôs a catch. According to the trader, Bitcoin remains stuck below the Ichimoku Kumo Cloud, a stubborn resistance zone that has capped upward momentum. Adding to the tension, the Easter weekend is expected to sap liquidity from the markets, raising the risk of erratic price swings in crypto. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has oscillated between $84,366 and $85,398, reflecting a market caught between accumulation and exhaustion. Zooming out, the seven-day performance shows a slight 2.1% uptick, which was still good enough to outperform the broader crypto market, down 0.8% in the same period. Whales Swarm Meanwhile, as retail traders watch the sideways action in frustration, whales and sharks are in a feeding frenzy, with Santiment reporting that wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC now control a record high 67.77% of the asset‚Äôs supply. Since March 22, these deep-pocketed investors have scooped up more than 53,600 BTC worth more than $4.5 billion, with the latest move being a $250 million buy-in, just hours before Bitcoin breached $85,000, sparking speculation of an incoming supply squeeze. Adding fuel to the fire, macro investor Kyle Chasse pointed to a $106.7 trillion liquidity surge from central banks, suggesting it could push Bitcoin into overdrive. ‚ÄúBITCOIN IS NEXT,‚Äù he declared , framing the number one cryptocurrency as a hedge against fiat debasement. The asset now stands at a pivotal junction. The ingredients for a rally are all there: whale accumulation, bullish technicals, and a potential liquidity boom. Still, the $85,000 resistance refuses to break. The post $135K in Sight?

43560243,https://nulltx.com/?p=148117,1745126594,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Circle Launches Refund Protocol for Onchain Dispute Resolution and $USDC Refunds,https://nulltx.com/circle-launches-refund-protocol-for-onchain-dispute-resolution-and-usdc-refunds/,"Circle , the issuer of the widely used $USDC stablecoin , has just rolled out a new feature designed to heighten the security and flexibility of on-chain transactions. The Refund Protocol allows for non-custodial refunds and a mostly on-chain dispute resolution process for payments made in $USDC. The Refund Protocol might represent the next step in the evolution of how digital currencies are exchanged. Enhancing on-chain transaction security, in any and every way possible, seems key to reaching the ‚Äútrustless‚Äù ideal proposed by early proponents of Bitcoin. Yet central to any ‚Äútrustless‚Äù exchange is a vision of a world in which on-chain, and by extension off-chain, transactions can be carried out without relying on any centralized intermediary. A range of key features characterizes the Refund Protocol. For one, it offers transparent, programmable escrow. If a buyer and seller can‚Äôt agree on a refund, then the Refund Protocol lets them engage the services of a non-custodial arbiter. Both of these features, I would argue, make it possible to handle refunds in a way that respects the trust-minimized nature of blockchain systems. This is important not only for the protocol‚Äôs users but also for the appearance and reality of stablecoins, which are (or ought to be) secure and transparent. Enhancing Trust with Programmable Escrow and Dispute Mediation The Refund Protocol‚Äôs standout feature is programmable escrow. In conventional payment systems, when buyers and sellers have to resolve disputes or request a refund, they rely on banks or third-party processors. The Refund Protocol, however, replaces these intermediaries with blockchain-based solutions that are promising in their transparency and security. Thanks to smart contracts, the Refund Protocol can hold funds in escrow until any disputes tied to the transaction are resolved. The system of smart contracts is clear and verifiable, and it lets one see at any time where the funds are. Both parties to a transaction can see the payment progress. The system does away with the need to trust some third party, and it certainly gives one more control over the funds, even in the event of a dispute. An important part of the system is the process used to resolve disputes, which Circle has designed to be managed by non-custodial arbiters. These arbiters act as neutral parties, step in when there‚Äôs a disagreement between users, and do so in a manner that ensures all resolutions are fair and transparent. Using non-custodial arbiters eliminates any potential bias or corruption that could arise with centralized mediators, and it also facilitates a sort of trustless resolution that is, in my opinion, a critical part of any system that is really trying to embody the ideals of a ‚Äúbanking with the unbanked‚Äù platform. Circle Launches Refund Protocol for Onchain Dispute Resolution and $USDC Refunds! @Circle has introduced Refund Protocol, a smart contract system enabling non-custodial refunds and onchain dispute resolution for #stablecoin payments‚Äîbringing trustless protections to real-world‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) April 18, 2025 Other key features of the system include non-custodial arbiters. These are neutral parties who step in when there‚Äôs a disagreement between users, and they do so in a fair and transparent manner. Early Withdrawals with Sender Approval Besides having the features of escrow and dispute mediation, the Refund Protocol allows early and sender-approved withdrawals. This is especially useful in the not-so-rare instances when a buyer wants to retrieve his or her funds before a dispute has been resolved. And it is one more way the Protocol helps to ensure that transactions are fair and mutually agreed upon. This flexibility can offer a major edge over conventional systems in which getting a hold of your money‚Äîin the form of a withdrawal or refund, say‚Äîis often a protracted and legally befuddling affair. The Refund Protocol allows users to access their funds faster in times when they need them and, as with all things blockchain, with an assured level of safety and transparency that‚Äôs downright enviable. The Refund Protocol draws on the expertise of Inflowpay, a company that works with payments, and knows well the ins and outs of payment processing systems. Inflowpay handles payment disputes and refunds in a decentralized manner, and its knowledge and experience have been instrumental in helping Circle develop the Refund Protocol. A Step Forward for Stablecoin Payments For users of $USDC and other stablecoins, the Refund Protocol marks a major step forward in securing on-chain payments. Although stablecoins like $USDC have long been a trusted tool for transferring value on the blockchain, the introduction of the Refund Protocol significantly upgrades the safety and security of stablecoin transactions. Circle is addressing a major user concern in the crypto space‚Äîsecurity‚Äîby providing non-custodial refunds and dispute resolution that‚Äôs trustless. The Refund Protocol has been developed in accordance with the most secure coding practices, making it a safe and efficient system. The protocol is not merely a research paper; it has already been implemented and tested within decentralized applications. We feel confident enough with the underlying code to release the Refund Protocol as an open-source project. It can be found here. Under its new Refund Protocol, Circle is setting a new standard for how stablecoins can be used in the real-world applications of today. This feature not only builds trust among users but also gives broader ballast to the adoption of $USDC in the wider financial ecosystem. After all, stablecoin transactions still largely have to pass through the existing banking system‚Äîby one means or another‚Äîso the use of $USDC in the actual payment transactions of today is as close to a banking-free payment system as one can get. Although the crypto world is ever growing, it is clear that Circle is making its way into the upper echelons of the most exciting and innovative companies. Why? Because it‚Äôs not only making USDC a valuable and reliable digital currency, but it‚Äôs also bringing it and its parent company directly to the forefront of Web 3.0.

As part of the unlock, 40 million tokens were released today‚Äîrepresenting 20% of the total circulating supply. The unlock‚Äôs current price is roughly $311 million, which is part of the reason why market observers are wondering about the price and liquidity of the token over the next few days. Though the direct response has so far been even-keeled, the situation with $TRUMP continues to change. Today‚Äôs unlock is just one part of a complex larger strategy involving not just $TRUMP but also the whole ecosystem being built around it. Despite this being the largest single release so far‚Äîsomething like 600,000 tokens‚Äîthe price of $TRUMP is down only 5% at midday. Daily Unlocks and the Pressure on $TRUMP The token unlock that occurred recently has shed light on the $TRUMP token‚Äôs daily operations. Along with 40 million tokens that were available for use today, we have learned that there are daily releases of 493,150 $TRUMP tokens ‚Äî a number worth around $3.79 million if you take the current market price as gospel. We are led to understand that the price of $TRUMP could be negatively affected in the near term by this ongoing supply pressure, as the S&P 493,000 Club keeps getting more members (i.e., as S&P 493,000 Club members keep getting $3.79 million worth of $TRUMP tokens daily). But the market is handling this relatively well without any signs of instability. Trump‚Äôs Memecoin Just Unlocked $300M TRUMP‚Äì What‚Äôs Next for $TRUMP ? The official token unlock for Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin #TRUMP is now complete! 40 MILLION $TRUMP tokens just got unlocked today ‚Äî that's 20% of the total circulating supply, worth around $311M at today‚Äôs‚Ä¶ https://t.co/N1aWoiWlvq pic.twitter.com/uhkuoT1Qgg ‚Äî Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) April 18, 2025 Now stands at just under 200 million tokens (199,999,976.64 to be exact), the total circulating supply of $TRUMP means that the token faces continuous selling pressure unless demand increases significantly. Coupled with daily unlocks, this sizable supply necessitates that price appreciation be characterized by increases in demand rather than decreases in supply. Interestingly, even though a considerable number of tokens were unlocked today, the price fell by only about 5%. This suggests that demand for $TRUMP is likely still strong enough to soak up all those new tokens. Now, normally, when a large quantity of tokens is released, it‚Äôs a sell signal for memecoins, like, say, $TRUMP. Yet despite market conditions that would typically send a memecoin‚Äôs price tumbling, the price of $TRUMP remains surprisingly stable. A Memecoin with a Real World Tie: Trump Plans a Dinner for Holders The $TRUMP token is not only associated with the political figure of Donald Trump, but it is also tied to interesting real-world incentives. An event is being planned‚Äîat least, that‚Äôs the word circulating‚Äîfor $TRUMP token holders. A recent price surge has been attributed to this expected announcement. Prices were up nearly 12% today, as excitement around the project has evidently been ramped up. The team behind the project seems to be in the process of making a dedicated webpage for the event, though it remains unclear what kind of event (if any) is actually in the pipeline. Market News: Trump Plans a Dinner for TRUMP Holders According to market rumors, @realDonaldTrump plans to host a dinner for $TRUMP token holders, and the team is working on a dedicated webpage for the event. As a result, $TRUMP has surged 12% today, bringing its current‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/43MRwvO3z7 ‚Äî Followin (@followin_io) April 19, 2025 A dinner might be an effective marketing strategy for the Trump token, aimed at building a loyal community of holders. It could also at least temporarily rev up interest in the token. By associating a real-world event with the digital currency, Trump and team are making a personal appeal that might resonate with potential investors. Memecoins often live or die by the strength of the communities around them and the viral nature of events associated with them. A dinner for holders of the Trump token, then, could be a way to pump up the price of that token. At present, the token‚Äôs market cap is elevated and resting at $1.69 billion. This mix of online and offline engagement is about as unique as it gets and could help keep $TRUMP in the public‚Äôs eye. The token unlock was a test of sorts for the market and for $TRUMP, and every indication was that the test had been passed. The Future of $TRUMP: A Balancing Act of Supply and Demand The future of $TRUMP depends on its ability to hold the line between two forces: ever-present supply pressure from daily unlocks and demand that‚Äôs generated by the community and real-world incentives. Sure, a dinner for token holders is something that could create some buzz and stir some interest in the project. But I think the long-term survival of $TRUMP is far more contingent on the absorption capacity of the wider market for the daily influx of new tokens. One factor to watch is how the market reacts as the daily unlocks continue. If the demand for $TRUMP continues to rise, the token might be able to hold its value or even appreciate over time despite the steady stream of new tokens. However, if demand fails to keep pace with the daily releases, the token could experience downward pressure in the coming months. Currently, the attention of investors seems to be squarely on $TRUMP, and with a market cap of $1.69 billion, it‚Äôs obvious that the project has, at the very least, booked some time on the crypto runway. Whether its price will keep climbing, or even stay at this level, is anybody‚Äôs guess. But with daily token releases and a few upcoming, potentially headline-making events (like Trump dining with some select guests), $TRUMP will remain a topic of conversation in the crypto space.

This hasn‚Äôt been a quiet week for on-chain activity from Galaxy. Blockchain data shows that in recent days, the firm has taken almost $78 million in SOL off centralized exchanges while putting $98 million worth of ETH onto those same exchanges. ùóúùòÄ ùóöùóÆùóπùóÆùòÖùòÜ ùóóùó∂ùó¥ùó∂ùòÅùóÆùóπ ùó±ùòÇùó∫ùóΩùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóòùóßùóõ ùó≥ùóºùóø ùó¶ùó¢ùóü? ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) April 19, 2025 This morning, just 30 minutes before this writing, a wallet tied to Galaxy Digital removed another 145,999 SOL, worth about $19.5 million, from Binance.

According to onchain data, Galaxy has‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/n7C9IP3IYE ‚Äî SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) April 18, 2025 This pattern has not gone unnoticed. Analysts, traders, and the wider crypto community are now questioning whether Galaxy Digital is up to something. Is it executing a deliberate rotation out of Ethereum and into Solana? Could it be placing a bet on what might well be the next dominant smart contract platform? The Data Behind the Moves Over the course of one week, Galaxy Digital has sent out 72,781 ETH ‚Äî worth about $98 million ‚Äî to a number of different crypto exchanges. Generally, this kind of inflow tends to announce an upcoming liquidation or rebalancing act. To keep us on our toes, meanwhile, the same firm has been taking the opposite tack with SOL and pulling that crypto off of platforms like Binance and others. Those SOL now seem to be stashed in what can only be described as long-term custody wallets. These are big moves. When institutions shift this kind of capital, it is usually for very good reasons. So what unifies all of these deals above? First, they involve big sums of tied-up capital. Second, they all look to affect the same thing: increase the amount of Solana tied up in the Solana ecosystem (even if ‚Äòecosystem‚Äô means just one of the things that you can do in it, like looking at an NFT). You might even call this a coordinated Solana effort on the part of Galaxy and its friends. Observers in the industry are also looking at the behavior of institutions to understand what is happening. They are saying that what has been going on in the market is the result of institutions behaving in a certain way. At the same time, a lot of criticism is being directed at Ethereum from various quarters. And it‚Äôs not criticism that‚Äôs emerging as a result of any technological shortcomings that Ethereum has (there‚Äôs a lot of debate about whether or not Ethereum has any such shortcomings; I‚Äôll get into that in a second). Instead, the criticism seems to be mostly coming from stagnation in the scaling that Ethereum is achieving, in the network‚Äôs being able to handle increased demand, and also, in the network‚Äôs just being very expensive to use when demand is high. It‚Äôs not just Galaxy Digital that is losing patience with ETH. Other venture capital firms and institutional investors have also started reallocating funds or hedging their Ethereum exposure. Reallocating funds usually means venture capital firms and institutional investors are no longer bullish on an asset. Strategic Rotation or Tactical Hedge? It is yet to be seen if Galaxy Digital‚Äôs actions signal a shift in the firm‚Äôs long-term, strategic vision or if they are just a shorter-term hedge. The firm has taken its share of hard falls over the last couple of years and has rebounded nicely lately, with a prime opportunity narrative of Solana. With Solana‚Äôs Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) really picking up steam, new dApps, token launches, and ecosystem grants are revitalizing user interest on the Solana network. And with Solana again becoming a liquidity magnet, the prime opportunists over at Galaxy Digital seem to have taken a renewed interest in Solana. It is also worth mentioning that Galaxy possesses a substantial framework for managing on-chain assets, allowing it to shift large amounts of capital with relative ease and speed. Beyond that notable detail, the mix of ETH going into exchanges and the firm‚Äôs accumulation of SOL suggests a firm not just passively reallocating capital but actively betting on where it sees near-term and possibly mid-term upside. Currently, there is no public position from Galaxy Digital confirming or denying these intentions. But the blockchain tells a story that many in the industry are interpreting as a vote of confidence in Solana‚Äôs future ‚Äî and a warning sign that even major institutions may be growing weary of Ethereum‚Äôs current trajectory. Traders and analysts will be watching closely for more signs as this story continues to unfold. Whether Galaxy‚Äôs pivot turns out to be an early smart move or a high-stakes gamble, one thing is for certain: the institutions are not sitting still in a market that never sleeps.

It has crypto community members raising eyebrows for what seems to be a controlled liquidity maneuver ‚Äî a sell-off of sorts. The project team has apparently divested 23.45 million $MELANIA tokens over the past month, and it did so in a way that shouldn‚Äôt have affected the price much. Yet the team‚Äôs been using (or has been rumored to be using) some sketchy tactics to make it seem like the token‚Äôs going places when it‚Äôs really just, um, not. Meteora liquidity operations have mostly been conducted from the other side of the price pool, allowing sales of up to 50% of MELANIA without large-sell alerts being triggered. One downside to this approach is that it pushes the price paid per MELANIA up, but that‚Äôs a downside in the context of this activity being a sale to generate funds to pay for other aspects of the project, like team salaries. So why not just sell to the buy side? Because that would trigger a public sell alert on-chain, and nobody wants to be perceived as dumping their own project‚Äôs token. Gradual Sell-Off Raises Transparency Concerns The most recent activity occurred just seven hours ago, when the team transferred yet another 2.95 million $MELANIA tokens from its reserves. It sold this latest batch for 9,009 SOL ‚Äî worth around $1.2 million. As with the previous token transfers, this one is being recorded in a pseudonymous fashion. And ‚Äî again, with this latest transfer ‚Äî liquidity is being added in such a manner that the $MELANIA tokens are being sold in a kind of automated process as they are needed. And what‚Äôs really weird is that this was done in a range between a token price of 0.025 and 0.040 SOL. 7 Â∞èÊó∂ÂâçÔºåÂèàÊúâ 295 ‰∏áÊûö $MELANIA Ë¢´È°πÁõÆÊñπ‰ª•Ê∑ªÂä†ÂçïËæπÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßÁöÑÂΩ¢ÂºèÂá∫ÂîÆÊàê 9,009 Êûö SOL ($1.2M)„ÄÇ ËøáÂéª 3 Â§©ÈáåÔºå$MELANIA È°πÁõÆÊñπÁªßÁª≠‰ªéÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßË∑üÁ§æÂå∫Âú∞ÂùÄËΩ¨Âá∫ 764.3 ‰∏áÊûö $MELANIA ($3.21M)ÔºåÁÑ∂ÂêéÂú® Meteora ‰∏äÊ∑ªÂä†Âà∞ MELANIA/SOL ÂçïËæπÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßÔºåÂ∞Ü $MELANIA Âú®ËÆæÂÆöÂå∫Èó¥Âá∫ÂîÆÊàê SOL„ÄÇ ÂÖ∂‰∏≠ 295 ‰∏áÊûö‚Ä¶ https://t.co/DCOMFOsGfz pic.twitter.com/zL2rIeTqOB ‚Äî ‰ΩôÁÉ¨ (@EmberCN) April 19, 2025 This is not a singular occurrence.

This constant sell-side pressure has funneled into accounts holding a cumulative total of 110,000 SOL, now worth around $14.75 million. Although this liquidity management isn‚Äôt necessarily bad or malicious, it ain‚Äôt good, either, when the team behind the project failed to relayed just what the hell their intentions were with the gathering of SOL. The investors and community members are starting to wonder if this liquidity action is a clever way to build a treasury or if it‚Äôs really a prolonged exit strategy in disguise. Market Impact and Community Reactions The ongoing liquidity injections have yet to make much of a dent in the price, and for this, we can thank the well-practiced team behind the project. They are selling tokens in a way that won‚Äôt get too many people too riled up in the short term‚Äîspreading sales across liquidity bands so as not to cause big on-chain price movements, for one. It‚Äôs almost like they are trying not to distribute the news that they are, in fact, distributing the tokens. Some community members view this as a treasury strategy that is far from erratic. They see it as an intentional, well-thought-out, and well-planned treasury strategy. They see it as an intentional move to build up reserves. They believe those reserves are going to be used for what I would call traditional development or marketing efforts. Others, however, see this as an outright betrayal of early supporters‚Äîa sellout, if you will. They see refusing to sell tokens as a kind of loyalty oath‚Äîand they see violating that loyalty oath as a precursor to The Flag of Cashing Out. The team‚Äôs silence adds fuel to the speculation. Officially, as of now, there has been no statement from the $MELANIA project concerning the 110,000 SOL that have been accumulated. What is their purpose? And more importantly, what is the long-term ecosystem plan, if there is one, for the token? Critics contend that if this is part of a strategic roadmap, the team should be clear with the community, especially considering how much value has been pulled from the liquidity pools in the last month. A couple of analysts have even started to draw parallels with other projects that have used comparable techniques and then, over time, shut down. At this point, the project‚Äôs wallets still hold large reserves, and the regular flow of $MELANIA into liquidity pools shows no immediate signs of abating. Traders and holders are left in a state of uncertainty, watching closely, questioning motives, and waiting for some clarity. As always in the world of cryptocurrency, when something happens and how openly it is communicated are of paramount importance. If the happening is not communicated in a timely manner, then those who should know may find out much too late. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to Farina, XRP‚Äôs fully diluted value reached $208.4 billion, overtaking Ethereum‚Äôs $192.5 billion. Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, is a stern XRP fan. This significant milestone matches his predictions that XRP will soon overtake Ethereum. Notably, this development comes after XRP outperformed Ethereum for five consecutive months . According to Farina, this is evidence that ‚Äúthe flip has already begun.‚Äù BREAKING: $XRP üëë has officially surpassed ETH in Fully Diluted Market Cap!

Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP‚Äôs supply in escrow, which keeps its market cap lower despite growing interest and usage. The fully diluted market cap considers the total supply of a token, not just what is currently circulating.

Experts have long projected that XRP will eventually overtake ETH . Now, with XRP outperforming Ethereum for over five months straight‚Äîthe longest stretch since both tokens have coexisted‚Äîthe possibility of a full market cap flip is gaining momentum. Ethereum Slowly Losing Ground XRP‚Äôs sustained momentum has been supported by ongoing developments in its ecosystem and increased institutional engagement. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its appeal against Ripple , giving the asset full regulatory clarity and opening the door to increased institutional adoption. Moreover, the broader market appears to be reacting to XRP‚Äôs long-term potential rather than short-term speculation. This contrasts with Ethereum, which, while still dominant in decentralized finance and smart contracts, faces challenges such as scaling issues and high transaction costs that have yet to be fully resolved. At press time, XRP had an FDV of $208.69 billion, while Ethereum had an FDV of $193.59 billion. With Ethereum struggling to stay on top, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it loses its position to XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Across five months, the balance in the wallet has swayed from almost $10 million in profit to just under $10 million in loss; at this moment, a tipped-to-the-side scale between unrealized and realized loss precariously balances the two rather against the backdrop of the very profitable-looking alcoves of $PNUT, $ai16z, and $ARC, now harboring a whale. As per the blockchain data and trading activity analysis, the wallet in question deployed a total of $16.41 million in capital to pile up positions across the three tokens. But things went south quickly, with all three trades now in the red ‚Äî two already closed at a loss and one still open with a substantial floating deficit. Breakdown of the Losses: A Pricey Crypto Experiment Most of this whale‚Äôs capital went to $PNUT. The investor spent about $9.12 million to assemble a position at an average cost of $0.3448 per token. This move first got analysts‚Äô and retail traders‚Äô eyes, with some taking the buy as a bullish signal from a smart player. However, after weeks of downward price pressure, the wallet threw in the towel and fully exited its $PNUT position just two weeks ago ‚Äî realizing a loss of $4.975 million. Next in line is $ai16z, another heavily backed token in the whale‚Äôs portfolio. For this position, the investor spent $5.6 million to buy in at an average cost of $0.7447. Unlike the $PNUT play, this position remains open, but it has already generated a massive floating loss of $4.58 million. Market watchers have noted that unless the price of $ai16z sees a substantial rebound, the whale may be looking at yet another deep red exit if they choose to close it in the near future. The third and final token in this trilogy is $ARC. This whale entered this position at a cost of $0.2914, deploying $2.77 million in capital. But after market conditions turned against the token, this whale exited the position two months ago, realizing a loss of $426,000. Compared to the other two, this was a smaller bet ‚Äî but still contributed to the overall drawdown. These trades have incurred such damage that now they stand at an astonishing $9.98 million in realized and unrealized losses, reaping a 60 percent decline from the original investment capital.

In reality, though, we have no idea who is behind the address or how it is getting funded, and analysts at this point can only make educated guesses when working through the possibilities. A Stark Reminder of Risk in High-Cap Altcoin Plays Whale wallets are a form of sentiment analysis for many retail traders. If a large player is in a position, he must know something, right? Not necessarily. The recent story of FTX proves that size and even seemingly sophisticated strategies are no guarantee of success. If you follow a whale wallet, you are betting, in a way, on the smarts of a large and presumably informed player. But those bets can go bad in a hurry in crypto. Regardless of if the wallet is owned by Galaxy Digital or another institutional player, the losses show how fast times can change ‚Äî even for whales. The recent market volatility, coupled with the thin liquidity across many altcoins, is now forcing large holders to truly consider their positions. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to manage sizable stakes in many altcoins without a) suffering serious slippage (which is how we got here in the first place), or b) essentially acting as a market maker (which is what large holders usually do when they want to get in or out of a position without causing too much of a scene). Currently, the attention is on the $ai16z position, which is still open. If the token keeps falling, the whale might have to take more losses in the near future. But if the token reverses and the market turns, the whale might have a chance to see some of these losses get reduced. This saga is a powerful warning story‚Äînothing more, nothing less. It warns us not only about the risks of betting on speculative altcoins but also about trusting supposedly infallible whale wallets. Even the biggest players can miscalculate, and when they do, it hurts‚Äîbig time. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

One such tale just emerged from the nascent market for memecoins . An early investor in a new token called $LUCE once sat with $43 million in unrealized profits, but now he‚Äôs looking at a $342,000 paper loss on that same investment. As the value of $LUCE has plummeted in the past week, some have started to question whether the meme-inspired tokens are the next big bubble in crypto. This investor‚Äôs journey began on October 28, 2024, the very day $LUCE was minted. On that day, he purchased 19.14 million tokens, investing a total of five hundred twenty-seven thousand sixty-five dollars. Over the following seventeen days, the token surged in value, skyrocketing by eighty-two times and transforming his investment into an enormous fortune worth over forty-three million dollars. From $43M Profit to -$342K Loss ‚Äì When Diamond Hands Go Wrong 6 months ago, one early investor bought 19.14M $LUCE on the very day it was minted ‚Äî October 28, 2024 ‚Äî investing $527,065. Within 17 days, $LUCE pumped 82x, and his unrealized profit hit a massive $43 MILLION.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/THWeiGsC43 ‚Äî Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) April 19, 2025 The investor didn‚Äôt sell even one token, despite the remarkable gains. He didn‚Äôt even take out his original investment. Encouraged instead‚Äîcertainly, this wall street artist was using the diamond hands philosophy‚Äîthat in hope of even greater returns, one should not sell but should hold on even tighter than before, he surely was holding firm. But the memecoin market is brutal for the holders of tokens who get too caught up in the hype without a clear strategy for when to get out. Six months have passed since then, and $LUCE has plummeted over ninety-eight percent from its all-time high. The same assets that were once worth in the ten million dollar range are now worth something much less than the initial investment. Once the envy of the memecoin world, the wallet now holds a staggering unrealized loss of over three hundred forty-two thousand dollars. When Holding Too Long Goes Wrong The phrase ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù signifies a substantial level of holding an asset during market ups and downs. In the world of crypto, it‚Äôs used to commend those who don‚Äôt sell when the market gets turbulent. While the commendation fits certain assets with a long-term outlook (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), it doesn‚Äôt really fit speculative playthings (almost all tokens not named Bitcoin or Ethereum) that don‚Äôt have any fundamental value and aren‚Äôt going to be around in two, five, or ten years. In this instance, the investor overlooked one of the most fundamental rules of investing: secure your principal when you can. Many seasoned traders counsel retrieving your initial investment as soon as a trade turns profitable, allowing any leftover gains to ride with less emotional baggage. This method keeps the investor from mutable circumstances that make them lose money and provides more freedom to stay calm under the pressure of changing markets. Altogether, it protects the investor from total loss and keeps them on a rational path. Rather than being guided by a rational assessment of the odds, the investor let greed and overconfidence push him around. He held on to every last ounce of a stock during an unsustainable price run-up and left himself utterly and completely naked when the price crashed. And this reversal of fortune wasn‚Äôt just a missed opportunity; it was a collapse that wiped out a huge part of his net worth. Price action like this is common in the memecoin world. Countless tokens have taken the same path: an overly excited launch, huge early profits, and then a sharp turn south as interest and liquidity drain away. Even when they don‚Äôt take profits or rebalance their portfolios, that unrewarded hypothetical just-in-time timing can turn anyone‚Äôs biggest win into a soul-crushing loss overnight. The investor‚Äôs ether was somehow unlocked and then moved, but it wasn‚Äôt because the investor did any of the following: 1. moved any of his $LUCE tokens. 2. showed any signs of profit-taking. 3. made any partial sells. 4. attempted to exit during any smaller retracement. When $LUCE‚Äôs value went down more than 98 percent, this token-holder who was presumably still holding (and now in a 98 percent underwater position) showed no signs of moving or selling. The narrative has travelled far and wide, not as a reason to throw a party, but as a reason to heed the old saw about ‚Äúmaking hay while the sun shines.‚Äù Unsurprising, really, given that traders work under the constant pressure of short time frames and high stakes. Still, it‚Äôs a bit strange for such a collective victory to produce an atmosphere not of jubilation but of dread. But that‚Äôs the way the Bitcoin lightning story has gone so far. The reality is this: what wasn‚Äôt a collective victory for Bitcoin in any obvious sense has become a reason for business writers to swarm. And swarm they have. The crypto world is unpredictable, and it can make fortunes just as quickly as it can lose them. This investor‚Äôs tale highlights the crucial need for a strategy‚Äîexecuted with discipline‚Äîthat can weather these kinds of market storms. Of course, knowing when to get out is part of that strategy. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

They are essential to crypto‚Äôs liquidity landscape, providing the sorts of dollar-pegged assets that facilitate trades and offer safety in otherwise volatile markets. But of late, they‚Äôve been looking a bit less stable‚Äîand for a few pretty plausible reasons. #Stablecoin supply growth remains positive but has softened in recent weeks. As stablecoins serve as core quote assets across crypto markets, this slowdown adds further evidence of a broad contraction in digital asset liquidity and a more risk-off environment. pic.twitter.com/2ccBnwsSzp ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) April 17, 2025 As almost every crypto exchange and trading pair, stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI, have core quote assets. These assets signal capital movement and sentiment. When the supply of these assets is rising, it almost always indicates that an influx of fresh capital is coming into the space and is ready to be deployed into some of the riskier assets. At times when capital isn‚Äôt flowing into the forced reserve stablecoins, we can assume that investors are either pulling capital from the space or sitting in the space waiting for clearer market signals. The recent slowdown in stablecoin supply expansion, while subtle, is adding to accumulating signs that the wider crypto market might be entering a more prudent phase. After a year that was 2024‚Äîspeculatively by the main meme coin manias, AI token rallies, and a deluge of fresh on-chain projects‚Äîthat part of the crypto world seemed more like the deep, blue sea than the promising surf zone. And this is not to even mention at the turn from late 2024 into early 2025 and what might happen to crypto price action and trading volume if the Fed persistently keeps interest rates high. #Stablecoin transaction volume surpassed Visa's payment volume for the first time in 2024 in 2024, according to reports. pic.twitter.com/qLJH5Lg5iH ‚Äî Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) April 17, 2025 Stablecoins Outpace Visa in Transaction Volume Even with this growth slowdown, stablecoins‚Äô influence in international finance appears to be gaining. Reports suggest that, for the first time ever, stablecoins cleared more in payments than the Visa network does in a year. That‚Äôs quite a milestone for an asset class that many in traditional finance still view as a bit of a wild child. But what‚Äôs happening here isn‚Äôt just a crypto thing. This is also about transactions based on U.S. dollars, and stablecoins clearing payment volumes in a dollar-dominated world. Tether (USDT) has seen a 13% increase in users in Q1 2025, showcasing its role as a key financial tool in developing countries facing economic challenges.

This makes them a not-so-secret weapon for not just traders but also businesses, remittance platforms, and individuals wandering through the financial desert of unstable monetary policy. These dollar-backed digital currencies are part of a shift that threatens to take a huge bite out of the payment systems operated by traditional banking giants. Among all stablecoins, Tether (USDT) remains the forerunner in adoption. In the first quarter of 2025, USDT had a user base that increased by 13%‚Äîthat is, a significant leap that indicates growing usefulness in the very sort of places where its sort of decentralized functionality is most desired: developing nations. Those from the developed world who are poor and who are told they might as well stay poor are increasingly using Tether to shield themselves and their families from the sorts of things that make a currency unstable, inflation guaranteed, and financial system collapse all but certain. The expanding utility places stablecoins at a unique intersection of the crypto innovation and real-world financial resilience. While the speculative use cases may ebb and flow, the demand for stable, accessible, and censorship-resistant money remains persistently strong, especially in places where conventional finance fails. But, the macroeconomic headwinds we encounter don‚Äôt just blow against stablecoins; they blow against the whole crypto market and the whole economy. A sustained recession or series of negative quarter-on-quarter GDP reports (which can sometimes happen) can lead to memories of the Great Depression. These are waters the whole crypto market is trying not to tread. The worry among stablecoin issuers is that regulators may restrict the amount of cash that can back a stablecoin. However, a recent report from the International Monetary Fund notes that funds held at banks may not be enough to back all the stablecoins in circulation. If that‚Äôs the case, stablecoins are at another near-death experience. However, at present, stablecoins exemplify how crypto can shake up and make financial systems more accessible. Stablecoins were in the Digital Dollar 1.0 phase. They now meditate on what the next phase looks like. That is why they are here, reading from the same hymnal but acknowledging in their different ways that the agenda must change. In the coming year, the market will be observing intently to determine if the ascent of the stablecoin supply will once again gather steam‚Äîor if this most recent cool-off is a sign of a much longer withdrawal stretching over the whole crypto realm.

This month, 23.8 million $BLUR tokens‚Äîworth about $2.3 million‚Äîwere sent to Coinbase Prime, the institutional arm of the crypto exchange. The transfer is the latest installment in Blur‚Äôs monthly token unlock cycle, which began in mid-2023 and has since become a key factor in the token‚Äôs price behavior and circulating supply. Blur began its token unlock process on June 15, 2023, as part of a larger plan to very slowly and very deliberately bring its full token supply into circulation. Since then, the project has set free a little over a third of its total $BLUR token supply‚Äîabout 1.068 billion tokens (35.6%). Each batch of unlocked tokens has been sent off to Coinbase Prime, which very much suggests that Blur is making these tokens available for trading on the open market. The resulting unlocked tokens had a mind-boggling combined valuation at the point of transfer of an enormous $340 million. This really highlighted the unlock operation‚Äôs scale and made us rethink the token‚Äôs present-value proposition. But alas, here we are: the token‚Äôs trading value today is at $0.096, with the average transfer price being, by my estimate, around $0.318. ‰∏ÄÊúà‰∏ÄËß£ÈîÅÁöÑ Blur Âú® 1 Â∞èÊó∂ÂâçÂ∞ÜÊú¨ÊúàËß£ÈîÅÁöÑ 2380 ‰∏áÊûö $BLUR ($2.3M) ËΩ¨Ëøõ Coinbase Prime„ÄÇ Blur Ëá™ 2023/6/15 ËøõÂÖ•Ëß£ÈîÅÂë®Êúü‰ª•Êù•ÔºåÂ∑≤ÁªèËß£ÈîÅ‰∫Ü 35.6% ÊÄªÈáèÁöÑ BLUR (10.68 ‰∫øÊûö) Âπ∂ËΩ¨Ëøõ Coinbase Prime ËøõÂÖ•Â∏ÇÂú∫ÊµÅÈÄö„ÄÇ ‰ª•Ëß£ÈîÅËΩ¨Âá∫Êó∂ÁöÑ‰ª∑Ê†ºËÆ°ÁÆóÔºå‰ª∑ÂÄº $3.4 ‰∫ø„ÄÇËΩ¨Âá∫Âπ≥Âùá‰ª∑ $0.318ÔºåËÄå BLUR‚Ä¶ https://t.co/rcxFGzufcb pic.twitter.com/MZCGF6E16y ‚Äî ‰ΩôÁÉ¨ (@EmberCN) April 18, 2025 Token Unlocks Pressure Market as Prices Slide The average unlock price compared to the actual market price is getting larger. This emphasizes investor concern. Many in the community argue that the price going down is a direct result of too many unlocked tokens being dumped on the market. We have done quite a few unlocks now, and every one of them is basically creating a supply increase in the market. This is happening alongside demand that hasn‚Äôt really picked up in a major way. Blur‚Äôs strategy for unlocking tokens closely mirrors a familiar crypto project playbook‚Äîgradually releasing tokens held by teams, investors, and communities in a way that (ideally) avoids sudden supply shocks. In practice, though, scheduled unlocks can create problems for a project and its token, particularly in a bear market, or when demand just can‚Äôt keep up with new supply. They‚Äôre a kind of necessary evil in crypto, a way to ensure the people and institutions that helped make a project happen get compensated for their unpaid work and that the project doesn‚Äôt just fall apart. More than one-third of the total $BLUR supply has already been unlocked and is now in circulation, so the next phases of this release schedule have market participants‚Äô full attention. If the trend seen so far continues, significant additional volumes of $BLUR will make their way into the markets over the next few months. The result could be a supply-induced downturn unless the markets can come up with some fresh $BLUR demand or supply-side use cases to absorb the unlocked tokens. Blur, which has zeroed in on NFT marketplace aggregation and DeFi tools, accumulated a lot of hype upon launch and during its early operations. But as the crypto world changes and the speculative juices dry up, it‚Äôs become tougher for the company to keep pumpin‚Äô up investor interest and the value of its token. Blur remains busy running its unlock schedule, which is coming off with what seems to be lots of transparency and consistency. What does this mean for long-term holders of the token? Well, it may be a bit mixed. For institutional players, the predictable inflow of liquidity seems to be coming off fine and dandy, especially with its conjoined partner, Coinbase Prime. Market prices, however, don‚Äôt seem to be validating the token as retail investors and early adopters of this space who have bought in seem to be feeling the pinch. The path forward for $BLUR may rely tremendously on how Blur‚Äôs main offering and community develop. More usefulness, more platform users, or a revival in the NFT market could all steady or reverse the token‚Äôs present course. Until that day, the Blur ecosystem has to make sure that it doesn‚Äôt too freely expand liquidity. If it does, value could start drifting down, and a down market for any token is a distant cousin to the cash cows we do stables in Web3. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Solana (SOL) remains a strong force among Layer-1s, and XRP continues to prove its staying power in institutional finance. Polygon (MATIC), Aptos (APT), and Sei (SEI) are all battling for positioning in an increasingly crowded field. But as the rotation into high-upside plays accelerates, investor focus is shifting toward a new contender. That contender is MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äîand analysts are paying close attention. PRESALE SELLING OUT ‚Äì CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE ‚Äì Still Under the Radar With a 6,250% Potential Climb There‚Äôs a measurable excitement building around MAGACOINFINANCE , but it‚Äôs not based on speculation‚Äîit‚Äôs driven by early investor activity and analyst forecasts. With wallet growth now exceeding 12,500+ holders and visibility on the rise, traders are positioning for what some are calling one of the final early-stage plays left in 2025. Research desks are now pointing to a 6,250% potential climb , using projection models tied to user base growth, market cap potential, and trading activity patterns ahead of major listings. The token is moving fast‚Äîbut not yet priced in by the broader market. This disconnect between valuation and visibility is precisely why experts believe MAGACOINFINANCE could follow the early trajectory of coins like Solana and Aptos before their explosive expansions. THIS IS YOUR 6,250% OPPORTUNITY ‚Äì ACT NOW ‚Äì JOIN EARLY Coin Comparisons Ripple ( XRP) remains relevant in payment rails, but long-term holders acknowledge its growth curve is maturing. Polygon (MATIC) continues to innovate in the scaling sector, though competition is limited upside. Aptos (APT) brings strong performance to Layer-1 infrastructure, yet remains relatively niche in adoption. Sei (SEI), while promising, is still establishing its broader use case. MAGACOINFINANCE is early‚Äînot just in age, but in discovery. That makes the 6,250% forecast notable, especially as momentum indicators begin to mirror the early rise of previous market stars. With investor sentiment rapidly turning toward new narratives, it‚Äôs a standout in a space that‚Äôs often saturated with repeat stories.

Even as Bitcoin attempts rallies, pessimism runs rampant among analysts, who have lost conviction amid the current climate. Yet, diverging sharply from this trembling, AI-driven presale projects such as FloppyPepe are stirring fervor, being heralded by many as the next 100x AI presale token. Market Pulse: Navigating April‚Äôs Tariff Tremors & Crypto Predictions General sentiment across the crypto space continues to be held back by macroeconomic factors, the pending US-China trade war being one of them. This speculation is a direct contributor to massive capital flight from crypto assets as well as Bitcoin ETFs during the earlier part of this month. Although temporary halts to tariff pains provided some relief, the lingering threat of regress keeps markets on edge. adding to overall volatility. The ongoing battle for Bitcoin to firmly sustain gains above $86K is a testament to the considerable surrounding fragility. April‚Äôs trajectory, together with the start of May, looks to be challenging to navigate. Constructive developments surrounding the trade talks might activate a rally, testing Bitcoin‚Äôs upper resistance of $88K-$93K . On the flip side, renewed macro fears might prove detrimental, causing prices to fall to lower support levels of $74K-$78K, significantly devaluing Bitcoin. Hence, the short-term outlook can be defined as a cautious rogue troubled by a high sensitivity level to external news surrounding the economy and geopolitics. FloppyPepe Fever: The AI Token Tagged for 100x Potential Despite the downtrends in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is performing well in presales, earning the label of ‚ÄúAI token‚Äù from some followers, and they are predicting it to have a 100x return. This project combines the AI hype with meme culture and offers huge potential returns. The low entry price drives great expectations for volatility. The presale value for FPPE is $0.0000002, whereas the suggested target for the 100x potential sits at $0.00002. This means that, from a theoretical perspective, there would be huge returns on the original price. The narrative that drives presale popularity is the massive spike projected to follow, which seems possible given the position FloppyPepe holds as a key player between AI and meme culture. FloppyPepe‚Äôs AI Arsenal: Tools, Tokenomics & Audited Trust FloppyPepe is already showcasing some of its AI capabilities and promises not to just be another hollow speculative asset. Its unique components, like FloppyX (an AI video creation tool), as well as meme generators like Meme-o-Matic, which are said to be operational on Telegram, allow users a new level of creativity. They also help to build a collaborative ecosystem with a community around the project. This sets them apart from the traditional focus on meme coins. Coupled with a tech focus is a commitment to security, demonstrated by achieving a successful audit of the SolidProof smart contract, which provides important peace of mind for early investors. The ‚ÄòFloppynomics‚Äô of the project, which include token burning, rewards for holders, and charitable donations, also seek to enhance sustainability. Finding Opportunity Amidst Uncertainty While broader market fear prompts capital flight from some established assets, it simultaneously pushes discerning investors toward specific pockets of innovation. Projects like FloppyPepe , with a strong narrative focus on a trending sector like AI and demonstrable progress via tool launches, can potentially carve their own path. Its specific niche appeal might allow it to capture interest somewhat independently of the macro concerns weighing on Bitcoin, offering a targeted play on technological advancement. Leverage the AI Opportunity: The Case for FloppyPepe‚Äôs Attention-Seizing Presale With fear-mongering often dominating headlines and even Bitcoin taking center stage during times of scrutiny, scanning the landscape for authentic innovation is essential. FloppyPepe offers this opportunity‚Äîan early investment in an AI project leveraging its tools and building momentum during its presale phase. While all presales are riddled with risk, some of these worries are alleviated through FloppyPepe‚Äôs security audit and transparent tokenomic structure. Capitalizing on AI, this presale is unique at $0.0000002, straddling the dangerous intersection of artificial intelligence with the rapidly growing meme community. This is an outstanding opportunity in April for investors looking to ride the growth wedge FloppyPepes offers, especially when compared to other investments less correlated with macro fears. Embrace the FloppyPepe presale now and place yourself strategically amid the seismic shifts dictated by AI advancements in crypto.

In a post on X, SMQKE noted that the SEC must respond to Grayscale‚Äôs XRP spot ETF filing by that day. This deadline has gained significance in light of the recent approval of Teucrium‚Äôs 2x Leveraged XRP ETF . ‚ÄºÔ∏èBREAKING: XRP Spot ETFs Could Get the Green Light by May 22‚ÄºÔ∏è üëá pic.twitter.com/J71fGDFFxs ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 18, 2025 The SEC has acknowledged several applications for XRP spot ETFs, signaling that the agency is formally reviewing them. Acknowledgment does not mean approval but marks an important step in the regulatory process. With Teucrium‚Äôs leveraged XRP product already approved by the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), the SEC is now under pressure to justify why a less risky spot product should not be approved. Teucrium‚Äôs Approval Raises New Questions Teucrium‚Äôs 2x Leveraged XRP ETF, which relies on returns from European ETPs and swap agreements, was approved despite its complexity and risk profile. This fact is central to SMQKE‚Äôs argument, as the approval makes it harder to justify rejecting a spot XRP ETF. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Leveraged ETFs aim to amplify daily returns, which introduces greater volatility. If such a product is deemed acceptable, the rationale for denying simpler spot-based products becomes weaker. The market is also eager to trade with these products, as Teucrium‚Äôs CEO recently revealed that the XRP ETF was the most successful launch in the company‚Äôs history . SEC‚Äôs Shifting Approach to Crypto Regulation The SEC‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation appears to be changing. Over the past few months, the Commission has dropped several crypto-related lawsuits, including the long-running lawsuit against Ripple . Although the SEC has not formally endorsed cryptocurrencies, this move has been interpreted by many in the crypto space as a signal of a broader policy shift. This shifting stance is reflected in the agency‚Äôs willingness to engage with ETF applications tied to cryptocurrencies. These ETFs will likely be approved, as concerns about market manipulation and investor protection may not hold in the current regulatory environment, especially when riskier products like leveraged ETFs are approved. Investors will wait eagerly for the May 22 deadline, as many market participants believe ETFs will help XRP grow substantially. Whether the SEC grants or denies the application, the justification provided will likely influence how future XRP-related financial products are treated.

As the broader crypto market stabilizes amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global trade tensions, Solana has managed to inch closer to a critical resistance level. Despite the risks still looming, especially with trade war rhetoric between the US and China escalating, some market participants believe the conditions are aligning for a potential recovery rally. Adding weight to that view, recent on-chain data from Glassnode reveals a subtle yet notable shift in whale activity. The number of wallets holding more than 10,000 SOL has increased by 1.53% over the past week, rising from 4,943 to 5,019. This uptick suggests that larger holders may be accumulating ahead of a possible breakout, interpreting current price levels as favorable entry points. Historically, such accumulation phases have preceded strong upward moves, particularly when combined with technical recovery signals and improving market sentiment. Whether Solana can break through resistance and sustain a recovery remains uncertain, but the growing whale interest paints a cautiously optimistic picture for the days ahead. Whale Accumulation Grows As Bulls Regain Momentum Solana has been one of the hardest-hit assets during the recent market downturn. Since peaking in January, SOL has lost over 65% of its value, reflecting deep investor uncertainty and heightened selling pressure. As macroeconomic tensions between the US and China continue to grow, global markets have shifted toward a risk-off sentiment, with high-volatility assets like Solana taking the brunt of the damage. However, there may now be signs of relief. A possible resolution in the ongoing trade dispute and improving liquidity conditions are breathing fresh life into the broader altcoin market. In Solana‚Äôs case, the recovery narrative is gaining support from on-chain metrics. According to data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X , the number of wallets holding over 10,000 SOL has increased by 1.53% over the past week, rising from 4,943 to 5,019. This subtle but notable uptick in large-holder activity suggests growing institutional or whale confidence in Solana‚Äôs long-term potential. 10K | Source: Ali Martinez on X"" width=""860"" height=""484"" srcset=""https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=750 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=860 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/btc_cb7bb7.jpeg?w=1140 1140w"" sizes=""(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"" loading=""lazy""/> This accumulation trend, paired with rising momentum among bulls, could mark the beginning of a shift in sentiment after weeks of relentless pressure. If global risk appetite improves and Solana can hold key support zones, this whale behavior could lead to a sustained rebound in price. Solana Tests Key Resistance As Investors Aim For A Recovery Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $140, just below a critical resistance zone that has capped price advances for weeks. After showing signs of strength in recent sessions, bulls are now attempting to push SOL above the $150 level‚Äîa key threshold that, if broken, could quickly propel the price toward the $180 mark. The current momentum is being closely watched, as reclaiming this resistance would signal a trend reversal and provide the foundation for a stronger bullish recovery. To confirm an uptrend, SOL must break and hold above the $150 mark and then target the 200-day moving average, currently acting as a dynamic resistance. A decisive move above the 200-day MA would indicate a shift in sentiment and reinforce Solana‚Äôs breakout potential in the near term. However, if bulls fail to reclaim and defend these levels, bearish pressure could return. A rejection at current prices would likely open the door for a retest of lower demand zones. Losing support around the $125 level could take SOL back to $100‚Äîa level that previously served as a strong support during earlier selloffs. The next few days will be pivotal for determining Solana‚Äôs short-term trajectory.

Fedrok AG , a Swiss-registered blockchain company focused on sustainability, has developed a novel ‚ÄúProof of Green‚Äù consensus mechanism that rewards blockchain activity powered by renewable energy. Howarig Traders , based in Papua New Guinea (PNG), is known locally for its work in renewable energy projects. The company will help Fedrok apply blockchain tech directly to clean energy initiatives throughout the country. Together, they're aiming to set an example for sustainable blockchain practices globally. An important reason behind this collaboration is to introduce the T4G Pay system to Papua New Guinea. This blockchain-based payment platform integrates tokenized carbon credits and is designed to promote climate-positive financial activity. The platform will run on Fedrok‚Äôs Proof of Green consensus mechanism and use the T4G Token (T4GT), a stablecoin developed for everyday transactions across PNG. While T4GT powers the payment system locally, Fedrok‚Äôs broader blockchain ecosystem is built around the FDK Coin, its native cryptocurrency used for infrastructure-level operations and tokenized carbon markets beyond PNG. Green Energy as a Priority Fedrok‚Äôs Proof of Green method rewards renewable energy use by linking blockchain activities directly to measurable carbon reductions. Traditional blockchain activities have faced criticism for consuming high amounts of energy. Fedrok‚Äôs model handles this challenge by incentivizing energy efficiency from the start. For Papua New Guinea, a country full of renewable energy potential but reliant on fossil fuels, this could seriously change how energy is used. Howarig Traders will assist Fedrok in setting up projects involving solar, hydro, and wind power, all feeding directly into blockchain mining operations. This way, both carbon emissions and energy waste are reduced. The collaboration also emphasizes carbon credit tokenization. Through T4G Pay, landowners will be able to form Incorporated Land Groups (ILGs), map and assess carbon stock on their land, and claim tokenized carbon credits. These credits can then be traded transparently and securely on-chain, reducing fraud and promoting verifiable climate action. Real Opportunities for PNG‚Äôs Economy One of the partnership‚Äôs promises is its potential boost to the local economy. Renewable energy and blockchain combined can create immediate jobs and stimulate growth in technology-related fields. Training and skill-building programs are planned to make sure that local communities actively participate and gain expertise in both blockchain technology and renewable energy. ‚ÄúThis is about helping local communities participate in the carbon economy,‚Äù said Dr. Philip Blazdell, CEO of Fedrok AG. This fits well with Howarig Traders‚Äô long-term dedication to empowering communities and fostering local economic development. The T4G Pay system is also being developed with financial inclusion in mind. In a country where a huge portion of the population remains unbanked, T4G Pay will provide access through mobile apps, USSD codes for offline transactions, point-of-sale systems for merchants, and even T4G Visa cards. This allows rural and underserved populations to participate in both the digital and green economy. Proceeds from carbon credit sales will be distributed through smart contracts, guaranteeing that landowners receive a fair share, between 45‚Äì65% of net proceeds, after allocations for government, platform operations, and development. This transparent revenue-sharing model aims to build lasting infrastructure while delivering direct benefits to local communities. Transparency and Trust Another advantage of blockchain is transparency. Fedrok AG intends to use blockchain technology to clearly track renewable energy production and carbon reductions. This transparent and secure record will help build trust and accountability around environmental initiatives. Greater transparency could attract further international investment and support, improving Papua New Guinea‚Äôs standing as a leader in sustainable innovation. The implementation of T4G Pay will further enrich transparency in financial transactions, reducing corruption and mismanagement risks. The use of SevisPass Digital ID for platform access adds a secure, government-linked identity verification layer for users. A Step Forward for Sustainability Around the world, industries face increased pressure to adopt environmentally friendly practices. This partnership is a direct response, demonstrating how blockchain can be used practically and responsibly. With clear objectives and actionable plans, this partnership could become a leading example for other nations aiming to merge renewable energy with blockchain technology. It marks a notable step forward, not only for PNG but for sustainable practices globally. What‚Äôs Next? Both Fedrok AG and Howarig Traders have indicated that initial projects under this partnership will start soon, with pilot initiatives in various parts of Papua New Guinea. Already, there‚Äôs enthusiasm among local communities and governmental bodies about the positive impact this collaboration might have. As the world keeps an eye on these developments, Fedrok AG and Howarig Traders are setting a positive pace, showing how combining blockchain with renewable energy, innovative payment solutions like T4G Pay, tokenized carbon credits, and inclusive infrastructure can genuinely support national development. This partnership is a bold and thoughtful experiment in using decentralized technology for real-world impact, one that could serve as a global blueprint for future sustainable blockchain initiatives.

During the company‚Äôs 2025 Spring Business Update this week , Schwab revealed that it is moving into spot crypto trading, allowing clients to directly buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This marks a big shift in how major financial firms approach digital assets. Schwab ‚ÄòOn A Great Path‚Äô to Launch Spot Crypto Trading Schwab currently enables access to crypto through ETFs, closed end funds, and futures. Wuster revealed that they are ‚Äúon a great path‚Äù to launch direct spot crypto trading within the next year. Schwab‚Äôs entry into the spot market would be a major step especially as regulatory clarity improves. He called the expansion a response to client demand as well as a strategic move to maintain its role as a top destination for retail and institutional crypto investors. Recently, the CEO highlighted growing interest in Schwab‚Äôs crypto offerings like ETFs and Bitcoin futures. Rick Wurster became Schwab‚Äôs CEO in 2025 and said in a 2024 interview that the firm was ready to offer crypto trading but was waiting for clearer regulations. Schwab saw a big 40% jump in profits last quarter, as many investors shifted their portfolios due to market volatility. Wurster suggested that some of those investors might be turning to crypto. Notably, there was a 400% surge in traffic to their crypto site, of which 70% was from non-clients which indicates rising public interest. Wurster noted that the massive spike in traffic indicates that investors who were once hesitant to jump into crypto space are now doing so, due to Schwab‚Äôs reputation as a trusted financial brand. ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said numerous times in past, spot crypto trading will be table stakes for every major brokerage,‚Äù reacted Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, to the development.

As he stated, ‚ÄúRipple and SWIFT are not partners.‚Äù His message aims to end years of speculation that reemerges with each market cycle. According to All Things XRP, this rumor dates back years, and in 2018, SWIFT publicly denied any talks with Ripple. Around the same time, the Ripple CEO clarified that the two entities competed rather than working together. Despite this clarity, recent developments have reignited the narrative of a collaboration. üö®üö´ RIPPLE & SWIFT PARTNERSHIP? LET‚ÄôS KILL THE MYTH ONCE AND FOR ALL.

Ripple‚Äôs‚Ä¶ ‚Äî All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 18, 2025 Why the Rumor Resurfaced in 2025 All Things XRP pointed to Ripple‚Äôs acquisition of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin in late 2024 as the catalysts that renewed the speculation. Many in the XRP community believe these moves signal a deeper integration with traditional finance institutions. The timing of these announcements, especially in the wake of the SEC‚Äôs decision to withdraw its appeal against Ripple, has added to the speculation. A major source of confusion came in March 2025 when Watcher.Guru‚Äôs account was compromised. During the breach, posts claimed billions of XRP were locked in escrow and falsely suggested a partnership between SWIFT and Ripple. These claims were quickly debunked, but many believe a partnership is in the works. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SWIFT‚Äôs Blockchain Strategy It is accurate that SWIFT is exploring blockchain solutions. However, All Things XRP noted that the institution has chosen to collaborate with Chainlink for interoperability testing. Although Ripple‚Äôs clients, such as Santander, use its services, they are not operating through SWIFT‚Äôs infrastructure. Some XRP advocates point to potential benefits SWIFT could gain by integrating XRP. Yet, there‚Äôs no evidence that SWIFT has ever formally considered such a move. Independent studies by global banking organizations have acknowledged XRP‚Äôs potential, but SWIFT was not involved in these assessments. Misunderstood References and Misleading Assumptions Much of the confusion arises from indirect associations. For instance, EastNets, a third party that licenses SWIFT software, has mentioned using Ripple‚Äôs technology . Some see the mention as a direct connection between both parties, despite there being none. Similarly, Ripple and SWIFT‚Äôs alignment with ISO 20022 has led some to infer an impending collaboration. However, compliance with a global messaging standard does not equate to partnership. Despite persistent claims, no credible evidence supports the idea of a Ripple-SWIFT partnership. While such a relationship could benefit XRP in adoption and institutional recognition, it remains purely speculative.

His forecast for Bitcoin ( BTC ) Dominance to rise further comes as the ratio has already exceeded the levels many crypto analysts expected it would reach by late 2024. ‚ÄúUnit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated,‚Äù Mow said in an April 19 X post. Mow suggested that unit bias ‚Äî a psychological method in behavioral economics that suggests that individuals usually like to own a complete unit or stock regardless of its price and size ‚Äî often causes less experienced investors to assume cheaper whole altcoins are better value than owning part of a Bitcoin. Mow questions altcoin valuations on level playing field ‚ÄúYou can buy one twenty-one millionth of the BTC supply for ~$85,000,‚Äù Mow said. He asked, ‚ÄúWhat happens if you remove unit bias from alts to calculate the equivalent of 1/21 million?‚Äù He pointed out that Ether ( ETH ) would be priced at $9,200, XRP ( XRP ) would be priced at $5,800, and Solana ( SOL ) would be priced at $3,400 ‚Äî representing increases of approximately 278,746%, 470%, and 2,328%, respectively, from their prices at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. ‚ÄúNo way these alts are worth that much,‚Äù Mow said. Source: Samson Mow Sunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin proponent, said on Jan. 12 that ‚ÄúUnit bias is a core foundational framework of the normie mind. ‚ÄòCheaper better.‚Äô‚Äù Mow said that ‚Äúmost‚Äù altcoins take advantage of unit bias by implementing a very high total supply so market participants ‚Äúcan‚Äôt figure out what they‚Äôre buying.‚Äù Related: XRP: Why it‚Äôs outperforming altcoins ‚Äî and what comes next Based on his calculations, Mow said Bitcoin dominance is going ‚Äúso much higher.‚Äù Bitcoin dominance ‚Äî a metric that reflects Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market capitalization ‚Äî is often used by traders to gauge when Bitcoin might be nearing a price peak.

Experts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/has-ethereum-turned-itself-around-experts-weigh-in/,"‚ÄúThe Ethereum ship is slowly turning around,‚Äù claimed David Hoffman from Bankless on April 19. He added that the process started over six months ago and changes are already observable, highlighting six areas of change Ethereum is undergoing. The project went through a rough patch earlier this year with leadership issues at the Ethereum Foundation, developers jumping ship, and record levels of FUD being disseminated. However, despite that, it is still the industry standard network for DeFi, stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization , and decentralized applications. Evolution of Ethereum After primarily being research-focused for years, Ethereum is now recognizing the need to adapt in response to competitive pressures that emerged around 2021, argues Hoffman. He added that the Ethereum community is actively addressing these issues through aggressive layer-1 scaling, with plans to increase gas limits tenfold over two years. There has also been a shift from protocol-first to product-first thinking, with new leadership roles, and the Ethereum Foundation is taking a more active coordinating role with new co-executive directors. He also said there is now a more inclusive culture as the doors to the ‚ÄúIvory Tower‚Äù open, enabling a welcoming ecosystem of voices into roadmap conversations. There is better layer-2 integration and developing interoperability standards, positioning Ethereum layer-1 service provider to L2s. Finally, an increased urgency is embracing shorter roadmap cycles and faster protocol upgrades. ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs Strategic Pivot‚Äù The Ethereum ship is slowly turning around.

He argued Ethereum should stick to its rollup-centric layer-2 scaling strategy, which it has developed over the past five years. ‚ÄúPeople need to pick a lane and attempt to mitigate the risks associated with it vs scrambling to shift narratives and strategy every month.‚Äù He added that he was also against ‚Äújust do every approach,‚Äù which is probably the only thing worse than not picking an approach.

While tokenizing real estate, art, or equities has become increasingly familiar, uranium‚Äîa tightly controlled, highly capital-intensive commodity‚Äîhas remained far out of reach for the average investor. That‚Äôs changing. Why Uranium? The uranium market, traditionally opaque and hard to access, trades over the counter in massive lot sizes‚Äîtypically 100,000 pounds, valued at around $6 million at today‚Äôs prices. It‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs not accessible to retail investors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an asset class of critical importance,‚Äù said Elvidge, ‚Äúbut historically very difficult to access.‚Äù Through a partnership with the Tezos Foundation, Uranium.io acquired a minimum tradable lot of uranium, stored it in a certified facility, and tokenized it, becoming one of the more interesting RWA crypto projects . Now, the average investor can gain exposure to physical uranium for as little as $4‚Äîno need for millions in capital or complex brokerage agreements. How It Works Uranium.io leverages a trust-based legal framework under English common law to represent fractional ownership in physical uranium. The uranium itself is stored in Cameco, one of three global storage facilities approved for this purpose (the other two are in the U.S. and France). Their partner, Curzon Uranium, helped facilitate the process. Users can buy tokens directly through the platform using a MetaMask wallet and USDC, with built-in on-chain analytics flagging suspicious activity. The onboarding is KYC-light, only requiring full identity verification if a red flag is raised. Each token represents a portion of the physical uranium stockpile, and‚Äîunlike most tokenized commodities‚Äîtoken holders can actually request physical delivery, assuming they have an approved converter account and pass relevant nonproliferation checks. One of the core advantages, Elvidge emphasized, is transparency. Currently, uranium pricing is derived from voluntary broker submissions and updated only during U.S. and UK trading hours. Uranium.io‚Äôs platform introduces real-time price discovery through live token trading. While the platform is still in its early stages, a market-making partner helps ensure price accuracy relative to legacy data feeds. Beyond Tokenization Hype Elvidge argues that Uranium.io is a case of real-world tokenization moving beyond buzzwords. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not doing tokenization for tokenization‚Äôs sake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is about taking something previously inaccessible and opening it up.‚Äù Increased access helps retail investors, but also benefits the broader uranium supply chain‚Äîparticularly fuel buyers and utility providers‚Äîby improving liquidity and price transparency. These market efficiencies are sorely lacking in the current OTC-only trading structure. While spot uranium trading is unregulated in many jurisdictions, Uranium.io has taken a careful approach to legal structure. Its framework doesn‚Äôt rely on an SPV and avoids categorizing the tokens as securities. Still, the regulatory environment is complex and remains under constant review, particularly as the project scales. Why Uranium Now? The fundamentals support long-term interest. Elvidge pointed to increasing demand from tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, all showing interest in nuclear power as a reliable energy source. Governments are shifting toward pro-nuclear energy policies. In 2023 alone, uranium demand reached 194 million pounds, while supply lagged behind at 155 million pounds. ‚ÄúUranium has no meaningful correlation with Bitcoin, the S&P 500, gold, or oil,‚Äù Elvidge noted. That makes it an attractive uncorrelated asset at a time when crypto investors are seeking diversification and stability amid risk-off market sentiment.

Starting with the US stock market, Brandt tells his 792,500 followers on the social media platform X that the S&P 500 looks bearish after breaching support at 5,800 and retesting the level as resistance.

An ascending channel indicates that an asset is in an uptrend as it prints higher highs and higher lows.

According to the company's statement, such correlation declines, especially observed on daily or hourly charts, indicate critical moments when the market may deviate from its usual direction. According to Alphractal‚Äôs analysis, historically, markets have experienced significant movements when correlations have fallen. The company has highlighted three key patterns: If Bitcoin moves sideways after a few days of bullishness and altcoin correlation drops, this is usually a sign of a market-wide price decline. If Bitcoin shows signs of recovery after falling for several days and the correlation falls again, it could signal that the downtrend is not over yet. If altcoin correlation remains high (around 1) while Bitcoin moves up or down, this may indicate that the market is in the process of consolidation or following a clear trend.

During Phase 4 MUTM tokens offer a price of $0.025 yet investors can anticipate 20% profit growth from Phase 5‚Äôs price increase. Multiple analysts assure that MUTM represents a DeFi platform of low value because it will reach over $5 in market capitalization upon launching. MUTM provides investors with stable investment opportunities unlike the volatile nature of meme coins. Investors seeking returns from DeFi operations will find MUTM attractive due to its distinctive lending mechanisms along with a dynamic top-50 leader leaderboard system that provides benefits to loyal users.

Farina has reportedly said that individuals who have fewer than 1,000 XRP tokens ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care enough about their financial success‚Äù and called possessing less than that amount ‚Äúinsanity.‚Äù Though these comments represent Farina‚Äôs individual investment strategy, they echo a developing perception among XRP enthusiasts that the asset is undervalued and poised for strong growth if regulatory clarity increases and more businesses embrace it. Doubters Challenge The Life-Changing Assertions Not everyone shares Farina‚Äôs positive perspective. Doubters have raised issues with his assertion that $1,000 in XRP today may be worth $50,000 someday. One critic pointed out that even if XRP hits $100 and converts $1,000 into $50,000, this may not be sufficient for early retirement. The remark points out that what appears to be a good return may not necessarily be the life-altering wealth many investors expect.

In a recent post on X, VET stated that for XRP to be utilized extensively by market makers to provide liquidity, the XRP Ledger must support many issued tokens with economic value. According to VET, the quality of the issuer is a significant factor, with higher-quality issuers naturally being more desirable. For XRP to be used a lot by market makers to provide liquidity the XRP Ledger needs a lot of issued tokens that have economic value. The higher the issuer quality the better obviously. Without it the XRP Ledger, which in itself is a DEX, can't play out its full strengths. ‚Äî Vet (@Vet_X0) April 17, 2025 The validator emphasized that without a substantial volume of such issued tokens, the XRP Ledger‚Äôs inherent capabilities as a DEX cannot be fully realized. While the XRP Ledger is technically designed to support trading between various assets without intermediaries, its actual impact depends heavily on the availability of assets that market participants want to trade. Range of Asset Types Encouraged for On-Chain Issuance In response to a question from X user XRP FOREVER, who asked whether the mentioned tokens could include examples like RLUSD, RLGBP, RLJPY, and BBRL, VET provided a broader perspective. VET replied that the scope is not limited to fiat-backed assets but extends to a wide array of items that people perceive as valuable. This includes airline miles, store loyalty points, gold, Treasury bills, meme coins, and stablecoins. The message from VET was clear: any asset that users associate with value and wish to trade should be brought on-chain to leverage the XRP Ledger‚Äôs capabilities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Concerns Over Community Attitudes Toward New Projects However, not all community members share the same enthusiasm when it comes to the proliferation of new tokens. A user identifying as A Concerned Human offered a critical but nuanced observation about the current sentiment within the XRPL ecosystem. This user pointed out that a significant portion of the XRP and XRPL community frequently dismisses new on-chain tokens as ‚Äúshitcoins,‚Äù often discrediting them before they have had an opportunity to demonstrate value or purpose. The same commenter acknowledged that many newly issued tokens have made questionable claims, such as announcing partnerships without verifiable evidence or presenting exploratory communications with institutions as official endorsements. Despite this, they argued that most legitimate projects start with little more than a concept and that real support often comes only after usefulness and viability have been established. They cautioned that while skepticism is reasonable, especially for those unable to assess a project‚Äôs fundamentals or team integrity, wholesale rejection of nascent efforts can harm the growth of the XRPL ecosystem. Support Needed for Ecosystem Growth and Ledger Utility The comment concluded with a call to action for informed investors and ecosystem participants. According to A Concerned Human, if the goal is to see the XRP Ledger thrive as a decentralized marketplace for asset exchange, it is counterproductive for knowledgeable stakeholders to impede the development of on-chain token initiatives, even in early or experimental stages. VET‚Äôs original message and the ensuing reactions reflect a broader tension within the XRPL community. On one hand is the desire to preserve trust and prevent scams from undermining the ecosystem. On the other hand is the recognition that for the XRP Ledger to reach its full capabilities, it must host a diverse range of tokenized assets that people recognize as having value. VET‚Äôs post serves as a reminder that the utility of XRP and the ledger itself is inseparable from the ecosystem of assets users are willing to issue, hold, and trade.

The larger-cap alts are also quite sluggish on a daily scale, with ETH slightly below $1,600 and XRP down by around 1%. BTC Consolidation Continues The past seven days went entirely differently from the previous week. Back then, BTC went through a massive five-digit price rollercoaster. However, it finally calmed after the tariff pause announced by Trump for most countries and remained in a tight range for the entire week. After it bounced above $82,000 last weekend, the asset went to a local peak of just over $86,000 on a couple of occasions but to no avail. Just the opposite, it was pushed back down to $83,000 both times. Since then, the cryptocurrency has traded within an even smaller range between $84,000 and $85,500. It now stands approximately in the middle of it, with many industry experts suggesting a breakout is just around the corner. For now, though, BTC‚Äôs market cap has retraced to $1.680 trillion on CoinGecko, while its dominance over the alts has taken a slight hit and is down to 60.7%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView FARTCOIN Is Back Most larger-cap alts have failed to post any significant moves in the past day. Minor losses are coming from ETH, XRP, DOGE, and ADA, while SOL is slightly in the green. More interesting price developments come from the mid- and lower-cap alts. FARTCOIN has stolen the show and returned to the top 100 alts by market cap after a 10% surge. FET follows suit, gaining 9%, and TAO is net (8.5%). The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has remained at the same level it has been in the past several days, at $2.770 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Leading the charge is Janover Inc.‚Äînow DeFi Development Corporation‚Äîwhich just added $5 million worth of SOL to its treasury. The purchase of 44,158 tokens brings its total to 83,084 SOL, currently valued at $9.6 million. This marks Janover‚Äôs second major Solana buy, reflecting a 109% jump in SOL-per-share value to $6.59. The aggressive accumulation follows an April leadership shake-up, where ex-Kraken executives took over, raised $42 million, and pivoted the firm toward Solana staking and DeFi infrastructure. Janover‚Äôs Institutional Bet on Solana: At a Glance Total Holdings: 83,084 SOL (~$9.6M) SOL per Share: 0.06 SOL ‚Üí $6.59 value Growth: 109% jump in per-share crypto value Staking Expansion and Whale Moves Add Fuel Janover isn‚Äôt alone in its conviction. SOL Strategies Inc . (CSE: HODL), a Canada-based crypto investment firm, is also betting big on Solana. In March, it added 24,000 SOL to its treasury‚Äînow totaling 267,151 SOL, worth over $30 million. In March, SOL Strategies (CSE: HODL) acquired 24,000 SOL, bringing total holdings to 267,151 SOL‚Äînearly all of which is staked across our validator network. Our commitment to Solana continues. Full article via @CoinDesk : https://t.co/ezSVXFr1mA ‚Äî SOL Strategies (CSE: HODL | OTCQX: CYFRF) (@solstrategies_) April 8, 2025 What makes this especially notable is that most of these tokens are actively delegated to validator nodes. That means they‚Äôre not just holding‚Äîthey‚Äôre building, with long-term exposure to Solana‚Äôs proof-of-stake economy. Despite the solid fundamentals, SOL Strategies‚Äô stock has lagged behind, dropping 67% year-to-date‚Äîa stark contrast to SOL‚Äôs 36% slide. Still, CEO Leah Wald isn‚Äôt blinking. She‚Äôs confirmed plans to grow staking operations into other chains like SUI, Monad, and Archway. A whale bought another 32,000 $SOL ($3.72M) after 6 months. This whale seems to be extremely bullish on $SOL . Three years ago, he bought 30,541 $SOL ($6.61M) at $216 and didn't sell ‚Äî even when $SOL dropped below $10. https://t.co/ouiQ0QsxeZ pic.twitter.com/qMDeQoks7T ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 10, 2025 And it‚Äôs not just institutions getting in. On-chain data shows whales are returning, too. One long-dormant wallet scooped up 32,000 SOL (about $3.72 million) just before Janover‚Äôs announcement. This same address famously bought 30,541 SOL at $216 during the last cycle‚Äîand never sold, even when prices dropped below $10. Accumulation Snapshot SOL Strategies Holdings: 267,151 SOL Whale Activity: 32,000 SOL bought at $3.72M Previous Buy: 30,541 SOL at $216 (held through 2022 crash) Solana Technical Setup: $145 Breakout Could Unleash Bulls From a technical angle, Solana is still in bullish territory. After briefly testing resistance at $145, price has pulled back slightly to $139, but key support at $136‚Äì$131 remains intact. The 50-day EMA around $131 adds confluence to this zone. Momentum indicators are still on the bulls‚Äô side. The MACD is trending higher, suggesting buyers are maintaining control. If SOL can punch through $145 with conviction, next upside targets sit at $153 and $161. Trade Setup: Entry: Bounce from $136 or breakout above $145 Targets: $153, $161 Stop Loss: Below $131 (EMA + trendline confluence) Final Take: Institutions Are Betting on Solana‚Äôs Comeback Between institutional stacking, whale activity, and a solid technical setup, Solana is quietly preparing for its next big move. While the headlines focus elsewhere, smart money is clearly circling‚Äîand for patient investors, this stealth rally may just be the beginning. BTC Bull Token Presale Tops $4.8M As Bitcoin edges closer to the $85,000 mark and macro uncertainty intensifies, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction with retail and crypto-savvy investors. This Ethereum-based meme coin stands out by offering real Bitcoin airdrops every time BTC hits key price milestones‚Äîaligning directly with Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upside. Earn Bitcoin with 86% APY Through Staking Beyond the airdrop rewards, BTC Bull‚Äôs staking program remains a major draw. Investors can earn up to 86% APY in passive income, while also contributing to the token‚Äôs network strength. The ability to unstake anytime makes it flexible for new and seasoned holders alike. Staking Snapshot: Annual Yield: 86% APY Total Staked: 1,222,531,969 BTCBULL Unstake Anytime: Yes With over 1.22 billion tokens already staked, momentum continues to build ahead of the next price milestone. Presale Nears Final Stretch as Demand Surges The presale is now approaching full subscription, with $4,801,979.55 raised out of the $5,550,445 target. The current token price remains at $0.002465, but with limited supply left and rising demand, a price hike could be imminent. Latest Presale Stats: Token Price: $0.00247 Raised So Far: $4.80M of $5.55M This window may be one of the last chances to secure BTCBULL before the next pricing tier kicks in. With its high-yield staking, real BTC rewards, and growing ecosystem engagement, BTC Bull is emerging as a top contender in the meme coin space‚Äîbacked by actual Bitcoin utility. With limited time remaining and demand accelerating, this is a key window to secure BTCBULL at presale rates before the next price jump.

POL Price Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL‚Äôs price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1749, resulting in a correction to $0.1516. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is POL price up today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price is aiming for a push toward $0.2 level. However, it faces a consolidation. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on POL Indian telecom leader Jio Platforms released its JioCoin on the Polygon network, expanding its digital services. Starting January 16, Jio integrated JioCoin into its JioSphere browser following a collaboration with Polygon Labs to incorporate Web3 and blockchain technologies. POL price prediction April 2025 Following Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. However, the recent announcement on Tariffs has triggered bearish pressure in the altcoin market. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following the crash. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.17 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.28 in April. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction April 2025 $0.17 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That‚Äôs why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It‚Äôs anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

POL historic price sentiment POL price history | Coinmarketcap POL debuted in 2019, initially valued below a cent. Maintained a steady level of around $0.02 for the following two years. POL‚Äôs rebranding to Polygon in 2021 fueled growth, surpassing $1 in May and peaking at an all-time high of $2.92 on December 27. In 2022, POL struggled, falling below $1 in May, under $0.50 in June, briefly rebounding above $1 in August, and ending the year at $0.7585, down 70%. In the following year, 2023, Polygon saw mixed performance, breaking $1 in February but dropping to $0.5593 in June after Crypto.com news. It peaked at $0.8775 in July, fell to $0.4946 in September, and recovered to $0.9789 by November. POL rose from $0.8514 in January to $1.4 in March but declined below $0.8 by May and hit lows near $0.4 in June and July.

The report cites a mix of macroeconomic resilience and strengthening on-chain indicators as key drivers behind the optimistic forecast. The research draws parallels between the current market cycle and 2021, when Bitcoin weathered major external shocks like China‚Äôs blanket mining ban without derailing its long-term uptrend. This time, the shocks come in the form of monetary policy disappointment and increased global liquidity, both of which underpin Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal. ‚ÄúDespite the volatility, we see strength rather than fear in the market,‚Äù the report said, noting that Bitcoin is currently trading around $84,400, down from around $83,152 earlier this month. Related News: Telegram and Toncoin (TON) Founder Pavel Durov Responds to Allegations of Collaboration with the European Union After Being Detained One of the most notable changes, according to 21Shares, is how Bitcoin now responds to disruptions in the traditional financial system. Events like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank no longer lead to panic selling. Instead, they reinforce Bitcoin‚Äôs reputation as a hedge against systemic financial risk. Even crypto-specific setbacks like the recent Bybit hack have failed to shake investor confidence in Bitcoin, with the market appearing increasingly adept at distinguishing between the failings of centralized participants and the fundamental value proposition of the decentralized protocol. On-chain metrics support this optimism, according to the report. Long-term holders continue to accumulate, and there is no sign of a broad-based distribution that would signal a market top. Meanwhile, institutional interest is growing, with increased flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and improved regulatory clarity lending more legitimacy to the asset. *This is not investment advice.

43566847,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64539,1745137444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Forecast For April 20, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-forecast-for-april-20-2025/,"On the weekly timeframe, XRP is consolidating within a well-defined bull flag, a classic continuation pattern following its explosive rally above $3.50. This downward-sloping channel has contained price action since late 2023, offering healthy retracement after the steep climb. The flag‚Äôs lower boundary, near $1.20, has consistently acted as dynamic support, while resistance remains around the upper trendline. Bollinger Bands are gradually tightening, signaling declining volatility and the likelihood of a breakout. Despite the current bearish candle, a strong wick rejection from the lower trendline suggests bullish pressure is mounting beneath the surface. Falling Wedge Hints at Reversal The daily chart reveals a bullish falling wedge, a pattern characterized by converging trendlines that slope downward. This setup typically precedes a trend reversal , especially when it appears during a broader consolidation phase like the weekly bull flag. XRP is currently trading just below the upper boundary of the wedge, with resistance at $2.23 and support near $1.87. Price has been steadily compressing within this structure, and the Bollinger Bands show a notable squeeze‚Äîoften a precursor to an explosive move. A daily candle close above the wedge could validate the breakout and trigger the next rally phase. Coiling Price Action Near Resistance On the 4-hour chart, XRP has recently rebounded from the lower wedge support and is now consolidating below immediate resistance around $2.08‚Äì$2.15. The price action is compressing into a tight range, often a sign that a breakout is near. The MACD shows a bullish crossover, with the MACD line now moving above the signal line and the histogram printing positive bars. Although trading volume remains subdued, the technical posture suggests bulls are gaining control. A surge in volume alongside a clean break above $2.15 could catalyze a quick rally toward $2.50. Momentum Shifting Bullish Technical indicators across all timeframes support a bullish thesis. The Bollinger Bands on the daily and 4-hour charts are extremely tight, indicating that volatility is about to expand. On the daily chart, price is nearing the middle band (20 SMA), which if reclaimed, could flip market sentiment in favor of buyers. The MACD on the daily timeframe is still slightly negative but flattening, while the 4-hour MACD has already turned positive. This multi-timeframe MACD setup often precedes broader momentum reversals. These indicators, in conjunction with the patterns, suggest that XRP is approaching a pivotal move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bull Flag and Falling Wedge Suggest Upside The two primary technical patterns‚Äîweekly bull flag and daily falling wedge‚Äîboth suggest a continuation of the prior bullish trend. The flag reflects long-term consolidation after a strong upward move, while the falling wedge signals waning bearish momentum and potential breakout. This dual-pattern setup creates a high-probability scenario for an upward move. Structural alignment across timeframes adds weight to this outlook, making any breakout above the $2.23 zone particularly significant. Price Forecast For Today XRP trades around $2.08, with clearly defined resistance at $2.23 and support at $1.87. The tightening wedge, bullish MACD cross on the 4-hour, and squeezed Bollinger Bands all suggest a breakout is imminent. If XRP breaks above the $2.15‚Äì$2.23 resistance zone with volume confirmation, it could quickly rally toward $2.50 or even $2.80. Conversely, failure to reclaim this level may result in a brief pullback to the $1.90 region. For today, the expected trading range is $2.00 to $2.30, with a bullish tilt favored by both pattern structure and momentum indicators.

Software Engineer States Seven Key Reasons,https://timestabloid.com/why-xrp-price-not-moon-software-engineer-states-seven-key-reasons/,"In a post on X, Software Analyst Vincent Van Code recently offered a detailed response to the frequently asked question: ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt the price of XRP surged?‚Äù In his post, Vincent acknowledged several reasons often cited by the crypto community for XRP‚Äôs sluggish price movement but dismissed them as speculative and ultimately invalid explanations. Instead, Van Code reaffirmed a long-term outlook on XRP, characterizing it as a strategic investment rather than a short-term trade. ""Why XRP price not moon""? This is probably the second most common question people asking (the first is of course ""where is Elvis"") Here is my take on what PEOPLE think is happening: 1. Regulatory uncertainty persists: The SEC lawsuit against Ripple isn‚Äôt fully resolved, and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) April 17, 2025 Investor Concerns Around Regulation, Supply, and Sentiment According to Van Code, regulatory uncertainty remains one of the most referenced explanations among investors. Despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple nearing resolution, lingering legal implications and the possibility of remaining penalties continue to make some investors hesitant. Van Code stated that this concern is not valid for XRP‚Äôs valuation today, as he believes the fundamental issues have already been addressed and priced in. Another argument commonly put forward, as outlined in his post, relates to market dynamics. He noted that global concerns such as trade wars, competitive pressure from stablecoins and alternative tokens, and Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing dominance in the crypto market all contribute to sidelining XRP despite its recent developments. Van Code listed this as part of public sentiment, but again reiterated that such external comparisons are speculative and do not reflect the actual utility of XRP. He also referenced tokenomics challenges, pointing out that XRP‚Äôs circulating supply, currently around 56 billion, and the monthly release of XRP from Ripple‚Äôs escrow accounts are often cited as downward pressures on price. In the eyes of many investors, this consistent unlocking of supply may discourage holding XRP for long durations due to the fear of dilution. Van Code challenged this perception, arguing that the influence of escrow releases is exaggerated and that broader market understanding around XRP‚Äôs use is evolving. Questions of Utility and the Impact of Infrastructure Developments Van Code then addressed recent developments, such as Hidden Road‚Äôs approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) , clarifying that the benefit to XRP is indirect. Since the approval is connected to RLUSD, Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, and not XRP, some investors perceive a lack of direct utility. Nevertheless, Van Code rejected this notion, emphasizing that such infrastructure developments form a foundation that indirectly supports XRP‚Äôs long-term adoption. He went on to mention the role of market memory and sentiment. Historical volatility, especially during sharp gains followed by rapid corrections, has left many investors cautious. As a result, the confidence to hold XRP beyond modest profits is limited.

Similarly, he pointed out that many investors remain anchored to past price points, such as $0.50, and hesitate to enter the market at higher levels‚Äîeven when fundamentals improve. Long-Term Outlook Remains Firm Despite Short-Term Doubts In closing, Van Code dismissed all of these investor theories as lacking in substance. ‚ÄúOf course, my view is NONE of these are valid drivers of price and demand, and are merely speculative opinions,‚Äù he wrote. He emphasized that XRP has always been intended as a multi-year investment and that the strategic role Ripple envisions for the token requires time. Now that the SEC lawsuit is over and what he called ‚Äúfavorable tailwinds‚Äù are beginning to form, Van Code expects progress and notable developments in the coming months. He concluded by urging investors to view XRP as a long-term asset. Referring to it as a ‚Äúbuy and store it away‚Äù token, he suggested that those waiting for short-term catalysts may misinterpret XRP‚Äôs value proposition. According to Van Code, Ripple‚Äôs efforts involving XRP unfolding over years, not months, and the market should align its expectations accordingly.

43566849,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64543,1745138067,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Projection For April 20, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-projection-for-april-20-2025/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $84,657.78, recording a mild daily dip of 0.18%. The daily chart reveals a consolidation zone between $78,000 and $88,000, with price hugging the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) at $82,930.39. The Bollinger Bands (BB) are tightening, reflecting compressed volatility‚Äîa classic precursor to a breakout. Price movements remain non-committal, but this squeeze pattern often precedes decisive action. Daily MACD Hints at Gradual Bullish Momentum On the daily timeframe, the MACD (12, 26) has formed a subtle bullish crossover. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and early green bars are appearing on the histogram. While this momentum shift is not yet strong, it indicates that buying pressure is starting to build. Traders should watch for a volume surge, which would confirm bullish intent and signal a potential breakout above current resistance. 4-Hour Chart Forms Bullish Structure with Ascending Triangle Zooming into the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is displaying a textbook ascending triangle. Higher lows continue to form, while resistance at $86,000 caps the upper boundary. This pattern generally suggests a bullish continuation. The Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand, signaling increased volatility on the horizon. MACD remains in positive territory, reinforcing the potential for an upward breakout if resistance is breached with conviction. 30-Minute Timeframe: Range-Bound with Breakout Potential The 30-minute chart shows short-term consolidation between $84,400 and $85,200, indicating an accumulation phase. The Bollinger Bands are compressed, suggesting that a significant move may be imminent. The MACD has slightly turned downward, pointing to a minor dip before a possible rally. This timeframe highlights market indecision but also provides an ideal setup for intraday traders awaiting breakout confirmation. Key Support and Resistance Levels in Focus Technically, Bitcoin‚Äôs structure is well-defined. Immediate support lies at the 20-day SMA of $82,930. Should this level fail, the next significant support sits at $77,996, marked by the lower Bollinger Band. On the upside, resistance stands at $86,000, followed by a breakout threshold near $87,864. A sustained move above this zone could open the door to a rally toward $90,000. These levels will likely dictate short-term market direction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro Sentiment and Market Drivers The broader crypto market maintains a cautiously bullish tone, supported by easing macroeconomic pressures and optimism following Bitcoin‚Äôs halving event. Liquidity remains steady, and institutional interest is holding firm. However, traders are waiting for a technical catalyst. Without a strong breakout or fundamental trigger, Bitcoin may continue to range. Still, technical indicators suggest momentum is gradually shifting in favor of the bulls. Price Projection For Today Based on current technical across the daily, 4-hour, and 30-minute charts, Bitcoin is expected to trade within a range of $83,500 to $86,500 today. A confirmed breakout above $86,000 could push the price swiftly toward $88,000, aligning with the upper BB on the daily chart. Conversely, a dip below $82,900 may lead to a retracement toward the $80,000‚Äì$81,000 range. Traders should monitor lower timeframes for breakout signals, especially MACD crossovers and Bollinger Band expansions.

But while price may be lagging, institutional interest is anything but. This week, HashKey Capital launched Asia‚Äôs first XRP Tracker Fund, giving professional investors exposure to XRP without the need to directly hold the asset. Ripple, the company behind XRP, is backing the initiative as an early investor‚Äîan endorsement that speaks volumes. HashKey Capital is launching Asia‚Äôs first XRP Tracker Fund‚Äîwith @Ripple as an early investor. This marks a major step in expanding institutional access to XRP, the third-largest token by market cap. ‚Äî HashKey Capital (@HashKey_Capital) April 18, 2025 The fund allows monthly subscriptions and redemptions, offering institutional investors a familiar, regulated vehicle to access the XRP market. It‚Äôs being viewed as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world‚Äîand potentially the first of many institutional onramps to XRP. Regulatory Clarity Could Be the Game-Changer Legal uncertainty has long been one of XRP‚Äôs biggest hurdles‚Äîbut that could be changing. Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have agreed to a 60-day pause in their ongoing lawsuit, a move many believe signals potential settlement talks. That pause has added a layer of optimism to the broader XRP narrative. @Ripple vs. SEC APPEAL PAUSED FOR 60 DAYS! This pause was requested by both sides to ‚Äúmeet and confer‚Äù on next steps. $XRP pic.twitter.com/nxelURf5tm ‚Äî Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) April 19, 2025 Meanwhile, multiple XRP ETF applications are currently under SEC review. And according to prediction markets, there‚Äôs now an 82% probability that at least one XRP ETF will receive approval in 2025. A green light from the SEC could significantly boost market liquidity and bring a wave of new capital into XRP. Technical Picture: Range-Bound but Poised for a Move From a technical standpoint, XRP is trading in a tight channel between $2.05 and $2.12. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $2.07, is acting as dynamic support. Momentum remains subdued, but that could change quickly with the right catalyst. XRP/USD Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview If XRP breaks above $2.12, it could trigger a bullish move toward $2.23 and eventually $2.34. On the downside, failure to hold $2.05 might send prices back to support zones at $1.93 or $1.85. Key Technical Levels Pivot: $2.07 Resistance: $2.12, $2.23 Support: $2.05, $1.93 50 EMA: $2.07 MACD: Neutral (momentum still building) XRP Trade Setup Bullish : Buy above $2.12 with volume. Target : $2.23, then $2.34 Stop Loss : Below $2.05 Bearish : Sell on breakdown below $2.05 Target : $1.93, then $1.85 Stop Loss : Above $2.12 XRP Price Outlook: Signs Point to Long-Term Strength While XRP remains under pressure in the short term, the broader outlook is improving. Institutional entry via the Tracker Fund, possible ETF approvals, and a potential settlement with the SEC all point to increasing confidence in XRP‚Äôs long-term viability. For now, price may be in a holding pattern‚Äîbut behind the scenes, the building blocks for a breakout are falling into place. $SUBBD Token: Your VIP Pass to the Future of AI-Powered Content The content creator economy is worth $85B‚Äîand $SUBBD is aiming to flip it on its head.

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network‚Äôs largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito‚Äôs price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there‚Äôs no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token.

However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment?

New Roadmap Sparks 4% Surge Amidst Mixed Reactions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network price has surged over 4% in the past 24 hours following the launch of its Migration Roadmap. Although the token is showing some signs of recovery across several indicators, it is too soon to confirm an uptrend. Although technical indicators like the Ichimoku Cloud and RSI hint that price might be recovering, it‚Äôs still facing strong resistance that is blocking a clear breakout. Besides, many in the Pi Community are frustrated that the new Migration Roadmap is not clear enough which adds another layer of uncertainty about where the price is headed next. Users Frustated Over Lack Of Details Pi Network released its Mainnet Migration Roadmap , but it lacks specific dates and clear details, leaving users frustrated. The roadmap outlines three phases, but no timelines are given, causing uncertainty. Some users noticed discrepancies in their coin balances, with no way to resolve them. Additionally, the claim that all tokens were minted at genesis has sparked debate, raising concerns about the project‚Äôs transparency. With 108.9 million tokens unlocked this month, users are unsure how the migration will unfold. These issues are weakening trust in the Pi Network. Pi Network Still Faces Resistance It is trading just below the Ichimoku Cloud, a key resistance area which signals that buyers are trying to push the price up. Although the price has been making some higher lows and hinting at a possible recovery, it still has not broken the resistance yet. Besides, the market is still not strongly bullish yet, showing that the short-term momentum is weaker than the medium-term trend, hence its not a clear signal to buy. Traders are being cautious and are waiting for stronger signs before making any big moves. Also, the Ichimoku Cloud is getting thicker and more tilted, which suggests that bigger price swings may be imminent. If Pi breaks above the cloud, it could signal a strong upward trend. However, until thay happens, Pi remains in a vulnerable position with a risk of rejection still likely. Pi Network‚Äôs RSI has bounced back to 53.77 from 32.34, signaling recovery. However, after peaking at 57.25, it has cooled slightly, weakening bullish momentum. The RSI is in neutral-bullish territory, showing moderate strength but still far from overbought levels. If momentum builds, there‚Äôs potential for growth, but caution is stil needed as the trend is not yet solid. Key Resistance Levels Pi Network (PI) is testing key resistance at $0.66. A breakout could push the price to $0.789 and $0.858, possibly reigniting bullish momentum. A successful breakout could possibly push PI to $1.23 or $1.79. However, frustrations over the unclear Migration Roadmap add uncertainty. If PI fails to break $0.66, it may dip toward $0.54 or $0.40. The next few sessions are crucial for determining the token‚Äôs direction, heavily influenced by both technical signals and community sentiment, awaiting a clear breakout or drop. Focus on Consensus 2025 Next With the Consensus 2025 fast approaching, excitement is building in the Pi Network Community. Analyst Dr Altcoin notes that this event is a major chance to promote Pi Network especially as the Pi founder Nicolas Kokkalis is set to share the stage with personalities like Bo Hines and Eric Trump. Consensus 2025 Summit is a huge opportunity to promote Pi Network‚Äîand one of the best so far! I call upon the Pi Core Team to expedite at least the following before the summit: 1.

Dr. Altcoin believes that Consensus 2025 could be a game-changer for Pi Network, only if the Pi Core Team acts fast. He‚Äôs urging them to approve all KYB applications and officially launch DApps in the Pi ecosystem before the event to maximise the opportunity on the global spotlight and boost Pi‚Äôs credibility and growth. The Pi Core Team has under a month to approve KYB and launch DApps before Consensus 2025, as delays have driven some projects to other blockchains. Pi is currently priced around $0.64, but with upcoming developments and potential adoption by big institutions, some believe it could reach $30, although short-term volatility remains a concern.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-20 08:49:14

43566850,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64546,1745139262,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Consolidation Is Nearing an End. Here‚Äôs the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-consolidation-is-nearing-an-end-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has released a new chart-based projection for XRP, suggesting that the digital asset is about to complete a significant consolidation phase. In a tweet that captioned a detailed price chart, Dark Defender stated that XRP‚Äôs ongoing consolidation appears to be in its final stage within the broader monthly structure. As the chart outlines, this phase has been characterized by many lower highs and relatively steady support zones, forming a descending triangle formation that now seems close to a breakout. According to the chart and commentary provided by Dark Defender, the asset is showing signs of preparing for a major impulsive move. The chart starts with a label ‚ÄúImpulsive Wave 1,‚Äù implying the initial move in a five-wave Elliott Wave structure. These projected waves, as drawn in the chart, anticipate a sharp bullish trend, with a notable breakout beyond resistance levels, followed by a strong upward continuation toward higher price targets. Hi all! I hope you are well! #XRP consolidation is nearing an end, and I call this the Final Consolidation, of the Monthly Structure! We can expect the 5 Waves as highlighted below. Resistances: $2.22, $2.30 (Orange Line) Supports: $1.88, $1.63 Targets: $3.75, $5.85‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IfmJlal7Vu ‚Äî Dark Defender (@DefendDark) April 18, 2025 Key Resistance and Support Levels Identified The resistance levels that have been emphasized include $2.22 and $2.30, both aligned with the descending trendline shown in orange. These levels represent key thresholds that XRP must surpass to confirm the beginning of the upward movement. On the downside, support zones are identified at $1.88 and $1.63, reliable floors during the asset‚Äôs consolidation. These technical levels are considered critical to validating the breakout scenario outlined in the chart. If XRP can breach the $2.30 resistance zone with volume and maintain above it, the path toward the higher Fibonacci extension targets becomes more probable. Conversely, a breakdown below the identified support levels would invalidate the bullish outlook and potentially indicate a continuation of the consolidation structure. Projected Wave Structure Targets $3.75 and $5.85 Dark Defender has also outlined longer-term targets based on this projected wave structure. Specifically, the chart indicates potential price levels of $3.75 and $5.85, with the latter corresponding to the 261.80% Fibonacci extension level. These targets are not presented as guarantees, and the tweet includes a disclaimer emphasizing that the information shared is not financial advice and is intended for educational and informational purposes only. The visual analysis shows that the breakout is expected to initiate shortly after XRP completes its current retest of the lower boundary of the consolidation range. The chart suggests that the first impulsive breakout will encounter resistance near $2.30 for a rapid rally toward $3.75. A brief correction is expected afterward, followed by a push toward the $5.85 level, completing what is labeled ‚ÄúWave 5.‚Äù Final Monthly Consolidation May Be Ending Dark Defender refers to this stage as the ‚ÄúFinal Consolidation‚Äù in the monthly chart, indicating a belief that the asset‚Äôs lengthy period of price compression is reaching its endpoint. This viewpoint aligns with the visual cues presented in the chart, particularly the tightening price action near long-term resistance and the growing likelihood of a breakout. Overall, Dark Defender‚Äôs analysis emphasizes a technically driven outlook for XRP , with clearly defined resistance and support levels, and specific price targets should the forecasted impulsive waves materialize. While the chart does not guarantee outcomes, it offers a structured roadmap for how XRP may behave in the coming weeks, based on historical price action and technical indicators.

Network activity is hemorrhaging, and momentum is slipping. Ethereum has become locked in a fight for its future. Without meaningful change, Ethereum risks becoming inaccessible to the builders and users it needs to thrive. Ethereum needs fresh ideas to bolster the ecosystem out of its slump, unify it, and genuinely support innovation. Enter based applications (bApps), which are any application or service that uses the Ethereum validator set for security. Inspired by the based movement, bApps enable any project to bootstrap directly from the Ethereum layer 1 (L1), enabling interoperable, scalable and cost-effective development. High stakes and high costs The recent decline in network activity highlights a deep issue across Ethereum, and it boils down to UX. The race to scale a blockchain isn‚Äôt just about TVL and transactions per second (TPS). It‚Äôs about the experience of users and developers who co-create the ecosystem. Ease of development and interoperable developer ecosystems and applications are paramount. Improving the developer experience is crucial for improving user experience, which drives adoption. Today, builders are presented with two options. The first and more popular one is restaking, which has become the default mechanism for bootstrapping new services by locking up validators‚Äô withdrawal keys or large amounts of capital for security. That leaves teams with only one other inconvenient alternative: self-bootstrapping. Building a validator set from scratch is resource-heavy, technically complex and often starts off centralized. Both choices are limiting for builders and don‚Äôt solve the fragmentation problems we see today in Ethereum. It is not just builders but validators that are affected by this system. In the current restaking setup, validators who want to earn more yield by supporting new services must restake , lock up their withdrawal keys, and take on additional risk. By locking up withdrawal keys to secure applications with slashable capital, validators are exposed to cascading risks, which, at scale, could affect Ethereum itself ‚Äî a core departure from Ethereum‚Äôs founding vision. bApps are more secure bApps provide a third, more accessible option for self-bootstrapping and restaking. Using based security infrastructure drastically lowers entry barriers for any size protocol to build securely and sustainably, all while preserving the traditional network effects of Ethereum. Validators are incentivized to join through risk-free yield opportunities; developers can affordably access security to build; and users benefit from a unified and interoperable ecosystem. Recent: SSV Network to create ‚Äòbased‚Äô apps infrastructure for Ethereum Mission-critical services like rollups, bridges and oracles don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel. They simply plug into an existing, trusted security model. Using Ethereum validators as a primary security base, any out-of-protocol service can inherit the Ethereum L1‚Äôs decentralization and Sybil resistance. It‚Äôs also possible to extend this paradigm beyond Ethereum, enabling other L1 validators to secure bApps. This potentially turns bApps into a marketplace for multichain security, dramatically reducing the complexity (and cost) for developers and raising the bar for the entire ecosystem, offering a ‚Äúbased‚Äù path forward. bApps empower validators to earn more with their existing stake. By primarily using the validator principle as non-slashable security, validators can opt into many services through their existing Ethereum validator role without needing to restake or supply extra stakes. This would encourage broader validator participation, especially from smaller or more risk-averse operators, which is excellent considering solo stakers are an important ecosystem pillar. bApps unlock scalability bApps also revolutionize Ethereum‚Äôs current bootstrapping ecosystem, which relies heavily on slashable capital. In restaking, one participant‚Äôs gain may directly correspond to another‚Äôs loss, creating a zero-sum model. Building a competitive dynamic where participants must add or reallocate resources instead of sharing them, consequently working against new entrants by creating competition for limited attention and resources. The based economy, conversely, promotes an infinite-sum game, transforming competition for resources into a synergistic environment where new applications, services and participants increase the overall value of the platform. Each new validator increases security for bApps, and each new bApp provides new opportunities for validators. This infinitely scalable model breaks free from the limitations of a zero-sum model, enabling seamless bootstrapping, rewarding innovation and building more secure, inclusive and resilient ecosystems. Unifying Ethereum‚Äôs fractured ecosystem For Ethereum to grow, fragmentation has to be addressed. Builders need building blocks, which need to be secure, low-cost, interoperable and scalable. Think about what cloud computing did for Web2. BApps offer just that ‚Äî by introducing an infinite-sum game, they unlock scalability and provide a safe and affordable way to bootstrap with Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake network. If Ethereum is to be the foundation of tomorrow‚Äôs decentralized world, it must empower the builders of today. The way forward is to solve Ethereum‚Äôs user and developer experience problem with a based infrastructure. Going based is the clear solution. Opinion by: Alon Muroch, founder of SSV Labs.

The broader market remains under pressure as global uncertainty escalates, largely fueled by ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Last week, US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China, intensifying concerns about an extended trade conflict that could destabilize global financial markets. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades At Bear Market Lows: Fundamentals Signal Major Undervaluation In this high-stakes environment, Ethereum‚Äôs price action is drawing close attention from investors and analysts. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that historically, the best Ethereum buying opportunities have emerged when the price drops below the lower MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Price Band‚Äîa level that signals potential undervaluation. Notably, ETH is now trading precisely in that zone. This alignment between technical conditions and macroeconomic instability suggests that Ethereum could be entering a phase of accumulation, with long-term investors looking to capitalize on discounted prices. However, sustained upward momentum will depend on whether bulls can overcome immediate resistance and whether macro conditions improve. The coming days could prove pivotal for ETH as it tests both technical and psychological thresholds. Ethereum Dips Into Historical Opportunity Zone Ethereum is currently trading below key resistance levels after enduring several weeks of selling pressure and weak market performance. Since losing the crucial $2,000 support level, ETH has fallen roughly 21%, a clear indication that bulls have yet to regain control. Broader macroeconomic pressures, especially rising global tensions and uncertain trade conditions between the US and China, have further dampened market sentiment. These conditions have driven many investors to exit riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, leading to elevated volatility and reduced market participation. Despite this downtrend, some analysts believe Ethereum could be nearing a pivotal turnaround zone. According to Martinez, one of the best historical signals for Ethereum accumulation has been price action dipping below the lower bound of the MVRV Price Band‚Äîa metric that compares market value to realized value to assess whether an asset is over- or undervalued. Currently, Ethereum is trading beneath that lower band. Martinez emphasizes that this positioning has typically preceded strong upside reversals, especially during periods of extreme market pessimism. While short-term volatility may persist, ETH‚Äôs entry into this zone could present a rare opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate at historically discounted levels‚Äîif market conditions stabilize and sentiment shifts.

ETH Stalls In Tight Range Ethereum is currently trading at $1,610 after nearly a week of low volatility and sideways action. Since last Tuesday, ETH has remained locked in a tight range between $1,550 and $1,630, reflecting the market‚Äôs uncertainty and hesitation to take a clear directional stance. This narrow trading zone highlights a period of price compression, often a precursor to a larger move in either direction. For bulls to regain momentum and shift sentiment, Ethereum must reclaim the $1,700 level and push decisively above the $2,000 mark. These levels not only serve as key psychological barriers but also represent critical zones of previous support that have now turned into resistance. A breakout above $2,000 would likely trigger renewed buying interest and set the stage for a potential recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stalls In Tight Range ‚Äì Big Price Move Incoming? However, if bearish pressure builds and the $1,550 floor is breached, Ethereum could quickly test the $1,500 support zone. A breakdown below that level would confirm further downside risk, potentially accelerating sell-offs and deepening the current correction. Until a breakout or breakdown occurs, traders should prepare for more consolidation and volatility as the market awaits a macro or technical catalyst.

Artificial intelligence has become a powerful force in the finance ecosystem, offering faster, data-driven insights that promise to improve investments, lending, and risk management. From AI advisors that personalize financial strategies for both companies and individuals to highly advanced trading systems that make data-driven decisions in microseconds, the financial AI sector has a lot of room to grow. You might also like: AI is creating a new class of entrepreneurs, and you‚Äôre either in or out | Opinion But there‚Äôs one major problem: bias. Despite offering speed, precision, and what seems like objectivity, financial AI systems carry the same bias that the industry has been trying to eliminate for decades. For example, according to Lehigh University, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 Turbo large language models‚Äîsimulating an AI mortgage advisor or decision system‚Äî required certain demographics of applicants to have 120 credit points higher than white applicants to receive the same approval despite having the same income, credit history, and debt levels. This bias doesn‚Äôt just affect the traditional financial markets but also the decentralized finance and crypto ecosystems. Take AI-powered market forecasting platforms, for example. Since their data is based on price history, news sentiment, or social trends, these platforms could sometimes overreact to market anomalies‚Äîcrypto is full of black swan events like the Terra collapse, FTX crash, or large penalties from the regulators. Consequently, these prediction tools can become over-aggressive or even overweight social trends and chatter, leading to poor signals and predictions. Blockchain, XAI to the rescue The limitations and opaque nature of many AI systems prevent them from becoming fully transparent and accountable. Some even call them black boxes since AI models usually have little to no transparency. Notably, the decisions made by AI tools within the crypto space are not usually explainable‚Äîthis makes it hard for users to understand how decisions are made. The absence of standardized auditing protocols for AI systems would also result in inconsistent assessments and potential oversight of critical issues.‚Äã Integrating blockchain technology with Explainable AI, or XAI for short, can tackle this issue by providing the immutability and transparency that come with decentralized ledgers‚Äîpotentially improving the auditing methods as well since the auditors will have complete access to the platform‚Äôs data and underlying algorithms. XAI models are already getting increased attention since they ensure the decision-making process is fair and ethical in addition to being efficient. Blockchain technology can complement XAI‚Äôs fairness by creating immutable records of AI decision-making processes, ensuring that every action is traceable and verifiable. This will promote trust and accountability. Blockchains operate in a trustless manner. This doesn‚Äôt mean the technology cannot be trusted, but it suggests that third parties or central authorities won‚Äôt be needed to confirm any decisions. Decentralization removes the need for a centralized entity to oversee the processes, thanks to the smart contracts that function autonomously. When a model changes or outputs a decision, the lack of logs and version control can cause trust issues with most of the AI platforms. Blockchain technology timestamps the records and data on an immutable ledger. FICO, a credit scoring company, has used blockchain to log AI model decisions, so regulators can trace how decisions like credit approvals were made. The company received the ‚ÄúTech of the Future‚ÄîBlockchain and Tokenisation‚Äù award at the Banking Tech Awards in London last year. From theory to practice Blockchains and decentralized finance protocols have the opportunity to bake fairness, transparency, and accountability into AI models‚Äîsomething traditional financial companies have been struggling with. Combining XAI with on-chain verification can transform how decisions are made and trusted in the web3 ecosystem. For example, using XAI to explain the voting of decentralized autonomous organizations could help users have a better understanding of the consequences of their choices. A more advanced utility would be using XAI for risk assessment in lending DeFi protocols. Mixing XAI with blockchain technology could also be a powerful on-chain surveillance and manipulation detection tool. AI is good at analyzing patterns of sandwich attacks, MEV exploitation, or wash trading. This could help in finding market anomalies. Some web3 projects are already trying to enhance AI transparency. SingularityNET, for instance, focuses on making AI processes auditable. Another platform called Ocean Protocol tracks the origins of the data, ensuring trustworthiness and traceability. Conclusion At this point, it‚Äôs just the beginning of the integration of blockchain and AI. Researchers are now exploring hybrid models that combine blockchain‚Äôs integrity, XAI‚Äôs clarity, and bias-detection tools into systems that can monitor and potentially correct themselves. But technology alone won‚Äôt fix this. It will also need attention from regulators, scrutiny from users, and humility from the developers building these systems. If the 2008 financial crisis taught us anything, it‚Äôs that blind trust in complex and centralized tools is dangerous. Most notably, smart doesn‚Äôt always mean fair. As the era of mainstream AI surfaces, users must also look for transparency in addition to efficiency. Read more: Who controls your digital identity?

Nearly 90% of Bitcoin ( BTC ) service providers registered in El Salvador are not operating, according to a recent report by El Mundo, which cited data from the Central Reserve Bank, showing that out of 181 companies officially registered to offer Bitcoin services in the country, 161 are marked as ‚Äúnon-operating.‚Äù That‚Äôs about 89% of the total. Only 20 firms are still active. These include the government-backed Chivo Wallet, among others. El Mundo adds that at least 22 of the inactive providers may have failed to meet the regulatory standards outlined in Article 4 of the Bitcoin Law Regulation, which requires crypto businesses to operate with ‚Äúhigh standards of integrity and honesty.‚Äù Providers are supposed to have anti-money laundering programs, clear records of assets and liabilities, and cybersecurity systems adapted to the nature of the services offered. It‚Äôs unclear how many others are behind on compliance, or whether enforcement is underway. Breaking paradigms of past The numbers paint a stark picture of the current state of Bitcoin in El Salvador. Back in 2021, the country became the first in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. It was a move that drew global headlines and crypto industry praise, but also concern from traditional financial institutions. President Nayib Bukele, a self-described ‚ÄúCEO of El Salvador,‚Äù argued that the policy would attract tech investment, lower remittance costs, and bring banking services to the unbanked. Como toda innovaci√≥n, el proceso del #Bitcoin en El Salvador tiene una curva de aprendizaje. Todo camino hacia el futuro es as√≠ y no se lograr√° todo en un d√≠a, ni en un mes. Pero debemos romper los paradigmas del pasado. El Salvador tiene derecho a avanzar hacia el primer mundo. ‚Äî Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 6, 2021 The law made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. It also required all businesses to accept it as payment, unless they lacked the means to do so. The government even launched its own digital wallet, Chivo, and handed out a $30 bonus in BTC to citizens who signed up. Still, things didn‚Äôt go smoothly. The wallet faced technical issues, adoption was limited, and a year later, studies suggested that most Salvadorans had stopped using it altogether. In a commentary for crypto.news, Hon Ng, chief legal officer of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, which also secured crypto license in El Salvador, agreed with the data from El Mundo, saying it ‚Äúhighlights some significant challenges in the rollout of the Bitcoin Law.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith over 88% of Bitcoin-related companies still non-operational, it‚Äôs evident that there are infrastructural and institutional hurdles to address. While the legislation shows El Salvador‚Äôs vision to become a ‚Äòcrypto hub,‚Äô further regulatory development may be required to effectively support the local ecosystem.‚Äù Hon Ng You might also like: IMF now officially tracks Bitcoin in cross-border finance ‚Äî just weeks after warning El Salvador to scale back IMF‚Äôs opposition By 2022, the Bitcoin Law had become a major sticking point in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ‚Äî an essential financial backer for El Salvador ‚Äî as the country sought a $1.3 billion agreement. The IMF, in turn, made no secret of its concerns over the policy. It warned of risks to financial stability, consumer protection, and the country‚Äôs overall fiscal health. In a public statement, the IMF recommended that El Salvador ‚Äúnarrow the scope of the Bitcoin law by removing Bitcoin‚Äôs legal tender status.‚Äù For a while, the Bukele administration resisted. But eventually, the country‚Äôs Legislative Assembly introduced quiet but significant changes. The state was no longer required to be involved in Bitcoin transactions. Businesses were no longer required to accept BTC. In effect, Bitcoin stopped being enforced as legal tender, although the government didn‚Äôt say it in so many words. Still, the government hasn‚Äôt backed away from Bitcoin completely. Quite the opposite. President Bukele has continued to publicly announce Bitcoin purchases, and says the country now holds more than 6,100 coins ‚Äî valued at over $500 million. He recently claimed the portfolio was in the green. But the exact source of funding remains murky. Critics worry that the state may still be using public funds for purchases, something the IMF had reportedly asked El Salvador to avoid. Questions to be answered Now, with the majority of registered Bitcoin providers inactive, it‚Äôs unclear how much of the country‚Äôs crypto infrastructure remains functional. The registry data doesn‚Äôt explain why so many firms have gone quiet. Bitget‚Äôs Hon Ng told crypto.news that the low low rate of active providers might be a ‚Äúcombination of several factors, with a significant issue being the gap between the legal framework and the actual business environment in El Salvador.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlthough the Bitcoin Law is intended to be progressive, some aspects may not fully appreciate how startups and mid-sized financial service providers operate in the country.‚Äù Hon Ng Ng went further to note that the Bitcoin Law mandates that companies establish tailored cybersecurity programmes, adding that many crypto firms, especially small-medium sized firms, ‚Äúlack the resources to meet these standards, particularly with the current uncertainty in user demand.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis, combined with regulatory ambiguity and limited mainstream adoption, can lead to situations where companies initially engage with optimism but later become inactive as they encounter practical challenges.‚Äù Hon Ng The government‚Äôs Bitcoin Office is still promoting the initiative online, and there are still plans ‚Äî at least officially ‚Äî for the so-called Volcano Bonds, a Bitcoin-backed tokenized bond offering backed by stablecoin issuer Tether. But those plans have been delayed multiple times. And outside of Chivo and a few private platforms, there‚Äôs little sign of a vibrant ecosystem. El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin story may not be over. But nearly three years in, with just 20 providers still running and many others falling short of regulatory standards, the country‚Äôs big crypto experiment looks a lot smaller than it once did.

In a new interview with Raoul Pal on the Real Vision YouTube channel, Silbert says that he‚Äôs created a new venture called Yuma, which exclusively focuses on Bittensor ( TAO ), a decentralized blockchain-based network built for a global, collaborative marketplace for artificial intelligence (AI). Says the Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO, ‚ÄúI started looking across the whole decentralized AI space and started digging in on Bittensor, and I very quickly came to the conclusion that from a theme or era perspective, this was the next big era for crypto. You had the Bitcoin and the Ethereum and the NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and you had the layer 2s and DeFi (decentralized finance)‚Ä¶ I think this is the next big investment theme for crypto, and there are a number of projects that have launched. We‚Äôve backed a number of them, but the one that over the past year or year and a half that has reached escape velocity is Bittensor, and so I decided last year, we‚Äôre going to do with Bittensor ‚Äì try to do with Bittensor what we did with Bitcoin. We‚Äôre going to invest in it, we‚Äôre going to build on it, we‚Äôre going to help educate, create awareness, create access.

Silbert says Yuma has focused on developing an ‚Äúaccelerator‚Äù to easily build new subnets on Bitensor. He also says one of his investment goals is finding the ‚ÄúCoinbase,‚Äù ‚ÄúBitgo,‚Äù or ‚ÄúChainalysis‚Äù of the Bittensor ecosystem.

The firm acquired 2,949 BTC, signaling renewed institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency amid global trade tensions and an approaching Easter weekend. According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain , which cited Arkham Intelligence data, Abraxas‚Äô latest purchase included over $45 million in Bitcoin from Binance on April 18 alone. MicroStrategy‚Äôs $285M Bitcoin Buy Sets the Stage for Institutional Accumulation The acquisition follows closely behind MicroStrategy‚Äôs announcement that it had bought $285 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $82,618 per coin. The move by Michael Saylor‚Äôs company further reinforced the bullish stance held by major corporate players. The broader accumulation trend among institutional investors and crypto whales is continuing. Recent data shows that these large holders are collectively buying up more than three times the amount of new Bitcoin being mined each year. Despite such accumulation, analysts are keeping a close eye on medium-term holders‚Äîthose who typically hold Bitcoin for three to six months‚Äîwho have recently released over 170,000 BTC into circulation. Whales/Institutions continue to accumulate $BTC ! Abraxas Capital related wallet withdrew another 505 $BTC ($42.64M) from #Binance 9 hours ago.

The past two weekends have seen notable disruptions in the crypto markets. On April 13, the price of Mantra (OM) plunged over 90% in a single day, sparking manipulation concerns. A week earlier, Bitcoin had dipped below $75,000 as global investors reacted to a record $5 trillion sell-off in the S&P 500. As reported, 10x Research‚Äôs head of research Markus Thielen has argued that Bitcoin may be entering a period of extended consolidation . In a recent market note, Thielen warned that short-term technical signals are painting a more cautious picture, even as many analysts forecast new all-time highs by mid-year. Thielen pointed to the Bitcoin stochastic oscillator, a technical indicator that measures momentum, suggesting the market is displaying traits more consistent with a late-cycle top than the beginning of a new bull run. Lyn Alden Says Bitcoin Would Be Higher if Not for Trump‚Äôs Tariff Shock Prominent macroeconomist Lyn Alden believes Bitcoin is on track to finish 2025 above its current price of around $85,000. ‚ÄúBefore all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,‚Äù Alden said during a recent interview . While she still expects Bitcoin to post gains by year-end, Alden noted that the tariffs introduced in February have tempered her earlier bullish outlook. Alden explained that a major liquidity boost could push Bitcoin toward more ambitious targets. Such a scenario might occur if the U.S. bond market faces a crisis, prompting the Federal Reserve to respond with quantitative easing or yield curve control. Despite current macro headwinds, Alden believes there is still a ‚Äúgood chance‚Äù Bitcoin surpasses the $100,000 mark in 2025. However, she warned that global market volatility remains a key obstacle, especially because Bitcoin trades continuously ‚Äî unlike traditional equity markets with limited trading hours. ‚ÄúBecause it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,‚Äù she said.

While Cardano, priced at $0.61, has built a solid foundation for smart contracts, Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining attention for its innovative dual-lending model and DeFi potential. Phase 4 presale is currently offering tokens at $0.025, with strong investor support driving the acquisition of over 8,400 buyers, raising a total of $6.9 million. Investors participating in this phase stand to earn a 140% profit when the token reaches $0.06 at its exchange launch. So, MUTM is the better bet offering long-term stability or the chance to capitalize on a fresh, high-growth opportunity. Mutuum Finance Presale The investor support for Mutuum Finance Phase 4 presale continues to grow steadily throughout its development cycle. Those investing in the platform due to its sustainable DeFi solution which uses a development scale beyond meme coin market volatility. Phase 4 has collected more than $6.9 million from investors while gathering over 8,400 token holders up to this point. Early participants find Phase 4 tokens highly appealing because they are available at $0.025 during the ongoing presale. The platform launch will raise token prices to $0.06 thereby delivering a 140% profit to Phase 4 investors who purchased at $0.025. The analysts anticipate MUTM will achieve a listing price of $3 which would significantly enhance its market value. Phase 5 investors can anticipate another price enhancement to $0.03 which indicates future price growth for MUTM. The updated dashboard of Mutuum Finance presents a leader ranking of token holders where participants who stay in their position earn bonus tokens to boost long-term investor interest. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance delivers a top-notch decentralized lending platform which allows complete user ownership of assets. The non-custodial liquidity protocol lets users receive passive income through its borrowing participants who can access funds by providing assets worth more than their loan amounts. The platform implements an automatic interest rate control system which helps operate the ecosystem in a sustainable and optimized manner. Mutuum‚Äôs unique dual-lending framework combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems for maximum flexibility: P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: The decentralized framework removes middle actors to establish peer-to-peer lender-borrower linkages that grant borrowers and lenders total freedom and command over the process. Mutuum Finance gives security and transparency complete priority status in its platform operations. Open-source smart contracts linked with third-party audits secure full transparency on the platform operation. The MUTM token delivers dual benefits including price growth together with passive income streams through a strategic buyback program that secures long-term value increase. To expand accessibility and liquidity, Mutuum Finance plans to implement multi-chain support, including both EVM and non-EVM blockchains. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance seeks to boost community expansion by providing a $100,000 giveaway that distributes $10,000 MUTM tokens to ten fortunate participants. Through its referral system Mutuum Finance encourages members to recruit new participants which helps the community grow organically while stimulating natural growth. Early investors and users obtain unique rewards together with additional benefits because of the ecosystem growth which results from their participation. While Cardano (ADA) offers scalability and smart contracts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a high-growth DeFi opportunity with its dual-lending model. MUTM‚Äôs presale has raised over $6.9 million, and early investors stand to gain 140% ROI. MUTM offers a promising path for long-term growth, making it a compelling choice for those seeking high returns in DeFi.

According to the head of the blockchain investment firm, the push from the BIS to isolate crypto markets is dangerous. According to Perkins, the controversial recommendations made on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and stablecoins pose a danger to the entire financial ecosystem. ‚ÄúMany of their recommendations and conclusions ‚Äî perhaps due to a mix of fear, arrogance, or ignorance ‚Äî are completely uninformed and, frankly, dangerous,‚Äù Perkins said. Perkins was replying to an April 15 report by the BIS, titled ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance: Functions and Financial Stability Implications.‚Äù CoinFund president says BIS recommendations expose TradFi to risks In his post on X, the CoinFund president mentioned that crypto is not communism, pushing back against the call by the BIS for a containment approach to isolate crypto from the traditional finance sector and the broader economy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the new internet that provides anyone with a connection access to financial services. You cannot control it anymore than you control the internet,‚Äù he said. The @BIS_org just published a new paper, ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies and decentralised finance: functions and financial stability implication.‚Äù The good news is that the authors finally realize that advancements in crypto (including the growth of ETFs, stablecoins and tokenized real world‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Christopher Perkins ü¶Öüåé‚öìÔ∏èNYC (@perkinscr97) April 19, 2025 The CoinFund president noted that the containment approach proposed by the BIS toward digital assets could open the traditional finance system to massive liquidity risks of unimaginable scale, noting that the crypto market operates 24/7, while traditional finance systems shut down after trading hours. ‚ÄúIf implemented they will cause‚Äìnot mitigate‚Äìthe systemic risk they seek to prevent,‚Äù Perkins added. The BIS report warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and DeFi have reached a critical mass, with investor protection becoming something of a concern for regulators globally. The report also mentioned that the size of the crypto market shows that authorities need to be worried about the stability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy. The bank also highlighted stablecoins as a means through which users have been transferring value within crypto. Industry participants push back on the BIS report The CoinFund president also slated the BIS‚Äô claims that the decentralized finance sector presents a significant challenge. He argued that it represents a big improvement over the opacity and imbalances of the traditional finance system. Discussing the BIS‚Äô claims of the anonymity of developers, Perkins questioned its relevance. ‚ÄúSorry, but when was the last time a TradFi company published a list of its developers? Sure, public companies provide a degree of disclosures and transparency, but they seem to be dying off in favor of private markets,‚Äù he said. He also criticized the concerns around stablecoins, especially the fact that the report mentioned that it could lead to macroeconomic instability in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe. ‚ÄúIf there is demand for USD stablecoins and it helps improve the condition of anyone in the developing world, perhaps that is a good thing?! Are you suggesting that the economic conditions in countries like this are acceptable and should be perpetuated? No, people across the world deserve access to basic financial services,‚Äù he said. The CoinFund president was not the only one who had issues with the report, with Lightspark co-founder Christian Catalini also weighing in. He criticized the report, giving compelling arguments on some loopholes he found in the report. Discussing stablecoins, he said, ‚ÄúThe paper frets, regulators pace, and developers keep building. With sensible rules, a digital dollar can settle on weekends and chat with smart contracts‚Äîperks that make CBDC pilots look like dial‚Äëup internet.‚Äù He summed up the report with an analogy: ‚ÄúThink: writing parking regulations for a fleet of self‚Äëdriving drones ‚Äî earnest work, two technological leaps behind.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

El Salvador Stats: Only 11% of firms are active 22 firms cited for non-compliance Regulatory friction slowing adoption despite national BTC push Bitcoin Consolidates Below $85K‚ÄîKey Breakdown Test in Play Bitcoin is sitting at a technical inflection point. A confirmed break below $84,600 could pave the way for a deeper slide toward $83,340. On the other hand, a push back above $85,500 would invalidate the bearish thesis and restore bullish momentum. Trade Setup: Short Entry: Below $84,600 Targets: $83,990 ‚Üí $83,340 Long Entry: Only above $85,500 with volume confirmation Stop Loss: Above $85,500 (shorts), below $84,000 (longs) With macro headlines heating up and institutional players entering the fray, traders should tread carefully.

BTC Bull Presale Crosses $4.82M as Staking Yields Hit 85%‚ÄîNext Price Hike Near With Bitcoin hovering around the $85,000 level, investor interest in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to grow.

What makes BTC Bull stand out is its real utility: every time Bitcoin hits key price milestones, $BTCBULL holders receive airdropped rewards in real BTC. This unique feature has attracted crypto-native investors looking to align their meme coin exposure with actual Bitcoin upside. Stake BTCBULL for 85% APY + Real Bitcoin Rewards BTC Bull‚Äôs high-yield staking program remains a top driver of demand. Investors can earn 85% APY by staking their $BTCBULL tokens and still retain the ability to unstake at any time‚Äîoffering both yield and flexibility.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs price decoupled from a bad week in stocks and added 11%. By comparison, Ethereum prices jumped by just 6%. The following five items are pertinent to Solana‚Äôs fast capital gains in mid-April. 1. 2025‚Äôs Bullish SOL Falling Wedge Pattern $SOL || Towards $250 Remember we bought Solana at ~$100 #Solana pic.twitter.com/qgelpcM1JR ‚Äî Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) April 17, 2025 In mid-April, the chart shows classic converging trend lines, with the big upswing beginning the second week of the month really pulling the Solana price outlook‚Äôs borderlines into that bullish formation. The falling wedge pattern is a classic bullish signal. They often precede a bull run beginning near the time when the trend lines converge on the chart.¬†Solana‚Äôs 2025 falling wedge shows up on the 1Y view starting in late January. The trend lines of support tracing low price outliers came in higher as the weeks go on, while the trend lines of resistance tracing high price outliers came in lower.¬†They converge right around the time of Solana‚Äôs mid-April price rally. Furthermore, Solana prices also threw up a cup and handle signal on the 1M window, concurrent with the bullish flip out of the falling wedge trend. It also exhibits the classic declining daily trade volume during the handle formation. The 10-day little teapot formation began on Wednesday, Apr. 2 and ended Saturday, Apr. 12, followed by the textbook downward drifting side channel for a 4-day handle until Wednesday, Apr. 16, followed by a bullish test to rally mid-week. The April chart for SOL tokens also features a neat 4-day mini-cup and handle within the handle of the 10-day teapot. So the market technical indicators are beautifully bullish this month. 2.

Blockchain insights firm Glassnode noted on Apr. 15 that the median cost basis, or the price at the most recent trade that shows up for the most SOL tokens, was $129.79. That median cost basis near the average trading price mid-April could work as an investor bias and market price ratchet locking in support for more growth at current price levels, the blockchain intelligence firm noted. ‚ÄúThis zone could act as a support during future drawdowns, reflecting high investor engagement at this price level,‚Äù Glassnode wrote. 3.

In April, Janover hired former Kraken C-execs to build a corporate stockpile of Solana, following the financial strategy set by Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy with corporate Bitcoin financing. The Florida company bought an initial tranche of some $20 million worth of SOL tokens.

On the regulatory front, Slovenia plans a 25% crypto tax by 2026, and New Hampshire advances a bill to hold Bitcoin reserves. Let‚Äôs dig deeper. Bitcoin JPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin has failed to meet expectations as a safe-haven asset , as gold and traditional assets attract inflows amid global uncertainty. Business Spar has become the first supermarket in Switzerland to begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC), marking a significant milestone in the country‚Äôs progressive approach to digital asset adoption. Web3 Layer 2 payment platform, Fuse, has struck a strategic collaboration with Web 2.0 cybersecurity firm, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, to leverage AI to provide real-time detection and prevention across the Fuse ecosystem.

Coin value has decreased up to a $5.27 low in the last 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency shed a minor 1.86% of its value today.

Uniswap price analysis on a daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed a declining trend for the day. UNI/USD price has decreased to $5.27 throughout the day. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a slow downswing. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the volatility.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $6.115. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $4.669. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is situated in the neutral region. Currently at 42.06 and slowly moving downwards, this marks a bearish trend. This declining movement is represented by a bearish slope.

Uniswap price analysis on a 4-hour chart In contrast to the 1-day price chart, the four-hour price analysis of the Uniswap coin confirms an upward trend in the market.

Uniswap price analysis gives out a bearish prediction with respect to the ongoing market events. The UNI/USD value has decreased to $5.27 following the latest bearish turn. The cryptocurrency lost up to 1.89% of its value through the day. Technical indicators give out a strong bearish verdict regarding the market conditions; the price charts are also in support of sellers. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.59 level by 2027 and above $48.41 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a decreasing phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are losing value, and so is UNI. The cryptocurrency lost more than 1.89 percent of its value over the last 24 hours, and its price has decreased to $5.27. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $11.17, while the average price is expected to be around $9.31. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading near the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $8.3; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $48.41 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

AI Companions ( AIC ) tokens jumped by over 40% to $0.2120, its highest point since March 30 and 70% above its lowest point this month. AI Companions price chart | Source: crypto.news Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) price rose for four consecutive weeks, reaching a high of $0.5730, its highest swing since March 26. Render ( RNDR ) token jumped to $4.32, also up by double digits from the year-to-date low. Worldcoin ( WLD ) price rose by 7%, while Tars AI jumped by about 60%. The total market cap of all AI tokens tracked by CoinGecko has jumped by 5.6% in the last 24 hours to $22.20 billion. These AI tokens jumped after a CoinGecko report showed that AI was one of the most popular themes in the crypto market. The Artificial Intelligence theme had a 14.4% share, while AI agents had 10.1%. Combined, the figure was higher than the meme coin interest of 16.5%. You might also like: EOS price prediction: Is there still hope for this ‚ÄòEthereum killer‚Äô? AI tokens and stocks are losing traction Recently, however, there are signs that the AI theme is losing traction in the stock and crypto market. Popular AI stocks like NVIDIA, AMD, SoundHound, and Bigbear AI have all plunged by over 20% from their peak levels. Similarly, AI tokens like Render, AIC, TAI, WLD, and FET have all plunged by over 50% from their highest points this year. Their decline has mirrored the performance of the broader crypto market. There are concerns that the AI bubble that has been inflating in the past few years is about to deflate. One possible sign for this is that Microsoft has started pausing its data center expansion in places like the United States, India, and Indonesia. Another concern is the oversupply of AI models. While US AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and Grok are the most popular, China has many more, including DeepSeek, Baidu Ernie, Alibaba Qwen, and ByteDance‚Äôs Doubao. It is unclear whether these AI tokens like AI Companions, Tars AI, Worldcoin, and FET will continue rising since this rebound may be part of a dead cat bounce. A sustained recovery will depend on the performance of the crypto market. A strong Bitcoin ( BTC ) rebound, as we predicted , will point to more gains for most altcoins.

33767162,[object Object],1745143215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Whales Could Drive Next Wave Of Price Crashes Amid Massive Dumps,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-could-drive-next-wave-of-price-crashes-amid-massive-dumps/,"On-chain data has raised red flags across the Dogecoin ecosystem as some whale wallets shed their holdings at an alarming rate. According to Santiment data, noted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, holders of between 10 million and 100 million DOGE have offloaded over 570 million coins in the past week alone, a signal that could foreshadow intensified price volatility and downside pressure in the coming week. Dogecoin Whales Quietly Dump As Price Struggles At $0.155 The chart shared by Martinez on social media platform X shows a steady and persistent decline in whale holdings from April 10 through April 17, 2025. This group of wallets, holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE tokens each, plays an important role in price action due to their capacity to move massive volumes. Considering the current price range of Dogecoin, the smallest holder in the cohort would hold around 10 million tokens, currently worth about $1.58 million. Over the course of the past week, their combined holdings dropped from above 24.3 billion DOGE tokens to just under 23.8 billion tokens, corresponding with a sharp reduction in Dogecoin‚Äôs price from around $0.165 to the current $0.155. This sort of movement suggests that these Dogecoin holders have most likely moved their tokens from self-storage into crypto exchanges. Price Impact Could Extend If Market Sentiment Weakens Whale distribution can precede strong market corrections, especially when trading volumes are not high enough to absorb the sudden influx of supply. The timing of this whale activity is also important, considering the fact that Dogecoin had been consolidating near a key support zone at $0.155 after a failed attempt to sustain a breakout beyond $0.17 earlier in the week. The latest data indicates that rather than accumulating at these lower levels, some whale addresses are exiting their positions, suggesting their confidence in a rebound may be fading . If this pattern of whale holding decline continues to unfold in the coming days, Dogecoin could be in for a deeper correction, with the price likely to revisit critical support zones at $0.144 or possibly even as low as $0.138 in the coming week. This retest of lower support ranges will be crucial, as whale accumulations will be necessary here in order to get a rebound . If a rebound does happen in this range, short-term bullish targets to watch in this case would be at $0.1607 and also at $0.1670. Interestingly, the challenge isn‚Äôt just limited to Dogecoin, as the wider crypto market has witnessed selloffs from some whales in the past week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.1584. The recent trading hours have been characterized by a brief push above the $0.155 support zone.
