Speaking at the XRPL Apex event, Garlinghouse offered a forecast that, within the next five years, XRPL could facilitate as much as 14% of the total transaction volume currently processed by SWIFT, the widely used global interbank messaging system. Garlinghouse emphasized that the real challenge in cross-border payments lies in liquidity, not messaging. He pointed out that while SWIFT remains essential for moving information between financial institutions, its primary function is ultimately to support the transfer of actual monetary value. He argued that blockchain platforms like XRPL are better positioned to streamline this function through native liquidity and real-time settlement capabilities. Quantifying the 14% Projection Following the CEO’s statement, a user on X known as “XRPMillionaire” used xAI’s Grok to break down the implications. Based on SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion in annual transaction volume, 14% would represent $21 trillion processed by XRPL each year. This would amount to roughly $58 billion in daily transactions. If this market share were to be achieved gradually over five years, it would imply a steady increase of 2.8% annually, or approximately $4.2 trillion processed per year. Market Reactions and Price Estimates These projections have led to renewed optimism within the XRP community, especially regarding the potential for long-term value appreciation. Despite XRP trading at around $2.13 and still sitting below its all-time high set several years ago, many investors and analysts now see room for significant price increases if such utility materializes. Several valuation models have emerged in response to this outlook. One analysis projects a potential XRP price of $12 if liquidity demand rises in proportion to transaction volume. This estimate assumes the token would be used and recycled approximately 30 times per year, necessitating a liquidity base of around $700 billion to support the full $21 trillion annual volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other forecasts, which account for increasing institutional interest and the speculative nature of the crypto market, suggest that XRP could trade between $18 and $24 under favorable market conditions. However, some observers have called for a broader examination of the competitive landscape. If XRP were to capture 14% of SWIFT’s total volume, the question remains: which platforms or technologies will handle the remaining 86%? Projects such as Chainlink have already begun working directly with SWIFT, positioning themselves as potential players in the evolving financial infrastructure. While XRP’s capacity to handle trillions in annual payments remains speculative, Garlinghouse’s remarks and the subsequent analysis have provided concrete figures for what such a scenario might entail. The discussion now turns to whether XRP can effectively scale to meet these expectations and how it will compete in a landscape that is becoming increasingly crowded with blockchain-based solutions.

Worldcoin (WLD) is also gaining traction after crossing $1.18, helped by strong market volume. But beyond the charts, another name is turning heads for a different reason. BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just focused on price action—it’s building something broader. A large-scale US sponsorship is rumored to be in motion, and if confirmed, it could make BlockDAG one of the most widely recognized projects before even listing. The move would not only boost trust and visibility; it could bring BDAG into everyday conversation across countries and industries. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025, this mix of scale and timing is becoming hard to overlook. SUI Price Climbs Past $3.40 on ETF Buzz and Growing Demand The SUI price performance is seeing a solid recovery. From June 9 to June 11, SUI gained 7.9%, climbing back to $3.40. A key reason for the lift was Nasdaq’s 19b-4 filing to list a spot SUI ETF with 21Shares. That announcement helped push SUI through the $3.55 resistance line, turning it into support. Volume surged to $930 million in 24 hours, and SUI’s Total Value Locked now stands at $1.77 billion, showing strong usage in DeFi and gaming. The SUI price also broke out of a descending channel, with EMA crossovers and bullish momentum supporting targets of $4.50 and above if the trend continues. WLD Moves Past $1.18 as Breakout Signals Grow Worldcoin (WLD) posted a 5.4% rise on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18. This came just as Google Cloud’s partnership with OpenAI made headlines, helping boost trader interest. Volume jumped by 38% to $208 million. Technicals also support the move. WLD has cleared its 50-period EMA and is now sitting in a breakout range between $1.05 and $1.15. The MACD is signaling strength, and RSI near 62 adds to the bullish case. Chart patterns show a rising wedge and triangle formations that point to a potential surge. If WLD clears $1.20–$1.24, targets between $1.28 and $1.60 could come into play. Support at $1.05–$1.10 remains strong, making this one of the better-positioned breakout plays at the moment. BlockDAG’s US Push Could Redefine What a Presale Can Do BlockDAG has already raised $303 million and sold 22.6 billion coins. It’s currently in Batch 29 of its presale, priced at $0.0276. Those who bought during Batch 1 have already earned a 2,660% return. But the latest twist? A special extended offer now allows users to buy at just $0.0018 for six more days. With the launch price set at $0.05, this window offers a potential ROI of 2,678%. That alone is a major draw. But it’s what’s happening outside the price chart that’s capturing attention. A rumored US-based sponsorship deal could soon take BDAG’s reach global. Widespread branding and televised exposure could turn BDAG into a name recognized even beyond the crypto world. Most projects chase attention after they launch. BlockDAG is flipping that model by building mass appeal in advance. It’s already backed by a CertiK audit, is EVM-compatible, and supports zero gas fees through its DAG-based infrastructure. Its X1 Miner app has attracted over 2 million users in more than 150 countries. Features like Buyer Battles and referral streaks make it not just easy to use, but addictive. BlockDAG isn’t just checking boxes. It’s rewriting how crypto connects with people. If the sponsorship is confirmed, BDAG won’t just launch, it’ll arrive already embedded in culture. That’s what makes it such a strong pick for anyone watching for the best crypto to buy right now Final Thoughts SUI is making progress with renewed institutional interest and a push from ETF news. WLD is showing signs of breaking higher on technical strength and narrative momentum. But for those looking beyond chart patterns, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for something more powerful. With $303 million raised, a special $0.0018 entry point, over 22.6 billion coins sold, and a listing price of $0.05, the upside is clear. The 2,678% ROI window is only open for six more days. Add to that a US sponsorship on the horizon, and BDAG is shaping up to be a serious player. It’s not just another presale. It’s an early-stage opportunity with real-world branding and user traction, setting a new standard for what crypto launches can achieve. For those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG may already be leading the way.

As the broader crypto space navigates renewed attention and shifting capital flows, select assets are standing out not for noise, but for solid infrastructure and development momentum. Among the top cryptos to invest in for short term, Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Cosmos are leading discussions across the space. With Qubetics offering a truly integrated multi-chain experience through its application, and the added traction around its token presale, this project has become a critical contender for short-term upside. Meanwhile, XRP continues to demonstrate its relevance through international payment corridors and growing adoption among traditional finance institutions. At the same time, Cosmos is rapidly advancing blockchain interoperability, attracting developer interest and on-chain liquidity. These three digital assets are building strong foundations for immediate relevance in the current cycle, making them standout picks among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Qubetics Multi‑Chain Wallet: The Future of Web3 User Experience At the center of Qubetics ‘ appeal is a breakthrough in digital asset management—the Qubetics Wallet. This product is designed as a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with support across mobile and desktop operating systems. As a key component of Qubetics’ broader ecosystem, this application empowers users to manage, transact, and interact with assets across major blockchain networks from a single interface. In a fragmented environment where most users juggle multiple wallets or custodial platforms, Qubetics offers an unprecedented level of utility. The wallet supports native $TICS tokens and is compatible with iOS, Android, and web-based systems. From small business operators handling cross-border payments in stablecoins to NFT creators selling digital collectibles across marketplaces, Qubetics provides seamless, secure access with no dependency on third parties. As digital asset adoption increases globally, the demand for self-custodial, interoperable tools will only rise. Qubetics is positioning itself at the center of that trend, building real-world use for its application, and validating its place among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term Gains Qubetics has officially reached the final stretch of its public token sale, entering Stage 37 with strong momentum. Priced at $0.3370, the Qubetics presale has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 515 million $TICS tokens to a growing community of 27,900+ holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining at this final price, the window to secure entry before the listing is quickly narrowing. Once the presale concludes, $TICS will list at $0.40—offering a built-in 20% return to those who join now. What makes this presale even more strategic is Qubetics’ updated tokenomics: a dramatic supply cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion and a public allocation increase to 38.55%, reinforcing both scarcity and decentralization. With this balance of financial upside and community-driven design, Qubetics is rapidly being positioned as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term performance. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale rate. At $0.3370, that amount secures around 14,837 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this holding immediately rises to $5,934—a gain of $934 before any post-launch appreciation. For those aiming at more aggressive returns, projections ranging between $5 to $10 per token suggest that same $5,000 could scale up to as much as $74,000–$148,000 during the next market cycle. This combination of immediate ROI and high upside potential is why Qubetics is now being recognized as the best crypto presale currently live—and why it’s dominating discussions around the top cryptos to invest in for short term growth. XRP: Expanding Institutional Utility in Global Payments XRP continues to gain relevance as a solution for institutional-grade cross-border transfers. Its utility-driven design enables near-instant settlements, low fees, and minimal counterparty risk—factors increasingly valued by banks, fintech firms, and payment processors. The XRP Ledger is also integrating smart contract capabilities, allowing tokenized assets and programmable finance to live directly on the chain without requiring external solutions. Recent developments have further solidified XRP’s case as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Its presence in Asia-Pacific payment channels is expanding, and partnerships with financial platforms have increased XRP’s daily volume across regulated corridors. Regulatory clarity is also improving, providing a more favorable outlook for adoption in regions that previously held back institutional engagement. As financial platforms scale up the use of on-chain tools, XRP remains well-positioned to serve both compliance-driven needs and next-generation payment architecture. Cosmos: Redefining Blockchain Interoperability with IBC Cosmos is one of the most compelling infrastructure-layer projects making waves in today’s market, due in large part to its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Cosmos enables secure, standardized communication between independent chains, solving one of crypto’s most persistent technical challenges. The architecture allows sovereign blockchains to interact without sacrificing scalability or governance, creating a truly interoperable network of networks. Recent updates to Cosmos Hub and its expanding validator set are drawing attention from both DeFi builders and application-layer protocols. Interchain accounts, smart routing, and shared security features now allow protocols to operate across ecosystems more efficiently. As a result, protocols that once relied on Ethereum or Solana for liquidity and composability are beginning to consider Cosmos for its flexibility and development-ready environment. This unique positioning places Cosmos comfortably within the top cryptos to invest in for short term, particularly for those tracking growth in cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. Conclusion Qubetics, XRP, and Cosmos each present a unique value proposition for short-term participants seeking informed exposure. Qubetics stands out with its web3 aggregator model and a high-impact Qubetics presale, offering structured growth and compelling ROI scenarios. XRP continues to lead the institutional payment narrative through expanding real-world partnerships and regulatory momentum. Cosmos is delivering on its promise of true cross-chain operability, attracting forward-thinking protocols and community members alike. Among all available opportunities, these three digital assets earn their place on the shortlist of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Participants seeking immediate utility and future scalability should strongly consider joining this best crypto presale while opportunity remains.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00006717 to $0.00007676. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000125 with an average price of $0.00012. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine.

Bonk price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.00001468 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.42 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators favor sellers, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000125, which is approximately 691% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its value decreased to $0.00001468. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent depreciation. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000020. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000125 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

The ruling was issued on Wednesday by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and stems from a long-running digital asset fraud scheme involving the fraudulent sale of a virtual currency known as My Big Coin (MBC). The court’s decision includes a $19.3 million civil monetary penalty and an additional $6.4 million in restitution for customers who were deceived by misleading claims about the coin’s value and backing. According to the CFTC’s official press release , from January 2014 to June 2017, the defendants falsely promoted MBC as a fully functional digital currency backed by gold and actively traded on established platforms. In reality, the currency lacked any such support or market presence. Over $6 million was collected from at least 28 customers under pretenses, while the funds were largely misappropriated by co-defendant Randall Crater, who was previously convicted and sentenced to more than eight years in prison for his central role in the scheme. The court’s latest order resolves the commodities regulator’s civil enforcement claims against Gillespie, Roche, and the two Nevada-based My Big Coin companies. It also imposes a permanent trading ban on the defendants, barring them from participating in any CFTC-regulated markets or registering with the agency. Crater, the primary orchestrator of the fraud, was earlier sentenced in a separate criminal case and ordered to forfeit and repay more than $7.6 million In a statement, the agency said. “The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.” The post Court Slaps My Big Coin: Founders Hit With $25.8M Penalty for Defrauding Crypto Investors appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 21:32:27

The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Trump’s Token Windfall According to the disclosure, Trump’s income line reads “$57,437,927.” It doesn’t say if he sold tokens, earned staking rewards, or used another method. But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details The disclosure also notes his past digital ventures. He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

Industry experts have highlighted how this technical upgrade could benefit digital assets like XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM). XRP and XLM are designed to work well with modern systems. Experts say they could become a larger part of global payments and transform how money moves worldwide. Global Financial Systems Are Moving to ISO 20022 Standard ISO 20022 allows financial institutions to send payment information clearly and in a structured. It improves data quality, increases transparency, and helps systems across countries collaborate more easily. In a video shared on X, the payments company Stronghold showed how it is using ISO 20022 along with blockchain technology . A company spokesperson explained that this combination improves how money is moved and makes the process more reliable and efficient. Stronghold is already using ISO 20022 messaging in real financial projects. This shows that blockchain and traditional systems can work together, rather than compete. Notably, it was revealed that all Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments moved to ISO 20022 in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced plans to adopt the standard in July. This move will replace the outdated Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM). Meanwhile, SWIFT has announced that it will fully transition to ISO 20022 by November. This global shift is poised to change how traditional and digital financial systems work together. XRP and XLM Are Built for This Change It was spotlighted that digital assets like XRP and XLM are better suited to connect with banks and payment systems. These digital currencies are fast, low-cost , and built to follow rules and standards, making them a good match for ISO 20022-based systems. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also recognises XRP and XLM as digital assets with strong potential to play key roles in future financial networks. As more banks switch to ISO 20022, they may turn to these for faster, safer, and cheaper payments. Stronghold Taps Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger for Real-World Use In a separate video clip , Stronghold’s CEO, Tammy Camp, explained that the company uses tools like Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger to link fiat money with digital systems. These technologies help bridge traditional and blockchain-based finance. They are connected through simple APIs, allowing different platforms to communicate and work smoothly. This setup helps Stronghold move money between banks and blockchain networks in real time. It also shows how XRP and XLM can support regular financial services without causing disruption.

BlockDAG, now in batch 29 of its presale, has raised more than $302 million directly from the public. There were no hedge funds, no private rounds, no seed investors—just organic momentum powered by retail users. While major chains like Ethereum and Solana depend on insider funding, BlockDAG has chosen a community-first path. This is more than a presale. It’s a full rejection of the old model. And the numbers show it’s working. This is truly the people’s crypto. No VC Funding, No Privileges — Just Genuine Demand BlockDAG stands out not just because of the amount raised, but because of how it raised it. Most big projects depend on private sales backed by Silicon Valley and hedge funds. BlockDAG opened its doors only to the public. There were no special discounts for insiders or influencers. No early unlocks for private buyers. Everyone joined on the same terms with full transparency. This removes the usual advantage held by big funds, putting community first. The public responded strongly. With over $302 million raised purely from retail support, BlockDAG reached a level of momentum that many VC-backed projects never achieve. Ethereum and Solana: Built by Few, Owned by Few To see why BlockDAG is different, consider the usual model. Ethereum’s early supply heavily favored insiders and developers, giving them large long-term gains. Solana also benefited from big VC backers like a16z and Alameda, creating wide gaps between public buyers and early insiders. This VC-driven setup shaped today’s market—powerful chains controlled by a few, with latecomers often priced out of meaningful returns. While marketed as decentralized, their token distributions tell a different story. BlockDAG changes that story. The People’s Chain: Powered by $302 Million in Public Support Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG has sold over 22.6 billion coins. Its active community engages publicly on Telegram, Discord, and through the X1 mining app, which has more than 1.5 million users worldwide. The X1 app lets anyone mine BDAG coins from their smartphones, creating a peer-to-peer, scalable onboarding method without needing institutional backing. This grassroots approach is succeeding. Rather than chasing institutional interest or hype, BlockDAG grows from real user activity—no boardrooms, no private deals, just people. A New Chapter for 2025: Community Capital Over Venture Capital Crypto is shifting. Users want chains without hidden power behind “decentralization.” Many claim to be open but block access through high fees, opaque governance, or limited early entry. BlockDAG breaks this pattern. This isn’t a token promising “community” while serving VC exits. It’s a network funded by everyday users, shown in real time by presale growth and app engagement. Supporters aren’t betting on hype—they’re building the future. Ethereum’s power still rests with whales and Layer-2 intermediaries. Solana leans on ETFs and institutional interest. BlockDAG has 1.5 million phone miners spreading the word organically. Why BlockDAG Is Ahead While others depend on big partnerships and VC money, BlockDAG sticks to execution: Over $302 million raised with zero VC backing 1.5 million+ active X1 miners 22.6 billion+ coins sold Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276 Tools and apps live before exchange listings BlockDAG isn’t aiming to be another “Ethereum killer” or a meme fad. It builds user-level utility first and scales organically. Its batch presale rewards early supporters fairly, with transparent demand-driven pricing and no artificial scarcity or hidden unlocks. Final Word: Crypto Needs Users, Not Kings The market doesn’t need another Solana or Ethereum. What it truly needs is a project that reflects the people who support it, use it daily, and believe in its future. BlockDAG shows what happens when the gatekeepers are removed, allowing the public to take the lead. This approach raises more than just funds—it builds lasting trust and a genuine community. While other projects chase headlines and institutional deals, BlockDAG focuses on steady, organic growth with real users at the center. This foundation positions it strongly for long-term success and sustainability in crypto market.

AI chips are currently being positioned as the backbone of the next wave of global computing and defense technologies. Every disruption in supply chains matters for companies intending to capitalize on this technology, and Taiwan is standing firmly in the way of China’s innovation. Taiwan rolls out export ban on China Taiwan has blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) and restricted both companies’ access to crucial chip-building technologies. The decision was published by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. Under the new rules, both Huawei and SMIC, along with several of their subsidiaries in Russia, Japan, and Germany, have been added to an updated “strategic high-tech commodities entity list,” which requires them to have government approval for any Taiwanese company to export goods or technologies to them. Taiwan’s updated restrictions specifically target the infrastructure and materials necessary for advanced chip production, including plant construction technologies and manufacturing equipment. According to a Bloomberg report in 2023, this restriction will compromise Huawei and SMIC’s ability to continue developing their network of covert chip plants. The network of chips is located across southern China and has reportedly been receiving support from some Taiwanese companies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s most advanced chipmaker, previously ceased business with Huawei in 2020 in compliance with U.S. export restrictions. Now, the rest of Taiwan’s high-tech industry will be expected to follow suit under domestic law. This may halt Huawei and SMIC’s efforts to replicate or replace the kind of high-performance chips that Taiwan exports to firms like Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions disrupt chip markets In early 2025, Taiwan’s newly inaugurated President, Lai Ching-te, made headlines for describing China as a “foreign hostile force.” Lai’s administration also launched a suite of measures aimed at countering Beijing’s infiltration tactics and its political influence operations on the island. Beijing has repeatedly asserted that Taiwan is part of its sovereign territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve what it calls a “peaceful reunification.” It appears that, due to the unlikelihood of outright military conflict in the short term, Taiwan and China are escalating their tensions via the tech industry. Both Huawei and SMIC have spent years trying to work around the export bans of the United States and its allied countries. In 2023, the companies stunned U.S. lawmakers with a surprise 7-nanometer chip, made entirely in China. But analysts have since questioned the scalability and efficiency of the chip, especially now that the companies lack consistent access to foreign equipment and materials. Neither Huawei nor SMIC has commented at the time of reporting. The Taiwanese government did not make an official public announcement either. The listing was only revealed through changes posted on an official website.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 22:15:35

While some market participants remain convinced that altcoin season—a period when Bitcoin is outpaced by the majority of alternative coins in the crypto market—is underway, others remain unfazed, certain that altcoins will continue to bleed . Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson is part of the former group, whose sentiments about the altcoin market are more bullish than bearish. In a recent “ask me anything” live session on YouTube, the Cardano boss responded to a viewer who quizzed him on the state of the altcoin market, particularly curious to know if altcoin season was “cancelled for 2025.” Maintaining optimism for the months ahead, Hoskinson remarked that July and the months preceding it could see altcoins record a notable price run.”The second half of 2025 is going to be great for altcoins,” Hoskinson asserted. Three altcoins are going head-to-head against Bitcoin Interestingly, Bitcoin appears to be recovering quickly after failing to sustain momentum above the $110,000 price mark. The new development indicates a build-up of buying pressure likely triggered by renewed interest from market players. While this could validate the sentiment that the leading cryptocurrency will continue to outperform altcoins, alternative coins could also very possibly secure larger gains in the long term. Despite sustaining mild intra-day losses, three altcoins have outpaced Bitcoin over the last 7 days. Ether, SOL, and DOGE are leading what looks like an altcoin comeback. While Bitcoin, currently trading at $105,516 at press time, has only managed to sustain 3.87% in gains over the last 7-days, ETH, SOL and DOGE are up 7.94%, 6.10%, and 5.65% respectively.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|SHIB|SHIBA INU|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:25:29

As if to make up for Q1’s underwhelming performance, Ether bulls have been up and working of late, with the price value of $3,000 appearing more attainable in the near term. Among other factors, the rise in Ethereum’s open interest rate presents a bullish signal for market participants. Notably, Ethereum’s Open Interest—the total number of outstanding (open) contracts yet to be settled—has hit a new all-time high, exceeding $40 billion for the first time. This new development is especially remarkable for Ethereum, as high open interest typically indicates a rise in market activity and liquidity, suggesting heightened enthusiasm amongst market participants.

These investors accumulated during consolidation and now will potentially form a strong support zone.” Glassnode wrote, adding that ETH is well on its way to $3,420 if the $2,700 and $2,760 support levels hold up strongly.

Αυτό ακριβώς έρχεται να κάνει η Shopify από τις 12 Ιουνίου 2025, συνεργαζόμενη με την Coinbase για να φέρει το stablecoin USDC στον βωμό του παγκόσμιου ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου. Η αρχή θα γίνει σε ένα περιορισμένο αριθμό ατόμων, αλλά σύντομα εκατομμύρια καταστήματα που χρησιμοποιούν το Shopify Payments θα μπορούν να δέχονται USDC μέσω του Base του γρήγορου, φθηνού και ασφαλούς δικτύου της Coinbase πάνω στο Ethereum . Στόχος; Πιο απλές, πιο οικονομικές και πιο παγκόσμιες πληρωμές με τη δύναμη των crypto. Χαρακτηριστικά και οφέλη για τους εμπόρους και πελάτες Με τη νέα αυτή δυνατότητα, το να πληρώνεις με κρυπτονομίσματα γίνεται πιο απλό από ποτέ. Οι πελάτες θα μπορούν να ολοκληρώνουν τις αγορές τους πληρώνοντας με USDC, ένα ψηφιακό «δολάριο» που παραμένει σταθερό στην αξία του. Από την άλλη πλευρά, οι έμποροι θα συνεχίσουν να λαμβάνουν τα χρήματά τους στο τοπικό τους νόμισμα, χωρίς περίπλοκες μετατροπές, win-win! Και για να κάνει την εμπειρία ακόμα καλύτερη, η Shopify σχεδιάζει να προσφέρει και 1% επιστροφή χρημάτων στους πελάτες που επιλέγουν να πληρώσουν με USDC, ένα έξτρα bonus που αναμένεται να ενεργοποιηθεί αργότερα μέσα στο 2025. Από τεχνικής πλευράς, όλο αυτό βασίζεται σε ένα ανοικτό κώδικα που σχεδίασαν μαζί Shopify και Coinbase. Αυτός ο κώδικας σκοπεύει να δώσει λύσει σε ζητήματα που αφορούν καθυστερημένες χρεώσεις και υπολογισμό φόρων, μέχρι και διαχείριση επιστροφών. Όλα είναι ενσωματωμένα στο υπάρχον σύστημα παραγγελιών, χωρίς επιπλέον κόπο για τον έμπορο. Γιατί η Shopify εμπιστεύτηκε το Base της Coinbase Όταν η Shopify έψαχνε την κατάλληλη υποδομή για να φέρει τις crypto πληρωμές στο παιχνίδι, το Base της Coinbase ξεχώρισε αμέσως. Γιατί; Επειδή είναι γρήγορο, οικονομικό και ασφαλές. Το Base αποτελεί μια λύση Layer-2 πάνω στο Ethereum και μπορεί να διαχειρίζεται πολύ περισσότερες συναλλαγές με πολύ χαμηλότερα κόστη. Αυτό το κάνει ιδανικό για χρήση σε μία τεράστια ηλεκτρονική πλατφόρμα όπως η Shopify, όπου κάθε δευτερόλεπτο και κάθε σεντ μετράει. Κανείς πελάτης δεν θέλει καθυστερήσεις ή έξτρα χρεώσεις και το Base προσφέρει ακριβώς αυτή την εμπειρία. Πέραν από το κομμάτι της τεχνολογίας, η Shopify δείχνει ξεκάθαρα ότι θέλει να προωθήσει το Web3 στο λιανικό εμπόριο. Και με τα stablecoins όπως το USDC να γίνονται πλέον καθημερινό εργαλείο για πληρωμές, το timing δεν θα μπορούσε να είναι καλύτερο. USDC στο Checkout; Δες με ποιο πορτοφόλι το κάνεις πράξη Κι αφού οι πληρωμές με USDC γίνονται πλέον mainstream, το επόμενο φυσικό βήμα είναι να έχεις και το κατάλληλο πορτοφόλι για να τα φυλάς! Εδώ έρχεται το Best Wallet , ένα ασφαλές και εύχρηστο πορτοφόλι για τα κρυπτονομίσματά σου. Τι είναι; ένα mobile app που σου δίνει τον πλήρη έλεγχο των crypto σου, με πλήρη διαφάνεια, χωρίς μεσάζοντες και χωρίς κρυφές παγίδες. Υποστηρίζει πάνω από 1.000 νομίσματα από 60+ blockchains, και σου επιτρέπει να τα ανταλλάσσεις εύκολα μέσω του ενσωματωμένου DEX. Και αν δεν έχεις crypto; Μπορείς να αγοράσεις με κάρτα ή τραπεζικό έμβασμα! Είναι δωρεάν, γρήγορο και φτιαγμένο για όσους θέλουν απλότητα, ασφάλεια και ανωνυμία! Το μέλλον των Stablecoins στο ηλεκτρονικό εμπόριο Μέχρι πρόσφατα, τα stablecoins, όπως το USDC ήταν απλώς ένα εργαλείο για όσους ασχολούνται με το crypto trading, όμως τον τελευταίο χρόνο η προσφορά τους αυξήθηκε κατά 54% και πλέον έγιναν κομμάτι των καθημερινών συναλλαγών. Και δεν μιλάμε μόνο για νεοφυείς επιχειρήσεις του Web3: μεγάλα ονόματα του χώρου όπως η PayPal και η Grab έχουν ήδη ενσωματώσει τα stablecoins στις υπηρεσίες τους για πληρωμές και τώρα ακολουθεί και η Shopify! Η δυνατότητα να πληρώνεις με ένα σταθερό, ψηφιακό δολάριο που λειτουργεί παντού, χωρίς την παρέμβαση τραπεζών, είναι κάτι που μπορεί να διευκολύνει ριζικά τον τρόπο με τον οποίο αγοράζουμε και πουλάμε online.",Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-14 22:45:45

Analyst Maps Out 3 Explosive Price Targets Using Rare Technical Signal",https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-2-today-13-tomorrow-analyst-maps-out-3-explosive-price-targets-using-rare-technical-signal/,"Whether altcoin season is in motion remains a topic of debate amongst market participants, although XRP is emerging as one of the few altcoins poised to hit a new price high soon. Ripple’s XRP, the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, might be preparing for an explosive run as market experts continue to outline bullish case scenarios for the altcoin. Cryptocurrency analyst EgragCrypto, known on X as EgragCrypto, predicts that the altcoin could soar to never-before-seen levels, notably $6.7, $13, and $27, if certain technical hurdles are surmounted. In an XRP technical chart shared with his followers on X, the analyst highlights 3 key areas using colored circles purple, red, and white to represent notable technical movements. While the purple circle, which historically follows a bullish uptrend, marks the start of a bullish rally observed across different market cycles, the red circle denotes an incoming market crash. This downward movement often occurs when the 21 EMA goes below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, a trend that is later preceded by a market pump, likely to get rejected by both moving averages. The analyst asserts that the move marks the arrival of a bear market. Conclusively, the white circle points to the 21 EMA avoiding a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on a weekly timeframe—an occurrence recorded only once, leading to a 1,200% surge in XRP’s price value. Laying out his bullish stance, the analyst wrote the following; “It’s simple. We still have one leg which will be an epic, fast, and short-lived move that will hype everyone up, claiming we’ll never go back and that utility will take us to the moon. But remember such moves have rarely continued in one direction, if ever, happened in the past and probably won’t in the future. If you’re well-off and don’t need to sell, stay patient. But if not, don’t come crying to my DMs when things don’t go as planned.” The analyst stated that should XRP surge by 1,200% from its current price of $2.24 or sustain a 600% gain in the near term, the altcoin will be valued at $27 or $13, respectively. Meanwhile, a 300% upsurge, which marks a quarter of the 2017 market rally, would value the asset at $6.70. XRP is trading at a press time price of $2.14, with 0.37% in 7-day gains.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:51:31

However, a new contender, Ruvi AI , is rapidly emerging as a high-potential alternative. With over $1.7 million raised , 150 million tokens sold , and predictions of an astonishing 13,100% ROI , Ruvi AI is gaining spotlight attention. But what truly sets it apart, and how does it stack up against Cardano? Here’s a closer look at why analysts are so optimistic about Ruvi AI. Why Analysts Draw Comparisons Between Ruvi AI and Cardano Cardano built its reputation by addressing key blockchain scalability and efficiency issues, a first for the industry when it launched. Similarly, Ruvi AI is making waves for its ability to tackle real-world challenges by integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) . Its solutions span industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance , bringing wide-ranging utility that extends far beyond traditional crypto applications. Where Cardano excels in creating a stable and scalable ecosystem, Ruvi AI adds another dimension by tapping into demand for practical, AI-driven solutions. This focus not only ensures Ruvi AI’s relevance but also positions it to thrive in a competitive landscape. Presale Success Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has garnered significant attention, with over $1.7 million raised and 150 million tokens sold during the current phase. This robust demand reflects growing confidence among investors and signals that Ruvi AI is more than just speculative noise. A standout feature of Ruvi AI is its structured growth model , which brings transparency and predictability to its token pricing. Unlike other tokens that soar or crash based on market whims, Ruvi AI is designed to steadily grow in value. When the presale concludes, tokens will increase to $0.07 , giving early investors a clear pathway to immediate returns. Analysts project even greater gains, predicting Ruvi AI could reach $1 post-listing , equivalent to a remarkable 66x return for presale participants. Maximize ROI With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI takes its presale one step further by offering exclusive VIP investment tiers . These tiers reward early investors with generous bonuses, ensuring that participants at all levels can amplify their gains. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers make Ruvi AI appealing to both cautious first-timers and seasoned whales alike. Building Trust Through Transparency and Security A major differentiator for Ruvi AI is its commitment to transparency and safety . The project is being independently assessed through an upcoming third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This ensures that Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is secure and reliable, an essential factor for responsible investors. Adding to its appeal is Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees ample liquidity and seamless trading for token holders following the presale stage. Together, these moves solidify trust in the platform and give Ruvi AI’s investors peace of mind. Real-World Applications Ensure Long-Term Demand Unlike purely speculative tokens, Ruvi AI delivers tangible value through real-world applications, ensuring ongoing demand. Key sectors benefiting from Ruvi AI’s solutions include: Marketing Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools provide businesses with enhanced customer targeting, campaign optimization, and elevated audience engagement. Entertainment By enabling personalized content recommendations and secure, blockchain-backed transactions, Ruvi AI is reshaping how content is consumed and monetized.

While Ripple has not confirmed such a move, the rumor has reignited discussions about the company’s evolving role in the global financial system. JackTheRippler’s post was accompanied by a visual breakdown demonstrating how Ripple’s infrastructure already mirrors the core functions of a modern digital bank. In the illustrated process, a sender’s bank connects to a third-party liquidity provider to replenish its XRP holdings. It then accesses RippleNet and xCurrent for pre-transaction verification, including exchange rates and transfer costs. Once the conditions are accepted, the bank executes the cross-border payment using XRP in real time. On the receiving end, the bank uses a separate liquidity provider to convert the XRP into local currency, completing the transaction seamlessly. This end-to-end flow highlights Ripple’s technical capacity to operate like a bank, even without a license. It has led many to ask whether formal regulatory approval is simply the next phase in Ripple’s institutional evolution. RUMORS: @Ripple will obtain a banking license and transform into a bank! #XRP pic.twitter.com/MfDPYel2Ed — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 14, 2025 The Banking Charter Possibility This rumor aligns closely with earlier developments reported by Timestabloid. Former Ripple board member and entrepreneur Greg Kidd revealed during a one-on-one interview with FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett at the XRP Las Vegas conference that he is developing a specialized banking charter. The charter is designed for digital-first companies that manage deposits and payments without engaging in lending or operating physical branches. Kidd emphasized that his proposal was theoretical and not linked to any official plan by Ripple. However, he made it clear that the goal is to reshape the financial system by making it more inclusive. This charter could enable companies like Ripple to acquire a form of banking license tailored to their business model, allowing them to provide core financial services without taking on the full regulatory load of traditional banks. Ripple’s Larger Ambitions In another earlier report , Timestabloid highlighted analysis by Stellar Rippler, a well-known crypto commentator, who claimed that Ripple is not just aiming to become a bank; it is preparing to operate at the very foundation of the global financial infrastructure. According to Stellar Rippler, Ripple’s goal is to rival traditional financial institutions, even central banks, by redefining how money moves across borders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While this may sound bold, it is grounded in observable developments. Ripple currently provides payment and liquidity solutions in more than 70 countries. Its suite of tools, including RippleNet, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), and its RLUSD stablecoin, positions it as a critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology. If Ripple does pursue a banking license, it would no longer need to rely on intermediary banks or third-party settlement networks. It could offer direct, real-time, cross-border payments powered entirely by blockchain, something legacy institutions have struggled to achieve. A Strategic Silence? Ripple has not commented on these rumors, but the silence could be strategic. The company remains entangled in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and may be waiting for regulatory clarity before making any significant structural changes. Still, Ripple’s direction is unmistakable. It is no longer just a fintech startup. It is building infrastructure, securing partnerships with central banks, and offering services that resemble, if not already exceeded, those of traditional banking institutions. Whether or not it becomes a licensed bank, Ripple is shaping the future of digital finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This resistance has not deterred long-term holders or analysts, many of whom remain confident that XRP’s underlying utility in cross-border payments could drive substantial gains in the future. Some analysts believe that if XRP is adopted as a key tool for international money movement, its value could climb significantly. These projections are based not on short-term speculation but on the asset’s potential role in global liquidity frameworks. Assessing the Cross-border Liquidity Market A critical factor in these forecasts is the estimated size of the cross-border liquidity pool. While exact figures are not readily available, economists often use M2 money supply data to frame the conversation. M2 includes cash, checking deposits, and other liquid financial assets, and offers a broad view of potential capital deployment. According to a macroeconomic analysis published in April 2025 by analyst Marty Party, the collective M2 money supply of the U.S., China, Japan, and the European Union stood at approximately $83.37 trillion. However, only a fraction of that total is typically designated for cross-border use. Historical data from the Bank for International Settlements suggests that banks allocate roughly 10% to 15% of M2 for international reserves and claims. This implies that the global cross-border liquidity pool may fall between $8 trillion and $12 trillion, with $10 trillion serving as a reasonable mid-range estimate. Calculating XRP’s Value at 25% Liquidity Share To determine XRP’s potential value if it facilitated 25% of the estimated $10 trillion in cross-border liquidity, an analysis was conducted using OpenAI’s ChatGPT model. At the time, XRP was priced at $2.23 with a circulating supply of about 58.82 billion tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the first scenario, where XRP is required to fully back the $2.5 trillion needed for 25% of global liquidity, each token would need to represent a portion of that amount. Dividing $2.5 trillion by the total circulating supply yields a price estimate of approximately $42.50 per XRP. Token Velocity and Adjusted Price Scenarios The second approach incorporates the concept of token velocity, how often a token is used in transactions within a year. If XRP is reused five times annually, then only $500 billion worth of XRP would be required to support $2.5 trillion in flows. This would translate to a token price of about $8.50. The model also evaluated other turnover rates. At a velocity of 10, XRP’s price would drop to around $4.25. Conversely, if the token turned over just twice a year, the required locked value would increase, raising the estimated price to $21.25. These scenarios highlight how XRP’s future price could vary significantly depending on the level of institutional adoption and how efficiently the token circulates. While theoretical, the models offer insight into XRP’s potential valuation if it becomes a core asset in the global financial infrastructure.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $2,567 following a slight recovery but remains some distance off the week’s high of $2,871. Amidst all these recent developments, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment has shared a positive report hinting at a bullish ETH future. ETH Whale Holdings Grow By 3.72% In 30 Days In an X post on June 14, Santiment provides valuable insights into Ethereum whales’ behaviors. The credible analytics firm reports that all 6,392 of such investors holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have significantly increased their holdings over the past month compared to retail investors. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash – Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast In adding data to this claim, Santiment further shares that ETH whales have acquired 1.49 million ETH, worth $38.26 million, in the past 30 days, boosting their total holdings by a significant 3.72%. Generally, whale accumulations are bullish signals that indicate an asset’s strong potential for long-term price appreciation. Therefore, ETH’s recent whale activity is likely to encourage significant levels of retail investment that could incite a price rally. Interestingly, CoinMarketCap data shows the altcoin has recorded a 2.38% decline over the past month. The token’s price has largely oscillated within a range of $2,400 to $2,800, reflecting indecision in the market amidst external pressures and a lack of clear bullish catalysts. Ethereum whales have conducted this accumulation spree during a period of market uncertainty, indicating strong investor confidence regardless of the present market situation. Ethereum Price Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,536 following a price gain of 1.18% in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 3.82% on its weekly chart after a notable brief price ascent above $2,800. According to data from CoinCodex, the general ETH market sentiment is bullish while the Greed & Fear Index stands at 61 (Greed). This report is well reflected in the reported accumulation trend.

Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts paint a strong bullish future of $4,269.40 in the next three months.

Tron (TRX) has recently surged 12% following a new stablecoin launch on its blockchain. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making progress with upgrades to Shibarium, its Layer-2 network. Both have sparked renewed interest. Yet, amid this, another project stands out with deeper traction. BlockDAG, an emerging presale initiative, is nearing the $300 million mark. It has already secured $303 million in funding and attracted over 2 million active users through its X1 mobile mining app. In a space often dominated by flashy headlines and speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing that a more grounded, user-first approach can outperform even long-established coins. TRX Jumps 12% on Stablecoin Buzz TRX rose 12% after a new USD₮ stablecoin launched on its blockchain. The coin benefited from media attention tied to the new dollar-pegged coin. This trend sparked higher network activity and boosted TRX’s market cap. Even so, this rise may be short-lived. TRX has experienced similar spikes before, which have faded once the initial buzz subsided. Its reliance on politically linked headlines leaves questions about long-term stability. Until network usage or developer growth matches these price moves, TRX’s momentum may not persist. Shiba Inu Builds Utility With Shibarium Shiba Inu continues development on Shibarium, its Layer‑2 network, aiming to improve speed and cut transaction costs. The update is designed to streamline validator operations and improve performance. These upgrades may help SHIB move beyond meme status, offering real-world use cases. Even though the Shibarium network has promise, past congestion and early bugs slow adoption. Community sentiment remains positive, yet market gains have been modest. If the improvements hold strong, SHIB may gain traction. For now, it’s in technical rebuild mode, offering potential upside but no breakout yet. BlockDAG: $303M Raised, 2M Users, and No Empty Hype While TRX enjoys attention from news cycles and SHIB focuses on rebuilding its tech, BlockDAG is gaining steady ground through real progress. It isn’t relying on famous names or viral trends to grow. So far, BlockDAG has raised $303 million in its ongoing presale, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. More than 2 million users are already active on its X1 mobile mining app. BDAG is set to launch at $0.05 and is priced at $0.0276 in Stage 29, but right now, $0.0018 buys you in. With over $303 million raised, this gap won’t last long. BlockDAG stands out because of its user-first approach. The X1 app lets people mine directly from their phones, with no need for expensive setups or complicated tools. This simple entry point has attracted users worldwide and built strong engagement, even before the coin launches. There’s no involvement from venture capital firms, no early access for insiders, and no private deals. Every contribution comes from the public. This clear structure helps build trust, especially at a time when many in the space are tired of centralized control. BlockDAG isn’t chasing stories. It’s setting the pace. And even before its official launch, it’s already outpacing many projects that are fully listed. With clear results and growing traction, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the leading crypto to watch this year. Final Verdict TRX may earn attention through stablecoin news and SHIB may build long-term utility via Shibarium. But those models depend on external momentum and delayed results. BlockDAG is different.

Jamie Selway, a veteran financial services executive, will begin serving in the role on June 17th, per a new press release from the regulator. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says Selway will help “ensure the agency’s regulations balance costs and benefits.” The SEC has adopted a more crypto-friendly stance under Atkins, who has sought to distance the regulatory agency from the high-profile enforcement actions overseen by Gary Gensler, the previous chair. Gensler launched legal battles against numerous crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. Since Gensler stepped down in January, many of those cases have been closed. Atkins said last month that the SEC’s “legacy rules and regulations” don’t contemplate the novel use cases of blockchain technology. “In order for the United States to be the ‘crypto capital of the planet’ as envisioned by President Trump, the Commission must keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Rules and regulations designed for off-chain securities may be incompatible with or unnecessary for on-chain assets and stifle the growth of blockchain technology. A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.

The deadly strikes against Iran on Friday, June 13, said to have killed at least 78 people, were praised by Donald Trump as “excellent” with promises of “more to come.” Speaking on the victims of the Israeli attack, UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani detailed: “The overwhelming majority of them [were] civilians, including women and children.” Bitcoin for bombs, Satoshi inverted “Pro-bitcoin” Trump pretended to be for peaceful resolution of the so-called Iranian nuclear issue until mere hours before the strike, posting to Truth Social: “We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue!” However, some Israeli officials have been quoted saying this was a deception designed to lower Iran’s guard. “We had a clear U.S. green light,” one of them allegedly told Axios . Similar comments by “senior Israeli officials” were also made to The Jerusalem Post. Source: Truth Social. Whatever the truth is, if there is any left in the poorly written drama called mainstream news these days, one thing is clear to O.G. bitcoiners: Politicians and bankers make wars, and innocent people on both sides are slaughtered to enrich them. As Major General Smedley D. Butler famously declared in War Is a Racket: “Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die … No one told them that dollars and cents were the real reason. No one mentioned to them, as they marched away, that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here.” Image: Pixabay. Bitcoin was originally meant to fix this. The genesis block gives us a hint with its headline message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.” Crypto was meant to separate money and state , and as early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver once said , it was meant to potentially “undermine every government on the entire planet’s ability to wage war.”Now, BTC is held largely in the hands of the same murdering psychopaths from whom we were meant to take the power back. Blackrock, which invests heavily in defense companies profiting from war, had roughly 575,810 BTC in their Bitcoin ETF as of March . The United States government holds about 200,000 BTC that we know about.Even the individual whales, like Michael Saylor, are strongly pro-state and pro-fiat money. Saylor, who privately holds well over 17,000 BTC, has called Trump “pro-crypto” and criticized advocates of permissionless use and privacy.States and their crony banks. State-embedded mega-corporations. The trend is clear. These entities now hold persuasive amounts of crypto not to be used as permissionless, peer-to-peer electronic cash but for purposes of socioeconomic control and power.Another example is crypto’s unprecedented use for directly purchasing weapons and military supplies in the Ukraine/Russia conflict. As for major centralized exchanges, they are regulated via statist legal systems. So, in essence, if the U.S. continues helping Israel in its war on everyone around and in funding terror cells like Hamas, BTC will be right there behind the cause. Source: bitcointreasuries.net . How to take crypto back in 2 steps While the masses rant and cheer like it’s a football game for either “Israel” or “Iran” to destroy the other, everyday people like you and I will be killed like dogs in the streets, in their houses, in hospitals and schools and while sleeping, in both countries. Bitcoin was supposed to “fix this.”Even “Bitcoin Jesus” Ver, the original voice of Bitcoin Not Bombs, now says he wants to help Trump “make America great again.” Maybe he hasn’t connected the dots yet on Trump’s warmongering, though that’s hard to imagine. Maybe it is (somewhat understandably) a desperate bid to regain his freedom, as he is currently being held by the U.S. Department of Justice on bogus charges. Or maybe there’s another, more disappointing explanation.Regardless, it makes bitcoiners who got into crypto for the prospect of freedom and peace reel with bewilderment. Was any of this ever real in the first place? Were we put on by state interests somehow? Perhaps Satoshi’s creation has just been co-opted. Luckily, it doesn’t matter either way if the tech works. It seems to me crypto still can bring us the separation of money and state. But we’ve got to focus on two things: uncaptured networks that can work for instant, permissionless cash transactions, and most importantly, understanding the true, inviolable source of freedom — self-ownership.The truth is, no government on earth cares for the people it professes to rule. Not Israel, not Iran, not the United States. This is a bitter pill but should be quite obvious, given the evidence. Further, no state is anything but a grouping of single individuals, no better than you or I. States aren’t some abstract, all-powerful deity, though they would have us believe them to be so (much like the old man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz). At the highest levels, even with Israel and Iran, there is a fraternity in the shadows. The enmity played out in the news keeps you distracted. Image: Pixabay. When we come to understand that we own ourselves, that our lives, bodies, and property acquired by non-violence are ours, it makes no sense why some “special” individuals should arbitrarily be able to rule us violently, appoint themselves masters over us, force us to kill strangers in another country we have nothing against personally, or extort money from us via “taxes” to pay for bombs and all other kinds of evil refuse.Like decentralized payment protocols, decentralized networks of societies and communities can order their own lives and make their own sensible rules. They already do. Bitcoin and crypto present a way out of this mess if combined with the above Voluntaryist ethos. Networks like Bitcoin Cash, which are fast, efficient , censorship-resistant, and cost next to nothing to use, can help individuals take their economic freedom back, little by little.Developing privacy tech makes this more possible than ever. How? By refusing to finance violence in whatever small or large way possible until a critical mass of non-compliance is reached. In the same way, individuals can wake up and simply refuse — one by one — to become soldiers to kill and die for Trump, Netanyahu, Ali Khamenei, violent religion, or anyone else who thinks murder is “excellent.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 00:39:27

Dogecoin (DOGE), long considered a meme favorite, still hovers near the $0.20 range and shows resilience, but the real buzz is around an emerging DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is in phase 5 of its presale. Over 10.5 million has already been raised and more than 12,000 investors have joined. With June winding down and momentum building across crypto, this might be the top token of the summer you’ll wish you grabbed early. If you’re still wondering what to buy before June ends, you may not want to sleep on this one. Dogecoin Edges Near $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.20, up about 1% on the day. The token recently bounced off support near $0.176, climbing into the $0.190 resistance zone, and has since held steady around $0.197 Indicators on the 4-hour chart show a breakout above a descending trendline, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum, although DOGE remains capped by overhead pressure near $0.3. With major cryptos rising in tandem, DOGE is regaining attention as a potentially stabilizing meme token, while other plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to draw interest at lower price points. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Blazing Ahead, Secure Tokens at $0.03 Before They Double Mutuum Finance is heating up fast in the DeFi market, now in Phase 5 of its presale with tokens priced at only $0.03, 100% from a listing price of $0.06. That means early Phase 5 investors stand to gain 2x once MUTM launches in addition to a post-launch 74x run. With over $10.5 million raised and a growing community of 12,000+ investors, MUTM is proving itself a rising star in decentralized finance. Plus, the next presale round jumps to $0.035, meaning if you buy now, you lock in an instant 16.67% profit before prices climb. Mutuum’s Hybrid Lending Model Mutuum Finance’s edge lies in its innovative hybrid lending system that merges two powerful DeFi models. In peer to contract (P2C), users place their stablecoins, for example, USDT, into smart contracts, which give them easy income from the interest generated. In P2P, borrowers and lenders talk directly, agree on loan terms, and stay private, since they do not need agents to connect them. This unique combination gives users the best of decentralization, control, and competitive yields, a real game changer in crypto lending. Leaderboard Gamification Sparks Community Excitement and Rewards Top Holders Mutuum Finance is driving engagement with a leaderboard system spotlighting the top 50 MUTM holders in real time. Those in the top spots will receive bonus tokens, turning investment into a thrilling, competitive experience that rewards loyalty and strategy. Certified Secure & Future-Proof Mutuum Finance’s open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, boosting investor confidence in the project. In addition, Mutuum is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum designed to avoid the risks of algorithmic stablecoins’ collapse. This stablecoin is going to hold the ecosystem together by improving stability and security for the system’s users and future institutional members. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $10.5M+ from 12,000+ investors. Now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03, launch price is $0.06, a 100% ROI. Real DeFi use, Certik-audited, and high upside.

Bittensor (TAO) dipped to about $399, forming a strong buy area. Aptos (APT) saw a whopping $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume, ranking it among the top two globally. But Unstaked takes the lead. It backs real AI tools, not empty promises. The presale price of Unstaked (UNSD) sits at $0.01139 in Stage 20. With a $5+ forecast, 3000x gains look plausible. Over $9.7 million has been raised, and about 1.1 billion coins sold. After launch, live AI agents will transition fully to on-chain and operational status. Bittensor’s Sub‑$400 Dip Sparks Buy Alert Bittensor (TAO) currently trades around $399 following an 8% drop this week and 5% over two weeks. This underperformance contrasts with broader market gains. Analyst Michael van de Poppe labels this zone a strong buy. He notes capitulation from weak holders and increased interest from stronger hands. A rounding bottom pattern is emerging, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. TAO remains the top‑ranked AI coin. If momentum returns, targets could range from $425 to $433, and even $700 to $800. For those tracking smart AI coins, Bittensor appears to offer a solid accumulation opportunity. Aptos Surges With $1.6B Stablecoin Activity Aptos (APT) shows impressive growth across its ecosystem. Bridging brought in over $30 million in BTC via OKX’s xBTC in one week. Stablecoin volume reached $1.6 billion, led by USDT, USDC, and USDe. Echo Protocol secured $275 million in TVL. Thala Labs contributed $850 million in DeFi volume. Transaction growth ranks Aptos among the global top two. The chain added 39 ambassadors, distributed $3.4 million in rewards and hosted a major NFT mint. It also expanded tools like Kana Learn, gaming features, naming services, plus real‑world activations such as UNTOLD Festival. With rising activity and user adoption, Aptos is gaining serious momentum. Unstaked’s On‑Chain AI Agents Drive Real Value Unstaked delivers working AI systems that users can deploy immediately after launch. These AI agents act autonomously and run on platforms like X and Telegram. They automate outreach, manage communities, and engage 24/7. Every action is verifiable with proof‑of‑activity on‑chain. No coding is needed. This means creators and crypto teams get powerful automation without hiring staff. These agents are cheaper than an intern and more scalable. They are exactly what crypto promised, but seldom delivered. The presale price is $0.01139 in Stage 20. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, the project already shows momentum. These figures are not hype. They reflect actual buyers’ interest backed by real tech. Most importantly, these AI agents will go live after launch. That means users can deploy them immediately to earn on‑chain rewards. They can customize agent behavior to fit specific goals or communities. Once live, agents will interact, learn, and earn autonomously. That level of real‑world use cements value. A project becomes strong when its product is live and working. Unstaked meets that test. Featuring coinized AI tools, seamless deployment, and on‑chain verification, Unstaked offers clear utility. With a future price target of $5+, the potential return over the $0.01139 presale price is striking. Real use cases, strong funding, and live agents after launch mark Unstaked as a utility‑driven leader. It stands apart from speculative coins by delivering actual functionality tied to actual value. Unstaked may well be the best performing crypto today by real‑world impact and math Final Verdict Bittensor’s drop under $400 may signal a buying setup toward $700+. Aptos is thriving with $30 million BTC inflow, $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume and top global transaction growth. Both projects have strong traction. But Unstaked operates differently. It builds coinized AI agents that automate outreach, grow communities and run on‑chain with proof. Priced at $0.01139 (Stage 20), with over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, it ties real use to real value. Live AI agents post‑launch will cement its utility. This makes Unstaked the standout play rather than just hype.

At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications.

Cardano (ADA) momentum builds as it eyes a $0.70 breakout, helped by inclusion in Nasdaq’s crypto index. But while both tokens rely on trend shifts and sentiment swings, Web3 ai is delivering results now. Its presale token WAI costs just $0.000422 and unlocks eight AI-powered crypto tools that already exist. With a confirmed listing at $0.005242, early buyers lock in a 1147% gain. Over $7.7 million has poured in, making Web3 ai the only project offering working tech before hype. Shiba Inu Teeters: Will Support Hold or Selloff Resume? Shiba Inu faces pressure after weeks of declines, with resistance around $0.000014 and support at $0.0000107 holding firm. The token has failed multiple attempts to stay above the upper range, keeping it in a narrow downtrend. The weekly MACD remains flat, indicating little momentum and a stalled short-term trend. However, sideways movement may offer a low-risk entry if buyers step in near support for a rebound. A break above $0.000014 on rising volume could spark upside to the $0.000015–$0.000016 zone. For cautious traders, the current setup offers clear risk management: buy near support and set tight stop-losses. Watching volume and trend shifts now may reveal whether SHIB resumes a bearish slide or consolidates toward a rebound. Cardano Price Holds Firm as $0.70 Breakout Looms Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.66 after bouncing off key support around $0.65. Analysts say this level is critical. A firm hold here could open a move toward $0.70, while a breakdown might lead to losses near $0.60. The price recently fell from April highs but has shown signs of stabilization. Technical charts show low volatility and steady support, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. Nasdaq’s move to include ADA in its crypto index later this year may boost investor confidence. For traders watching altcoins with well-defined technical setups and upcoming catalysts, ADA stands out. Monitoring the price action near the $0.65 level could offer a smart entry before a potential upward move gains momentum. Why WAI Could Be 2025’s Biggest Moonshot Web3 ai is selling WAI at just $0.000422, yet analysts are already sketching price curves that end at 4 by 2026. Their math is not wishful thinking. The project has locked a listing at $0.005242, giving Stage 8 buyers a clear 1303.95 % lift before the first exchange candle prints. More importantly, every token powers eight AI tools that traders need. There is a live risk simulator that runs GARCH models, a DeFi yield advisor that ranks pools by safety, a scam detector that scans contracts line by line, and five other modules feeding decisions in real time. Each user action burns WAI, creating permanent scarcity. Early demand shows the concept works. Web3 ai has already raised $7.7 million without billboard hype or celebrity endorsements. If daily usage grows like early Metamask adoption, token velocity could force prices into whole dollar territory faster than many expect. Investors who missed Solana at one or Polygon at pennies now have a second shot. The window stays open only until presale allocations vanish. Grab tokens now, before the valuation wakes the market. Web3 ai Transforms Speculation into Math Investors weighing the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price target against Cardano (ADA) momentum may chase charts for weeks, yet outcomes remain tied to market mood. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price target relies on retail buzz, and Cardano (ADA) momentum demands regulatory milestones before $0.70 breaks cleanly. Web3 ai removes that guesswork. Every risk scan, yield check, or sentiment sweep burns WAI, reducing supply while usage climbs. Buying at $0.000422 secures access to eight revenue-driven tools and a listing at $0.005242, mathematically locking 1147% upside. With $7.7 million secured, WAI launches are funded, making it the pick in a speculative field.

This setup allows individuals to earn rewards by offering excess hard drive space, while businesses gain better control and transparency over their data storage needs. Filecoin’s technology has already been put to use by Web3 projects, such as storing NFT metadata and other decentralized assets. With strong backing from institutional investors and a history of regular protocol updates, Filecoin is constantly evolving to meet the needs of commercial users. Recent upgrades have boosted its retrieval efficiency, enhancing its appeal. As demand for decentralized storage continues to rise, Filecoin’s infrastructure-first approach positions it for significant growth in the coming years. 4. Render: Revolutionizing GPU Computing for Creators Render is making waves as a standout contender for the top crypto coins of the upcoming bull run, thanks to its focus on decentralized GPU computing. By connecting creators, like animators, designers, and developers, with individuals offering idle GPU capacity, Render enables faster and cheaper processing of complex visuals compared to traditional cloud services. Already adopted in the creative industry, Render’s platform helps level the playing field by providing access to powerful computing resources. With the rise of the metaverse, AI, and digital design, the need for decentralized rendering power is expected to grow, giving RNDR a strong real-world use case tied to these expanding sectors. Render has also made significant platform and governance upgrades, improving transparency and giving token holders a say in the network’s future. With a functional platform and an increasing number of users, Render is poised to scale alongside the industries it serves, positioning itself for future success. Which Top Crypto Coin Should You Buy Now? As we gear up for the next bull run, top crypto coins that deliver real-world solutions are becoming the main contenders. BlockDAG is leading the way, with its live testnet supporting NFT creation and token burn trials, all backed by over $303 million in presale funding and strong community backing. NEAR Protocol shines with its developer-friendly framework, perfect for scaling dApp growth. Meanwhile, Filecoin meets the growing demand for decentralized storage in today’s privacy-conscious world, and Render is revolutionizing the creative sector by providing decentralized GPU power for faster, more affordable rendering.

46036186,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746919,1749949850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46036186.jpeg,Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/amazon-pours-13b-into-aussie-ai/,"Amazon.com Inc. will invest A$20 billion ($13 billion) in Australia between 2025 and 2029 to expand its data center infrastructure, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global firm. The prime Minister welcomed Amazon Web Services’ investment to expand data center infrastructure in Sydney and Melbourne, calling it the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global provider. He emphasized the project’s role in strengthening Australia’s AI capabilities, creating skilled jobs, and supporting high-performance computing infrastructure. The funds will boost cloud computing capacity and support Australia’s growing demand for artificial intelligence, Amazon said in a statement. The investment will center around its existing Sydney and Melbourne data centers. Albanese met with Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman on Saturday in Seattle ahead of the G-7 summit in Canada, where the deal was highlighted as a milestone in digital cooperation . Garman highlighted the company’s commitment to helping Australian organizations leverage generative AI. He said the investment will strengthen data infrastructure, increase renewable energy use, and support Australia’s ambition to become a global AI leader. Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres welcomed the investment in an interview with Sky News Australia, calling it a “very significant” step for the nation’s digital infrastructure. “It’s in Australia’s interests to lean into the opportunity,” Ayres said. “We must be makers of the technology as well as takers.” Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia As part of the expansion, Amazon will also build three new solar farms in Victoria and Queensland to power the growing infrastructure and support its clean energy goals . Amazon will commit to buying a combined capacity of more than 170 megawatts across these farms. Amazon operates eight solar and wind energy projects across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, which help power its Australian data centers and fulfillment facilities. Once all 11 of its planned renewable energy projects are online, they are expected to produce over 1.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy annually—enough to power approximately 290,000 Australian homes each year. Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon invested an estimated A$467 million in renewable energy projects in Australia. In 2024, Amazon was Australia’s third-largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and remains the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally. As per a study by Accenture, Australian organizations migrating compute-heavy AI workloads to AWS can reduce carbon emissions by up to 94% compared with on-premises data centers. This is because of AWS’s infrastructure hardware, power, cooling, and carbon-free energy procurement efficiencies. AWS powers Australia’s AI ambitions with expanding cloud footprint The investment aligns with the Australian government’s goal to boost productivity and economic growth through AI-driven innovation. It will equip hundreds of thousands of Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and partners with advanced cloud and AI tools, enabling large-scale innovation while ensuring compliance with local data residency and regulatory standards. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources estimates that AI and automation could add up to A$600 billion to Australia’s GDP annually by 2030. AWS’s presence in Australia began in 2012 with the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. This was followed by the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific in 2023, including the country’s first AWS Local Zones in Perth. In April 2024, AWS established Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed generative AI service, in the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. Moreover, in July 2024, the Australian Government linked with AWS to provide a “Top Secret” AWS Cloud to deliver cloud innovation in national security and defense and enhance the nation’s defense and intelligence capabilities.

Recent price movements have formed a classic Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, often seen as a reliable bullish reversal signal. While the breakout hasn’t roared just yet, the structure forming beneath the surface suggests growing strength. Inverse Head And Shoulders Takes Shape On SUI Chart In a recent analysis shared on X, Cleanwater highlights a potential Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern forming on SUI. The move began with a dip from $3.74 on May 29th to $3.00 by May 31st, marking the initial correction. A strong bounce followed, pushing the price up to $3.39 on June 3rd, establishing the first neckline. Related Reading: SUI Meteoric Rise: Golden Cross Signals A Potential 380% Explosion The price then reversed again, dropping to $2.84 on June 5th, forming a key support zone and the “head” of the pattern. However, a swift recovery brought SUI to $3.55 on June 10th, aligning with the neckline and reinforcing the setup. On June 13th, SUI saw one last dip to $2.91, which Cleanwater identifies as the final touch needed to validate the inverse head and shoulders formation. With the price now trading around $3.04, the setup hints at strong upside potential. According to Cleanwater, the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern took shape with an initial dip, a slight recovery, and a second, deeper drop. A push to higher resistance followed this, then capped off by a final dip, shallower than the second and hovering near the level of the first. 4H And 1D Charts Align: Market Prepares For A Break The analyst also observed that a channel is forming on both the 4-hour and daily time frames, indicating that a breakout may be approaching. While it’s difficult to predict exactly when a breakout will occur, the consistent price action within well-defined support and resistance zones shows growing strength. Sideways consolidation like this often precedes a significant move in either direction. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View In his personal view, Cleanwater leans bullish, suggesting there’s significant upside potential if momentum shifts in favor of the bulls. The repeated tests of resistance and support reinforce this view, hinting at a strong underlying structure. Though he can’t call the exact moment for a breakout, he believes the current setup favors those positioning early for a move. However, Cleanwater also expressed caution regarding the global economic environment, noting that broader news events have started to weigh on market sentiment. He sees the current range as a solid accumulation zone, but acknowledges that a bit more time is needed for the picture to fully develop.

With new regulations, network congestion, and user demand for real-world utility, certain projects are standing out. Qubetics is leading the conversation for innovation and interoperability, while long-established names like BNB and Monero continue to build on scalability and privacy, respectively. For forward-looking participants, these three assets are proving to be the best cryptos to join this month. They offer more than just hype—they bring tangible upgrades, meaningful use cases, and sustainable growth models. Whether you’re seeking tech-backed value, long-term resilience, or privacy, this shortlist highlights the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics ($TICS): Final Public Sale, Interoperability Advancements, and Rising Community Demand Qubetics is stepping into its final crypto presale phase, and time is running out. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 at a fixed price of $0.3370, with a scheduled 20% increase upon listing. The protocol has attracted over 27,900 holders and raised $18 million. Following a major tokenomics revision, the total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, creating heightened scarcity and stronger long-term token dynamics. This isn’t just another altcoin. Qubetics introduces a cross-industry interoperability layer that simplifies how professionals, businesses, and platforms interact with decentralized systems. The surge in demand stems from its ability to integrate high-volume, data-sensitive industries without sacrificing decentralization or user control. Qubetics is engineered to avoid the congestion issues plaguing Ethereum and the centralization concerns surrounding major Layer 1 chains. What makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to join this month isn’t just scarcity. It’s the multi-layered roadmap and its delivery. The mainnet launch is anticipated by the end of Q3 2025, and early analysts have estimated price surges driven by low supply, aggressive exchange listings, and strong developer incentives. BNB Chain’s Smart Contract Dominance Strengthens In early June, Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) reported its highest-ever 24-hour developer activity spike, backed by over 2,000 verified new smart contracts. Fueled by gas cost efficiency and ecosystem grants, this surge demonstrates why BNB remains a leading Layer 1 choice, especially as Ethereum faces usability hurdles. The BNB Chain has also expanded its sidechain architecture through opBNB and Greenfield, solidifying its utility beyond DeFi. These developments have turned BNB into a multi-vertical asset, serving dApp builders, NFT marketplaces, and DePIN infrastructure alike. A key metric driving interest: BNB Chain’s daily active addresses surpassed 1.8 million last week, nearly triple the count seen in early 2023. This growth—along with newly inked partnerships with gaming studios and AI labs—underscores why BNB Chain is still counted among the best cryptos to join this month. Monero (XMR) Makes a Comeback: Privacy, Fungibility, and Anti-Surveillance Tech With rising surveillance threats and increased scrutiny of blockchain transactions by global regulators, Monero (XMR) is gaining traction again. In June, a new update to its Bulletproofs+ protocol decreased transaction sizes by 7% and improved network verification speeds by 11%, resulting in faster payments with lower resource consumption. Regulatory crackdowns on centralized exchanges have made privacy-oriented coins more appealing, and Monero leads this space with unmatched transaction obfuscation. Unlike zero-knowledge alternatives, XMR doesn’t require a trusted setup and allows true peer-to-peer transfers without metadata exposure. Monero’s relevance grows in scenarios where financial sovereignty and digital privacy are essential. While mainstream coins focus on compliance and transparency, XMR defends the ethos of permissionless freedom. For those focused on utility beyond speculation, Monero still holds a vital role in privacy-first financial systems. Its resistance to censorship and strong developer base continue to make it one of the best cryptos to join this month. Conclusion: Strategic Timing Is Everything—Final $TICS Tokens Are Running Out Fast The crypto space rewards preparation—and the smart money is already watching assets that solve real problems. Qubetics pushes interoperability to new levels, BNB enables scale for builders, and Monero safeguards privacy in a compliance-heavy era. These aren’t just trends; they’re indicators of what’s next.

Platforms that let users build, test, and deploy code offer long-term strength, not just market buzz. In this article, we examine four crypto projects that appeal to builders with working tools and promising structures. BlockDAG takes the spotlight as the only presale project already offering a working testnet and developer access, making it a practical option worth understanding. BlockDAG (BDAG): Test Smart Contracts on a Live EVM-Compatible Testnet Among the top trending cryptos in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has earned attention for providing a developer-ready environment powered by a live testnet and high-speed architecture. Built on a DAG system combined with Proof-of-Work, it delivers both scalability and strong network security. These elements are key for anyone working on smart contract-based applications. The most appealing part of BlockDAG for developers is its hands-on testing capacity. Ethereum-compatible smart contracts can already be deployed through MetaMask and Remix on its running testnet. This setup allows for real-world trials and debugging before launching on the mainnet, giving builders an early edge. BlockDAG’s economic progress is also notable. The presale has crossed $304 million in funding, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. With $304M in presale funding and Stage 29 priced at $0.0276, BlockDAG has frozen a $0.0018 access point for buyers who act fast. This won’t stay open much longer. With over 2 million users on its X1 app and batch 29 now active, BlockDAG stands apart from typical presale projects thanks to real tech and visible demand. Render (RNDR): A GPU Rendering Protocol for Development at Scale Render plays a specific but vital role in the top trending cryptos in 2025, especially for creators working with advanced visuals. It allows builders in 3D design, gaming, and digital effects to outsource GPU rendering tasks via its decentralized network, cutting time and costs while supporting large-scale production. Its API lets developers tap into distributed GPU power using smart contracts. As AI and immersive gaming continue to expand, Render’s GPU compute tools give tech creators a solid backend. RNDR tokens are used to reward those offering GPU time. While not a general-purpose chain for smart contracts, its usefulness in graphics-heavy projects earns it a firm place among top trending cryptos in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): DAG Speed with Fast Block Inclusion for Practical Builds Kaspa is gaining momentum among developers who value speed and clean structure. Its use of a DAG model allows many blocks to be processed per second with near-instant confirmations. While it doesn’t support EVM contracts, its Proof-of-Work and DAG base make it ideal for projects needing simple scripting and real-time data handling. Kaspa’s strengths include a block-pruning system that avoids data overload and a steady block inclusion design. Builders working on microtransactions, streamlined protocols, or testing new payment flows may find its approach fits well. Kaspa may not replace EVM-based platforms, but it fills a niche in the top trending cryptos in 2025 for quick, low-weight development. Solana (SOL): Fast Smart Contract Support with Lower Network Fees Solana stays relevant in the top trending cryptos in 2025, especially for creators aiming to build apps that demand high speeds and massive output. Its network handles over 65,000 transactions per second through a unique parallel processing method, with low fees and wide smart contract support. Solana’s system uses Rust and C, not Solidity, which can pose a challenge for some developers. But its efficiency often justifies the shift. Solana now offers strong tooling, improved uptime, and a growing base of active developers. For building large-scale platforms in finance, gaming, or media, Solana remains a useful option within top trending cryptos in 2025. Final Remarks! Finding top trending cryptos in 2025 isn’t only about prices or chart patterns. Builders should focus on platforms offering working tools, early testing access, and stable developer support. BlockDAG ranks high here, as its live testnet, Ethereum compatibility, and early-stage traction make it more than just a presale name. Alongside it, Render serves developers in the design and GPU sector, Kaspa supports quick builds with low complexity, and Solana allows full-scale apps with high output needs. For anyone creating real systems, these top trending cryptos in 2025 show strong promise backed by hands-on utility and technical progress.

46041754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746935,1749956858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46041754.jpeg,Cardano Founder teases full XRP integration package,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-founder-teases-full-xrp-integration/,"Charles Hoskinson, the Cardano founder, released new information about the possible integration of XRP and its related features on the Cardano blockchain. Hoskinson replied with a wide-scope plan that is not limited to RLUSD. His comments followed a user’s inquiry about whether the Ripple-backed stablecoin RealUSD (RLUSD) would be available on Cardano. He mentioned that a full “ XRP package ” is on the way, with plans for XRP DeFi integration, support for Lace wallet, “glacier drops,’ and ongoing talks about RealUSD. He did not make a fine point about timing, but his reply confirmed that high-level discussions were taking place. Cardano gears up for XRP integration with RLUSD As soon as RLUSD was mentioned, the cryptocurrency community went into overdrive, with many hoping for information on when they could access the stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain . However, Hoskinson’s reply suggests that RLUSD is part of the bigger plan, which involves all the other Ripple-related assets. One term that emerged with greater prominence was “glacier drops.” While not commonly used in the space, the term refers to a controlled and staggered release of tokens or features — analogous to a focused airdrop effort pegged to product milestones. Lace wallet support is also on the agenda. As Cardano’s official wallet was built emphasizing user experience, Lace’s integration with XRP would streamline access for users looking to manage Ripple-based assets within the Cardano ecosystem. Equally significant is the mention of DeFi. Historically, XRP has had a limited role in decentralized finance. Its integration into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure could unlock new use cases — such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision — potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform. While no final decisions have been made public, Hoskinson’s remarks shed more light on Cardano’s dedication to interoperability, interest in stablecoin adoption, and interest in growing their presence in the DeFi space. Through the integration of RLUSD, XRP DeFi utilities, advanced wallet features, and token drops, Cardano is gearing up to vie for its share of the competitive blockchain ecosystem. If it works, this could be important for Cardano in expanding its ecosystem and offering itself a bit more than it is to an even larger crypto market. Hoskinson proposes strategic investments to grow Cardano’s treasury Hoskinson recently shared insight into what the Cardano community should expect regarding the ecosystem’s decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). He gave the update in an 18-minute-long podcast on X to ecosystem members. According to Hoskinson, the team is considering several approaches to improving and growing the Cardano SWF. He maintained that the goal is to use the fund’s resources to benefit the ecosystem. Hoskinson explained that the decentralized Cardano SWF is similar in principle to how countries like Norway invest national wealth into assets for future benefits. He proposed investing a small portion of the Cardano treasury in different assets. “Could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of a collection of stablecoins … and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin/DeFi?” he asked. The plan aims to mitigate risk, create long-term yield, and reinvest the money into buying back ADA. This sets up Cardano’s Sovereign Wealth Fund to grow the ecosystem and, consequently, the value of ADA as time goes on. Cardano could make relatively easy returns without significantly eating into its core reserves by dedicating a portion of the treasury to Bitcoin and similar assets. When used to acquire ADA, these profits may increase demand and sustain the market price. Charles Hoskinson describes an economic model designed to be self-sustaining for the Cardano community.

After hitting a low on June 5th, the cryptocurrency made a small upward move. However, the momentum since then has been weak and uncertain. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.14. Current Market Situation XRP’s price has managed to hold above its June 5th low, even as many other altcoins have fallen below their recent support levels. This is a positive sign because it shows XRP is holding up slightly better than some of its competitors. But to turn this into a strong upward move, bulls need to step in soon and push the price higher with conviction. Key Resistance and Support Levels Right now, the first important price barrier for XRP is around $2.33. A clean break above this level could mean that buyers are gaining control. If that happens, the next resistance levels to watch are at $2.36, $2.48, and ideally $2.47. These levels could act as short-term targets if the rally continues. On the downside, the key support level to watch would be $1.94 and $1.83. A fall to these levels would hint at weakness and raise concerns about a further drop. What to Expect Next For a stronger bullish trend to begin, XRP needs to show increased momentum and trading volume. If buyers manage to push the price above $2.33 and beyond $2.47, it could open the door for a move towards $2.54 or even higher. However, if the price remains weak and struggles to break above resistance, or worse — falls below $2 — the outlook would turn more bearish. The critical long-term support to watch in that case would be at $1.79. A drop below this would significantly reduce the chances of a quick recovery.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 03:13:35

This sudden fall created panic among holders, with many unsure whether to sell or wait for a possible recovery. However, the price has now bounced back, gaining 6% in the last 24 hours. Pi Coin is now trading at $0.61. The price dip comes after weeks of little progress from the Pi Core Team. Despite earlier promises of major upgrades and ecosystem development, no significant updates have been delivered. This has frustrated investors and caused the token’s price to stagnate. Can Pi Price Hit $10? Even though Pi Network’s price recently fell below $1, many in the community still believe it could reach $10 one day. Pi Network already has over 70 million registered users (called Pioneers). This is a big number for any cryptocurrency. If even a small part of this community starts using Pi for daily payments, online shopping, or services within the Pi ecosystem, demand for the token could increase — and when demand rises, prices often follow. Right now, most of the mined Pi tokens are still locked or waiting for migration. This means there aren’t many tokens freely available for trading. If the supply remains limited while demand increases through new apps or business partnerships, the price could naturally climb higher over time. Analyst Dr Altcoin said, “For Pi to be practical within the Pi Ecosystem, its price would need to reach at least $10.” Geopolitical Factors Add Pressure Part of the recent crypto market decline can also be linked to growing geopolitical tensions, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. The escalating situation, which has included military strikes and leadership losses, has injected uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Like other altcoins, Pi followed the broader market trend — but some community members have criticized the token for mirroring negative movements without benefiting from bullish ones.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 04:18:33

With the market recalibrating, one project is positioning itself as a standout alternative in the form of Remittix —offering sharper fundamentals, stronger use cases, and far more room to run. Here’s why. XRP price prediction: Is a drop below $2 in the works? XRP’s four-hour chart has shown a bearish reversal head-and-shoulders formation since May 9. If the XRP price fails to reclaim the neckline of $2.33, projected XRP price targets tighten around $2.25. This aligns with the 200-day SMA, and extends to $2.00. Market sentiment has cooled, with bullish momentum fading. Egrag Crypto emphasized $2.30 as must-hold support. A confirmed breakdown could escalate losses, with extended downside targets at $2.15 and potentially $1.60, should sellers take control. Volume trends and price structure point toward a weakening bid side. Unless bulls reclaim technical ground quickly—or if the spot XRP ETF comes to pass—XRP price will continue to face sell-side pressure as bearish headwinds prevail. XRP price fell as low as $2.08 in the past 24 hours. Source: TradingView SUI facing heavy selling pressure Rising Layer-1 blockchain protocol SUI rejected at the 50-day SMA ($3.55), signaling firm resistance and renewed bearish pressure. Now trading near $3.00, the $2.86 support has become a key battleground. A break below this level could expose the pair to a deeper decline toward $2.50, as sellers look to take short-term control. If bulls hold the line at $2.86 and stage a rebound, the price may retest the moving averages. A failure to break above them would only strengthen bearish momentum, raising the odds of another test—and possible breach—of support. Market pressure is rising. The next move will likely define short-term direction. SUI hovers around the key psychological level of $3. Source: TradingView Remittix offers greater upside than XRP and SUI SUI and XRP may face stiff bearish headwinds moving forward—but the smart money is already on the next blue chip in the form of Remittix (RTX). Positioned to revolutionize the $190T cross-border payments industry, Remittix offers seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers without the friction or hidden fees typical of legacy platforms. Its architecture is tailored for both consumers and businesses, offering real-time settlement, staking rewards, and governance participation through its native RTX token. With over $15.7 million raised in presale funding, institutional and retail interest is already signaling strong forward momentum. What sets Remittix apart is scale. While SUI operates within niche verticals, RTX targets a global payments market—broad, essential, and underserved. Its platform aims to serve freelancers, enterprises, and remittance corridors with equal efficiency. With a 2025 price forecast of up to a 600% run in 2025, Remittix offers both utility and asymmetric upside, positioning it as a standout asset in the next market cycle. This isn’t just another token—it’s infrastructure, designed to last. The final word While SUI and HYPE are showing strong growth and market interest in 2025, Remittix presents the best opportunity for investment. Its innovative approach to crypto payments and its growing ecosystem position it for greater success in the coming years. Backed by over $15.7 million in funding thus far, Remittix is one of the few emerging assets with genuine institutional alignment and scalable upside.

Bitcoin was stuck above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens dropped to $3.28 trillion. This article explores the top crypto forecasts of coins like Pi Network (PI), Monero (XMR), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Pi Network price prediction Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi coin has come under pressure in the past few weeks as it plunged to $0.3945 on Friday, down from last month’s high of $1.6567. The token has stabilized a bit and moved to over $0.60 today, a 50% surge. Technicals point to more Pi Network gains as it has formed a triple-bottom pattern at around $0.60. A triple-bottom is made up of three distinct bottoms and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $1.6567. The token is attempting to move above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the MACD and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Pi Network token price will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $1, which is about 61% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.3945 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network forecast. Monero price forecast XMR price chart | Source: TradingView Monero, the biggest privacy-focused coin, has crashed in the past two weeks, erasing some of the gains made earlier this year. The initial gains happened as demand for privacy tokens soared. XMR token retreated from a high of $420 to $315 today as investors booked profits. Monero has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also remains slightly above the 50-day and 100-day EMA. Most importantly, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $301.05. A double-bottom pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, Monero token will likely bounce back as long as it remains above the double-bottom pattern at $301. Such a move will see it rise and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $353, which is about 12% above the current level. A drop below the support at $301 will invalidate the bullish Monero price forecast. Fartcoin price forecast Fartcoin chart | Source: TradingView Fartcoin, a top meme coin on the Solana network , has been one of the most actively traded tokens this year. Its recent surge saw it peak at $1.6520 in May. It then pulled back and reached a low of $0.8715, its lowest point on June 5, and then bounced back to the current $1.20. Fartcoin token remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated and moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the Fartcoin price will likely resume the uptrend, and potentially retest the psychological point at $1.50. A drop below the support at $0.8715 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

On Saturday, an Israeli strike hit the Phase 14 processing plant of the South Pars gas field , causing a major explosion and fire, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The blast forced the shutdown of a nearby production platform. South Pars, located in the Persian Gulf, is the world’s largest gas field and is shared between Iran and Qatar. Iran uses most of its gas domestically. The strike marked a serious shift in the conflict, which began Friday when Israel carried out a series of attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. By targeting energy infrastructure, Israel has now opened a new front in the crisis. The strikes will further cripple Iran’s economy and shake the markets The recent attacks come at a time when Iran is already struggling with severe power outages. Iran has already seen widespread blackouts in recent months, hitting businesses and households. The Iran Chamber of Commerce estimates the economic cost of these outages at around $250 million a day. Though the damage may mainly impact Iran’s internal energy supply, global markets are bracing for more volatility when trading resumes after the weekend. Oil markets had already reacted strongly before this latest attack. U.S. crude prices jumped by as much as 14% on Friday, finishing near $73 per barrel. Experts warn that further attacks could deepen the threat to oil production and shipments in the region. “This is pretty significant,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects Ltd. He added, “We appear to be in an escalatory cycle,” and warned that Israeli forces may continue to strike Iranian energy sites. In a separate incident, a fire also broke out at the Fajr Jam gas plant, another key processing facility in Iran. This plant handles gas from South Pars as well as the Nar and Kangan fields. Tasnim described it as one of the largest facilities of its kind in the country. Goldman Sachs analysts have already raised their short-term oil price forecasts by $2 to $3 a barrel in response to the rising tensions. They noted the potential for oil prices to spike above $100 per barrel if the situation worsens, though their base forecast still expects prices to fall below $60 by the end of the year. “The potential of further escalation in the Middle East implies that the short-term risks to our price forecast are now skewed to the upside,” Goldman analysts, including Daan Struyven, wrote in a recent note.

46047506,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-303-million-presale-surpasses-worldcoin-price-jump-solana-price-trend/,1749963600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/46047506.jpeg,BlockDAG’s $303 Million Presale Surpasses Worldcoin Price Jump & Solana Price Trend,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-303-million-presale-surpasses-worldcoin-price-jump-solana-price-trend/,"In a market where attention constantly shifts, one presale is quietly dominating the spotlight: BlockDAG. Despite being in its early phase, the project has already raised over $303 million, placing it side by side with two of 2025’s most watched names, Worldcoin (WLD) and Solana (SOL). While Worldcoin gained a boost from renewed OpenAI ties and Solana trends on speculation around a potential ETF, neither has matched BlockDAG’s steady stream of capital and user growth. BlockDAG is not relying on hype alone. It is attracting users, delivering tools, and progressing ahead of schedule. The real question is whether WLD or SOL can keep pace with what BlockDAG (BDAG) has already rolled out. Solana Shows Promise but Awaits Key Breakout to Confirm Uptrend Solana continues to rank among the most followed coins this cycle, driven by technical setups that favor a bullish breakout. The token displays both a bullish flag and an inverse head-and-shoulders formation, targeting a breakout that could climb to $295. A move above $200 might trigger a potential five to tenfold rally, particularly if the Canary Marinade ETF, scheduled for review on July 24, receives approval and draws in institutional capital. Open interest in SOL increased by 8.3% over 24 hours, with the long-to-short ratio now at 1.67. Analysts like Ali Martinez highlight a cup-and-handle setup that could take Solana to $1,000 in the long run. Yet, all of this remains speculative. Unless Solana clears its psychological resistance, the Solana price trend stays in limbo. That pause gives BlockDAG a lead by delivering concrete outcomes while others wait for signals. Worldcoin Gains on OpenAI News but Still Lacks Independent Traction Worldcoin surged 5.4% on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18 after OpenAI revealed its transition to Google Cloud. This allowed OpenAI to expand beyond Microsoft Azure and sparked interest in its AI capabilities. Since Worldcoin is closely tied to OpenAI through Sam Altman and its focus on decentralized identity, the news drove strong price and volume increases. Trading volume jumped 38% to $208.6 million, while RSI flashed bullish indicators and targets rose between $1.25 and $1.62. Despite the Worldcoin price jump, the rally seems rooted more in association with OpenAI than in independent user growth or real-world utility. As WLD remains tethered to OpenAI’s trajectory, investors who value scalability, autonomy, and native adoption are starting to consider alternatives. BlockDAG presents a much different and more self-sustaining proposition. BlockDAG Breaks $303 Million as Presale Momentum Builds Fast While Worldcoin and Solana await triggers, BlockDAG is moving ahead decisively. The project’s presale has passed the $303 million mark, drawing far more attention than typical for a pre-launch coin. With the official launch price set at $0.05, early buyers stand to gain significantly when the token becomes tradable. For the next six days, the price remains locked at $0.0018 in Batch 29, fueling strong demand. Analysts have forecast returns of up to 10,000x, and some even suggest a long-term target as high as $20. BlockDAG offers more than just speculation. Its dual blockchain and DAG framework allows for parallel block validation, solving key limitations found in older Layer 1 chains. Developers can build using Ethereum tools, thanks to full EVM compatibility. Additionally, its Smart Contract Wizard enables simplified deployment, lowering the barrier for non-technical users. A recent teaser of a US partnership has also stirred discussion, drawing attention from broader cultural and investment circles. This momentum extends beyond crypto, placing BlockDAG at the intersection of mainstream curiosity and blockchain innovation. BlockDAG’s X1 App provides a mobile-first mining system with over 2 million users across more than 100 countries. Through a Proof-of-Engagement model, users mine BDAG by checking in daily, making participation accessible and habit-forming. The app combines gamified elements with social engagement, positioning it not just as a crypto tool but as a scalable acquisition engine. This real-time user growth demonstrates that BlockDAG is not waiting to go live, it is already building a user base that most projects only dream of at this stage. Summing Up While Solana and Worldcoin remain key topics of discussion, BlockDAG is making measurable progress. The Worldcoin price jump is more about OpenAI than WLD’s own traction. The Solana price trend looks technically solid, but still needs ETF decisions and breakout validation. BlockDAG, in comparison, is checking all the boxes. With $303 million raised and the presale price at $0.0018, it’s ahead on execution. Its scalable architecture and mobile mining app are delivering real solutions, not just plans. In 2025, success belongs to projects that take action, not the ones still waiting. Right now, BlockDAG is where that action is happening.

The Japanese government confirmed today that the two continued discussing a possible trade agreement. Akazawa also had in-person talks on Friday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for around 70 minutes and with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for 45 minutes. Japan’s PM hopes to talk with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 Summit The Japanese government described the talks on Saturday similarly to Akazawa’s Friday statement, terming the conversation as “very in-depth” and that the two parties explored the possibility of reaching an agreement that would benefit both countries. It added that their Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US President Donald Trump could meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit starting Sunday in Canada, where they hope they can finalize a deal. The country is still in for a 24% tariff rate on their exports starting in July unless it can secure a deal with the US. Tokyo is also pushing to shield its auto industry from a separate 25% US levy. In earlier talks, Japan offered to increase imports of US agricultural goods and review its “non-tariff trade barriers” to American car sales to respond to the concerns of the Trump administration. In addition, the government is mulling to collaborate with the US to secure supply chains of rare earth magnets and semiconductors. So far, China is the primary producer of high-performance rare earth magnets. However, Japan hopes to promote building supply chains with the US without relying on China. Often, rare earth magnets manufacture electric vehicle motors and missile devices. Regarding neodymium magnets, China produces more than 80%, while Japan accounts for only about 15%. The US has been scrambling for ways to deal with China’s dominance and restrictions on rare earths exports, and Japan could very well be the solution the country has been looking for.

The Japanese company’s offer aroused much criticism and opposition over national security concerns. The order by Trump requires that the merger only go ahead if a deal is signed with the Treasury Department to resolve any national security risks. US Steel and Nippon Steel announced that they had reached a deal, which satisfied a critical requirement for Trump. They cited $11 billion in planned investments by 2028 and commitments on governance, production, and trade. Sources have said that the US government will also receive a golden share, which doesn’t involve an ownership stake. Other reports say some of the top jobs will also be reserved for Americans, and Nippon Steel would also be required to invest $3 billion to build a new mill after 2028. White House spokesman Kush Desai believes the deal will help Pennsylvania retain ownership of US Steel and protect the company as a critical element of the nation’s national and economic security. Japan’s Economy, Trade, and Industry Minister Yoji Moto also expressed confidence that the investment will enhance innovation in Japanese and US steel sectors while deepening their strong bilateral partnership. The merger agreement deadline is June 18, though the companies’ statement did not specify exactly when it will close.

Experts Split,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-at-105k-breakout-or-breakdown-next-experts-split/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?

The trajectory of meme coins proves it’s more than possible. From lighthearted digital jokes to serious investment vehicles, meme tokens have captured the imagination of a new generation of crypto enthusiasts. In a market increasingly driven by community engagement and viral potential, meme coins have transcended novelty and become some of the most watched, most traded, and most celebrated digital assets in the blockchain space. The wave is far from over. With tokens like Bonk, Floki, Brett, Popcat, Cat in a Dog’s World, Neiro, Book of Meme, Turbo, Ponke, and Troller Cat climbing charts and captivating communities, 2025 is poised to become the year of the meme coin evolution. Among these, Troller Cat stands apart with a live presale already drawing investor attention. For those looking to buy TCAT early, this is a critical moment to join and gain maximum perks. Troller Cat is not just riding the meme wave—it’s engineering it. Its features are why it’s consistently ranked among the top 10 meme coins. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Where Viral Culture Meets High-APY Crypto Innovation Troller Cat’s presale launched at a modest $0.000005 per token and has reached Stage 9 with the price rising to $0.00002834. The token will list at $0.0005309, and this momentum translates to an ROI of over 1773.32% from the first stage. Over 1,100 holders have already joined the initiative, raising $250,000 in under a month. With 26 presale stages and the next one poised to surge, the opportunity window narrows. Stage 9 is proving Troller Cat isn’t just a presale—it’s a precision-calibrated entry point into serious ROI. A $5K stake grants over 176.4 million tokens, tracking toward a projected value of $93.6K. Each new stage tightens the margins. Every delay lowers the upside. The setup is ready—will you take the position or miss the momentum? This presale isn’t just structured for hype. With 69% APY staking, a deflationary play-to-earn Game Center, and zero glitches due to a fully audited smart contract, Troller Cat exemplifies presale engineering done right. KYC verification adds trust, while the ability to join with no minimum buy-in—and $25 required only for referrals—makes it accessible. These features mark TCAT as one of the top 10 meme coins with built-in utility and strategic upside. Hold, Earn, Repeat: Troller Cat’s 69% APY Staking Power Troller Cat isn’t just serving up internet chaos—it’s delivering serious earning potential with every token held. While the memes draw you in, the staking rewards make you stay. During the presale, holders can tap into a jaw-dropping 69% APY staking, turning idle $TCAT into a nonstop earning machine. This isn’t fluff or gimmicks—it’s a real strategy designed for long-term impact. Each staked token contributes to a stronger, more stable ecosystem, rewarding commitment and discouraging quick flips. And unlike overinflated reward systems that crash under their own hype, Troller Cat’s staking model is built with balance, precision, and sustainability at its core. The result? A loyal base of holders who aren’t just along for the ride—they’re building wealth as they go. With rewards rolling in passively, participants can focus on enjoying the experience, spreading the word, and watching their stacks grow. In a space full of noise, Troller Cat turns loyalty into leverage—and it pays in more ways than one. 2. Bonk ($BONK): The Fast-Moving Underdog of Solana’s Meme Ecosystem Bonk emerged as Solana’s answer to the Ethereum-based meme coin explosion. With a fair launch and wide airdrop strategy, it instantly captivated thousands of wallets and created a grassroots movement that spread like wildfire. Built with speed and low fees, Bonk complements Solana’s infrastructure and delivers lightning-fast transactions ideal for micro-payments and community engagement. Bonk’s core appeal lies in decentralization and accessibility. It lacks a centralized development team and is entirely community-driven. The token experienced wild price volatility in 2023 but gained a reputation for resilience and a loyal user base. Analysts view Bonk as one of the few Solana-native meme coins capable of matching Ethereum-based contenders in both scale and sentiment. Bonk made this list for its strategic launch model, Solana integration, and ability to rally decentralized momentum, proving it’s a top 10 meme coin candidate by both speed and spirit. 3. Floki ($FLOKI): A Norse Legend Reimagined for the Blockchain Age Floki combines Norse mythology with DeFi infrastructure, creating an immersive metaverse-backed ecosystem. Unlike traditional meme coins, Floki isn’t just about the brand—it’s also about the build. From FlokiFi (its DeFi arm) to Valhalla (a metaverse play-to-earn game), the project expands utility into both entertainment and finance. Floki’s marketing is relentless, with global campaigns seen on public transport, stadiums, and major billboards. Its DAO governance, NFT marketplace, and charity arm showcase its commitment to innovation and social impact. Floki balances humor and high-function with surprising effectiveness. This project makes the top 10 meme coins list due to its cross-sector ecosystem, brand recognition, and focus on long-term scalability. 4. Brett ($BRETT): A Comedic Take with Cutting-Edge Ambition Brett is both a meme and a message. Launched as a tribute to the irreverent side of crypto culture, Brett quickly distinguished itself with community-led initiatives and bold, edgy branding. It doesn’t aim to be polished—it aims to be loud, real, and impossible to ignore. What Brett lacks in formal whitepapers is transparent governance, meme-friendly engagement, and bold takes on the future of crypto culture. Brett is unapologetically himself, and investors appreciate that. It’s building partnerships with meme-centric NFT communities, bolstering both relevance and reach. Brett earns its place as a top 10 meme coin by turning cultural commentary into crypto capital. 5. Popcat ($POPCAT): The Meme King with Viral Kinetics Popcat is one of the most recognizable meme coins, inspired by a viral image and built on pure community momentum. While many meme tokens rely on sustained marketing, Popcat thrived through the simplicity of its name and an instantly viral appeal. It started as a token of fun, but quickly snowballed into a broader project with staking, NFTs, and gamified community participation. What sets Popcat apart is its cultural stickiness. The token’s memeability remains its primary strength, and its ability to reinvent through digital culture makes it endlessly relevant. Its roadmap includes interactive gaming utilities and cross-platform meme integration. Popcat is on this list because of its sheer viral power and potential to evolve into a gamified, utility-rich ecosystem—a true contender among the top 10 meme coins. 6. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW): A Parody Turned Powerplay Cat in a Dog’s World is exactly what it sounds like—a contrarian meme coin pushing back against the dominance of dog-themed tokens. It leans into its feline identity with humorous branding while simultaneously rolling out serious crypto mechanics, including auto-burn, reflections, and community-funded liquidity pools. Its branding is wildly creative, and its contrarian concept appeals to those tired of “yet another dog coin.” With creative marketing campaigns and regular token burns, the project has maintained a strong community base while ensuring deflationary value gains. This coin made the top 10 meme coins list for reimagining meme coin narratives with sharp wit and smart economics. 7. Neiro ($NEIRO): The AI-Driven Meme Marvel Neiro stands at the junction of AI and memes, a futuristic combination that has fueled its rapid rise. It integrates artificial intelligence with crypto rewards, enabling users to generate memes through a neural network and earn tokens based on community votes. This use case is unique in the meme coin landscape. Its growth has been methodical, supported by regular community engagement, algorithmic token burns, and strategic partnerships with AI incubators. Neiro also incorporates gamified staking and a machine learning-backed rarity system for its NFT line. Neiro earns its place for pioneering the AI + meme coin hybrid model, making it a standout in the top 10 meme coins of 2025. 8. Book of Meme ($BOME): Crypto Lore as Asset Class Book of Meme is a cultural archive as much as it is a digital token. It aims to catalog and tokenize meme history on the blockchain, giving nostalgic and iconic memes their own traceable value. Each meme becomes an NFT chapter in the blockchain’s ongoing story. This coin resonates with collectors and meme historians, turning pop culture into a monetized database. The token’s roadmap includes a publishing platform, meme auctions, and educational meme modules for Web3 literacy. Book of Meme deserves a place among the top 10 meme coins because it is highly original in its blend of entertainment, education, and crypto-native art. 9. Turbo ($TURBO): The Ultra-Fast Meme Coin with Gasless Ambition Turbo lives up to its name. With a focus on blazing-fast transactions and zero gas fees through Layer-2 integrations, Turbo is positioning itself as the efficient meme coin for the next-gen blockchain. It utilizes smart routing and on-chain compression to deliver one of the smoothest transaction experiences. The project is highly technical for a meme coin, emphasizing throughput and scalability while keeping its branding loose and accessible. It has also started bridging across EVM-compatible chains, boosting interoperability and attracting cross-chain traders. Turbo is listed among the top 10 meme coins for showing that speed and scalability can merge with meme culture without compromising performance. 10. Ponke ($PONKE): The Community-Fueled Underdog With Tactical Fire Ponke began as an inside joke and evolved into a strategic, community-driven movement. It operates on a frictionless yield-generation protocol, redistributing tokens with every trade to holders and burn wallets. What began as humor turned into tokenomics brilliance. Ponke’s secret weapon is its highly engaged Discord community and strategic timing around cultural events. It often launches meme-driven campaigns during major crypto news cycles to harness trending attention. Its agility and community-first approach give it unique staying power. Ponke stands strong among the top 10 meme coins for transforming humor into organized momentum and token-based economics.

46050583,https://invezz.com/?p=2762281,1749966480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"DOGE price risks 66% drop to $0.06, but all eyes are now on MUTM",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/15/doge-price-risks-66-drop-to-0-06-but-all-eyes-are-now-on-mutm/,"In a climate where political spectacle increasingly dictates market sentiment, Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again facing heightened volatility. Recent tensions between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have ignited a fresh wave of uncertainty surrounding the meme coin’s future. With Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price already teetering near unstable support zones, some analysts foresee a sharp correction as deep as 66%, bringing the token down to $0.06. While Dogecoin (DOGE) wrestles with public narratives and celebrity-driven swings, many retail and institutional investors are now rotating into fundamentally solid assets — and one of the most notable among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Dogecoin (DOGE)’s sentiment spiral highlights need for utility-driven assets The rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) was powered by memes, viral social media moments, and endorsements from high-profile individuals. Yet its long-term growth has been questioned repeatedly due to its lack of foundational utility. The speculative nature of DOGE has left it vulnerable to unpredictable price swings — and the current drama involving Trump and Musk has only intensified investor uncertainty. Despite widespread brand recognition, Dogecoin (DOGE)’s use cases remain minimal, and that absence of real yield generation has pushed many holders to reconsider its role in a sustainable portfolio. In stark contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a protocol grounded in genuine utility. It is built to serve real needs in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena — with working products, passive income features, and robust token mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raises over $10.55 million as presale momentum builds At the time of writing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised more than $10.55 million in its presale. The token is currently priced at $0.03, making it one of the most attractive entry points in DeFi for value-focused investors. With over 12,000 holders and rising, it is clear that the market recognizes the project’s potential. A $100,000 giveaway is also ongoing, offering immediate value for early adopters while broadening exposure across new audiences. The beta version of the Mutuum platform is scheduled to go live by the time the token is listed. This means MUTM will enter public markets with a functioning ecosystem rather than promises — a rare approach that puts investor confidence at the forefront. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another DeFi project. It will combine a dual-lending architecture with both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) functionalities. In the P2C model, users will deposit blue-chip assets into lending pools to earn interest. These deposits will help other users borrow against their collateral, creating a circular ecosystem. Interest rates in each pool will be dynamically adjusted based on supply and demand, allowing lenders to enjoy higher returns during periods of high borrowing activity. Meanwhile, the P2P model will introduce broader flexibility by allowing lenders and borrowers to negotiate directly using tokens that are often unsupported by other lending platforms. This will include memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE)—giving users new ways to extract value from idle assets. One of the protocol’s most innovative tools will be the introduction of mtTokens—minted immediately when a user deposits an asset into a pool. For example, depositing ETH will result in mtETH, which will reflect the principal plus accumulated interest. These mtTokens will be freely tradable on secondary markets or reusable within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem for new strategies, including staking and collateral reuse. This model will give participants continuous access to liquidity without the need to withdraw from lending pools, preserving yield while enhancing optionality. Layer-2 integration and CertiK audit set a high technical standard Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to outperform legacy DeFi platforms by integrating with Layer-2 networks. This ensures fast, low-cost transactions that remove the barriers typically caused by congestion and high gas fees. It also greatly enhances usability, making Mutuum’s tools more accessible for everyday users. Security is equally prioritized. The protocol has been fully audited by CertiK, with a Token Scan score of 80.00. The audit involved both manual code review and static analysis, and was revised in late May 2025. These checks help verify the reliability of smart contracts and are a strong signal of long-term protocol safety. In addition to its lending pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized stablecoin that will be fully overcollateralized by assets already held in the protocol. This stablecoin will not rely on fiat reserves or centralized custodians. Instead, it will be minted from on-chain collateral with algorithmic adjustments ensuring a consistent and transparent supply. By redirecting borrowing interest payments into the ecosystem’s treasury, this system will fortify platform sustainability while giving borrowers a dependable stable asset. The native token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is the heartbeat of the protocol. With a total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens, its utility includes staking rewards and revenue redistribution. A portion of protocol profits will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This feedback loop drives token demand while incentivizing long-term participation. As the platform grows, this model will increase staking activity, deepen liquidity, and apply upward pressure on demand. Additionally, part of the protocol’s earnings will be allocated toward marketing and pool growth, reinforcing the ecosystem’s momentum.

The idea behind the feature is to be used for functional Web3 identifiers – anchors for Pi-powered apps, services, and storefronts. What Are pi Domains? Pi Network’s team described the .pi Domains Auction as a platform-level utility that “harnesses the collective resources of the Pi community and Open Network’s external connectivity to further Pi’s role in real-world commerce and digital interactions.” It’s supposed to expand the Pi ecosystem through strong participation from Pioneers, businesses, and developers. According to the team, it has seen over 100,000 bids within less than a week after its announcement (and over 200,000 in total), which shows encouraging signs of adoption and real engagement. .pi domains function similarly to traditional ones, acting as unique digital identifiers by enabling businesses, apps, and individuals to establish a clear online identity or digital storefront in a Web3 social network. They are created to operate within and outside the Pi Browser, as other wallets and browsers have the option to integrate the feature over time, similar to how other crypto-based domains work. In terms of Chrome and Safari compatibility, all .pi domains will work through the ‘.pinet.com’ extension. The team said all proceeds from this function will be “used to support the Pi ecosystem, including developer programs and events.” Recent Updates The latest on the .pi Domains Auction included two main updates and some bonuses. The first is an interface dedicated to showing statistics in real-time. Users can view domains with the most bids, the highest price, and the most recent trending bids alongside other information. This allows them to review a transparent snapshot of how the Auction is progressing and where the highest activity is occurring. The second update is the inclusion of .pi Domains Auction in the Pi App, following its initial release through the Pi Wallet, which enabled unique feature deployments, such as the stats page and email notifications. The bonus updates: refinement of the bidding interface to provide a cleaner and smoother experience; more Pionners can see and participate in the Auction as the Mainnet wallet accessibility has been “significantly” expanded; and lastly, the option to receive email notifications about updates for individual domains via the Settings tab.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $11.29, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $18.71 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price surged by 0.9% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.18 and $2.40, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for June 15 shows that the current value of Near price rose to the $2.25 mark as bulls triggered a correction. However, sellers are attempting to defend this upward move. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR faces bullish volatility toward $2.3 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the near protocol price trades in a recovery trend since declining toward $2.1. Buyers are now aiming for a strong push above $2.3 to maintain the recovery rally, defending a drop below $2.2. NEAR/USDT 1-day price chart The technical indicators suggest a drop in bullish momentum as NEAR previously declined toward $2.1, raising concerns of a short-term bearish rally. Moreover, the MACD is bearish at -0.022 units and suggests low buying demand. The EMAs are returning towards the mean position, and the latest data shows that indicator shows declining bearish pressure. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 39 from the 70.00 index level; though, it stills hints at bullish reversal. The wide Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility, indicating that the $2.3 level may not hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has met strong resistance at the $2.60 mark and the following selloff suggests high bearish momentum. If the buyers fail to defend $2.18 support, NEAR may see a freefall below that level.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 06:00:00

This rapidly growing Web3 infrastructure project, priced at just $0.0276 in Batch 29, is on track to move from an early-stage token to a fundamental Web3 asset. With the market shifting back into an optimistic gear, driven by BONK’s bullish comeback and Algorand’s stability, BlockDAG ’s unique technical advantages and its community-driven momentum are turning heads. The big question now: Could this Layer 1 project surge to $1 and become a key player in the Web3 revolution? Many investors think it’s possible. BONK Shows Resilience: A 10% Rally and Bullish Signals After a tough 21% drop over the past few weeks, BONK has made a surprising comeback, jumping 10% in just 24 hours. This bounce is backed by a promising technical signal: a Golden Cross on the MACD, where the blue line is about to cross above the orange signal line. At the same time, there’s been a noticeable increase in open interest and trading volume, with OKX traders leading the way. The platform reported a 1.27 buyer-to-seller ratio, showing a clear bullish trend. On top of the technicals, BONK is seeing impressive figures in the derivatives market, ranking second in both open interest ($5.54M) and trading volume ($14.55M). With daily spot purchases nearing $987K, the mood around BONK is shifting quickly from bearish to bullish. This reversal could spark renewed interest across other altcoins, especially for traders looking for quick, high-potential plays. ALGO’s Rebuild: Why Investors Are Watching Closely While BONK is riding the waves of volatility, Algorand (ALGO) is taking a steadier approach, showing signs of being in a critical accumulation phase. This suggests that long-term investors might be getting ready for a bigger move. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has set his sights on a target between $0.90 and $1.00, pointing to Fibonacci retracement levels and the completion of a correction phase. Currently sitting at $0.2036 with a daily volume of $69.45 million, ALGO is holding its ground even in these unpredictable market conditions. What sets Algorand apart from meme coins is its solid fundamentals. With ongoing development, strategic enterprise partnerships, and a growing presence in Web3 infrastructure, it’s more than just market noise. As the sentiment shifts and capital moves back into altcoins, ALGO might just lead the charge for rallies based on real utility and long-term value, rather than short-term hype. BlockDAG: The Layer 1 Star Ready for $1 Growth BlockDAG is capturing the spotlight as a cutting-edge Layer 1 protocol that combines powerful scalability, accessible mining, and real-world use. With a presale raise of over $303 million and a current price of just $0.0276 in Batch 29, it’s emerging as a major contender in the blockchain space. The projected launch price of $0.05 is sparking buzz, indicating strong early gains and even greater potential if the momentum continues. Unlike Algorand (ALGO), which has built a solid foundation with institutional backing, BlockDAG is making waves by appealing to a wider, more engaged audience. Its innovative X1 mobile mining app allows anyone with a smartphone to get involved through a Proof-of-Engagement model, a strategy that taps into the viral excitement seen in meme coins like BONK, but with robust, tech-driven infrastructure at its core. What sets BlockDAG apart is its advanced DAG-based architecture, designed for lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability. With EVM compatibility, it seamlessly supports Ethereum dApps, and its low-latency P2P engine minimizes congestion and keeps fees low. On top of this, a comprehensive suite of developer tools ensures that BlockDAG is more than just a trend—it’s a serious platform for the future of Web3. With five exchange listings already confirmed, BlockDAG is primed for immediate visibility and liquidity, making it a standout in the Web3 space. If you’re eyeing the next big opportunity, BlockDAG is one to watch closely. Looking Ahead The competition for top Web3 coins is heating up, but BlockDAG is quickly carving out its space. While Algorand remains a solid choice for regulated DeFi and BONK continues to drive short-term trades, neither offers the same combination of scalability, grassroots access, and Layer 1 innovation that BlockDAG brings to the table. Investors are no longer chasing small gains; they’re hunting for projects with major growth potential—think 5x, 50x, or even 100x. In a time when institutional mistrust is high and retail investors are searching for the next big breakout, BlockDAG’s $0.05 to $1 growth target seems far from out of reach. With the market sentiment around BONK heating up and Algorand maintaining steady momentum, BlockDAG stands out as a blend of speculative opportunity, strong foundations, and broad accessibility. It’s the underdog with serious potential to lead in the Web3 space.

The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel’s strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin’s trend remains intact. Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin’s appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals. According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they’re focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline."" Park added that bitcoin’s global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty. As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded between $104,480.15 and $105,696.12, closing near $105,590, up 0.15%, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Support was reinforced in the $104,400–$104,500 zone, with high-volume accumulation during the 16:00–20:00 GMT window. A bullish reversal followed at 21:00, driving BTC above $105,000 on strong volumeIntraday breakout occurred at 02:01, with price jumping from $105,486 to $105,550 on elevated activity. Consolidation above $105,470 suggests further upside potential toward $106,000, pending sustained demand.

As mainstream players adopt blockchain technology with growing confidence, digital assets such as Qubetics are capturing attention for their innovation and community-driven models. Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a standout among the top trending cryptos to buy in June 2025, attracting a wide spectrum of users through its interoperability and scalable ecosystem. This recent surge follows a wave of pivotal announcements across the crypto world. Major partnerships, technological upgrades, and regulatory developments have bolstered confidence, lifting the entire market’s sentiment. For example, several Layer 1 blockchains have showcased increased adoption metrics, while oracle providers have secured integrations that promise enhanced data reliability. These advances create fertile ground for projects like Toncoin and Chainlink to assert their value as foundational layers within decentralized finance and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): The Interoperability Powerhouse Fueling Top Trending Cryptos to Buy in June Qubetics has rapidly become one of the top trending cryptos to buy in June, driven by its strategic focus on interoperability—a critical hurdle for widespread blockchain adoption.

Qubetics aims to bridge this gap through a robust, decentralized network that caters to diverse use cases from corporate solutions to individual finance. Interoperability stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, addressing the fragmentation that currently limits broader adoption. It ensures that distinct blockchain networks can communicate and operate cohesively, unlocking new levels of functionality and efficiency. The current $TICS crypto presale has entered its 37th stage, offering tokens at a fixed price of $0.3370. To date, the presale has distributed more than 515 million tokens among over 27,900 holders, generating upwards of $18 million in funding. Notably, only 10 million tokens remain at this price point, highlighting the urgency for participation before the price increases by 20% upon listing. This tokenomics overhaul has significantly reduced the total supply from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens, fostering scarcity and aligning incentives toward long-term ecosystem growth. Beyond its market mechanics, Qubetics focuses heavily on community governance and decentralization. With 38.55% of the total supply allocated to the public sale, control is shifting to the community, reinforcing transparency and collective decision-making. This design contrasts with earlier blockchain projects where centralized control hindered organic development and user trust. As blockchain adoption expands in sectors such as finance, supply chain, and identity verification, Qubetics positions itself as a critical infrastructure. Analysts forecast a strong price movement post-listing, driven by limited supply and robust demand, marking Qubetics as one of the top trending cryptos to buy in June 2025.

After initial development by Telegram, the TON ecosystem now operates independently, maintaining momentum through vibrant community development and technical upgrades. Toncoin’s architecture supports fast transaction speeds and low fees, positioning it as a practical alternative for decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social applications. Its sharded blockchain design enhances throughput, a key factor in scalability challenges facing many competitors. Such technical strengths contribute to Toncoin’s standing as one of the top trending cryptos to buy in June. The network’s focus on interoperability through bridges connecting TON with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain further solidifies its position as a versatile blockchain solution. These efforts underpin Toncoin’s prominence among the top trending cryptos to buy in June. Chainlink: Decentralized Oracles at the Core of Top Trending Cryptos to Buy in June Chainlink remains the leading decentralized oracle provider, enabling smart contracts on various blockchains to interact with real-world data securely and reliably. As the demand for blockchain-based financial products and automated agreements grows, Chainlink’s role becomes indispensable. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network aggregates data from multiple sources, ensuring accuracy and resistance to manipulation. This functionality supports a vast array of applications, from DeFi to insurance and supply chain monitoring. Chainlink’s partnerships with major DeFi platforms and enterprise clients continue to grow, reinforcing its status as a cornerstone in blockchain infrastructure. These developments have solidified Chainlink’s standing among the top trending cryptos to buy in June 2025.

Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Explains,https://coinpedia.org/news/whats-going-on-in-the-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-explains/,"The post What’s Going On in the Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit? Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Explains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The never-ending legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC is back in the news — and pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton recently broke down exactly what’s happening. What’s This Settlement About? The SEC and Ripple have reached a proposed settlement. In it: The SEC wants to lower Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million The agency also wants the judge to remove an injunction (a legal order stopping Ripple from violating securities laws) If the judge agrees to this, the case would finally be settled and closed. But Judge Torres Pushed Back Many thought Judge Analisa Torres would quickly approve the deal, but she surprised both sides. According to Deaton, the judge told them: They cited the wrong legal rule They haven’t shown “exceptional circumstances,” a very strong legal reason — for why she should undo a decision she already made. Deaton explained that a judge can’t simply reverse an order without serious justification, especially after 4.5 years of work and resources poured into this case. Is a Deal Still Possible? Yes. Deaton believes the judge will likely approve the settlement eventually, giving it about a 70% chance, but she’s demanding a better explanation first. Both sides now need to show how this deal serves both private interests (Ripple and SEC) and the public interest (protecting other crypto investors and companies). They also need to convince her that settling now would save time, money, and resources for the courts and avoid risky appeals for both sides. Why Does It Matter? This case has been one of the most important for crypto regulation in the U.S. If the injunction is removed and the fine reduced: Ripple avoids a bigger penalty The SEC avoids risking a total loss on appeal The case officially closes without affecting Judge Torres’ earlier ruling that XRP itself is not a security in the U.S. Deaton stressed that the judge’s past ruling would still stand, and crypto companies would still need to follow U.S. securities laws.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 06:50:45

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an undecided trend regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has been maintained at $0.614 for the last 24 hours. If a downward momentum initiates, the SNX price might retest buyers’ support at the $0.585 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.88 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish trend, and SNX is following suit. From a larger picture, the token is following a bearish trend; however, the SNX price slightly increased to $0.614, gaining 1.32% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.29 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.60, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.60 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and at the start of June, the token is trading near $0.71 as the current Synthetix sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 07:00:00

As the market approaches a key inflection point, a recent update from crypto analyst XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) has brought renewed focus to the technical setup. The analyst has been tracking this price trend and provided a chart showing XRP hovering near the apex of a multi-month symmetrical triangle. The price recently faced resistance along the trendline that has capped upward movement for nearly six months, but XRPunkie expects a breakout soon. The chart shows the asset trading at $2.1, with price action now positioned just below the resistance boundary. The updated trendline, extending from the January 2025 high, reinforces the same structural formation XRPunkie highlighted earlier in the week. #XRP is finally coming to the apex of this huge 6 months accumulation triangle. If U haven't gotten enough XRP, now is NOT the time to wait for lower entry prices. We could be days away from a massive breakout.

Compression Building Toward Potential Breakout The symmetrical triangle , reinforced by the converging yellow trendlines and the visible compression in recent candles, shows that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation range. Exponential and simple moving averages (EMA 21 and SMA 33) remain tightly wound near current levels, further emphasizing the stalling momentum. XRPunkie notes that the price is at a critical juncture: “Either we get a strong rejection here & continue to chop sideways more, or we’re gonna break out of it soon.” His updated chart retains a bullish bias, supported by a projected breakout zone highlighted in green, with a measured move potentially targeting the $13 to $15 range. This range is notable, as other analysts have expressed confidence that XRP can reach $15 . The asset is currently trading at $2.15, and its trajectory remains contingent on whether it can decisively flip the descending resistance into a support level.

A successful retest and hold above the trendline would represent a shift in market structure, implying that bullish momentum is regaining control. The importance of this trendline cannot be understated, as it has consistently capped every bullish attempt since January. The digital asset is now ready for lift-off , and the potential upside around the $13–$15 zone could bring life-changing gains to XRP Investors.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Gundlach says recent behavior in the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market appears “strange” to him, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, investors are beginning to sniff out the looming risks tied to the US government’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory. “In the last 15 years, there has been a number of corrections on the S&P 500, and in every single one of them, when the S&P goes down by more than 10%, the trade-weighted dollar index goes up. This time, the dollar went down when the S&P 500 went down by almost 20%. That’s strange, things are behaving differently. Usually when the Fed starts cutting interest rates, rates across the yield curve go down. The 10-year Treasury almost always goes up [in price] immediately following the first Fed rate cut, and then it keeps rallying for a while. This time, the 10-year yield went up, and the yield curve is steepening. So I think what we have is recognition that the interest expense for the United States is untenable – if we continue running a $2.1 trillion budget deficit and we continue to have sticky interest rates.” The Bond King zeroes in on foreign investors, noting that they hold tens of trillions of dollars in US assets. Gundlach says it is now within the realm of possibility for the investor cohort to start exiting US markets. “There’s a net investment position; foreigners were investing more in the US than the US was investing outside the country to the tune of $3 trillion. That was about 15 or 17 years ago. It’s now over $25 trillion is the net investment position, and the dollar is falling. It’s not inconceivable that some of that $25 trillion that came in not even two decades could go out.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Notably, Ripple's expansion ambitions led to the acquisition of Hidden Road , a well-known prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion last month. This move confirmed Ripple's growing focus on serving institutional clients and expanding its presence in traditional finance. Ripple Confirms Use of RLUSD for Post-Trade SettlementInterestingly, following the acquisition, Ripple confirmed that Ripple USD (RLUSD), its proprietary stablecoin, will handle Hidden Road's post-trade transactions, placing the stablecoin at the center of this new strategy.Since RLUSD also runs on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), most transactions will pass through the XRPL network. While XRP won't settle these trades directly, the asset is necessary as a transaction fee. The network burns these fees, which slowly reduces the total amount of XRP in circulation.Notably, Hidden Road processes around $3 trillion worth of transactions each year. If all of that activity moves to the XRPL, the network could see a sharp increase in traffic. To better understand what this might mean for XRP's price, we asked Grok, the AI chatbot from xAI, for an assessment.Grok Presents Factors That Could Impact XRP Price GrowthGrok explained that predicting the exact price is difficult because several factors play a role. These include how much of Hidden Road's volume actually lands on the XRPL, how many transactions it involves, how much XRP gets burned, and how investors react to the development. Ultimately, it predicted a possible rise in price to a range of $3.5 to $28.However, according to Grok, the burn rate on its own won't have a huge effect. If $3 trillion worth of transactions result in about one billion operations on XRPL, that would burn around 100,000 XRP each year. At the current price of $2.16, that's about $230,000, barely a dent in the total supply of around 58 billion XRP. Even if activity increases tenfold, the burned amount still remains small compared to the overall supply. Grok Analysis Grok Analysis However, Grok stressed that real value growth could come from rising demand and greater adoption. If RLUSD helps bring more institutional transactions to XRPL, XRP's role as the fuel that powers the network becomes more important. This utility could raise demand for XRP, especially if financial institutions start building more use cases around the XRPL.Further, Grok also pointed out that market sentiment could push the price higher. Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road has already triggered excitement in crypto circles. If more investors and analysts start viewing this move as a sign of Ripple's strength in institutional finance, XRP could benefit from that optimism.XRP Price if XRPL Handles All of Hidden Road's TransactionsSpecifically, regarding price predictions, Grok presented a few possibilities. In a realistic scenario, where XRPL sees steady growth and RLUSD gains traction, XRP could climb to between $3.50 and $4.50 within the next six to twelve months. XRP Price if XRPL Handles All of Hidden Road Volume Grok XRP Price if XRPL Handles All of Hidden Road Volume | Grok If adoption picks up faster and market enthusiasm grows, XRP might reach between $5 and $10 over the next year or two.

According to Laffont, despite Bitcoin’s 13% increase so far in 2025, its volatility has decreased significantly compared to previous years. BTC’s sharp price swings have caused Coatue to avoid investing in the past. But that’s changing now. “The cost of entry into Bitcoin may be decreasing. If beta is decreasing, that would be really interesting,” Laffont said, noting that Bitcoin’s beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has decreased over time. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs by giants like BlackRock is a clear indication that BTC is maturing, according to Laffont. He also recalled that Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, but this decline was more striking compared to the fluctuations experienced, for example, after Trump's tariff announcement in April 2025. “Bitcoin is down only 5%, while Nasdaq is down more than 6% between April 2nd and April 10th. This shows that Bitcoin is now becoming a more resilient asset to risk events in the market,” he said. Additionally, the rate at which coins held in Bitcoin wallets for at least a month are being sold out has dropped significantly, suggesting that investors are moving away from short-term speculation and starting to view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Pointing out that Bitcoin’s share in total global wealth is still very low (0.4%) at around $2 trillion, Laffont said that this rate will inevitably increase over time: “If people continue to believe that Bitcoin is valuable, then that asset will become more valuable over time, which means it should become more central in portfolios.” Despite this, Laffont warned investors that Bitcoin’s weight in the portfolio should not be exaggerated: “Even if you think Bitcoin is going to be important, don’t put a large portion of your portfolio into it. A small but long-term position can make you less stressed and more profitable.” Related News: List of Today's Top 15 Trending Altcoins Published Laffont, who admitted that Coatue had previously missed the Bitcoin opportunity, attributes this mostly to their inability to think simply. According to Laffont, in the investment world, it is usually more profitable to focus on assets that people believe are valuable, rather than complex models: “For something to be valuable, everyone has to believe it is valuable. It was that simple, and we missed it.” Technology-focused hedge fund Coatue has invested in cryptocurrency and technology companies such as Dune Analytics, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave. CoreWeave also has a partnership with Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Dividing his investors into three, Laffont said that there are those who leave crypto completely to themselves, those who question why Bitcoin was entered late, and cautious investors who want to stay away from crypto. However, he stated that this cautious audience is decreasing a little more every year: “This group of abstainers is disappearing. They are becoming smaller and smaller every year.” *This is not investment advice.

It noted that there was a soaring interest from companies, with 81% of crypto-aware small and medium businesses (SMBs) expressing interest in using stablecoins. Additionally, Fortune 500 companies showing stablecoin interest have tripled compared to 2024, and 82% of SMBs said crypto can solve at least one major financial challenge. The Q2 2025 State of Crypto report just dropped. TL;DR: The world loves stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/agOZ8naqoF — Coinbase ️ (@coinbase) June 10, 2025 Stablecoins: The Future of Finance The firm also reported that organic stablecoin transfer volume has reached unprecedented levels, with the two highest monthly volume transfers in history over the past year in December and April. The stats don’t stop there. There are more than 160 million stablecoin holders worldwide, and global stablecoin supply grew 54% year-over-year. Additionally, stablecoin transfer volume in 2024 hit $27.6 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. “Regulatory clarity is the unlock for crypto’s next chapter,” the report noted, citing the GENIUS Act and other bills that are making their way through US Congress. “An overwhelming 9 in 10 Fortune 500 executives agree that clear, consistent US regulation around crypto, blockchain, and onchain technologies is essential to support ongoing innovation. “ The United States is not the only nation pushing for stablecoin regulation. This week, the newly elected president of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, made good on his campaign pledge by proposing the Digital Asset Basic Act. The legislation allows local companies to issue stablecoins with a minimum equity capital of 500 million KRW ($US368,000), and they need to guarantee refunds through reserves and get regulatory approval. However, the wheels are turning much more slowly in Europe, where the European Central Bank wants its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) and regional governments want to maintain their tight grip on monetary flows. Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook The current stablecoin ecosystem is dominated by just two players, Tether and Circle. Tether has a 61% stablecoin market share with $155 billion in circulation. USDT supply has surged around 38% over the past 12 months to an all-time high on June 10. Circle’s USDC has also surged with a circulation of $61 billion, giving it a market share of 24%. The two companies produce 85% of the stablecoins in the market at the moment. Maker’s USDS, formerly DAI, is the third-largest with $7.2 billion and the only true high-cap decentralized stablecoin.

XRP Army Reacts,https://timestabloid.com/what-is-the-minimum-price-you-are-willing-to-sell-your-xrp-at-xrp-army-reacts/,"A tweet posted by prominent crypto enthusiast “XRP Avengers” has gotten attention from the XRP community after posing a direct question to holders: “What is the minimum price you are willing to sell your $XRP at? $5, $10, $50, $100, $500 or $1000?” The question prompted numerous responses from long-term investors and crypto community members, many of whom articulated strong personal strategies for holding or selling the digital asset. The tweet reflects the sentiment from XRP holders who view the asset not only as a medium of exchange or investment but as a key component of their future financial plans. What is the minimum price you are willing to sell your $XRP at? $5, $10, $50, $100, $500 or $1000? #XRP — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) June 11, 2025 Long-Term XRP Price Projection One community member, identified as “yves,” responded by stating that if the ecosystem surrounding XRP develops positively, he has no intention of selling at all. According to yves, XRP is his “generational wealth coin,” and he claimed that in his forecast, XRP could reach $100,000 within the next ten years. He clarified that while he does hold other digital assets that he may choose to liquidate, XRP is not one of them. Specifically, he pointed to SHX as a coin he intends to sell, setting a sell price of €3.33. He concluded by referencing his long-term commitment to the XRP community, saying he has been involved in the space “for too long,” and characterized his stance as a reflection of his broader investment philosophy. Some Holders Emphasize Utility Over Liquidation Another reply came from a user identified as “Charlie Sunshine,” who rejected the idea of selling XRP entirely. Instead, he advocated for leveraging XRP as a long-term asset through investment rather than liquidation. In his words, “Sell?? Invest it and you’ll never have to sell it. That’s the point. Its uses are limitless.” His view aligns with others who believe XRP’s potential lies in its future utility rather than in short-term price targets. More Cautious Voices Point to Current Market Levels In contrast to those projecting high valuations or indefinite holding strategies, a third community member named “S.M” offered a more tempered perspective. S.M highlighted the current market valuation, noting that at the time of their comment, XRP was priced at $2.24. From this standpoint, they regarded all the hypothetical price points mentioned in the original tweet as speculative. S.M emphasized that XRP must first surpass the $5.00 mark before more ambitious targets can be taken seriously, framing the discussion in more immediate and realistic terms. Varied XRP Investment Approaches These varying responses illustrate a range of investor attitudes toward XRP’s future. Some are focused on the digital asset’s perceived long-term potential and institutional adoption, while others maintain a more price-conscious and incremental approach. The community includes both those who regard XRP as a key store of value and those who view it within the context of broader portfolio strategies. While opinions differ on what constitutes an acceptable exit price, the level of engagement highlights the significance XRP still holds within the crypto investor base.

According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, stablecoins could soon reach their breakthrough moment, akin to the iPhone’s launch in 2007. In a post on Saturday, Allaire said the industry is “not quite yet at the iPhone moment ” when developers universally recognize the potential of programmable digital dollars. However, he acknowledged that the day was fast approaching. Calling stablecoins “the highest utility form of money ever created,” Allaire’s remarks responded to a post from a16z Crypto partner Sam Broner, who argued that stablecoins foster competition and reduce the costs of building financial applications. Broner noted that stablecoins allow anyone to program money, fostering more competition, which leads to better prices, improved user experiences, and greater access. Retail giants and e-commerce leaders embrace stablecoins Allaire’s optimism coincides with reports that US retail giants Walmart and Amazon are exploring their own US dollar-backed stablecoins, signaling increased institutional interest. Meanwhile, e-commerce powerhouse Shopify recently confirmed plans to integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin for payments by the end of 2025. The global e-commerce giant is rolling out the early access in collaboration with major US exchange Coinbase. According to a spokesperson for Shopify, a limited number of merchants will immediately have access to the full product starting on June 13 as part of the early access rollout. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke said in an X post on Thursday that they think that stablecoins are a natural way to transact on the internet and worked with Coinbase to develop the commerce payment protocol smart contract that powers this work. Daren Matsuoka, a data scientist at a16z, emphasized the transformative potential of stablecoins in onboarding the next billion crypto users. In a June 6 post, he highlighted the staggering $33 trillion in transaction volume processed by stablecoins over the past year — nearly 20 times more than PayPal and almost three times that of Visa. Circle surges as stablecoin momentum grows and the GENIUS Act advances The spike in the adoption of stablecoin comes just days after the public debut of Circle on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5. Shares of the company jumped 167% on its first day of trading, a sign of keen investor interest. However, rival stablecoin USDT’s issuer, Tether, has no intention of following suit. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said on June 8 that Tether will continue to be a private company for the foreseeable future. Allaire’s forecast of an “iPhone moment” for stablecoins is starting to look plausible as competition heats up and use cases multiply. The future of stablecoin issuance for many companies may depend on the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. This bill seeks to establish clear rules around collateralization and enforce Anti-Money Laundering compliance. These regulations could pave the way for greater institutional adoption in the world’s largest US economy. On Thursday, the US Senate advanced the bill with a 68–30 vote, as Majority Leader John Thune called on lawmakers to rally behind the legislation. A bipartisan majority, including several Democrats, voted to invoke cloture, moving the bill toward a full floor vote before it heads to the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, firms associated with major banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo have reportedly explored launching a joint stablecoin initiative.

Deaton clarified that his analysis was not aimed at discrediting the lawyers involved, but instead focused on what he believed was missing from the recent motion. He emphasized that his critique should not be interpreted as a call for deference or excessive flattery toward Judge Analisa Torres. Responding to a comment implying that he and fellow commentator Freddy Rizzo believed Ripple and the SEC should have been more deferential to Judge Torres, Deaton refuted the suggestion directly. He stated that he sees a 70% chance that the requested relief will be granted, and he plans to further elaborate on his reasoning in a subsequent post. Someone posted a comment that said “we get it: you and @freddyriz believe @Ripple and the @SECGov should’ve kissed Judge Torres’ ass more. That’s not it. In fact, I believe there’s a 70% chance she grants the relief requested and I’ll discuss it more in detail tomorrow. … https://t.co/QXf65N87dR — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 14, 2025 Expectations Around SEC Accountability Deaton expressed disappointment that the SEC did not acknowledge prior overreach in its enforcement actions against crypto firms . He believed the SEC could have benefited from recognizing how past leadership had engaged in aggressive tactics, citing judicial rebukes such as the appellate court’s finding of “arbitrary and capricious” actions and the sanctions imposed on SEC attorneys in the Debt Box case. He also referenced Judge Sarah Netburn’s prior comment that SEC lawyers “lacked faithful allegiance to the law” in the Ripple proceedings. From Deaton’s perspective, a more effective argument would have included some recognition of these developments. He thinks the SEC had an opportunity to demonstrate an evolution in its stance by referencing these prior legal setbacks and using them as context for supporting the relief request. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Missed Opportunity to Emphasize Regulatory Shifts Deaton also believed that Ripple’s legal team, which includes a former SEC Director of Enforcement, could have done more to explain the real-world implications of continuing to operate under a potential injunction. He noted that the pending legislative developments —such as the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act—constitute exceptional circumstances that could be relevant to the court’s decision-making. According to him, this legislative context and its implications for business competitiveness were not fully brought forward. He added that Ripple is disadvantaged as long as an injunction hangs over it, particularly when compared to competitors like Circle , which operate without such legal restrictions. Financial institutions and corporate partners tend to favor legal certainty, and Ripple’s position could be weakened if these risks are not removed. Legal Strategy Versus Judicial Standards Ultimately, Deaton summarized that the legal argument seemed to lean on the political shift following the U.S. presidential election, rather than offering a robust rationale that would meet the court’s standards for reconsidering a prior decision. He suggested that merely referencing a couple of case precedents was insufficient and that the legal team appeared to be assuming the judge would be willing to reverse her earlier position based on minimal legal reasoning. Deaton closed by acknowledging that his expectations might reflect a lack of experience in such high-level legal proceedings. Nevertheless, he indicated that he had anticipated a more detailed and strategic approach aimed at persuading a judge who believes her prior ruling aligns with existing law. He concluded his post by encouraging followers to tune in the next day for an objective breakdown of both the arguments for and against granting the requested relief. He also noted that CryptoLawUS would follow up with a poll regarding the likely outcome. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Trump disclosed over $600 million in 2024 earnings, much of it from crypto ventures. His total asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, with significant income from NFTs, token sales, and real estate. The revelation raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest during his presidency. The filing , made public Friday, outlines the president’s sprawling business portfolio, including significant gains from digital assets and meme coin projects. While the exact timeframe isn’t specified, the report appears to cover income through the end of December 2024. Trump Assets Top $1.6 Billion, Earnings Surge Trump’s estimated asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis . Notably, a large portion of his 2024 windfall came from crypto-related endeavors, including over $320 million in estimated fees from the meme coin $TRUMP, and more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm. The disclosure also shows Trump received $57.35 million from token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The report sheds light on the growing entanglement between Trump’s business interests and the U.S. crypto industry. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office.

While exact valuations are unclear, revenue from branded merchandise and licensing deals continue to flow in. Among them, $2.8 million from Trump Watches, $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances, and over $1 million from his NFT trading cards. In the physical world, Trump’s Florida golf resorts brought in $217.7 million, led by the Trump National Doral, which earned over $110 million. Additional income came from real estate projects in India, Dubai, and Vietnam, with licensing and development fees totaling over $30 million. The filing also included $12 million in passive income through investments in Blue Owl Capital and U.S. bond funds. Despite previously claiming to have distanced himself from day-to-day management, the disclosure confirms Trump remains deeply tied to the financial performance of his vast network of businesses, including crypto. SEC Approves Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-Linked Registration As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. While the approval gives TMTG flexibility to raise capital, the firm says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. After Pi Coin doubts, investors eye Neo Pepe Coin, a tech-powered memecoin blending utility with DeFi and NFT potential. Table of Contents Pi Coin experience vs. Neo Pepe’s movement Why Neo Pepe Coin stands out Smart contracts driving real value Ethereum liquidity pool integration Deflationary tokenomics creating scarcity How Polygon innovations strengthen Neo Pepe’s model Polymarket case study Presale alert, Neo Pepe Coin’s big opportunity Think smarter with smart contracts and memecoins Pi Coin once promised to change the crypto space with its ambitious goal of accessibility. However, many have now begun questioning whether it has turned into one of the biggest rug pulls of the year. For those that are burned by Pi Coin (or almost fell for it), they may be wondering where to look next for potential high-value investments. Enter Neo Pepe Coin, a memecoin powered by cutting-edge technology and smart contract functionality that offers real value far beyond just hype. Neo Pepe Coin isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan memecoin. With promising applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and play-to-earn gaming, it positions itself as a hybrid of fun branding and serious utility. Buyers looking to cash in on the next big crypto opportunity may want to explore this ecosystem model, especially with its presale currently underway . Below, we’ll deep-dive into Neo Pepe Coin’s groundbreaking features, the role of smart contracts, and how its ecosystem leverages Ethereum liquidity pools and deflationary tokenomics to deliver long-term value. Stick around to find out why joining this early could be a smart move for your investment portfolio. You might also like: Pepe price due for a healthy pullback after 30% rally Pi Coin experience vs. Neo Pepe’s movement Before we explore Neo Pepe Coin, we need to reflect on one of the most debated crypto stories this year. Pi Coin launched with enormous hype, marketed as a game-changing platform that made mining accessible through mobile devices. Yet, its utility and transparency have been marred by criticism, with many calling it a borderline rug pull. Investors placed their faith in Pi Coin, only to discover limited real-world utility and questionable long-term potential. Learning from such experiences, the crypto community seeks coins that integrate robust functionality, community-driven governance, and transparency. This is where Neo Pepe Coin stands apart, with its focus on innovation and utility. Why Neo Pepe Coin stands out Unlike purely speculative tokens, Neo Pepe Coin is backed by tangible utility and unique features that redefine what a memecoin can achieve. From its smart contract capabilities to Ethereum liquidity pool integration, Neo Pepe Coin creates a comprehensive ecosystem for savvy crypto investors. Smart contracts driving real value Neo Pepe Coin leans heavily into the power of smart contracts to offer real-world value. These contracts automate agreements between parties without relying on intermediaries, making them ideal for: Staking and Farming: Invest Neo Pepe Coins in DeFi protocols to earn passive income while contributing to the ecosystem. NFT Compatibility: Neo Pepe’s smart contracts enable seamless integration with decentralized NFT exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, or trade digital collectibles. Gaming Rewards: The play-to-earn gaming sector is growing rapidly, and Neo Pepe Coin is positioning itself as a go-to token for transparent and secure in-game rewards. This application of smart contracts ensures Neo Pepe Coin has utility well beyond the humor-filled image of its meme origins. Ethereum liquidity pool integration Neo Pepe Coin thrives on integration with Ethereum liquidity pools, offering investors several tangible benefits: Smooth Trades: The liquidity pool eliminates price fluctuations during transactions, allowing for efficient and cost-effective trading. Ecosystem Strength: By participating in Ethereum’s liquidity pool, Neo Pepe contributes to sustaining and expanding one of the largest blockchain ecosystems. Enhanced Returns: Investors enjoy dual exposure to the proven stability of Ethereum and the explosive growth potential of Neo Pepe Coin. By linking itself with Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, Neo Pepe Coin creates a synergistic relationship that amplifies its value proposition. Deflationary tokenomics creating scarcity Unlike inflationary tokens that flood the market with excess supply, Neo Pepe Coin adopts a deflationary model. Here’s why this matters: Token Burning: Periodic token burns reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and driving long-term value. Sustainable Growth: Lower supply combined with rising demand ensures steady upward pressure on token prices. Community Incentives: This setup rewards early adopters and holders by making their tokens more valuable over time. This deflationary mechanism ensures Neo Pepe Coin doesn’t fall victim to the pitfalls of oversupply, as many other coins have. How Polygon innovations strengthen Neo Pepe’s model Neo Pepe Coin’s affiliation with the Polygon ecosystem amplifies its strengths. Often called the “Internet of Blockchains,” Polygon addresses Ethereum’s scalability issues with faster transaction speeds and lower fees. Platforms like Polymarket have thrived on Polygon’s infrastructure. Neo Pepe Coin similarly leverages Polygon’s capabilities, promising investors and users a seamless experience within its ecosystem. Polymarket case study Polymarket’s success on Polygon demonstrates how tokens like Neo Pepe can thrive. By offering real-time trade settlements at minimal costs, Polymarket has set the standard for what a next-gen crypto platform can achieve. Neo Pepe Coin mirrors this ethos, making DeFi, gaming, and NFT transactions efficient and affordable. Presale alert, Neo Pepe Coin’s big opportunity Now that Pepe Coin’s incredible potential has been explained, it’s time to talk about strategy. The presale phase is where the smart money moves in. Here’s why: Exclusive Pricing: Token prices during presale are significantly lower than their listing price, creating a perfect entry point for early supporters. Community Perks: Earn access to exclusive NFTs, governance rights, and bonus rewards as part of the early adopter family. Rapid Growth Potential: Joining before public launch means you’re at the forefront of one of the most promising crypto revolutions. Getting involved is easier. How to Join its presale Visit the Official Website: Head over to Neo Pepe Coin’s verified page to get started. Connect a Wallet: Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet for safe and seamless transactions. Buy Tokens: Select how much to invest and complete the purchase. (Tip: Act early for the best deals.) Hold and Watch: Secure tokens and keep an eye on their rise as the ecosystem grows. Think smarter with smart contracts and memecoins Neo Pepe Coin isn’t just another token riding on the memecoin wave. It’s a thoughtful, utility-driven platform marrying smart contracts, deflationary tokenomics, and Ethereum liquidity pools to offer something truly valuable in the crypto space. While other tokens might deliver short-term hype with little substance, Neo Pepe Coin has all the ingredients for long-term success. Ready to make smarter investments and join the future of memecoins with real value? Don’t miss out on the presale and the chance to be part of a community that turns jokes into serious profits.

Investors and market watchers both find great interest in this forecast. The issue now is whether XYZVerse will really redefine the scene and fulfill on high standards. Is a 30x Jump Possible for XYZVerse ($XYZ)? Price Prediction XYZVerse entered the meme coin space at a period when community-driven tokens still rule speculative trading. The emergence of meme coins such as PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows how powerfully community involvement, viral marketing, and strong branding can propel large increases. The potential of XYZVerse depends much on the general mood of the market as well. Lower-cap meme coins are attracting more interest as the altcoin season gets underway. XYZVerse could profit from this wave if it gets strategic exchange listings and keeps community buzz after launch since it is still in presale. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: The Future of Fast and Free DeFi Trading Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform aiming to change decentralized finance (DeFi). Built from the ground up, it offers a custom Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability. At its heart is HyperBFT, a unique consensus mechanism that ensures transactions are finalized quickly and securely. One of Hyperliquid’s standout features is its focus on perpetual futures trading directly on its native blockchain. Unlike many platforms, it eliminates gas fees for transactions, making trading more affordable and efficient. With a fully on-chain order book, Hyperliquid provides transparency and security, as every transaction is verifiable on the blockchain. In today’s market, Hyperliquid looks promising. Its approach to fast, cost-free trading meets the growing demand for efficient DeFi solutions. The development team, with backgrounds from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT, brings strong expertise to the project. Being self-funded, Hyperliquid operates independently, focusing solely on its vision without outside pressures. Compared to other coins, its zero gas fees and high-performance blockchain give it an edge. As the DeFi space evolves, platforms that offer speed, security, and low costs are likely to attract more users. Hyperliquid’s unique features position it well in the current market cycle. ICP: Paving the Way for a Decentralized Internet Revolution Imagine an internet where apps run at lightning speed without relying on big tech companies. That’s the vision of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation. ICP aims to transform the internet from just a network for sharing information into a global computing platform. It seeks to enable decentralized applications to operate swiftly and securely, reducing costs and boosting efficiency. This could reshape the way we experience the digital world, making it more open, secure, and user-friendly. In today’s market, ICP stands out with its bold goals and cutting-edge technology. While many cryptocurrencies focus on digital money, ICP is building the backbone for a new kind of internet. This sets it apart from other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the market looks for projects with real-world use, ICP’s approach could make it an attractive option. By challenging traditional cloud services and decreasing reliance on big tech, ICP has the potential to revolutionize the digital landscape. For those watching market trends, ICP might be a coin worth keeping an eye on. Conclusion Though HYPE and ICP are commendable, XYZVerse’s sports-meme fusion and community focus make it poised for exceptional growth, offering early adopters a chance to ride the 2025 bull run.

33767162,[object Object],1749977842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Whales Buy $495K Solaxy in Two Days: The Best Crypto Presale Ends in One Day,https://bitcoinist.com/whales-buy-495k-solaxy-in-two-days-the-best-crypto-presale-ends-in-one-day/,"Solaxy ($SOLX) is turning heads – and wallets. In just the past 48 hours, crypto whales have scooped up nearly $500K worth of $SOLX tokens across more than ten big-ticket transactions. One whale dropped $113K just today, while others followed closely behind with $59K and $58K purchases yesterday. The project has already raised over $50M during its presale, and now it’s racing toward the finish line.With just one day left before the presale ends, investors are making their move. And fast. Why Are Whales Suddenly Flocking to Solaxy? The answer seems to lie in a mix of urgency and belief. The Solaxy ($SOLX) crypto presale officially ends Monday, giving buyers less than 24 hours to lock in $SOLX at $0.00176. That’s a steep discount compared to where it could be headed if this whale interest keeps snowballing. And this isn’t just a meme coin feeding frenzy (though we love a good meme coin moment). These are calculated, high-volume buys from wallets that don’t usually blink unless they see major potential. In a market where new crypto projects pop up like mushrooms after rain, Solaxy appears to be one of the rare ones getting real traction. So, What Is Solaxy? Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana, designed to fix the problems that have plagued the network – like congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability – while turning up the dial on what Solana does best: speed and low fees. Its native token, $SOLX, is multichain and will be available on both Ethereum and Solana – the two most dominant and liquid blockchains in existence. That means $SOLX connects the dots between Ethereum’s enormous DeFi and tokenization markets and Solana’s efficiency. You get the best of both worlds: vast liquidity on one side and blazing speed with low fees on the other. This dual-chain power opens the door for an expanded user base and makes $SOLX a serious contender for long-term adoption. Solaxy is also a game-changer for meme coin traders. It democratizes access to sniper bots, giving retail users the tools that were once reserved for whales and insiders. That means faster entries, better exits, and more wins in a space where milliseconds matter. With top Layer 2 tokens already boasting billion-dollar market caps, Solaxy is stepping in not just to compete, but to take the lead as the first and most powerful Layer 2 on Solana. It’s more than a blockchain. It’s a bridge to the future of DeFi. Time’s Almost Up: Just One Day Left to Buy The clock is ticking. The Solaxy presale ends Monday, and there’s no second chance to buy at the current price of $0.00176. So far, the project has raised over $50M, and in the past two days alone, whales have poured in nearly $500K across multiple six-figure buys. That kind of action signals confidence, not hype. Now here’s where it gets exciting. According to current forecasts, $SOLX could reach $0.032 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential gain of 1,718% from today’s price. But the real kicker comes when you factor in staking. With an annual percentage yield of 82%, investors who stake their tokens stand to grow their holdings significantly before $SOLX even hits those predicted highs. Imagine you buy $SOLX for $1K today. At the current rate, they’d get about 568K tokens. Staking those tokens at 82% APY means they’d have over a million tokens in a year. If the price reaches the predicted $0.032 by the end of 2025, that investment could be worth more than $33K. Even if $SOLX only hits the low-end prediction of $0.0024, that’s still over $2,4K – more than double the original investment. That’s the beauty of staking combined with smart timing. And timing is everything, because there’s just one day left before this presale closes for good. The whales have already made their move. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now’s the time to jump in. Your Last Chance to Catch the Wave The clock is ticking on Solaxy , and the whales aren’t waiting. If you’re hunting for the best altcoin opportunity before summer really heats up, $SOLX might be your last-minute ticket.

Most larger-cap alts are slightly in the red, including HYPE, which has dumped by 5%, while PI is up by a similar percentage. BTC Stopped at $106K The primary cryptocurrency was riding high at the beginning of the previous business week as it pumped above $110,000 on several occasions by Wednesday. However, each attempt was met with an immediate rejection, and the last one pushed BTC south to under $106,000. Although the bulls managed to recover some ground on Thursday and pushed bitcoin to $108,400, the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East resulted in an immediate price drop that drove the asset south to under $103,000. Although the attacks continued in the following 48 hours, including a few retaliations by Iran, BTC’s price recovered some ground and even jumped above $106,000 hours ago. However, US President Trump weighed in on the matter once again at that point and threatened Iran with “the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces” if Tehran decides to retaliate against the US in some form. Bitcoin slipped once again, but it’s still hovering above $105,000 . Its market cap remains below $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.7% on CG. BTCUSD.

Ethereum is still above $2,500 after a minor decline, and similar price drops of around 1% are evident from DOGE, BNB, LINK, XRP, and SOL.

Saylor stated that the United States should not miss this change, saying, “It is in the interest of the United States to have as much Bitcoin as possible before other countries realize this transformation.” According to Saylor, the BTC network will form the basis of future capital flows as a decentralized financial infrastructure, so it is strategically important for countries, especially the US, to invest in Bitcoin early.

With a near 600% rally from November 2024 to January 2025, XRP was the best-performing asset among the top cryptocurrencies during the Trump-led market-wide rally, as confirmed by CNBC . However, while some might consider XRP holders lucky, they fail to acknowledge the years of agony suffered by these investors.John Squire, a market commentator, recently called attention to this. According to him, if patience was a crypto token, XRP holders would have already assumed billionaire status. This is due to their ability to hold the asset through seven years of price struggles. John Squire on X John Squire on X XRP Faced a Turbulent Period After 2018For context, after surging over 68,000% from March 2017 to January 2018, XRP price stumbled considerably. This downturn continued for over two years, with XRP reaching a new low of $0.1140 by March 2020. Notably, this marked a massive 97% crash from the $3.8 all-time high.When XRP attempted a recovery push in November 2020, soaring 177% that month, it encountered a fundamental issue. Specifically, the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple began the month after, triggering a 67% crash in December, XRP's highest-ever monthly loss.The asset witnessed a bearish campaign after December 2020, as several U.S. and Canadian exchanges ceased trading. Massive selloffs also engulfed the asset, triggering intense bearish pressure. As a result of this, XRP missed the 2021 bull run and faced relegation below the top 5 list of largest assets.While other assets posted new gains in 2021, XRP failed to leverage the uptrend due to the bearish pressure, only rising to $1.96 in April 2021, 92% away from its 2017/2018 all-time high. XRP Holders Remained Unperturbed Amid the StrugglesNotably, despite the bearish campaign, most XRP investors held strong. Interestingly, the number of XRP holders continued to increase during this turbulent period. Specifically, data from Santiment confirms that there were about 986,000 XRP holders in January 2018 amid the all-time high.However, despite the downturn that followed, the number of XRP holders quickly crossed the 1 million threshold and continued to increase. Over the next few years, amid the price collapse and the SEC lawsuit, existing holders held strong, and the market welcomed new entrants. Total XRP Holders Santiment Total XRP Holders | Santiment Between January 2018 and December 2022, XRP welcomed over 3.53 million new holders. Ironically, the growth pace saw a remarkable uptick from November and December 2020 when the SEC lawsuit began. This pace dropped after the effects of the May 2022 Terra collapse.Reward for Patience?Now, XRP is attempting to make up for years of what many have believed to be an elaborate price suppression campaign. The near 600% rally from November 2024 to January 2025 is the first step toward this recovery effort.Multiple analysts believe a much larger upsurge is imminent, citing XRP's 2017 price action. Analysts like BarriC believe their patience will be rewarded, and not at meager prices such as $2.

According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter say that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Such a move would mark a major shift away from the traditional finance system, which includes the nation’s largest banks and credit providers. Other firms that are reportedly exploring the potential use of stablecoins include Expedia Group and unnamed airline companies. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to other assets – such as the dollar, precious metals, or other crypto assets – and are typically backed on a one-to-one basis. Stablecoins have been gaining traction recently due to their low transaction fees and faster payment processing times. The firms’ decisions may ultimately depend on the fate of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill still making its way through Congress and yet to pass either chamber. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, aims to establish a regulatory framework for alternative payment systems, opening the door for new players to compete with giants like Visa and MasterCard. The sources say that Amazon’s stablecoin exploration has mostly revolved around creating one for online purchases, while Walmart has lobbied to change the GENIUS Act to introduce more competition in the credit-card sector. The firms are also considering how to use existing stablecoins if they decide not to create their own.

Experts Break Down the Math,https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-handle-14-of-swift-volume-experts-break-down-the-math/,"At the APEX 2025 developer summit, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that XRP could facilitate up to 14% of SWIFT’s total volume within five years. With the global interbank messaging network handling over $30 trillion in annual cross-border transactions, such a goal implies a dramatic expansion in XRP’s utility. While some dismissed the claim as aspirational, the post-event analysis has introduced rigorous, data-driven models suggesting XRP could fulfill that role under the right conditions. Conservative Liquidity Calculations Crypto expert and commentator Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) offered a grounded view of how much XRP would be needed to handle a $4.2 trillion annual volume, representing just a fraction of SWIFT’s total, under conservative assumptions. Based on a token price of $2.15 and an average transaction cycle of three minutes for liquidity management, the calculation estimates that 11.15 million XRP could facilitate that volume, amounting to only 0.0190% of the 58.82 billion circulating supply. The key factor underpinning this conclusion is high token velocity. If each XRP is reused every three minutes, that enables up to 480 bridge transactions per day per token. On a VERY CONSERVATIVE calculation, 11.15 million XRP (at $2.15) is needed to facilitate $4.2 trillion annually. That is approximately 0.0190% of the circulating supply of 58.82 billion. The exact number depends on real-world velocity & liquidity. We know the settlement times… https://t.co/ZDtHHV2WMZ pic.twitter.com/QZohB8CGIX — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) June 14, 2025 The Critical Role of Velocity in XRP Valuation However, this high-frequency assumption is theoretical and rarely mirrored in actual market conditions. Another contributor, responding to Eri’s model, elaborated on the practical realities of using XRP as a bridge asset . If liquidity recycles more slowly, for instance, at 100 or even 50 transactions per day, the price of the asset must increase significantly to maintain the same transaction capacity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The example given shows that at only 50 transactions per day, XRP would need to be priced at approximately $20.64 to handle the same $4.2 trillion throughput. At 10 daily transactions, the price would have to hit $103.20. This shift shows how reduced velocity increases demand per token, exerting upward pressure on price. Some experts believe the pressure from this volume could push the asset even higher, with one expert recently suggesting a potential 16,400% surge to $357 is conservative. Can XRP Handle This Volume? XRP settles in 3 to 5 seconds, but real-world frictions, such as uneven transaction flow, regulatory delays, and fiat off-ramps, limit effective reuse, forcing liquidity providers to hold extra XRP and reducing practical turnover despite automation. However, XRP is still significantly faster than SWIFT and similar legacy systems, leading to louder calls for the adoption of the digital asset as a SWIFT replacement . If XRP is to support a sizable share of global payment volume, the required price depends less on how quickly and efficiently each token can be cycled through the system.

This growth has been supported by recent development, including the recent inflows from institutional investors. Amid this positive performance, several coins are flashing bullish signals, which warrant a closer look. These three coins could be your ticket to massive gains in the crypto world in June 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is leading the way amongst altcoins, rising over 9% in the past week, something that has not happened in a while. It is currently above $2,640, with some analysts forecasting that it could rise to $2,800 in the next few weeks. So far, its weekly gains are almost double those of Bitcoin (BTC). However, for investors looking for bigger gains, the best place to look would be in the presale market, where coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have captured the attention of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is still in the presale phase, is causing a lot of excitement with forecasts of 2,345% in gains or higher. XRP The XRP coin has been in the news a lot lately, and mainly for positive reasons. Recently, the CEO of Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, made clear his intentions to make XRP a replacement for SWIFT. In his estimation, XRP could take over as much as 14% of the market from SWIFT. However, regulatory challenges remain for the global adoption of XRP. Even in the US, its home market, the project is still not in the clear with the SEC. It is expected that it would face similar challenges in large markets globally, such as in the EU, which has a tougher stance on crypto. Despite these challenges, XRP is up nearly 5% in the past week. However, it is still down over 15% in the past month. As these price swings continue, savvy investors are increasingly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for long-term sustainable growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Source Of Growth In 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been throwing a lot of bullish signals since the presale began. For instance, it has over 20k followers across all its social media channels, which is a major indicator of the potential for community growth once it goes live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for the current phase have been sold, barely two weeks after it began. The presale has managed to raise over $10.6 million from around 12,000 unique buyers. All these figures point to a high participation rate, which foreshadows massive gains when the tokens go live. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The stepped increase in the price started back in phase 1, when prices were at $0.01 per token. These increases are designed to ensure that the earlier supporters get the biggest benefits. The Technical Innovations Of The Protocol The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a marvel of innovation that pushes the limits of what is possible with DeFi technology. Users of the protocol can join as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their funds in pools to earn interest, with the rate based on the pool utilization rate. Lenders receive mtTokens in exchange for their deposits, which are based on the ERC20 token standard. As such, they can trade them on exchanges that support the standard. They ensure that holders can benefit from crypto market opportunities in real time, while still earning interest. The mtTokens represent the value of the initial deposit plus any interest accrued, which helps to simplify the overall user experience. That is because holders of the mtTokens do not have to actively claim or compound their gains. Instead, the value of their tokens is updated in real time on-chain to reflect the accrued interest. A People-Focused Approach Mutuum Finance is a people-focused protocol that aims to ensure their earnings are protected and they continue to earn interest and make profits sustainably. In line with this, the project does token vetting to ensure users are not exposed to poor-quality assets. Additionally, all borrowers must over-collateralize their loan positions. That ensures the lenders’ assets are protected in case of massive price movements. Additionally, it ensures that the protocol can liquidate positions quickly when they fall in danger of under-collateralization. In support of the safety of its community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a bug bounty program. This is an open invitation to blockchain experts, security analysts, and researchers to investigate the code and identify any vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program will be a continuing program that will use incentives to ensure that any bugs are identified fast and acted upon in good time. With a people-focused approach and the presale blazing past milestones, the analysts’ forecast of gains of over 20x is something to take seriously. This project could be one of your biggest crypto gainers of this summer if you take advantage of the opportunity and get your MUTM tokens at the low price of $0.03 per token.

Every month, another token distribution falls prey to coordinated bot attacks. Within minutes of launch, automated programs claim a significant portion of the supply, leaving genuine users with nothing but frustration. The pattern repeats with alarming regularity: a project announces an airdrop, bots flood the system, and real users find themselves crowded out––from Kaito (systemic flaws enabling bot predation) to Linea (the sheer scale of Sybil farming) to Magic Eden (technical vulnerabilities exploited by bots), and more. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion Beyond token grabs, governance systems across web3 also face increasing manipulation. Voting mechanisms designed to serve as vox populi become puppet shows instead, with single entities controlling multiple identities to sway outcomes in their favor. What appears to be community consensus often masks the influence of a concentrated few operating via bot armies. This problem intensifies as new tokens launch daily, with each facing the same fundamental challenge of reaching real humans rather than automated scripts. Without solving this identity verification challenge, web3 remains vulnerable to exploitation, undermining its foundational promise. Enter zero-knowledge cryptography, which offers a logical and attainable solution. This technology, evolving from mathematical theory into practical applications, can solve this core contradiction by enabling the verification of humanity without exposing personal information. The privacy paradox Web3 advertises the promise of decentralized systems that preserve user privacy while enabling trustless interactions. Yet today, projects face a seemingly impossible choice when verifying users. On one hand, there are conventional KYC solutions—intrusive identity verification systems that demand personal documentation and create centralized repositories of sensitive data. These systems not only contradict web3’s ethos but also present security vulnerabilities. In an era where deepfakes and AI-generated content can easily circumvent traditional verification methods, KYC has become both philosophically and practically problematic. On the other hand, there are soft spam prevention mechanisms that preserve privacy but fail to provide meaningful protection against bot attacks. Captchas, email verification, and social media checks can be effortlessly bypassed by determined attackers, leaving projects exposed to Sybil attacks. What’s revealing is that users themselves recognize this dilemma. While few prioritize privacy for casual social media interactions, sentiment changes dramatically when financial transactions or personal identification come into play. People want privacy for what truly matters—their money and their identity. A human problem, not a technical one Crypto’s deepest challenges don’t solely lie in blockchain mechanics, consensus algorithms, or smart contract optimization. They exist at the boundary where digital systems meet human reality. While the industry has made significant strides in reducing gas fees and speeding up transactions, it has struggled to translate real-world trust into the digital realm. This represents a human problem first and foremost. Without reliable human verification, the web of trust that underpins all social and economic systems can’t translate to digital spaces. We need systems that recognize genuine human participants without requiring them to surrender their privacy. Too many projects have attempted to solve this by building entirely new trust infrastructures from scratch. They launch new networks, create isolated verification mechanisms, and inevitably fail to generate meaningful network effects. These isolated efforts fragment the ecosystem rather than strengthen it. How do we verify someone’s humanity without demanding they surrender their personal data? The zero-knowledge solution Zero-knowledge proofs—once theoretical mathematical constructs—now offer a practical solution to this paradox. This cryptographic approach allows users to prove specific facts about themselves without revealing any underlying data. For identity, this means that one can verify they possess a valid government-issued ID without sharing any of the personal information contained within it. They can prove they’re of legal age without revealing their birthdate; confirm they’re from an eligible jurisdiction without disclosing their address; or establish they’re a unique human without exposing their identity. This technological approach enables truly Sybil-resistant systems while preserving the privacy principles that define web3. A person can only register once, preventing bot farmers from creating thousands of fake accounts while maintaining complete control over their personal information. This works through mathematical verification of cryptographic signatures already embedded in modern electronic passports and IDs. When a country issues a passport, it digitally signs the document’s data with its private key. Using zero-knowledge circuits, users can prove this signature exists and is valid against the country’s public key without exposing its data. The verification confirms the government vouched for this person without sharing who they are, functioning like a mathematical black box that outputs only “valid” or “invalid” while keeping all personal details sealed inside. Practical applications are already emerging across the web3 landscape. Airdrops can now implement genuine one-verification-equals-one-claim systems, preventing bot armies from draining token supplies. Projects can verify a user’s age for compliance without collecting birthdate information. Services can confirm a user’s country of origin without storing precise location data. DeFi protocols can restrict specific functions based on regulatory requirements without compromising user privacy. Building bridges between trust systems The solution to web3’s identity crisis doesn’t require reinventing trust from scratch. It can be done by building secure bridges between existing trust infrastructures, like government-issued IDs and digital systems. By extracting the cryptographic signatures from electronic passports and other official documents and then verifying them against issuing authorities’ public keys, we can create a privacy-preserving pathway between established trust systems and emerging digital economies. This approach leverages existing infrastructure rather than building parallel systems. It recognizes that trust already exists in the world––the challenge is translating it to digital contexts without compromising personal sovereignty. In sum, zero-knowledge verification dissolves the false tension between privacy and trust that has limited web3. Through mathematical certainty, users prove their uniqueness without revealing themselves. This shift enables bot-free token distributions, sovereign compliance with regulations, and manipulation-resistant governance systems. These technologies create selective disclosure on user terms by tapping into existing trust infrastructures, removing the need for a parallel system. The result brings what web3 always needed most: verified humans interacting with full data sovereignty.

With a current price of $0.03 per token and over 12,000 holders already on board, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the DeFi space. Unlike speculative price movements seen in Avalanche (AVAX), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building core utility designed to support sustainable long-term growth through real financial infrastructure. Quiet capital, loud fundamentals While AVAX holders ride volatile price waves tied to short-term market sentiment, early participants in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are investing in a fully decentralized, overcollateralized lending protocol. Backed by a transparent, audited architecture and driven by real DeFi usage rather than hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has opted for Layer-2 blockchain integration. This enables faster and cheaper transactions, directly addressing network congestion and high gas fees that continue to limit many DeFi platforms. What sets this project apart is its focus on actual usability. The development team plans to launch a beta version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform at the token launch. This move will give early investors immediate access to lending and borrowing utilities for testing that work across both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to deposit assets like ETH, AVAX, or DAI into a shared liquidity pool and earn interest that adapts with market demand. These lending pools feature dynamic interest rates that change based on how much liquidity is borrowed. When demand increases, yields go up. That brings in more depositors who want to earn higher returns, creating a self-regulating balance between borrowers and lenders. For example, when a user deposits $5,000 worth of DAI into a pool that reaches high utilization, the annual returns can reach double-digit percentages. These yields are automatically paid out, and depositors also receive mtTokens (like mtDAI), which reflect the value of their deposits plus accumulated interest. These mtTokens provide instant liquidity and can be traded or used as collateral to unlock further opportunities within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. The peer-to-peer (P2P) system also introduces a unique edge. On most DeFi lending protocols, users are limited to high-cap known tokens. But in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), P2P lenders and borrowers will have access to a much wider token set, including memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This makes the lending platform more versatile and attractive for those holding assets that are often excluded from conventional DeFi systems. Stablecoin and layer-2—built for the future In the coming months, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its own fully overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin. Unlike USDT or USDC, which rely on opaque reserves and centralized custody, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be algorithmically adjusted and backed by on-chain assets already stored within the protocol. All interest collected from stablecoin loans will be redirected into the ecosystem to strengthen the platform’s treasury. The architecture supports fast growth while maintaining operational efficiency, making it ideal for both institutional backers and retail users seeking yield with minimal risk. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards its community through a comprehensive token utility structure. All protocol profits will be partially used to buy back MUTM tokens from the market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts, ensuring that active participants are rewarded. This setup applies natural demand pressure on the token price and encourages long-term holding. Additionally, users can stake their mtTokens or use them to provide liquidity in platform pools. These activities not only help the protocol function but also earn passive dividends for the participants. As platform adoption grows, these reward streams will deepen, offering high-yield, low-risk passive income that isn’t tied to speculative market behavior. CertiK audit signals safety and compliance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a comprehensive audit from CertiK, which included both manual review and static code analysis. The protocol scored 80.00 on CertiK’s Token Scan, validating its code quality and safety mechanisms. This level of scrutiny is rare in early-stage DeFi and speaks to the team’s commitment to building a compliant, reliable platform from the ground up. While Avalanche (AVAX) rides momentary rallies driven by market emotions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is locking in capital from informed investors. Over $10.55 million has already been raised in Phase 5, with more than 12,000 holders showing strong belief in the protocol’s long-term vision. The team’s ongoing huge $100K giveaway is yet another draw for newcomers, offering immediate value while strengthening community engagement.

In a thread on X, he outlines a detailed argument centered on global debt concerns, the devaluation of fiat currencies, the rise of asset tokenization, and Ripple’s expanding institutional reach. According to Pumpius, the long-term decline of the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power, particularly since it was decoupled from the gold standard in 1971, has set the stage for digital assets to play a central role in future settlements. He highlights that the United States’ national debt has surpassed $34 trillion, with interest payments now exceeding $1 trillion annually. Under these conditions, he argues, the Federal Reserve will be forced to continue expanding the money supply, further distorting traditional asset valuations. Within this backdrop, he believes XRP can emerge as a high-efficiency bridge asset . Its ability to settle transactions rapidly and cheaply could allow it to gain significant ground as confidence in fiat systems continues to erode. If you think $XRP can’t hit $10,000… You’re already priced out of the future. This isn’t hopium. It’s math, markets, and macroeconomics. Let me walk you through the biggest monetary reset in human history — and why XRP sits right at the center of it. pic.twitter.com/NI60FREIcJ — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 7, 2025 Real-World Asset Tokenization and the Growing Ecosystem One of the more compelling elements of Pumpius’ pro-XRP argument is the anticipated growth in tokenized real-world assets . He draws attention to the fact that major financial institutions such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Citi are actively investing in blockchain-based tokenization frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Estimates from various analysts suggest that between $16 trillion and $30 trillion in real-world assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. The Dubai Land Department is already making significant progress in this sector with tokenized land deeds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Pumpius argues that XRP’s fast settlement, DEX features, interoperability, and other features position it as a core player in the tokenized economy. Ripple’s ecosystem already spans over 300 financial institutions, and its Ripple Payments platform (formerly On-Demand Liquidity) eliminates pre-funded accounts. The launch of the RLUSD stablecoin and investment in custody solutions also highlight Ripple’s institutional focus and support Pumpius’s bullish case. Challenging the Conventional Valuation Model Pumpius’s boldest claim centers on monetary velocity, as he sees XRP facilitating segments of FX markets, tokenized assets, and sovereign debt. With high turnover and fixed supply, he argues XRP could justify far higher valuations, irrespective of traditional market capitalization logic. Critics reject such valuations as unrealistic, but supporters insist XRP is infrastructure, not a speculative asset. Pumpius believes that ignoring the shift in institutional adoption and global liquidity needs means missing the deeper transformation already underway, and believes that those who can’t see XRP at $10,000 are already priced out.

46060565,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=747073,1749981566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46060565.jpeg,AI could take over more jobs says BT CEO,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/british-telecom-says-ai-may-deepen-job-cuts/,"British Telecom (BT) Group CEO Allison Kirkby believes artificial intelligence advances could rile up job cuts at the company. The British Telecom company is already planning to slash 40,000 jobs and trim 3 billion pounds, roughly $4 billion in costs, by the end of the decade. Kirkby says that the figures may not fully capture AI’s potential impact. She argued that if AI makes it possible to operate with fewer resources, they must respond accordingly to remain in the game. She commented, “Depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” Kirkby sold off their Italian and Irish business to focus on the UK Before Kirkby took over, the company in 2023, under the then-CEO Phillip Jansen, declared it would reduce the workforce by about 55,000, including contractors, by 2030. Back then, Jansen asserted they would depend on a much leaner workforce and a lower cost base by the end of the 2020s. Kirkby seems to hold a similar stance on working with a smaller workforce, having sold off their Irish wholesale and enterprise division to focus on their UK operations. The company also sold its Italian Business, British Telecom Italia, to telecoms provider Retelit. BT Italia had about 350 corporate clients, earning roughly €160 million, about $217 million in 2024. However, the platform had legal trouble over possible document manipulation, which bruised investor confidence in the company’s non-UK business. In May, the company also reorganized its international operations into a standalone unit and is reportedly open to selling the entire division, according to a source familiar with the matter. Some investors have supported Kirkby’s restructuring efforts, like Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal, who holds a 24.5% stake. Not to mention, British Telecom’s shares have also surged 65% since Kirkby became CEO. BT weighs Openreach spin-off as fibre rollout nears milestone Kirkby is considering separating Openreach, the company’s network infrastructure business, into an independent entity at some point in the future, though no final decision has been made. She argued that she did not feel the value of Openreach was reflected in the company’s share price, and if that continued, the company would have to consider other options. The firm will have time to look into what could be done to Openreach while the business upgrades its network to full fiber. After the upgrade , capital spending is expected to return to normal, and free cash flow should recover. Openreach expects to hit its 25 million home coverage target next year, after which the expansion will ease to 1 million homes per year—well below the current quarterly pace. Nonetheless, British Telecom aims to expand to 30 million homes by 2030. According to New Street Research, Openreach is worth about £30 billion, about $40.7 billion—significantly higher than British Telecom’s current market capitalization of £18.5 billion, estimated at $25 billion. Despite the valuation gap, Kirkby claimed she would rather see the network’s value recognized in BT’s share price than pursue a spin-off. Meanwhile, British Telecom wants to take advantage of the hype and uncertainty around the recent partnership of Vodafone and Three to expand its retail platforms, EE and Plusnet. Kirkby believes that their merger presents an opportunity for them to market their brands. She added that she might have their retail brands operate in an alternative part of the UK where it isn’t cost-effective for Openreach to deploy its own fibre network.

Investors Ask as Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the Ultimate Bitcoin Replacement,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-is-xrp-investors-ask-as-bitcoin-solaris-emerges-as-the-ultimate-bitcoin-replacement/,"XRP once held the promise of revolutionizing global payments. Fast, cheap, and bank-friendly—it was pitched as the future of cross-border finance. But years of regulatory battles, stagnant token utility, and centralized control have left many investors wondering: Is this still the future, or just another chapter in crypto history? As attention shifts, a bold new name is rising with far more than promises. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just aiming to improve the blockchain—it’s redefining what decentralized money can do. With blazing speed, mobile-first mining, and a full ecosystem that empowers users instead of institutions, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a Bitcoin alternative, but the upgrade Bitcoin never had. XRP Had Potential—But the Space Moved On XRP deserves credit for challenging the banking sector and pioneering real-time settlement. But with Ripple entangled in legal skirmishes and token utility tied closely to corporate control, cracks have shown. Decentralization remains a concern. And for users seeking freedom, speed, and income, not just transaction rails, XRP now feels like a limited play. Investors are beginning to shift their gaze to a project that’s not just faster or cheaper, but fundamentally more empowering. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Replace, Not Just Compete BTC-S was built from the ground up to combine what Bitcoin started with what modern tech makes possible. It features a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work (PoW) for core chain security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability. Together, they deliver unmatched performance. Key highlights include: Base Layer PoW using SHA-256 (Bitcoin-compatible) with 5-minute block times Solaris Layer DPoS with 21 rotating validators every 24 hours and 15-second blocks Cross-layer integration where validator data is secured on-chain through PoW anchoring Smart contracts in Rust, enabling DeFi, tokenization, and secure automation Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) It gets even better with throughput: the Solaris Layer pushes up to 100,000 transactions per second, finalizing in just 2 seconds, while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. This isn’t theoretical—it’s audited and tested. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the code, and early influencers like Ben Crypto are already spotlighting BTC-S as one of the most promising chains of the year. Mobile Mining with Real Rewards Unlike XRP, which can’t be earned directly through network participation, BTC-S opens the doors to daily income through mining—without expensive hardware. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine using: Smartphones (Android and iOS) Laptops and desktops ASICs and GPUs (for power users) With adaptive mining algorithms, in-app wallets, and energy-optimized performance, it’s truly accessible. Just tap, and you’re earning. Want to estimate your earning potential? The BTC-S mining calculator helps you visualize your daily impact. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Liquid Staking That Doesn’t Lock You In Beyond mining, Bitcoin Solaris also introduces a breakthrough in staking. With liquid staking , users can earn rewards without locking away their tokens. How it works: Staked BTC-S becomes sBTC-S (1:1 ratio) sBTC-S remains fully liquid, tradable, and DeFi-compatible You earn rewards while retaining full control It enhances decentralization, validator rotation, and network health It’s integrated right into the Solaris Nova App, with no complex setup required, making staking easy, flexible, and profitable for everyone. A Roadmap That’s Actually Being Followed Many coins brag about roadmaps. BTC-S is executing one. Its forward-looking roadmap spans: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2026) with full support for smart contracts and governance Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain tools by Q4 2026 Quantum-resistant upgrades and layer-2 scaling in 2027 Enterprise-grade integrations with AI and IoT in late 2027 It’s a roadmap backed by action, not just whitepaper buzzwords. Every phase is designed to increase adoption, unlock real-world use, and build sustainable value. The Presale Is Moving Fast—and It’s Not Just Hype We’re currently in Phase 7 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale, with over 11,000 users already onboard and more than $4.5M raised. Current price: $7 Next phase: $8 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 9% With only around 7 weeks left before the July 31, 2025 launch, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most dynamic presales in crypto history. The growth is organic, driven by real use, not marketing gimmicks. If you’re watching from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris is your window into the future. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin? Or Something Better? XRP may have started as a disruptor. But Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a revolution. With mobile mining, powerful staking, lightning-fast scalability, and a clear roadmap, BTC-S isn’t just an upgrade to Bitcoin—it’s what Bitcoin would be if it were built today.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Faces a New DeFi Rival with Huge Potential,https://timestabloid.com/top-coin-to-hold-through-2025-bitcoin-cash-bch-faces/,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) entered the crypto market with strong momentum as a transactional fork of Bitcoin, promising faster payments and lower fees. But in 2025, the conversation is shifting. While BCH’s utility has largely plateaued—with limited innovation and minimal presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector—a new protocol is emerging that directly challenges the old guard. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another DeFi token; it is an all-in-one ecosystem built for passive income, smart lending models, and long-term scalability. DeFi Needs More Than Speed—It Needs Vision Bitcoin Cash (BCH) once offered a compelling alternative to Bitcoin, but as blockchain innovation moved toward smart contracts, DeFi lending, and protocol-owned liquidity, BCH failed to evolve. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is executing a phased roadmap that includes everything from a CertiK-audited smart contract to the launch of a testnet demo and eventual exchange listings. Unlike BCH, which remains fixed in a transactional mold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is addressing real user needs: lending, borrowing, earning, and transparency. Its dual lending model—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—gives users maximum control and flexibility, something legacy chains never prioritized. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building toward its live platform release with a structure and intent that few projects can claim. With a major part of Phase 1 already completed—including presale launch, CertiK audit (Token Scan Score: 80), and a $100K giveaway (ongoing)—the team is now advancing through backend development, DApp integration, and rigorous internal reviews. By the time the token goes live, users will be able to interact with a fully functional beta version of the platform. Beyond that, the roadmap includes exchange listings, regulatory compliance, and even institutional partnerships. This is not just about launching a token—it’s about delivering a long-term financial product that works for both individual users and large-scale stakeholders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Makes Passive Income Truly Passive In the P2C model, you deposit assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, or BNB into a liquidity pool. The interest you earn depends on actual borrowing activity—driven by real-time demand. When pool utilization is high, APYs go up, providing lenders with competitive returns without constant oversight. In the P2P model, lenders set their own terms and can support tokens like DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE. This opens up custom earning strategies unavailable on traditional lending platforms. Whether you want passive rewards or hands-on lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) puts the power in your hands. Additionally, when you stake your mtTokens in the safety module, you gain a share of protocol profits. A portion of these profits will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to stakers. This creates both scarcity and reward in one loop, boosting price support while offering long-term passive income. Locked-In Value: Real Math, Real Gains The MUTM token is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, priced at just $0.03 with over $10.60 million already raised and more than 12,000 holders onboard. With the total supply of 4,000,000,000, early positions are increasingly valuable. Let’s break it down: A user who locks in 100,000 MUTM at $0.03 secures a position worth $3,000. Should the token rise to just $0.75—a 25x return backed by platform demand and protocol profits—that same position becomes $75,000. This isn’t hypothetical growth based on hype; it’s a calculation rooted in Mutuum’s utility, architecture, and revenue model. One of Mutuum’s most user-friendly innovations is its mtToken system. When you deposit assets into Mutuum’s pools, you receive mtTokens (like mtDAI or mtETH) that represent your principal plus earned interest. These tokens can be used as collateral, traded on secondary markets, or held as interest-accruing assets—introducing new flexibility that traditional DeFi platforms lack. This liquid staking model means your funds are never trapped, and your earnings are always working for you. It’s a simple idea with transformative results: freedom of movement and continuous compounding. A Stablecoin Built for the Long Game Mutuum’s ecosystem will also include a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stable assets that rely on fiat reserves or corporate governance, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be minted using assets already within the protocol. That means complete transparency, on-chain security, and automated supply regulation. This stablecoin will not only offer a reliable borrowing option but also redirect interest payments into the protocol, strengthening the treasury and opening additional revenue paths for MUTM holders. It’s another way Mutuum is building a sustainable ecosystem, not just a token. Where Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its moment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering a future. With Layer-2 integration for fast and low-cost transactions, a fully audited smart contract, and an upcoming exchange listing, MUTM is positioned for real-world traction. The ongoing roadmap includes platform launch, cross-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships—all critical components for long-term success in DeFi. Whether you want to earn from pool lending, P2P strategies or mtToken liquidity, Mutuum gives you the tools and the structure to grow your holdings with confidence. BCH paved the way for faster payments. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is paving the road for financial freedom in a fully decentralized world. With a functional beta release approaching and a roadmap filled with utility milestones, MUTM isn’t just a new token—it’s the future of DeFi, designed for sustainability, scalability, and user prosperity.

Discover the altcoins capturing attention and see why they're generating buzz in the crypto community. Solana Struggles: Analyzing Past Decline and Current Range Dynamics Solana experienced a noticeable decline over the past month, dropping by about 21.57%, and a steeper decrease of around 34.48% over the past six months. Its weekly performance was nearly flat at -0.24%, amid fluctuating prices within the range of $136 to $182. The coin's downward trend highlights the absence of consistent upward recovery, suggesting persistent pressure on its valuation. These movements reflect overall market sentiment and investor caution, indicating a period of adjustment and consolidation in trading behavior. The historical trend emphasizes a market struggling to regain momentum, presenting challenges for traders navigating this landscape. Currently, Solana’s price is situated between $136 and $182, facing a nearest resistance level at $207.9 and stronger resistance near $253.93. On the support side, key levels are at $115.84 and a secondary support at $69.81. The technical indicators lean bearish, with negative momentum and an RSI reading of 38.03 suggesting oversold conditions. The absence of a clear trend creates potential for short-term trading opportunities. Bears appear to dominate as traders monitor these key levels closely, with strategies focused on entering near support zones while awaiting decisive movements beyond resistance levels to signal a recovery in this challenging market. Chainlink Price Fluctuations and Key Market Levels Analysis Chainlink faced a steep one-month decline of nearly 24% along with a significant six-month drop of roughly 54%. Price action during these periods showed a consistent bearish trend, with selling pressure outpacing buying interest. The decline has eroded investor confidence, leading to significant volatility and rapid shifts in market sentiment. This has made traders cautious, prompting many to reassess their risk strategies while navigating a challenging landscape. Chainlink currently trades in a range between $12.14 and $16.89. Resistance at $19.80 acts as an immediate ceiling, while a stronger barrier is found at $24.55. Support is identified at $10.30, with a deeper level near $5.55. Bears retain a slight edge as indicated by negative momentum readings, despite a minor weekly gain of 2.8%. The recent losses contribute to a market characterized by caution. Traders should monitor for bounces off the $10.30 support and consider a break above $19.80 as a potential buy signal. Balancing risk and potential gains will be crucial as market pressures persist. Resilient Cardano Amid Recent Downturns and Key Price Boundaries Cardano has experienced a steep decline in the past month, with prices dropping nearly 24% and around 40% in the last six months. The market has shown significant volatility, contracting the trading range and creating an environment of caution among investors. Price fluctuations have pointed to weakening momentum, with corrective pressure evident as the coin tested lower support levels. Uncertainty remains, reflected in the overall negative trends from technical indicators. Currently, Cardano is trading between approximately $0.60 and $0.82, encountering immediate resistance around $0.95 and a higher barrier at $1.17, while support stands near $0.51 and further at $0.29. Bears dominate the market, with indicators signaling a short-term bearish scenario. The absence of a clear upward trend results in choppy price action. Traders should monitor support levels for potential rebounds or await a solid break above resistance before entering long positions, though caution is advised due to the prevailing bearish sentiment. Conclusion SOL , ADA , and LINK show strong potential for growth. These coins have demonstrated resilience and consistent performance. With positive market trends, new all-time highs appear achievable for each currency. Confidence in their future remains high. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
