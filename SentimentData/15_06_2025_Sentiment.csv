Speaking at the XRPL Apex event, Garlinghouse offered a forecast that, within the next five years, XRPL could facilitate as much as 14% of the total transaction volume currently processed by SWIFT, the widely used global interbank messaging system. Garlinghouse emphasized that the real challenge in cross-border payments lies in liquidity, not messaging. He pointed out that while SWIFT remains essential for moving information between financial institutions, its primary function is ultimately to support the transfer of actual monetary value. He argued that blockchain platforms like XRPL are better positioned to streamline this function through native liquidity and real-time settlement capabilities. Quantifying the 14% Projection Following the CEO’s statement, a user on X known as “XRPMillionaire” used xAI’s Grok to break down the implications. Based on SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion in annual transaction volume, 14% would represent $21 trillion processed by XRPL each year. This would amount to roughly $58 billion in daily transactions. If this market share were to be achieved gradually over five years, it would imply a steady increase of 2.8% annually, or approximately $4.2 trillion processed per year. Market Reactions and Price Estimates These projections have led to renewed optimism within the XRP community, especially regarding the potential for long-term value appreciation. Despite XRP trading at around $2.13 and still sitting below its all-time high set several years ago, many investors and analysts now see room for significant price increases if such utility materializes. Several valuation models have emerged in response to this outlook. One analysis projects a potential XRP price of $12 if liquidity demand rises in proportion to transaction volume. This estimate assumes the token would be used and recycled approximately 30 times per year, necessitating a liquidity base of around $700 billion to support the full $21 trillion annual volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other forecasts, which account for increasing institutional interest and the speculative nature of the crypto market, suggest that XRP could trade between $18 and $24 under favorable market conditions. However, some observers have called for a broader examination of the competitive landscape. If XRP were to capture 14% of SWIFT’s total volume, the question remains: which platforms or technologies will handle the remaining 86%? Projects such as Chainlink have already begun working directly with SWIFT, positioning themselves as potential players in the evolving financial infrastructure. While XRP’s capacity to handle trillions in annual payments remains speculative, Garlinghouse’s remarks and the subsequent analysis have provided concrete figures for what such a scenario might entail. The discussion now turns to whether XRP can effectively scale to meet these expectations and how it will compete in a landscape that is becoming increasingly crowded with blockchain-based solutions.

Worldcoin (WLD) is also gaining traction after crossing $1.18, helped by strong market volume. But beyond the charts, another name is turning heads for a different reason. BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just focused on price action—it’s building something broader. A large-scale US sponsorship is rumored to be in motion, and if confirmed, it could make BlockDAG one of the most widely recognized projects before even listing. The move would not only boost trust and visibility; it could bring BDAG into everyday conversation across countries and industries. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025, this mix of scale and timing is becoming hard to overlook. SUI Price Climbs Past $3.40 on ETF Buzz and Growing Demand The SUI price performance is seeing a solid recovery. From June 9 to June 11, SUI gained 7.9%, climbing back to $3.40. A key reason for the lift was Nasdaq’s 19b-4 filing to list a spot SUI ETF with 21Shares. That announcement helped push SUI through the $3.55 resistance line, turning it into support. Volume surged to $930 million in 24 hours, and SUI’s Total Value Locked now stands at $1.77 billion, showing strong usage in DeFi and gaming. The SUI price also broke out of a descending channel, with EMA crossovers and bullish momentum supporting targets of $4.50 and above if the trend continues. WLD Moves Past $1.18 as Breakout Signals Grow Worldcoin (WLD) posted a 5.4% rise on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18. This came just as Google Cloud’s partnership with OpenAI made headlines, helping boost trader interest. Volume jumped by 38% to $208 million. Technicals also support the move. WLD has cleared its 50-period EMA and is now sitting in a breakout range between $1.05 and $1.15. The MACD is signaling strength, and RSI near 62 adds to the bullish case. Chart patterns show a rising wedge and triangle formations that point to a potential surge. If WLD clears $1.20–$1.24, targets between $1.28 and $1.60 could come into play. Support at $1.05–$1.10 remains strong, making this one of the better-positioned breakout plays at the moment. BlockDAG’s US Push Could Redefine What a Presale Can Do BlockDAG has already raised $303 million and sold 22.6 billion coins. It’s currently in Batch 29 of its presale, priced at $0.0276. Those who bought during Batch 1 have already earned a 2,660% return. But the latest twist? A special extended offer now allows users to buy at just $0.0018 for six more days. With the launch price set at $0.05, this window offers a potential ROI of 2,678%. That alone is a major draw. But it’s what’s happening outside the price chart that’s capturing attention. A rumored US-based sponsorship deal could soon take BDAG’s reach global. Widespread branding and televised exposure could turn BDAG into a name recognized even beyond the crypto world. Most projects chase attention after they launch. BlockDAG is flipping that model by building mass appeal in advance. It’s already backed by a CertiK audit, is EVM-compatible, and supports zero gas fees through its DAG-based infrastructure. Its X1 Miner app has attracted over 2 million users in more than 150 countries. Features like Buyer Battles and referral streaks make it not just easy to use, but addictive. BlockDAG isn’t just checking boxes. It’s rewriting how crypto connects with people. If the sponsorship is confirmed, BDAG won’t just launch, it’ll arrive already embedded in culture. That’s what makes it such a strong pick for anyone watching for the best crypto to buy right now Final Thoughts SUI is making progress with renewed institutional interest and a push from ETF news. WLD is showing signs of breaking higher on technical strength and narrative momentum. But for those looking beyond chart patterns, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for something more powerful. With $303 million raised, a special $0.0018 entry point, over 22.6 billion coins sold, and a listing price of $0.05, the upside is clear. The 2,678% ROI window is only open for six more days. Add to that a US sponsorship on the horizon, and BDAG is shaping up to be a serious player. It’s not just another presale. It’s an early-stage opportunity with real-world branding and user traction, setting a new standard for what crypto launches can achieve. For those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG may already be leading the way.

As the broader crypto space navigates renewed attention and shifting capital flows, select assets are standing out not for noise, but for solid infrastructure and development momentum. Among the top cryptos to invest in for short term, Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Cosmos are leading discussions across the space. With Qubetics offering a truly integrated multi-chain experience through its application, and the added traction around its token presale, this project has become a critical contender for short-term upside. Meanwhile, XRP continues to demonstrate its relevance through international payment corridors and growing adoption among traditional finance institutions. At the same time, Cosmos is rapidly advancing blockchain interoperability, attracting developer interest and on-chain liquidity. These three digital assets are building strong foundations for immediate relevance in the current cycle, making them standout picks among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Qubetics Multi‑Chain Wallet: The Future of Web3 User Experience At the center of Qubetics ‘ appeal is a breakthrough in digital asset management—the Qubetics Wallet. This product is designed as a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with support across mobile and desktop operating systems. As a key component of Qubetics’ broader ecosystem, this application empowers users to manage, transact, and interact with assets across major blockchain networks from a single interface. In a fragmented environment where most users juggle multiple wallets or custodial platforms, Qubetics offers an unprecedented level of utility. The wallet supports native $TICS tokens and is compatible with iOS, Android, and web-based systems. From small business operators handling cross-border payments in stablecoins to NFT creators selling digital collectibles across marketplaces, Qubetics provides seamless, secure access with no dependency on third parties. As digital asset adoption increases globally, the demand for self-custodial, interoperable tools will only rise. Qubetics is positioning itself at the center of that trend, building real-world use for its application, and validating its place among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term Gains Qubetics has officially reached the final stretch of its public token sale, entering Stage 37 with strong momentum. Priced at $0.3370, the Qubetics presale has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 515 million $TICS tokens to a growing community of 27,900+ holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining at this final price, the window to secure entry before the listing is quickly narrowing. Once the presale concludes, $TICS will list at $0.40—offering a built-in 20% return to those who join now. What makes this presale even more strategic is Qubetics’ updated tokenomics: a dramatic supply cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion and a public allocation increase to 38.55%, reinforcing both scarcity and decentralization. With this balance of financial upside and community-driven design, Qubetics is rapidly being positioned as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term performance. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale rate. At $0.3370, that amount secures around 14,837 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this holding immediately rises to $5,934—a gain of $934 before any post-launch appreciation. For those aiming at more aggressive returns, projections ranging between $5 to $10 per token suggest that same $5,000 could scale up to as much as $74,000–$148,000 during the next market cycle. This combination of immediate ROI and high upside potential is why Qubetics is now being recognized as the best crypto presale currently live—and why it’s dominating discussions around the top cryptos to invest in for short term growth. XRP: Expanding Institutional Utility in Global Payments XRP continues to gain relevance as a solution for institutional-grade cross-border transfers. Its utility-driven design enables near-instant settlements, low fees, and minimal counterparty risk—factors increasingly valued by banks, fintech firms, and payment processors. The XRP Ledger is also integrating smart contract capabilities, allowing tokenized assets and programmable finance to live directly on the chain without requiring external solutions. Recent developments have further solidified XRP’s case as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Its presence in Asia-Pacific payment channels is expanding, and partnerships with financial platforms have increased XRP’s daily volume across regulated corridors. Regulatory clarity is also improving, providing a more favorable outlook for adoption in regions that previously held back institutional engagement. As financial platforms scale up the use of on-chain tools, XRP remains well-positioned to serve both compliance-driven needs and next-generation payment architecture. Cosmos: Redefining Blockchain Interoperability with IBC Cosmos is one of the most compelling infrastructure-layer projects making waves in today’s market, due in large part to its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Cosmos enables secure, standardized communication between independent chains, solving one of crypto’s most persistent technical challenges. The architecture allows sovereign blockchains to interact without sacrificing scalability or governance, creating a truly interoperable network of networks. Recent updates to Cosmos Hub and its expanding validator set are drawing attention from both DeFi builders and application-layer protocols. Interchain accounts, smart routing, and shared security features now allow protocols to operate across ecosystems more efficiently. As a result, protocols that once relied on Ethereum or Solana for liquidity and composability are beginning to consider Cosmos for its flexibility and development-ready environment. This unique positioning places Cosmos comfortably within the top cryptos to invest in for short term, particularly for those tracking growth in cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. Conclusion Qubetics, XRP, and Cosmos each present a unique value proposition for short-term participants seeking informed exposure. Qubetics stands out with its web3 aggregator model and a high-impact Qubetics presale, offering structured growth and compelling ROI scenarios. XRP continues to lead the institutional payment narrative through expanding real-world partnerships and regulatory momentum. Cosmos is delivering on its promise of true cross-chain operability, attracting forward-thinking protocols and community members alike. Among all available opportunities, these three digital assets earn their place on the shortlist of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Participants seeking immediate utility and future scalability should strongly consider joining this best crypto presale while opportunity remains.

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.00001468 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.42 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators favor sellers, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000125, which is approximately 691% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its value decreased to $0.00001468. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent depreciation. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000020. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000125 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

The ruling was issued on Wednesday by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and stems from a long-running digital asset fraud scheme involving the fraudulent sale of a virtual currency known as My Big Coin (MBC). The court’s decision includes a $19.3 million civil monetary penalty and an additional $6.4 million in restitution for customers who were deceived by misleading claims about the coin’s value and backing. According to the CFTC’s official press release , from January 2014 to June 2017, the defendants falsely promoted MBC as a fully functional digital currency backed by gold and actively traded on established platforms. In reality, the currency lacked any such support or market presence. Over $6 million was collected from at least 28 customers under pretenses, while the funds were largely misappropriated by co-defendant Randall Crater, who was previously convicted and sentenced to more than eight years in prison for his central role in the scheme. The court’s latest order resolves the commodities regulator’s civil enforcement claims against Gillespie, Roche, and the two Nevada-based My Big Coin companies. It also imposes a permanent trading ban on the defendants, barring them from participating in any CFTC-regulated markets or registering with the agency. Crater, the primary orchestrator of the fraud, was earlier sentenced in a separate criminal case and ordered to forfeit and repay more than $7.6 million In a statement, the agency said. “The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.” The post Court Slaps My Big Coin: Founders Hit With $25.8M Penalty for Defrauding Crypto Investors appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 21:32:27

Industry experts have highlighted how this technical upgrade could benefit digital assets like XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM). XRP and XLM are designed to work well with modern systems. Experts say they could become a larger part of global payments and transform how money moves worldwide. Global Financial Systems Are Moving to ISO 20022 Standard ISO 20022 allows financial institutions to send payment information clearly and in a structured. It improves data quality, increases transparency, and helps systems across countries collaborate more easily. In a video shared on X, the payments company Stronghold showed how it is using ISO 20022 along with blockchain technology . A company spokesperson explained that this combination improves how money is moved and makes the process more reliable and efficient. Stronghold is already using ISO 20022 messaging in real financial projects. This shows that blockchain and traditional systems can work together, rather than compete. Notably, it was revealed that all Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments moved to ISO 20022 in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced plans to adopt the standard in July. This move will replace the outdated Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM). Meanwhile, SWIFT has announced that it will fully transition to ISO 20022 by November. This global shift is poised to change how traditional and digital financial systems work together. XRP and XLM Are Built for This Change It was spotlighted that digital assets like XRP and XLM are better suited to connect with banks and payment systems. These digital currencies are fast, low-cost , and built to follow rules and standards, making them a good match for ISO 20022-based systems. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also recognises XRP and XLM as digital assets with strong potential to play key roles in future financial networks. As more banks switch to ISO 20022, they may turn to these for faster, safer, and cheaper payments. Stronghold Taps Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger for Real-World Use In a separate video clip , Stronghold’s CEO, Tammy Camp, explained that the company uses tools like Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger to link fiat money with digital systems. These technologies help bridge traditional and blockchain-based finance. They are connected through simple APIs, allowing different platforms to communicate and work smoothly. This setup helps Stronghold move money between banks and blockchain networks in real time. It also shows how XRP and XLM can support regular financial services without causing disruption.

The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Trump’s Token Windfall According to the disclosure, Trump’s income line reads “$57,437,927.” It doesn’t say if he sold tokens, earned staking rewards, or used another method. But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details The disclosure also notes his past digital ventures. He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

BlockDAG, now in batch 29 of its presale, has raised more than $302 million directly from the public. There were no hedge funds, no private rounds, no seed investors—just organic momentum powered by retail users. While major chains like Ethereum and Solana depend on insider funding, BlockDAG has chosen a community-first path. This is more than a presale. It’s a full rejection of the old model. And the numbers show it’s working. This is truly the people’s crypto. No VC Funding, No Privileges — Just Genuine Demand BlockDAG stands out not just because of the amount raised, but because of how it raised it. Most big projects depend on private sales backed by Silicon Valley and hedge funds. BlockDAG opened its doors only to the public. There were no special discounts for insiders or influencers. No early unlocks for private buyers. Everyone joined on the same terms with full transparency. This removes the usual advantage held by big funds, putting community first. The public responded strongly. With over $302 million raised purely from retail support, BlockDAG reached a level of momentum that many VC-backed projects never achieve. Ethereum and Solana: Built by Few, Owned by Few To see why BlockDAG is different, consider the usual model. Ethereum’s early supply heavily favored insiders and developers, giving them large long-term gains. Solana also benefited from big VC backers like a16z and Alameda, creating wide gaps between public buyers and early insiders. This VC-driven setup shaped today’s market—powerful chains controlled by a few, with latecomers often priced out of meaningful returns. While marketed as decentralized, their token distributions tell a different story. BlockDAG changes that story. The People’s Chain: Powered by $302 Million in Public Support Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG has sold over 22.6 billion coins. Its active community engages publicly on Telegram, Discord, and through the X1 mining app, which has more than 1.5 million users worldwide. The X1 app lets anyone mine BDAG coins from their smartphones, creating a peer-to-peer, scalable onboarding method without needing institutional backing. This grassroots approach is succeeding. Rather than chasing institutional interest or hype, BlockDAG grows from real user activity—no boardrooms, no private deals, just people. A New Chapter for 2025: Community Capital Over Venture Capital Crypto is shifting. Users want chains without hidden power behind “decentralization.” Many claim to be open but block access through high fees, opaque governance, or limited early entry. BlockDAG breaks this pattern. This isn’t a token promising “community” while serving VC exits. It’s a network funded by everyday users, shown in real time by presale growth and app engagement. Supporters aren’t betting on hype—they’re building the future. Ethereum’s power still rests with whales and Layer-2 intermediaries. Solana leans on ETFs and institutional interest. BlockDAG has 1.5 million phone miners spreading the word organically. Why BlockDAG Is Ahead While others depend on big partnerships and VC money, BlockDAG sticks to execution: Over $302 million raised with zero VC backing 1.5 million+ active X1 miners 22.6 billion+ coins sold Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276 Tools and apps live before exchange listings BlockDAG isn’t aiming to be another “Ethereum killer” or a meme fad. It builds user-level utility first and scales organically. Its batch presale rewards early supporters fairly, with transparent demand-driven pricing and no artificial scarcity or hidden unlocks. Final Word: Crypto Needs Users, Not Kings The market doesn’t need another Solana or Ethereum. What it truly needs is a project that reflects the people who support it, use it daily, and believe in its future. BlockDAG shows what happens when the gatekeepers are removed, allowing the public to take the lead. This approach raises more than just funds—it builds lasting trust and a genuine community. While other projects chase headlines and institutional deals, BlockDAG focuses on steady, organic growth with real users at the center. This foundation positions it strongly for long-term success and sustainability in crypto market.

AI chips are currently being positioned as the backbone of the next wave of global computing and defense technologies. Every disruption in supply chains matters for companies intending to capitalize on this technology, and Taiwan is standing firmly in the way of China’s innovation. Taiwan rolls out export ban on China Taiwan has blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) and restricted both companies’ access to crucial chip-building technologies. The decision was published by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. Under the new rules, both Huawei and SMIC, along with several of their subsidiaries in Russia, Japan, and Germany, have been added to an updated “strategic high-tech commodities entity list,” which requires them to have government approval for any Taiwanese company to export goods or technologies to them. Taiwan’s updated restrictions specifically target the infrastructure and materials necessary for advanced chip production, including plant construction technologies and manufacturing equipment. According to a Bloomberg report in 2023, this restriction will compromise Huawei and SMIC’s ability to continue developing their network of covert chip plants. The network of chips is located across southern China and has reportedly been receiving support from some Taiwanese companies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s most advanced chipmaker, previously ceased business with Huawei in 2020 in compliance with U.S. export restrictions. Now, the rest of Taiwan’s high-tech industry will be expected to follow suit under domestic law. This may halt Huawei and SMIC’s efforts to replicate or replace the kind of high-performance chips that Taiwan exports to firms like Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions disrupt chip markets In early 2025, Taiwan’s newly inaugurated President, Lai Ching-te, made headlines for describing China as a “foreign hostile force.” Lai’s administration also launched a suite of measures aimed at countering Beijing’s infiltration tactics and its political influence operations on the island. Beijing has repeatedly asserted that Taiwan is part of its sovereign territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve what it calls a “peaceful reunification.” It appears that, due to the unlikelihood of outright military conflict in the short term, Taiwan and China are escalating their tensions via the tech industry. Both Huawei and SMIC have spent years trying to work around the export bans of the United States and its allied countries. In 2023, the companies stunned U.S. lawmakers with a surprise 7-nanometer chip, made entirely in China. But analysts have since questioned the scalability and efficiency of the chip, especially now that the companies lack consistent access to foreign equipment and materials. Neither Huawei nor SMIC has commented at the time of reporting. The Taiwanese government did not make an official public announcement either. The listing was only revealed through changes posted on an official website.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 22:15:35

While some market participants remain convinced that altcoin season—a period when Bitcoin is outpaced by the majority of alternative coins in the crypto market—is underway, others remain unfazed, certain that altcoins will continue to bleed . Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson is part of the former group, whose sentiments about the altcoin market are more bullish than bearish. In a recent “ask me anything” live session on YouTube, the Cardano boss responded to a viewer who quizzed him on the state of the altcoin market, particularly curious to know if altcoin season was “cancelled for 2025.” Maintaining optimism for the months ahead, Hoskinson remarked that July and the months preceding it could see altcoins record a notable price run.”The second half of 2025 is going to be great for altcoins,” Hoskinson asserted. Three altcoins are going head-to-head against Bitcoin Interestingly, Bitcoin appears to be recovering quickly after failing to sustain momentum above the $110,000 price mark. The new development indicates a build-up of buying pressure likely triggered by renewed interest from market players. While this could validate the sentiment that the leading cryptocurrency will continue to outperform altcoins, alternative coins could also very possibly secure larger gains in the long term. Despite sustaining mild intra-day losses, three altcoins have outpaced Bitcoin over the last 7 days. Ether, SOL, and DOGE are leading what looks like an altcoin comeback. While Bitcoin, currently trading at $105,516 at press time, has only managed to sustain 3.87% in gains over the last 7-days, ETH, SOL and DOGE are up 7.94%, 6.10%, and 5.65% respectively.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|SHIB|SHIBA INU|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:25:29

As if to make up for Q1’s underwhelming performance, Ether bulls have been up and working of late, with the price value of $3,000 appearing more attainable in the near term. Among other factors, the rise in Ethereum’s open interest rate presents a bullish signal for market participants. Notably, Ethereum’s Open Interest—the total number of outstanding (open) contracts yet to be settled—has hit a new all-time high, exceeding $40 billion for the first time. This new development is especially remarkable for Ethereum, as high open interest typically indicates a rise in market activity and liquidity, suggesting heightened enthusiasm amongst market participants.

These investors accumulated during consolidation and now will potentially form a strong support zone.” Glassnode wrote, adding that ETH is well on its way to $3,420 if the $2,700 and $2,760 support levels hold up strongly.

Αυτό ακριβώς έρχεται να κάνει η Shopify από τις 12 Ιουνίου 2025, συνεργαζόμενη με την Coinbase για να φέρει το stablecoin USDC στον βωμό του παγκόσμιου ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου. Η αρχή θα γίνει σε ένα περιορισμένο αριθμό ατόμων, αλλά σύντομα εκατομμύρια καταστήματα που χρησιμοποιούν το Shopify Payments θα μπορούν να δέχονται USDC μέσω του Base του γρήγορου, φθηνού και ασφαλούς δικτύου της Coinbase πάνω στο Ethereum . Στόχος; Πιο απλές, πιο οικονομικές και πιο παγκόσμιες πληρωμές με τη δύναμη των crypto. Χαρακτηριστικά και οφέλη για τους εμπόρους και πελάτες Με τη νέα αυτή δυνατότητα, το να πληρώνεις με κρυπτονομίσματα γίνεται πιο απλό από ποτέ. Οι πελάτες θα μπορούν να ολοκληρώνουν τις αγορές τους πληρώνοντας με USDC, ένα ψηφιακό «δολάριο» που παραμένει σταθερό στην αξία του. Από την άλλη πλευρά, οι έμποροι θα συνεχίσουν να λαμβάνουν τα χρήματά τους στο τοπικό τους νόμισμα, χωρίς περίπλοκες μετατροπές, win-win! Και για να κάνει την εμπειρία ακόμα καλύτερη, η Shopify σχεδιάζει να προσφέρει και 1% επιστροφή χρημάτων στους πελάτες που επιλέγουν να πληρώσουν με USDC, ένα έξτρα bonus που αναμένεται να ενεργοποιηθεί αργότερα μέσα στο 2025. Από τεχνικής πλευράς, όλο αυτό βασίζεται σε ένα ανοικτό κώδικα που σχεδίασαν μαζί Shopify και Coinbase. Αυτός ο κώδικας σκοπεύει να δώσει λύσει σε ζητήματα που αφορούν καθυστερημένες χρεώσεις και υπολογισμό φόρων, μέχρι και διαχείριση επιστροφών. Όλα είναι ενσωματωμένα στο υπάρχον σύστημα παραγγελιών, χωρίς επιπλέον κόπο για τον έμπορο. Γιατί η Shopify εμπιστεύτηκε το Base της Coinbase Όταν η Shopify έψαχνε την κατάλληλη υποδομή για να φέρει τις crypto πληρωμές στο παιχνίδι, το Base της Coinbase ξεχώρισε αμέσως. Γιατί; Επειδή είναι γρήγορο, οικονομικό και ασφαλές. Το Base αποτελεί μια λύση Layer-2 πάνω στο Ethereum και μπορεί να διαχειρίζεται πολύ περισσότερες συναλλαγές με πολύ χαμηλότερα κόστη. Αυτό το κάνει ιδανικό για χρήση σε μία τεράστια ηλεκτρονική πλατφόρμα όπως η Shopify, όπου κάθε δευτερόλεπτο και κάθε σεντ μετράει. Κανείς πελάτης δεν θέλει καθυστερήσεις ή έξτρα χρεώσεις και το Base προσφέρει ακριβώς αυτή την εμπειρία. Πέραν από το κομμάτι της τεχνολογίας, η Shopify δείχνει ξεκάθαρα ότι θέλει να προωθήσει το Web3 στο λιανικό εμπόριο. Και με τα stablecoins όπως το USDC να γίνονται πλέον καθημερινό εργαλείο για πληρωμές, το timing δεν θα μπορούσε να είναι καλύτερο. USDC στο Checkout; Δες με ποιο πορτοφόλι το κάνεις πράξη Κι αφού οι πληρωμές με USDC γίνονται πλέον mainstream, το επόμενο φυσικό βήμα είναι να έχεις και το κατάλληλο πορτοφόλι για να τα φυλάς! Εδώ έρχεται το Best Wallet , ένα ασφαλές και εύχρηστο πορτοφόλι για τα κρυπτονομίσματά σου. Τι είναι; ένα mobile app που σου δίνει τον πλήρη έλεγχο των crypto σου, με πλήρη διαφάνεια, χωρίς μεσάζοντες και χωρίς κρυφές παγίδες. Υποστηρίζει πάνω από 1.000 νομίσματα από 60+ blockchains, και σου επιτρέπει να τα ανταλλάσσεις εύκολα μέσω του ενσωματωμένου DEX.

Analyst Maps Out 3 Explosive Price Targets Using Rare Technical Signal",https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-2-today-13-tomorrow-analyst-maps-out-3-explosive-price-targets-using-rare-technical-signal/,"Whether altcoin season is in motion remains a topic of debate amongst market participants, although XRP is emerging as one of the few altcoins poised to hit a new price high soon. Ripple’s XRP, the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, might be preparing for an explosive run as market experts continue to outline bullish case scenarios for the altcoin. Cryptocurrency analyst EgragCrypto, known on X as EgragCrypto, predicts that the altcoin could soar to never-before-seen levels, notably $6.7, $13, and $27, if certain technical hurdles are surmounted. In an XRP technical chart shared with his followers on X, the analyst highlights 3 key areas using colored circles purple, red, and white to represent notable technical movements. While the purple circle, which historically follows a bullish uptrend, marks the start of a bullish rally observed across different market cycles, the red circle denotes an incoming market crash. This downward movement often occurs when the 21 EMA goes below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, a trend that is later preceded by a market pump, likely to get rejected by both moving averages. The analyst asserts that the move marks the arrival of a bear market. Conclusively, the white circle points to the 21 EMA avoiding a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on a weekly timeframe—an occurrence recorded only once, leading to a 1,200% surge in XRP’s price value. Laying out his bullish stance, the analyst wrote the following; “It’s simple. We still have one leg which will be an epic, fast, and short-lived move that will hype everyone up, claiming we’ll never go back and that utility will take us to the moon. But remember such moves have rarely continued in one direction, if ever, happened in the past and probably won’t in the future. If you’re well-off and don’t need to sell, stay patient. But if not, don’t come crying to my DMs when things don’t go as planned.” The analyst stated that should XRP surge by 1,200% from its current price of $2.24 or sustain a 600% gain in the near term, the altcoin will be valued at $27 or $13, respectively. Meanwhile, a 300% upsurge, which marks a quarter of the 2017 market rally, would value the asset at $6.70. XRP is trading at a press time price of $2.14, with 0.37% in 7-day gains.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:51:31

However, a new contender, Ruvi AI , is rapidly emerging as a high-potential alternative. With over $1.7 million raised , 150 million tokens sold , and predictions of an astonishing 13,100% ROI , Ruvi AI is gaining spotlight attention. But what truly sets it apart, and how does it stack up against Cardano? Here’s a closer look at why analysts are so optimistic about Ruvi AI. Why Analysts Draw Comparisons Between Ruvi AI and Cardano Cardano built its reputation by addressing key blockchain scalability and efficiency issues, a first for the industry when it launched. Similarly, Ruvi AI is making waves for its ability to tackle real-world challenges by integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) . Its solutions span industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance , bringing wide-ranging utility that extends far beyond traditional crypto applications. Where Cardano excels in creating a stable and scalable ecosystem, Ruvi AI adds another dimension by tapping into demand for practical, AI-driven solutions. This focus not only ensures Ruvi AI’s relevance but also positions it to thrive in a competitive landscape. Presale Success Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has garnered significant attention, with over $1.7 million raised and 150 million tokens sold during the current phase. This robust demand reflects growing confidence among investors and signals that Ruvi AI is more than just speculative noise. A standout feature of Ruvi AI is its structured growth model , which brings transparency and predictability to its token pricing. Unlike other tokens that soar or crash based on market whims, Ruvi AI is designed to steadily grow in value. When the presale concludes, tokens will increase to $0.07 , giving early investors a clear pathway to immediate returns. Analysts project even greater gains, predicting Ruvi AI could reach $1 post-listing , equivalent to a remarkable 66x return for presale participants. Maximize ROI With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI takes its presale one step further by offering exclusive VIP investment tiers . These tiers reward early investors with generous bonuses, ensuring that participants at all levels can amplify their gains. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers make Ruvi AI appealing to both cautious first-timers and seasoned whales alike. Building Trust Through Transparency and Security A major differentiator for Ruvi AI is its commitment to transparency and safety . The project is being independently assessed through an upcoming third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This ensures that Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is secure and reliable, an essential factor for responsible investors. Adding to its appeal is Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees ample liquidity and seamless trading for token holders following the presale stage. Together, these moves solidify trust in the platform and give Ruvi AI’s investors peace of mind. Real-World Applications Ensure Long-Term Demand Unlike purely speculative tokens, Ruvi AI delivers tangible value through real-world applications, ensuring ongoing demand.

While Ripple has not confirmed such a move, the rumor has reignited discussions about the company’s evolving role in the global financial system. JackTheRippler’s post was accompanied by a visual breakdown demonstrating how Ripple’s infrastructure already mirrors the core functions of a modern digital bank. In the illustrated process, a sender’s bank connects to a third-party liquidity provider to replenish its XRP holdings. It then accesses RippleNet and xCurrent for pre-transaction verification, including exchange rates and transfer costs. Once the conditions are accepted, the bank executes the cross-border payment using XRP in real time. On the receiving end, the bank uses a separate liquidity provider to convert the XRP into local currency, completing the transaction seamlessly. This end-to-end flow highlights Ripple’s technical capacity to operate like a bank, even without a license. It has led many to ask whether formal regulatory approval is simply the next phase in Ripple’s institutional evolution. RUMORS: @Ripple will obtain a banking license and transform into a bank! #XRP pic.twitter.com/MfDPYel2Ed — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 14, 2025 The Banking Charter Possibility This rumor aligns closely with earlier developments reported by Timestabloid. Former Ripple board member and entrepreneur Greg Kidd revealed during a one-on-one interview with FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett at the XRP Las Vegas conference that he is developing a specialized banking charter. The charter is designed for digital-first companies that manage deposits and payments without engaging in lending or operating physical branches. Kidd emphasized that his proposal was theoretical and not linked to any official plan by Ripple. However, he made it clear that the goal is to reshape the financial system by making it more inclusive. This charter could enable companies like Ripple to acquire a form of banking license tailored to their business model, allowing them to provide core financial services without taking on the full regulatory load of traditional banks. Ripple’s Larger Ambitions In another earlier report , Timestabloid highlighted analysis by Stellar Rippler, a well-known crypto commentator, who claimed that Ripple is not just aiming to become a bank; it is preparing to operate at the very foundation of the global financial infrastructure. According to Stellar Rippler, Ripple’s goal is to rival traditional financial institutions, even central banks, by redefining how money moves across borders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While this may sound bold, it is grounded in observable developments. Ripple currently provides payment and liquidity solutions in more than 70 countries. Its suite of tools, including RippleNet, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), and its RLUSD stablecoin, positions it as a critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology. If Ripple does pursue a banking license, it would no longer need to rely on intermediary banks or third-party settlement networks. It could offer direct, real-time, cross-border payments powered entirely by blockchain, something legacy institutions have struggled to achieve. A Strategic Silence? Ripple has not commented on these rumors, but the silence could be strategic. The company remains entangled in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and may be waiting for regulatory clarity before making any significant structural changes. Still, Ripple’s direction is unmistakable. It is no longer just a fintech startup. It is building infrastructure, securing partnerships with central banks, and offering services that resemble, if not already exceeded, those of traditional banking institutions. Whether or not it becomes a licensed bank, Ripple is shaping the future of digital finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This resistance has not deterred long-term holders or analysts, many of whom remain confident that XRP’s underlying utility in cross-border payments could drive substantial gains in the future. Some analysts believe that if XRP is adopted as a key tool for international money movement, its value could climb significantly. These projections are based not on short-term speculation but on the asset’s potential role in global liquidity frameworks. Assessing the Cross-border Liquidity Market A critical factor in these forecasts is the estimated size of the cross-border liquidity pool. While exact figures are not readily available, economists often use M2 money supply data to frame the conversation. M2 includes cash, checking deposits, and other liquid financial assets, and offers a broad view of potential capital deployment. According to a macroeconomic analysis published in April 2025 by analyst Marty Party, the collective M2 money supply of the U.S., China, Japan, and the European Union stood at approximately $83.37 trillion. However, only a fraction of that total is typically designated for cross-border use. Historical data from the Bank for International Settlements suggests that banks allocate roughly 10% to 15% of M2 for international reserves and claims. This implies that the global cross-border liquidity pool may fall between $8 trillion and $12 trillion, with $10 trillion serving as a reasonable mid-range estimate. Calculating XRP’s Value at 25% Liquidity Share To determine XRP’s potential value if it facilitated 25% of the estimated $10 trillion in cross-border liquidity, an analysis was conducted using OpenAI’s ChatGPT model. At the time, XRP was priced at $2.23 with a circulating supply of about 58.82 billion tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the first scenario, where XRP is required to fully back the $2.5 trillion needed for 25% of global liquidity, each token would need to represent a portion of that amount. Dividing $2.5 trillion by the total circulating supply yields a price estimate of approximately $42.50 per XRP. Token Velocity and Adjusted Price Scenarios The second approach incorporates the concept of token velocity, how often a token is used in transactions within a year. If XRP is reused five times annually, then only $500 billion worth of XRP would be required to support $2.5 trillion in flows. This would translate to a token price of about $8.50. The model also evaluated other turnover rates. At a velocity of 10, XRP’s price would drop to around $4.25. Conversely, if the token turned over just twice a year, the required locked value would increase, raising the estimated price to $21.25. These scenarios highlight how XRP’s future price could vary significantly depending on the level of institutional adoption and how efficiently the token circulates. While theoretical, the models offer insight into XRP’s potential valuation if it becomes a core asset in the global financial infrastructure.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $2,567 following a slight recovery but remains some distance off the week’s high of $2,871. Amidst all these recent developments, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment has shared a positive report hinting at a bullish ETH future. ETH Whale Holdings Grow By 3.72% In 30 Days In an X post on June 14, Santiment provides valuable insights into Ethereum whales’ behaviors. The credible analytics firm reports that all 6,392 of such investors holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have significantly increased their holdings over the past month compared to retail investors. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash – Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast In adding data to this claim, Santiment further shares that ETH whales have acquired 1.49 million ETH, worth $38.26 million, in the past 30 days, boosting their total holdings by a significant 3.72%. Generally, whale accumulations are bullish signals that indicate an asset’s strong potential for long-term price appreciation. Therefore, ETH’s recent whale activity is likely to encourage significant levels of retail investment that could incite a price rally. Interestingly, CoinMarketCap data shows the altcoin has recorded a 2.38% decline over the past month. The token’s price has largely oscillated within a range of $2,400 to $2,800, reflecting indecision in the market amidst external pressures and a lack of clear bullish catalysts. Ethereum whales have conducted this accumulation spree during a period of market uncertainty, indicating strong investor confidence regardless of the present market situation. Ethereum Price Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,536 following a price gain of 1.18% in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 3.82% on its weekly chart after a notable brief price ascent above $2,800. According to data from CoinCodex, the general ETH market sentiment is bullish while the Greed & Fear Index stands at 61 (Greed). This report is well reflected in the reported accumulation trend.

Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts paint a strong bullish future of $4,269.40 in the next three months.

Tron (TRX) has recently surged 12% following a new stablecoin launch on its blockchain. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making progress with upgrades to Shibarium, its Layer-2 network. Both have sparked renewed interest. Yet, amid this, another project stands out with deeper traction. BlockDAG, an emerging presale initiative, is nearing the $300 million mark. It has already secured $303 million in funding and attracted over 2 million active users through its X1 mobile mining app. In a space often dominated by flashy headlines and speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing that a more grounded, user-first approach can outperform even long-established coins. TRX Jumps 12% on Stablecoin Buzz TRX rose 12% after a new USD₮ stablecoin launched on its blockchain. The coin benefited from media attention tied to the new dollar-pegged coin. This trend sparked higher network activity and boosted TRX’s market cap. Even so, this rise may be short-lived. TRX has experienced similar spikes before, which have faded once the initial buzz subsided. Its reliance on politically linked headlines leaves questions about long-term stability. Until network usage or developer growth matches these price moves, TRX’s momentum may not persist. Shiba Inu Builds Utility With Shibarium Shiba Inu continues development on Shibarium, its Layer‑2 network, aiming to improve speed and cut transaction costs. The update is designed to streamline validator operations and improve performance. These upgrades may help SHIB move beyond meme status, offering real-world use cases. Even though the Shibarium network has promise, past congestion and early bugs slow adoption. Community sentiment remains positive, yet market gains have been modest. If the improvements hold strong, SHIB may gain traction. For now, it’s in technical rebuild mode, offering potential upside but no breakout yet. BlockDAG: $303M Raised, 2M Users, and No Empty Hype While TRX enjoys attention from news cycles and SHIB focuses on rebuilding its tech, BlockDAG is gaining steady ground through real progress. It isn’t relying on famous names or viral trends to grow. So far, BlockDAG has raised $303 million in its ongoing presale, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. More than 2 million users are already active on its X1 mobile mining app. BDAG is set to launch at $0.05 and is priced at $0.0276 in Stage 29, but right now, $0.0018 buys you in. With over $303 million raised, this gap won’t last long. BlockDAG stands out because of its user-first approach. The X1 app lets people mine directly from their phones, with no need for expensive setups or complicated tools. This simple entry point has attracted users worldwide and built strong engagement, even before the coin launches. There’s no involvement from venture capital firms, no early access for insiders, and no private deals. Every contribution comes from the public. This clear structure helps build trust, especially at a time when many in the space are tired of centralized control. BlockDAG isn’t chasing stories. It’s setting the pace. And even before its official launch, it’s already outpacing many projects that are fully listed. With clear results and growing traction, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the leading crypto to watch this year. Final Verdict TRX may earn attention through stablecoin news and SHIB may build long-term utility via Shibarium. But those models depend on external momentum and delayed results. BlockDAG is different. With $303 million raised, 22.6 billion coins sold, 2,660% ROI for Batch 1 holders, over 2 million active users, a retail‑only presale, and limited batches, it is showing substance and scale now, not promises later. The frozen $0.0018 price remains available for another six days, while batch 29 continues at $0.0276. In a crowded market, BlockDAG delivers actual metrics and a working app before any coin launch. It is quietly emerging as the clear standout to follow in 2025.

Jamie Selway, a veteran financial services executive, will begin serving in the role on June 17th, per a new press release from the regulator. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says Selway will help “ensure the agency’s regulations balance costs and benefits.” The SEC has adopted a more crypto-friendly stance under Atkins, who has sought to distance the regulatory agency from the high-profile enforcement actions overseen by Gary Gensler, the previous chair. Gensler launched legal battles against numerous crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. Since Gensler stepped down in January, many of those cases have been closed. Atkins said last month that the SEC’s “legacy rules and regulations” don’t contemplate the novel use cases of blockchain technology. “In order for the United States to be the ‘crypto capital of the planet’ as envisioned by President Trump, the Commission must keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Rules and regulations designed for off-chain securities may be incompatible with or unnecessary for on-chain assets and stifle the growth of blockchain technology. A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.

The deadly strikes against Iran on Friday, June 13, said to have killed at least 78 people, were praised by Donald Trump as “excellent” with promises of “more to come.” Speaking on the victims of the Israeli attack, UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani detailed: “The overwhelming majority of them [were] civilians, including women and children.” Bitcoin for bombs, Satoshi inverted “Pro-bitcoin” Trump pretended to be for peaceful resolution of the so-called Iranian nuclear issue until mere hours before the strike, posting to Truth Social: “We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue!” However, some Israeli officials have been quoted saying this was a deception designed to lower Iran’s guard. “We had a clear U.S. green light,” one of them allegedly told Axios . Similar comments by “senior Israeli officials” were also made to The Jerusalem Post. Source: Truth Social. Whatever the truth is, if there is any left in the poorly written drama called mainstream news these days, one thing is clear to O.G. bitcoiners: Politicians and bankers make wars, and innocent people on both sides are slaughtered to enrich them. As Major General Smedley D. Butler famously declared in War Is a Racket: “Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die … No one told them that dollars and cents were the real reason. No one mentioned to them, as they marched away, that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here.” Image: Pixabay. Bitcoin was originally meant to fix this. The genesis block gives us a hint with its headline message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.” Crypto was meant to separate money and state , and as early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver once said , it was meant to potentially “undermine every government on the entire planet’s ability to wage war.”Now, BTC is held largely in the hands of the same murdering psychopaths from whom we were meant to take the power back. Blackrock, which invests heavily in defense companies profiting from war, had roughly 575,810 BTC in their Bitcoin ETF as of March . The United States government holds about 200,000 BTC that we know about.Even the individual whales, like Michael Saylor, are strongly pro-state and pro-fiat money. Saylor, who privately holds well over 17,000 BTC, has called Trump “pro-crypto” and criticized advocates of permissionless use and privacy.States and their crony banks. State-embedded mega-corporations. The trend is clear. These entities now hold persuasive amounts of crypto not to be used as permissionless, peer-to-peer electronic cash but for purposes of socioeconomic control and power.Another example is crypto’s unprecedented use for directly purchasing weapons and military supplies in the Ukraine/Russia conflict. As for major centralized exchanges, they are regulated via statist legal systems. So, in essence, if the U.S. continues helping Israel in its war on everyone around and in funding terror cells like Hamas, BTC will be right there behind the cause. Source: bitcointreasuries.net . How to take crypto back in 2 steps While the masses rant and cheer like it’s a football game for either “Israel” or “Iran” to destroy the other, everyday people like you and I will be killed like dogs in the streets, in their houses, in hospitals and schools and while sleeping, in both countries. Bitcoin was supposed to “fix this.”Even “Bitcoin Jesus” Ver, the original voice of Bitcoin Not Bombs, now says he wants to help Trump “make America great again.” Maybe he hasn’t connected the dots yet on Trump’s warmongering, though that’s hard to imagine. Maybe it is (somewhat understandably) a desperate bid to regain his freedom, as he is currently being held by the U.S. Department of Justice on bogus charges. Or maybe there’s another, more disappointing explanation.Regardless, it makes bitcoiners who got into crypto for the prospect of freedom and peace reel with bewilderment. Was any of this ever real in the first place? Were we put on by state interests somehow? Perhaps Satoshi’s creation has just been co-opted. Luckily, it doesn’t matter either way if the tech works. It seems to me crypto still can bring us the separation of money and state. But we’ve got to focus on two things: uncaptured networks that can work for instant, permissionless cash transactions, and most importantly, understanding the true, inviolable source of freedom — self-ownership.The truth is, no government on earth cares for the people it professes to rule. Not Israel, not Iran, not the United States. This is a bitter pill but should be quite obvious, given the evidence. Further, no state is anything but a grouping of single individuals, no better than you or I. States aren’t some abstract, all-powerful deity, though they would have us believe them to be so (much like the old man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz). At the highest levels, even with Israel and Iran, there is a fraternity in the shadows. The enmity played out in the news keeps you distracted. Image: Pixabay. When we come to understand that we own ourselves, that our lives, bodies, and property acquired by non-violence are ours, it makes no sense why some “special” individuals should arbitrarily be able to rule us violently, appoint themselves masters over us, force us to kill strangers in another country we have nothing against personally, or extort money from us via “taxes” to pay for bombs and all other kinds of evil refuse.Like decentralized payment protocols, decentralized networks of societies and communities can order their own lives and make their own sensible rules. They already do. Bitcoin and crypto present a way out of this mess if combined with the above Voluntaryist ethos. Networks like Bitcoin Cash, which are fast, efficient , censorship-resistant, and cost next to nothing to use, can help individuals take their economic freedom back, little by little.Developing privacy tech makes this more possible than ever. How? By refusing to finance violence in whatever small or large way possible until a critical mass of non-compliance is reached. In the same way, individuals can wake up and simply refuse — one by one — to become soldiers to kill and die for Trump, Netanyahu, Ali Khamenei, violent religion, or anyone else who thinks murder is “excellent.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 00:39:27

Dogecoin (DOGE), long considered a meme favorite, still hovers near the $0.20 range and shows resilience, but the real buzz is around an emerging DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is in phase 5 of its presale. Over 10.5 million has already been raised and more than 12,000 investors have joined. With June winding down and momentum building across crypto, this might be the top token of the summer you’ll wish you grabbed early. If you’re still wondering what to buy before June ends, you may not want to sleep on this one. Dogecoin Edges Near $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.20, up about 1% on the day. The token recently bounced off support near $0.176, climbing into the $0.190 resistance zone, and has since held steady around $0.197 Indicators on the 4-hour chart show a breakout above a descending trendline, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum, although DOGE remains capped by overhead pressure near $0.3. With major cryptos rising in tandem, DOGE is regaining attention as a potentially stabilizing meme token, while other plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to draw interest at lower price points. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Blazing Ahead, Secure Tokens at $0.03 Before They Double Mutuum Finance is heating up fast in the DeFi market, now in Phase 5 of its presale with tokens priced at only $0.03, 100% from a listing price of $0.06. That means early Phase 5 investors stand to gain 2x once MUTM launches in addition to a post-launch 74x run. With over $10.5 million raised and a growing community of 12,000+ investors, MUTM is proving itself a rising star in decentralized finance. Plus, the next presale round jumps to $0.035, meaning if you buy now, you lock in an instant 16.67% profit before prices climb. Mutuum’s Hybrid Lending Model Mutuum Finance’s edge lies in its innovative hybrid lending system that merges two powerful DeFi models. In peer to contract (P2C), users place their stablecoins, for example, USDT, into smart contracts, which give them easy income from the interest generated. In P2P, borrowers and lenders talk directly, agree on loan terms, and stay private, since they do not need agents to connect them. This unique combination gives users the best of decentralization, control, and competitive yields, a real game changer in crypto lending. Leaderboard Gamification Sparks Community Excitement and Rewards Top Holders Mutuum Finance is driving engagement with a leaderboard system spotlighting the top 50 MUTM holders in real time. Those in the top spots will receive bonus tokens, turning investment into a thrilling, competitive experience that rewards loyalty and strategy. Certified Secure & Future-Proof Mutuum Finance’s open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, boosting investor confidence in the project. In addition, Mutuum is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum designed to avoid the risks of algorithmic stablecoins’ collapse. This stablecoin is going to hold the ecosystem together by improving stability and security for the system’s users and future institutional members. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $10.5M+ from 12,000+ investors. Now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03, launch price is $0.06, a 100% ROI. Real DeFi use, Certik-audited, and high upside.

Bittensor (TAO) dipped to about $399, forming a strong buy area. Aptos (APT) saw a whopping $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume, ranking it among the top two globally. But Unstaked takes the lead. It backs real AI tools, not empty promises. The presale price of Unstaked (UNSD) sits at $0.01139 in Stage 20. With a $5+ forecast, 3000x gains look plausible. Over $9.7 million has been raised, and about 1.1 billion coins sold. After launch, live AI agents will transition fully to on-chain and operational status. Bittensor’s Sub‑$400 Dip Sparks Buy Alert Bittensor (TAO) currently trades around $399 following an 8% drop this week and 5% over two weeks. This underperformance contrasts with broader market gains. Analyst Michael van de Poppe labels this zone a strong buy. He notes capitulation from weak holders and increased interest from stronger hands. A rounding bottom pattern is emerging, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. TAO remains the top‑ranked AI coin. If momentum returns, targets could range from $425 to $433, and even $700 to $800. For those tracking smart AI coins, Bittensor appears to offer a solid accumulation opportunity. Aptos Surges With $1.6B Stablecoin Activity Aptos (APT) shows impressive growth across its ecosystem. Bridging brought in over $30 million in BTC via OKX’s xBTC in one week. Stablecoin volume reached $1.6 billion, led by USDT, USDC, and USDe. Echo Protocol secured $275 million in TVL. Thala Labs contributed $850 million in DeFi volume. Transaction growth ranks Aptos among the global top two. The chain added 39 ambassadors, distributed $3.4 million in rewards and hosted a major NFT mint. It also expanded tools like Kana Learn, gaming features, naming services, plus real‑world activations such as UNTOLD Festival. With rising activity and user adoption, Aptos is gaining serious momentum. Unstaked’s On‑Chain AI Agents Drive Real Value Unstaked delivers working AI systems that users can deploy immediately after launch. These AI agents act autonomously and run on platforms like X and Telegram. They automate outreach, manage communities, and engage 24/7. Every action is verifiable with proof‑of‑activity on‑chain. No coding is needed. This means creators and crypto teams get powerful automation without hiring staff. These agents are cheaper than an intern and more scalable. They are exactly what crypto promised, but seldom delivered. The presale price is $0.01139 in Stage 20. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, the project already shows momentum. These figures are not hype. They reflect actual buyers’ interest backed by real tech. Most importantly, these AI agents will go live after launch. That means users can deploy them immediately to earn on‑chain rewards. They can customize agent behavior to fit specific goals or communities. Once live, agents will interact, learn, and earn autonomously. That level of real‑world use cements value. A project becomes strong when its product is live and working. Unstaked meets that test. Featuring coinized AI tools, seamless deployment, and on‑chain verification, Unstaked offers clear utility. With a future price target of $5+, the potential return over the $0.01139 presale price is striking. Real use cases, strong funding, and live agents after launch mark Unstaked as a utility‑driven leader. It stands apart from speculative coins by delivering actual functionality tied to actual value. Unstaked may well be the best performing crypto today by real‑world impact and math Final Verdict Bittensor’s drop under $400 may signal a buying setup toward $700+. Aptos is thriving with $30 million BTC inflow, $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume and top global transaction growth. Both projects have strong traction. But Unstaked operates differently. It builds coinized AI agents that automate outreach, grow communities and run on‑chain with proof. Priced at $0.01139 (Stage 20), with over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, it ties real use to real value. Live AI agents post‑launch will cement its utility. This makes Unstaked the standout play rather than just hype.

At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,990.

Cardano (ADA) momentum builds as it eyes a $0.70 breakout, helped by inclusion in Nasdaq’s crypto index. But while both tokens rely on trend shifts and sentiment swings, Web3 ai is delivering results now. Its presale token WAI costs just $0.000422 and unlocks eight AI-powered crypto tools that already exist. With a confirmed listing at $0.005242, early buyers lock in a 1147% gain. Over $7.7 million has poured in, making Web3 ai the only project offering working tech before hype. Shiba Inu Teeters: Will Support Hold or Selloff Resume? Shiba Inu faces pressure after weeks of declines, with resistance around $0.000014 and support at $0.0000107 holding firm. The token has failed multiple attempts to stay above the upper range, keeping it in a narrow downtrend. The weekly MACD remains flat, indicating little momentum and a stalled short-term trend. However, sideways movement may offer a low-risk entry if buyers step in near support for a rebound. A break above $0.000014 on rising volume could spark upside to the $0.000015–$0.000016 zone. For cautious traders, the current setup offers clear risk management: buy near support and set tight stop-losses. Watching volume and trend shifts now may reveal whether SHIB resumes a bearish slide or consolidates toward a rebound. Cardano Price Holds Firm as $0.70 Breakout Looms Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.66 after bouncing off key support around $0.65. Analysts say this level is critical. A firm hold here could open a move toward $0.70, while a breakdown might lead to losses near $0.60. The price recently fell from April highs but has shown signs of stabilization. Technical charts show low volatility and steady support, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. Nasdaq’s move to include ADA in its crypto index later this year may boost investor confidence. For traders watching altcoins with well-defined technical setups and upcoming catalysts, ADA stands out. Monitoring the price action near the $0.65 level could offer a smart entry before a potential upward move gains momentum. Why WAI Could Be 2025’s Biggest Moonshot Web3 ai is selling WAI at just $0.000422, yet analysts are already sketching price curves that end at 4 by 2026. Their math is not wishful thinking. The project has locked a listing at $0.005242, giving Stage 8 buyers a clear 1303.95 % lift before the first exchange candle prints. More importantly, every token powers eight AI tools that traders need. There is a live risk simulator that runs GARCH models, a DeFi yield advisor that ranks pools by safety, a scam detector that scans contracts line by line, and five other modules feeding decisions in real time. Each user action burns WAI, creating permanent scarcity. Early demand shows the concept works. Web3 ai has already raised $7.7 million without billboard hype or celebrity endorsements. If daily usage grows like early Metamask adoption, token velocity could force prices into whole dollar territory faster than many expect. Investors who missed Solana at one or Polygon at pennies now have a second shot. The window stays open only until presale allocations vanish. Grab tokens now, before the valuation wakes the market. Web3 ai Transforms Speculation into Math Investors weighing the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price target against Cardano (ADA) momentum may chase charts for weeks, yet outcomes remain tied to market mood. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price target relies on retail buzz, and Cardano (ADA) momentum demands regulatory milestones before $0.70 breaks cleanly. Web3 ai removes that guesswork. Every risk scan, yield check, or sentiment sweep burns WAI, reducing supply while usage climbs. Buying at $0.000422 secures access to eight revenue-driven tools and a listing at $0.005242, mathematically locking 1147% upside. With $7.7 million secured, WAI launches are funded, making it the pick in a speculative field.

As demand for decentralized storage continues to rise, Filecoin’s infrastructure-first approach positions it for significant growth in the coming years. 4. Render: Revolutionizing GPU Computing for Creators Render is making waves as a standout contender for the top crypto coins of the upcoming bull run, thanks to its focus on decentralized GPU computing. By connecting creators, like animators, designers, and developers, with individuals offering idle GPU capacity, Render enables faster and cheaper processing of complex visuals compared to traditional cloud services. Already adopted in the creative industry, Render’s platform helps level the playing field by providing access to powerful computing resources. With the rise of the metaverse, AI, and digital design, the need for decentralized rendering power is expected to grow, giving RNDR a strong real-world use case tied to these expanding sectors. Render has also made significant platform and governance upgrades, improving transparency and giving token holders a say in the network’s future. With a functional platform and an increasing number of users, Render is poised to scale alongside the industries it serves, positioning itself for future success. Which Top Crypto Coin Should You Buy Now? As we gear up for the next bull run, top crypto coins that deliver real-world solutions are becoming the main contenders. BlockDAG is leading the way, with its live testnet supporting NFT creation and token burn trials, all backed by over $303 million in presale funding and strong community backing. NEAR Protocol shines with its developer-friendly framework, perfect for scaling dApp growth. Meanwhile, Filecoin meets the growing demand for decentralized storage in today’s privacy-conscious world, and Render is revolutionizing the creative sector by providing decentralized GPU power for faster, more affordable rendering.

46036186,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746919,1749949850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46036186.jpeg,Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/amazon-pours-13b-into-aussie-ai/,"Amazon.com Inc. will invest A$20 billion ($13 billion) in Australia between 2025 and 2029 to expand its data center infrastructure, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global firm. The prime Minister welcomed Amazon Web Services’ investment to expand data center infrastructure in Sydney and Melbourne, calling it the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global provider. He emphasized the project’s role in strengthening Australia’s AI capabilities, creating skilled jobs, and supporting high-performance computing infrastructure. The funds will boost cloud computing capacity and support Australia’s growing demand for artificial intelligence, Amazon said in a statement. The investment will center around its existing Sydney and Melbourne data centers. Albanese met with Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman on Saturday in Seattle ahead of the G-7 summit in Canada, where the deal was highlighted as a milestone in digital cooperation . Garman highlighted the company’s commitment to helping Australian organizations leverage generative AI. He said the investment will strengthen data infrastructure, increase renewable energy use, and support Australia’s ambition to become a global AI leader. Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres welcomed the investment in an interview with Sky News Australia, calling it a “very significant” step for the nation’s digital infrastructure. “It’s in Australia’s interests to lean into the opportunity,” Ayres said. “We must be makers of the technology as well as takers.” Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia As part of the expansion, Amazon will also build three new solar farms in Victoria and Queensland to power the growing infrastructure and support its clean energy goals . Amazon will commit to buying a combined capacity of more than 170 megawatts across these farms. Amazon operates eight solar and wind energy projects across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, which help power its Australian data centers and fulfillment facilities. Once all 11 of its planned renewable energy projects are online, they are expected to produce over 1.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy annually—enough to power approximately 290,000 Australian homes each year. Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon invested an estimated A$467 million in renewable energy projects in Australia. In 2024, Amazon was Australia’s third-largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and remains the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally. As per a study by Accenture, Australian organizations migrating compute-heavy AI workloads to AWS can reduce carbon emissions by up to 94% compared with on-premises data centers. This is because of AWS’s infrastructure hardware, power, cooling, and carbon-free energy procurement efficiencies. AWS powers Australia’s AI ambitions with expanding cloud footprint The investment aligns with the Australian government’s goal to boost productivity and economic growth through AI-driven innovation. It will equip hundreds of thousands of Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and partners with advanced cloud and AI tools, enabling large-scale innovation while ensuring compliance with local data residency and regulatory standards. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources estimates that AI and automation could add up to A$600 billion to Australia’s GDP annually by 2030. AWS’s presence in Australia began in 2012 with the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. This was followed by the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific in 2023, including the country’s first AWS Local Zones in Perth. In April 2024, AWS established Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed generative AI service, in the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. Moreover, in July 2024, the Australian Government linked with AWS to provide a “Top Secret” AWS Cloud to deliver cloud innovation in national security and defense and enhance the nation’s defense and intelligence capabilities.

Recent price movements have formed a classic Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, often seen as a reliable bullish reversal signal. While the breakout hasn’t roared just yet, the structure forming beneath the surface suggests growing strength. Inverse Head And Shoulders Takes Shape On SUI Chart In a recent analysis shared on X, Cleanwater highlights a potential Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern forming on SUI. The move began with a dip from $3.74 on May 29th to $3.00 by May 31st, marking the initial correction. A strong bounce followed, pushing the price up to $3.39 on June 3rd, establishing the first neckline. Related Reading: SUI Meteoric Rise: Golden Cross Signals A Potential 380% Explosion The price then reversed again, dropping to $2.84 on June 5th, forming a key support zone and the “head” of the pattern. However, a swift recovery brought SUI to $3.55 on June 10th, aligning with the neckline and reinforcing the setup. On June 13th, SUI saw one last dip to $2.91, which Cleanwater identifies as the final touch needed to validate the inverse head and shoulders formation. With the price now trading around $3.04, the setup hints at strong upside potential. According to Cleanwater, the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern took shape with an initial dip, a slight recovery, and a second, deeper drop. A push to higher resistance followed this, then capped off by a final dip, shallower than the second and hovering near the level of the first. 4H And 1D Charts Align: Market Prepares For A Break The analyst also observed that a channel is forming on both the 4-hour and daily time frames, indicating that a breakout may be approaching. While it’s difficult to predict exactly when a breakout will occur, the consistent price action within well-defined support and resistance zones shows growing strength. Sideways consolidation like this often precedes a significant move in either direction. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View In his personal view, Cleanwater leans bullish, suggesting there’s significant upside potential if momentum shifts in favor of the bulls. The repeated tests of resistance and support reinforce this view, hinting at a strong underlying structure. Though he can’t call the exact moment for a breakout, he believes the current setup favors those positioning early for a move. However, Cleanwater also expressed caution regarding the global economic environment, noting that broader news events have started to weigh on market sentiment. He sees the current range as a solid accumulation zone, but acknowledges that a bit more time is needed for the picture to fully develop.

With new regulations, network congestion, and user demand for real-world utility, certain projects are standing out. Qubetics is leading the conversation for innovation and interoperability, while long-established names like BNB and Monero continue to build on scalability and privacy, respectively. For forward-looking participants, these three assets are proving to be the best cryptos to join this month. They offer more than just hype—they bring tangible upgrades, meaningful use cases, and sustainable growth models. Whether you’re seeking tech-backed value, long-term resilience, or privacy, this shortlist highlights the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics ($TICS): Final Public Sale, Interoperability Advancements, and Rising Community Demand Qubetics is stepping into its final crypto presale phase, and time is running out. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 at a fixed price of $0.3370, with a scheduled 20% increase upon listing. The protocol has attracted over 27,900 holders and raised $18 million. Following a major tokenomics revision, the total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, creating heightened scarcity and stronger long-term token dynamics. This isn’t just another altcoin. Qubetics introduces a cross-industry interoperability layer that simplifies how professionals, businesses, and platforms interact with decentralized systems. The surge in demand stems from its ability to integrate high-volume, data-sensitive industries without sacrificing decentralization or user control. Qubetics is engineered to avoid the congestion issues plaguing Ethereum and the centralization concerns surrounding major Layer 1 chains. What makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to join this month isn’t just scarcity. It’s the multi-layered roadmap and its delivery. The mainnet launch is anticipated by the end of Q3 2025, and early analysts have estimated price surges driven by low supply, aggressive exchange listings, and strong developer incentives. BNB Chain’s Smart Contract Dominance Strengthens In early June, Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) reported its highest-ever 24-hour developer activity spike, backed by over 2,000 verified new smart contracts. Fueled by gas cost efficiency and ecosystem grants, this surge demonstrates why BNB remains a leading Layer 1 choice, especially as Ethereum faces usability hurdles. The BNB Chain has also expanded its sidechain architecture through opBNB and Greenfield, solidifying its utility beyond DeFi. These developments have turned BNB into a multi-vertical asset, serving dApp builders, NFT marketplaces, and DePIN infrastructure alike. A key metric driving interest: BNB Chain’s daily active addresses surpassed 1.8 million last week, nearly triple the count seen in early 2023. This growth—along with newly inked partnerships with gaming studios and AI labs—underscores why BNB Chain is still counted among the best cryptos to join this month. Monero (XMR) Makes a Comeback: Privacy, Fungibility, and Anti-Surveillance Tech With rising surveillance threats and increased scrutiny of blockchain transactions by global regulators, Monero (XMR) is gaining traction again. In June, a new update to its Bulletproofs+ protocol decreased transaction sizes by 7% and improved network verification speeds by 11%, resulting in faster payments with lower resource consumption. Regulatory crackdowns on centralized exchanges have made privacy-oriented coins more appealing, and Monero leads this space with unmatched transaction obfuscation. Unlike zero-knowledge alternatives, XMR doesn’t require a trusted setup and allows true peer-to-peer transfers without metadata exposure. Monero’s relevance grows in scenarios where financial sovereignty and digital privacy are essential. While mainstream coins focus on compliance and transparency, XMR defends the ethos of permissionless freedom. For those focused on utility beyond speculation, Monero still holds a vital role in privacy-first financial systems. Its resistance to censorship and strong developer base continue to make it one of the best cryptos to join this month. Conclusion: Strategic Timing Is Everything—Final $TICS Tokens Are Running Out Fast The crypto space rewards preparation—and the smart money is already watching assets that solve real problems.

Platforms that let users build, test, and deploy code offer long-term strength, not just market buzz. In this article, we examine four crypto projects that appeal to builders with working tools and promising structures. BlockDAG takes the spotlight as the only presale project already offering a working testnet and developer access, making it a practical option worth understanding. BlockDAG (BDAG): Test Smart Contracts on a Live EVM-Compatible Testnet Among the top trending cryptos in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has earned attention for providing a developer-ready environment powered by a live testnet and high-speed architecture. Built on a DAG system combined with Proof-of-Work, it delivers both scalability and strong network security. These elements are key for anyone working on smart contract-based applications. The most appealing part of BlockDAG for developers is its hands-on testing capacity. Ethereum-compatible smart contracts can already be deployed through MetaMask and Remix on its running testnet. This setup allows for real-world trials and debugging before launching on the mainnet, giving builders an early edge. BlockDAG’s economic progress is also notable. The presale has crossed $304 million in funding, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. With $304M in presale funding and Stage 29 priced at $0.0276, BlockDAG has frozen a $0.0018 access point for buyers who act fast. This won’t stay open much longer. With over 2 million users on its X1 app and batch 29 now active, BlockDAG stands apart from typical presale projects thanks to real tech and visible demand. Render (RNDR): A GPU Rendering Protocol for Development at Scale Render plays a specific but vital role in the top trending cryptos in 2025, especially for creators working with advanced visuals. It allows builders in 3D design, gaming, and digital effects to outsource GPU rendering tasks via its decentralized network, cutting time and costs while supporting large-scale production. Its API lets developers tap into distributed GPU power using smart contracts. As AI and immersive gaming continue to expand, Render’s GPU compute tools give tech creators a solid backend. RNDR tokens are used to reward those offering GPU time. While not a general-purpose chain for smart contracts, its usefulness in graphics-heavy projects earns it a firm place among top trending cryptos in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): DAG Speed with Fast Block Inclusion for Practical Builds Kaspa is gaining momentum among developers who value speed and clean structure. Its use of a DAG model allows many blocks to be processed per second with near-instant confirmations. While it doesn’t support EVM contracts, its Proof-of-Work and DAG base make it ideal for projects needing simple scripting and real-time data handling. Kaspa’s strengths include a block-pruning system that avoids data overload and a steady block inclusion design. Builders working on microtransactions, streamlined protocols, or testing new payment flows may find its approach fits well. Kaspa may not replace EVM-based platforms, but it fills a niche in the top trending cryptos in 2025 for quick, low-weight development. Solana (SOL): Fast Smart Contract Support with Lower Network Fees Solana stays relevant in the top trending cryptos in 2025, especially for creators aiming to build apps that demand high speeds and massive output. Its network handles over 65,000 transactions per second through a unique parallel processing method, with low fees and wide smart contract support. Solana’s system uses Rust and C, not Solidity, which can pose a challenge for some developers. But its efficiency often justifies the shift. Solana now offers strong tooling, improved uptime, and a growing base of active developers. For building large-scale platforms in finance, gaming, or media, Solana remains a useful option within top trending cryptos in 2025. Final Remarks! Finding top trending cryptos in 2025 isn’t only about prices or chart patterns. Builders should focus on platforms offering working tools, early testing access, and stable developer support. BlockDAG ranks high here, as its live testnet, Ethereum compatibility, and early-stage traction make it more than just a presale name. Alongside it, Render serves developers in the design and GPU sector, Kaspa supports quick builds with low complexity, and Solana allows full-scale apps with high output needs. For anyone creating real systems, these top trending cryptos in 2025 show strong promise backed by hands-on utility and technical progress.

46041754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746935,1749956858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46041754.jpeg,Cardano Founder teases full XRP integration package,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-founder-teases-full-xrp-integration/,"Charles Hoskinson, the Cardano founder, released new information about the possible integration of XRP and its related features on the Cardano blockchain. Hoskinson replied with a wide-scope plan that is not limited to RLUSD. His comments followed a user’s inquiry about whether the Ripple-backed stablecoin RealUSD (RLUSD) would be available on Cardano. He mentioned that a full “ XRP package ” is on the way, with plans for XRP DeFi integration, support for Lace wallet, “glacier drops,’ and ongoing talks about RealUSD. He did not make a fine point about timing, but his reply confirmed that high-level discussions were taking place. Cardano gears up for XRP integration with RLUSD As soon as RLUSD was mentioned, the cryptocurrency community went into overdrive, with many hoping for information on when they could access the stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain . However, Hoskinson’s reply suggests that RLUSD is part of the bigger plan, which involves all the other Ripple-related assets. One term that emerged with greater prominence was “glacier drops.” While not commonly used in the space, the term refers to a controlled and staggered release of tokens or features — analogous to a focused airdrop effort pegged to product milestones. Lace wallet support is also on the agenda. As Cardano’s official wallet was built emphasizing user experience, Lace’s integration with XRP would streamline access for users looking to manage Ripple-based assets within the Cardano ecosystem. Equally significant is the mention of DeFi. Historically, XRP has had a limited role in decentralized finance. Its integration into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure could unlock new use cases — such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision — potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform. While no final decisions have been made public, Hoskinson’s remarks shed more light on Cardano’s dedication to interoperability, interest in stablecoin adoption, and interest in growing their presence in the DeFi space. Through the integration of RLUSD, XRP DeFi utilities, advanced wallet features, and token drops, Cardano is gearing up to vie for its share of the competitive blockchain ecosystem. If it works, this could be important for Cardano in expanding its ecosystem and offering itself a bit more than it is to an even larger crypto market. Hoskinson proposes strategic investments to grow Cardano’s treasury Hoskinson recently shared insight into what the Cardano community should expect regarding the ecosystem’s decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). He gave the update in an 18-minute-long podcast on X to ecosystem members. According to Hoskinson, the team is considering several approaches to improving and growing the Cardano SWF. He maintained that the goal is to use the fund’s resources to benefit the ecosystem. Hoskinson explained that the decentralized Cardano SWF is similar in principle to how countries like Norway invest national wealth into assets for future benefits. He proposed investing a small portion of the Cardano treasury in different assets. “Could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of a collection of stablecoins … and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin/DeFi?” he asked. The plan aims to mitigate risk, create long-term yield, and reinvest the money into buying back ADA. This sets up Cardano’s Sovereign Wealth Fund to grow the ecosystem and, consequently, the value of ADA as time goes on. Cardano could make relatively easy returns without significantly eating into its core reserves by dedicating a portion of the treasury to Bitcoin and similar assets. When used to acquire ADA, these profits may increase demand and sustain the market price. Charles Hoskinson describes an economic model designed to be self-sustaining for the Cardano community.

After hitting a low on June 5th, the cryptocurrency made a small upward move. However, the momentum since then has been weak and uncertain. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.14. Current Market Situation XRP’s price has managed to hold above its June 5th low, even as many other altcoins have fallen below their recent support levels. This is a positive sign because it shows XRP is holding up slightly better than some of its competitors. But to turn this into a strong upward move, bulls need to step in soon and push the price higher with conviction. Key Resistance and Support Levels Right now, the first important price barrier for XRP is around $2.33. A clean break above this level could mean that buyers are gaining control. If that happens, the next resistance levels to watch are at $2.36, $2.48, and ideally $2.47. These levels could act as short-term targets if the rally continues. On the downside, the key support level to watch would be $1.94 and $1.83. A fall to these levels would hint at weakness and raise concerns about a further drop. What to Expect Next For a stronger bullish trend to begin, XRP needs to show increased momentum and trading volume. If buyers manage to push the price above $2.33 and beyond $2.47, it could open the door for a move towards $2.54 or even higher. However, if the price remains weak and struggles to break above resistance, or worse — falls below $2 — the outlook would turn more bearish. The critical long-term support to watch in that case would be at $1.79. A drop below this would significantly reduce the chances of a quick recovery.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 03:13:35

33767162,[object Object],1749960059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Analyst Drops Bearish Bombshell: Bitcoin To $93,500, Ethereum To $2,100, XRP To $1.6",https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-drops-bearish-bombshell-bitcoin-to-93500-ethereum-to-2100-xrp-to-1-6/,"Bitcoin has continued to hover around the $105,000 price level for the past 24 hours, a level which it has respected for most of the past seven days. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to hold above $2,500, while XRP is also holding its ground above $2.10 within the past 24 hours. Some analysts still expect a resumption of bullish momentum once the current range breaks to the upside, but others have taken a more cautious or outright pessimistic stance. One of such bearish outlooks in recent days came from crypto commentator Warren MUPPET, who shared a forecast of a strong downside correction for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies. Analyst Predicts Crash Scenario For Major Cryptos The broader crypto market appears to be stuck in a consolidation range, with the Fear & Greed Index currently reading 52, which is a neutral sentiment that could easily swing in either direction. According to crypto analyst Warren MUPPET on the social media platform X, this swing will be to the downside. Particularly, the crypto commentator recently posted a blunt list of projected price levels that sent waves through some crypto traders. The post, with no charts or technical context, had simply highlighted the price targets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Fartcoin, and Hype. Despite the lack of technical and and fundamental analysis explanation, the message was clear that a sharp correction could be on the horizon. According to the analyst, Bitcoin will crash from its current price levels to $93,500, Ethereum will crash to $2,100, Fartcoin will crash to $0.68, XRP will crash to $1.6, and Hype will crash to $28. In one of the comments to the original post, the crypto commentator also predicted the possibility of Solana crashing to $85. These numbers might seem extreme to some, but they are not far-fetched. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all crahsed to these price levels just two months ago in April. This gives some credibility to the warning and if sentiment turns negative, a drop to these prices may not be out of the picture. Prolonged Consolidation Could Lead To Price Crash Previous price action data suggests that bearish phases often come up swiftly after prolonged consolidation in high zones. If that plays out again, Bitcoin slipping below $100,000 could quickly escalate into a wider marlet price crash. Also, with Ethereum and XRP also consolidating around their respective resistance levels, the chances of a synchronized following Bitcoin crash below $100,000 can’t be ruled out. Therefore, the bullish/bearish outlook all depends on if Bitcoin can hold above $100,000. If sentiment weakens in the coming days, the analyst’s projections may no longer seem like an exaggeration. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,096, Ethereum is trading at $2,540, XRP is trading at $2.16, while Hype is trading at $42.

This sudden fall created panic among holders, with many unsure whether to sell or wait for a possible recovery. However, the price has now bounced back, gaining 6% in the last 24 hours. Pi Coin is now trading at $0.61. The price dip comes after weeks of little progress from the Pi Core Team. Despite earlier promises of major upgrades and ecosystem development, no significant updates have been delivered. This has frustrated investors and caused the token’s price to stagnate. Can Pi Price Hit $10? Even though Pi Network’s price recently fell below $1, many in the community still believe it could reach $10 one day. Pi Network already has over 70 million registered users (called Pioneers). This is a big number for any cryptocurrency. If even a small part of this community starts using Pi for daily payments, online shopping, or services within the Pi ecosystem, demand for the token could increase — and when demand rises, prices often follow. Right now, most of the mined Pi tokens are still locked or waiting for migration. This means there aren’t many tokens freely available for trading. If the supply remains limited while demand increases through new apps or business partnerships, the price could naturally climb higher over time. Analyst Dr Altcoin said, “For Pi to be practical within the Pi Ecosystem, its price would need to reach at least $10.” Geopolitical Factors Add Pressure Part of the recent crypto market decline can also be linked to growing geopolitical tensions, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. The escalating situation, which has included military strikes and leadership losses, has injected uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Like other altcoins, Pi followed the broader market trend — but some community members have criticized the token for mirroring negative movements without benefiting from bullish ones.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 04:18:33

With the market recalibrating, one project is positioning itself as a standout alternative in the form of Remittix —offering sharper fundamentals, stronger use cases, and far more room to run. Here’s why. XRP price prediction: Is a drop below $2 in the works? XRP’s four-hour chart has shown a bearish reversal head-and-shoulders formation since May 9. If the XRP price fails to reclaim the neckline of $2.33, projected XRP price targets tighten around $2.25. This aligns with the 200-day SMA, and extends to $2.00. Market sentiment has cooled, with bullish momentum fading. Egrag Crypto emphasized $2.30 as must-hold support. A confirmed breakdown could escalate losses, with extended downside targets at $2.15 and potentially $1.60, should sellers take control. Volume trends and price structure point toward a weakening bid side. Unless bulls reclaim technical ground quickly—or if the spot XRP ETF comes to pass—XRP price will continue to face sell-side pressure as bearish headwinds prevail. XRP price fell as low as $2.08 in the past 24 hours. Source: TradingView SUI facing heavy selling pressure Rising Layer-1 blockchain protocol SUI rejected at the 50-day SMA ($3.55), signaling firm resistance and renewed bearish pressure. Now trading near $3.00, the $2.86 support has become a key battleground. A break below this level could expose the pair to a deeper decline toward $2.50, as sellers look to take short-term control. If bulls hold the line at $2.86 and stage a rebound, the price may retest the moving averages. A failure to break above them would only strengthen bearish momentum, raising the odds of another test—and possible breach—of support. Market pressure is rising. The next move will likely define short-term direction. SUI hovers around the key psychological level of $3. Source: TradingView Remittix offers greater upside than XRP and SUI SUI and XRP may face stiff bearish headwinds moving forward—but the smart money is already on the next blue chip in the form of Remittix (RTX). Positioned to revolutionize the $190T cross-border payments industry, Remittix offers seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers without the friction or hidden fees typical of legacy platforms. Its architecture is tailored for both consumers and businesses, offering real-time settlement, staking rewards, and governance participation through its native RTX token. With over $15.7 million raised in presale funding, institutional and retail interest is already signaling strong forward momentum. What sets Remittix apart is scale. While SUI operates within niche verticals, RTX targets a global payments market—broad, essential, and underserved. Its platform aims to serve freelancers, enterprises, and remittance corridors with equal efficiency. With a 2025 price forecast of up to a 600% run in 2025, Remittix offers both utility and asymmetric upside, positioning it as a standout asset in the next market cycle. This isn’t just another token—it’s infrastructure, designed to last. The final word While SUI and HYPE are showing strong growth and market interest in 2025, Remittix presents the best opportunity for investment. Its innovative approach to crypto payments and its growing ecosystem position it for greater success in the coming years. Backed by over $15.7 million in funding thus far, Remittix is one of the few emerging assets with genuine institutional alignment and scalable upside.

Bitcoin was stuck above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens dropped to $3.28 trillion. This article explores the top crypto forecasts of coins like Pi Network (PI), Monero (XMR), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Pi Network price prediction Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi coin has come under pressure in the past few weeks as it plunged to $0.3945 on Friday, down from last month’s high of $1.6567. The token has stabilized a bit and moved to over $0.60 today, a 50% surge. Technicals point to more Pi Network gains as it has formed a triple-bottom pattern at around $0.60. A triple-bottom is made up of three distinct bottoms and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $1.6567. The token is attempting to move above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the MACD and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Pi Network token price will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $1, which is about 61% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.3945 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network forecast. Monero price forecast XMR price chart | Source: TradingView Monero, the biggest privacy-focused coin, has crashed in the past two weeks, erasing some of the gains made earlier this year. The initial gains happened as demand for privacy tokens soared. XMR token retreated from a high of $420 to $315 today as investors booked profits. Monero has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also remains slightly above the 50-day and 100-day EMA. Most importantly, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $301.05. A double-bottom pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, Monero token will likely bounce back as long as it remains above the double-bottom pattern at $301. Such a move will see it rise and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $353, which is about 12% above the current level. A drop below the support at $301 will invalidate the bullish Monero price forecast. Fartcoin price forecast Fartcoin chart | Source: TradingView Fartcoin, a top meme coin on the Solana network , has been one of the most actively traded tokens this year. Its recent surge saw it peak at $1.6520 in May. It then pulled back and reached a low of $0.8715, its lowest point on June 5, and then bounced back to the current $1.20. Fartcoin token remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated and moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the Fartcoin price will likely resume the uptrend, and potentially retest the psychological point at $1.50. A drop below the support at $0.8715 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

On Saturday, an Israeli strike hit the Phase 14 processing plant of the South Pars gas field , causing a major explosion and fire, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The blast forced the shutdown of a nearby production platform. South Pars, located in the Persian Gulf, is the world’s largest gas field and is shared between Iran and Qatar. Iran uses most of its gas domestically. The strike marked a serious shift in the conflict, which began Friday when Israel carried out a series of attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. By targeting energy infrastructure, Israel has now opened a new front in the crisis. The strikes will further cripple Iran’s economy and shake the markets The recent attacks come at a time when Iran is already struggling with severe power outages. Iran has already seen widespread blackouts in recent months, hitting businesses and households. The Iran Chamber of Commerce estimates the economic cost of these outages at around $250 million a day. Though the damage may mainly impact Iran’s internal energy supply, global markets are bracing for more volatility when trading resumes after the weekend. Oil markets had already reacted strongly before this latest attack. U.S. crude prices jumped by as much as 14% on Friday, finishing near $73 per barrel. Experts warn that further attacks could deepen the threat to oil production and shipments in the region. “This is pretty significant,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects Ltd. He added, “We appear to be in an escalatory cycle,” and warned that Israeli forces may continue to strike Iranian energy sites. In a separate incident, a fire also broke out at the Fajr Jam gas plant, another key processing facility in Iran. This plant handles gas from South Pars as well as the Nar and Kangan fields. Tasnim described it as one of the largest facilities of its kind in the country. Goldman Sachs analysts have already raised their short-term oil price forecasts by $2 to $3 a barrel in response to the rising tensions. They noted the potential for oil prices to spike above $100 per barrel if the situation worsens, though their base forecast still expects prices to fall below $60 by the end of the year. “The potential of further escalation in the Middle East implies that the short-term risks to our price forecast are now skewed to the upside,” Goldman analysts, including Daan Struyven, wrote in a recent note.

Despite being in its early phase, the project has already raised over $303 million, placing it side by side with two of 2025’s most watched names, Worldcoin (WLD) and Solana (SOL). While Worldcoin gained a boost from renewed OpenAI ties and Solana trends on speculation around a potential ETF, neither has matched BlockDAG’s steady stream of capital and user growth. BlockDAG is not relying on hype alone. It is attracting users, delivering tools, and progressing ahead of schedule. The real question is whether WLD or SOL can keep pace with what BlockDAG (BDAG) has already rolled out. Solana Shows Promise but Awaits Key Breakout to Confirm Uptrend Solana continues to rank among the most followed coins this cycle, driven by technical setups that favor a bullish breakout. The token displays both a bullish flag and an inverse head-and-shoulders formation, targeting a breakout that could climb to $295. A move above $200 might trigger a potential five to tenfold rally, particularly if the Canary Marinade ETF, scheduled for review on July 24, receives approval and draws in institutional capital. Open interest in SOL increased by 8.3% over 24 hours, with the long-to-short ratio now at 1.67. Analysts like Ali Martinez highlight a cup-and-handle setup that could take Solana to $1,000 in the long run. Yet, all of this remains speculative. Unless Solana clears its psychological resistance, the Solana price trend stays in limbo. That pause gives BlockDAG a lead by delivering concrete outcomes while others wait for signals. Worldcoin Gains on OpenAI News but Still Lacks Independent Traction Worldcoin surged 5.4% on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18 after OpenAI revealed its transition to Google Cloud. This allowed OpenAI to expand beyond Microsoft Azure and sparked interest in its AI capabilities. Since Worldcoin is closely tied to OpenAI through Sam Altman and its focus on decentralized identity, the news drove strong price and volume increases. Trading volume jumped 38% to $208.6 million, while RSI flashed bullish indicators and targets rose between $1.25 and $1.62. Despite the Worldcoin price jump, the rally seems rooted more in association with OpenAI than in independent user growth or real-world utility. As WLD remains tethered to OpenAI’s trajectory, investors who value scalability, autonomy, and native adoption are starting to consider alternatives. BlockDAG presents a much different and more self-sustaining proposition. BlockDAG Breaks $303 Million as Presale Momentum Builds Fast While Worldcoin and Solana await triggers, BlockDAG is moving ahead decisively. The project’s presale has passed the $303 million mark, drawing far more attention than typical for a pre-launch coin. With the official launch price set at $0.05, early buyers stand to gain significantly when the token becomes tradable. For the next six days, the price remains locked at $0.0018 in Batch 29, fueling strong demand. Analysts have forecast returns of up to 10,000x, and some even suggest a long-term target as high as $20. BlockDAG offers more than just speculation. Its dual blockchain and DAG framework allows for parallel block validation, solving key limitations found in older Layer 1 chains. Developers can build using Ethereum tools, thanks to full EVM compatibility. Additionally, its Smart Contract Wizard enables simplified deployment, lowering the barrier for non-technical users. A recent teaser of a US partnership has also stirred discussion, drawing attention from broader cultural and investment circles. This momentum extends beyond crypto, placing BlockDAG at the intersection of mainstream curiosity and blockchain innovation. BlockDAG’s X1 App provides a mobile-first mining system with over 2 million users across more than 100 countries. Through a Proof-of-Engagement model, users mine BDAG by checking in daily, making participation accessible and habit-forming. The app combines gamified elements with social engagement, positioning it not just as a crypto tool but as a scalable acquisition engine. This real-time user growth demonstrates that BlockDAG is not waiting to go live, it is already building a user base that most projects only dream of at this stage. Summing Up While Solana and Worldcoin remain key topics of discussion, BlockDAG is making measurable progress. The Worldcoin price jump is more about OpenAI than WLD’s own traction. The Solana price trend looks technically solid, but still needs ETF decisions and breakout validation. BlockDAG, in comparison, is checking all the boxes. With $303 million raised and the presale price at $0.0018, it’s ahead on execution. Its scalable architecture and mobile mining app are delivering real solutions, not just plans.

The Japanese government confirmed today that the two continued discussing a possible trade agreement. Akazawa also had in-person talks on Friday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for around 70 minutes and with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for 45 minutes. Japan’s PM hopes to talk with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 Summit The Japanese government described the talks on Saturday similarly to Akazawa’s Friday statement, terming the conversation as “very in-depth” and that the two parties explored the possibility of reaching an agreement that would benefit both countries. It added that their Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US President Donald Trump could meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit starting Sunday in Canada, where they hope they can finalize a deal. The country is still in for a 24% tariff rate on their exports starting in July unless it can secure a deal with the US. Tokyo is also pushing to shield its auto industry from a separate 25% US levy. In earlier talks, Japan offered to increase imports of US agricultural goods and review its “non-tariff trade barriers” to American car sales to respond to the concerns of the Trump administration. In addition, the government is mulling to collaborate with the US to secure supply chains of rare earth magnets and semiconductors. So far, China is the primary producer of high-performance rare earth magnets. However, Japan hopes to promote building supply chains with the US without relying on China. Often, rare earth magnets manufacture electric vehicle motors and missile devices. Regarding neodymium magnets, China produces more than 80%, while Japan accounts for only about 15%. The US has been scrambling for ways to deal with China’s dominance and restrictions on rare earths exports, and Japan could very well be the solution the country has been looking for. Trump approved Nippon’s Steel bid for US Steel on Friday US President Donald Trump recently approved Japan’s Nippon Steel’s $ 14.9 billion bid for US Steel. The Japanese company’s offer aroused much criticism and opposition over national security concerns. The order by Trump requires that the merger only go ahead if a deal is signed with the Treasury Department to resolve any national security risks. US Steel and Nippon Steel announced that they had reached a deal, which satisfied a critical requirement for Trump. They cited $11 billion in planned investments by 2028 and commitments on governance, production, and trade. Sources have said that the US government will also receive a golden share, which doesn’t involve an ownership stake. Other reports say some of the top jobs will also be reserved for Americans, and Nippon Steel would also be required to invest $3 billion to build a new mill after 2028. White House spokesman Kush Desai believes the deal will help Pennsylvania retain ownership of US Steel and protect the company as a critical element of the nation’s national and economic security. Japan’s Economy, Trade, and Industry Minister Yoji Moto also expressed confidence that the investment will enhance innovation in Japanese and US steel sectors while deepening their strong bilateral partnership. The merger agreement deadline is June 18, though the companies’ statement did not specify exactly when it will close.

Experts Split,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-at-105k-breakout-or-breakdown-next-experts-split/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?

The trajectory of meme coins proves it’s more than possible. From lighthearted digital jokes to serious investment vehicles, meme tokens have captured the imagination of a new generation of crypto enthusiasts. In a market increasingly driven by community engagement and viral potential, meme coins have transcended novelty and become some of the most watched, most traded, and most celebrated digital assets in the blockchain space. The wave is far from over. With tokens like Bonk, Floki, Brett, Popcat, Cat in a Dog’s World, Neiro, Book of Meme, Turbo, Ponke, and Troller Cat climbing charts and captivating communities, 2025 is poised to become the year of the meme coin evolution. Among these, Troller Cat stands apart with a live presale already drawing investor attention. For those looking to buy TCAT early, this is a critical moment to join and gain maximum perks. Troller Cat is not just riding the meme wave—it’s engineering it. Its features are why it’s consistently ranked among the top 10 meme coins. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Where Viral Culture Meets High-APY Crypto Innovation Troller Cat’s presale launched at a modest $0.000005 per token and has reached Stage 9 with the price rising to $0.00002834. The token will list at $0.0005309, and this momentum translates to an ROI of over 1773.32% from the first stage. Over 1,100 holders have already joined the initiative, raising $250,000 in under a month. With 26 presale stages and the next one poised to surge, the opportunity window narrows. Stage 9 is proving Troller Cat isn’t just a presale—it’s a precision-calibrated entry point into serious ROI. A $5K stake grants over 176.4 million tokens, tracking toward a projected value of $93.6K. Each new stage tightens the margins. Every delay lowers the upside. The setup is ready—will you take the position or miss the momentum? This presale isn’t just structured for hype. With 69% APY staking, a deflationary play-to-earn Game Center, and zero glitches due to a fully audited smart contract, Troller Cat exemplifies presale engineering done right. KYC verification adds trust, while the ability to join with no minimum buy-in—and $25 required only for referrals—makes it accessible. These features mark TCAT as one of the top 10 meme coins with built-in utility and strategic upside. Hold, Earn, Repeat: Troller Cat’s 69% APY Staking Power Troller Cat isn’t just serving up internet chaos—it’s delivering serious earning potential with every token held. While the memes draw you in, the staking rewards make you stay. During the presale, holders can tap into a jaw-dropping 69% APY staking, turning idle $TCAT into a nonstop earning machine. This isn’t fluff or gimmicks—it’s a real strategy designed for long-term impact. Each staked token contributes to a stronger, more stable ecosystem, rewarding commitment and discouraging quick flips. And unlike overinflated reward systems that crash under their own hype, Troller Cat’s staking model is built with balance, precision, and sustainability at its core. The result? A loyal base of holders who aren’t just along for the ride—they’re building wealth as they go. With rewards rolling in passively, participants can focus on enjoying the experience, spreading the word, and watching their stacks grow. In a space full of noise, Troller Cat turns loyalty into leverage—and it pays in more ways than one. 2. Bonk ($BONK): The Fast-Moving Underdog of Solana’s Meme Ecosystem Bonk emerged as Solana’s answer to the Ethereum-based meme coin explosion. With a fair launch and wide airdrop strategy, it instantly captivated thousands of wallets and created a grassroots movement that spread like wildfire. Built with speed and low fees, Bonk complements Solana’s infrastructure and delivers lightning-fast transactions ideal for micro-payments and community engagement. Bonk’s core appeal lies in decentralization and accessibility. It lacks a centralized development team and is entirely community-driven. The token experienced wild price volatility in 2023 but gained a reputation for resilience and a loyal user base. Analysts view Bonk as one of the few Solana-native meme coins capable of matching Ethereum-based contenders in both scale and sentiment. Bonk made this list for its strategic launch model, Solana integration, and ability to rally decentralized momentum, proving it’s a top 10 meme coin candidate by both speed and spirit. 3. Floki ($FLOKI): A Norse Legend Reimagined for the Blockchain Age Floki combines Norse mythology with DeFi infrastructure, creating an immersive metaverse-backed ecosystem. Unlike traditional meme coins, Floki isn’t just about the brand—it’s also about the build. From FlokiFi (its DeFi arm) to Valhalla (a metaverse play-to-earn game), the project expands utility into both entertainment and finance. Floki’s marketing is relentless, with global campaigns seen on public transport, stadiums, and major billboards. Its DAO governance, NFT marketplace, and charity arm showcase its commitment to innovation and social impact. Floki balances humor and high-function with surprising effectiveness. This project makes the top 10 meme coins list due to its cross-sector ecosystem, brand recognition, and focus on long-term scalability. 4. Brett ($BRETT): A Comedic Take with Cutting-Edge Ambition Brett is both a meme and a message. Launched as a tribute to the irreverent side of crypto culture, Brett quickly distinguished itself with community-led initiatives and bold, edgy branding. It doesn’t aim to be polished—it aims to be loud, real, and impossible to ignore. What Brett lacks in formal whitepapers is transparent governance, meme-friendly engagement, and bold takes on the future of crypto culture. Brett is unapologetically himself, and investors appreciate that. It’s building partnerships with meme-centric NFT communities, bolstering both relevance and reach. Brett earns its place as a top 10 meme coin by turning cultural commentary into crypto capital. 5. Popcat ($POPCAT): The Meme King with Viral Kinetics Popcat is one of the most recognizable meme coins, inspired by a viral image and built on pure community momentum. While many meme tokens rely on sustained marketing, Popcat thrived through the simplicity of its name and an instantly viral appeal. It started as a token of fun, but quickly snowballed into a broader project with staking, NFTs, and gamified community participation. What sets Popcat apart is its cultural stickiness. The token’s memeability remains its primary strength, and its ability to reinvent through digital culture makes it endlessly relevant. Its roadmap includes interactive gaming utilities and cross-platform meme integration. Popcat is on this list because of its sheer viral power and potential to evolve into a gamified, utility-rich ecosystem—a true contender among the top 10 meme coins. 6. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW): A Parody Turned Powerplay Cat in a Dog’s World is exactly what it sounds like—a contrarian meme coin pushing back against the dominance of dog-themed tokens. It leans into its feline identity with humorous branding while simultaneously rolling out serious crypto mechanics, including auto-burn, reflections, and community-funded liquidity pools. Its branding is wildly creative, and its contrarian concept appeals to those tired of “yet another dog coin.” With creative marketing campaigns and regular token burns, the project has maintained a strong community base while ensuring deflationary value gains. This coin made the top 10 meme coins list for reimagining meme coin narratives with sharp wit and smart economics. 7. Neiro ($NEIRO): The AI-Driven Meme Marvel Neiro stands at the junction of AI and memes, a futuristic combination that has fueled its rapid rise. It integrates artificial intelligence with crypto rewards, enabling users to generate memes through a neural network and earn tokens based on community votes. This use case is unique in the meme coin landscape. Its growth has been methodical, supported by regular community engagement, algorithmic token burns, and strategic partnerships with AI incubators. Neiro also incorporates gamified staking and a machine learning-backed rarity system for its NFT line. Neiro earns its place for pioneering the AI + meme coin hybrid model, making it a standout in the top 10 meme coins of 2025. 8. Book of Meme ($BOME): Crypto Lore as Asset Class Book of Meme is a cultural archive as much as it is a digital token. It aims to catalog and tokenize meme history on the blockchain, giving nostalgic and iconic memes their own traceable value. Each meme becomes an NFT chapter in the blockchain’s ongoing story. This coin resonates with collectors and meme historians, turning pop culture into a monetized database. The token’s roadmap includes a publishing platform, meme auctions, and educational meme modules for Web3 literacy. Book of Meme deserves a place among the top 10 meme coins because it is highly original in its blend of entertainment, education, and crypto-native art. 9. Turbo ($TURBO): The Ultra-Fast Meme Coin with Gasless Ambition Turbo lives up to its name. With a focus on blazing-fast transactions and zero gas fees through Layer-2 integrations, Turbo is positioning itself as the efficient meme coin for the next-gen blockchain. It utilizes smart routing and on-chain compression to deliver one of the smoothest transaction experiences. The project is highly technical for a meme coin, emphasizing throughput and scalability while keeping its branding loose and accessible. It has also started bridging across EVM-compatible chains, boosting interoperability and attracting cross-chain traders. Turbo is listed among the top 10 meme coins for showing that speed and scalability can merge with meme culture without compromising performance. 10. Ponke ($PONKE): The Community-Fueled Underdog With Tactical Fire Ponke began as an inside joke and evolved into a strategic, community-driven movement. It operates on a frictionless yield-generation protocol, redistributing tokens with every trade to holders and burn wallets. What began as humor turned into tokenomics brilliance. Ponke’s secret weapon is its highly engaged Discord community and strategic timing around cultural events. It often launches meme-driven campaigns during major crypto news cycles to harness trending attention. Its agility and community-first approach give it unique staying power. Ponke stands strong among the top 10 meme coins for transforming humor into organized momentum and token-based economics. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top 10 meme coins to watch in 2025 include Troller Cat , Bonk, Floki, Brett, Popcat, Cat in a Dog’s World, Neiro, Book of Meme, Turbo, and Ponke.

The idea behind the feature is to be used for functional Web3 identifiers – anchors for Pi-powered apps, services, and storefronts. What Are pi Domains? Pi Network’s team described the .pi Domains Auction as a platform-level utility that “harnesses the collective resources of the Pi community and Open Network’s external connectivity to further Pi’s role in real-world commerce and digital interactions.” It’s supposed to expand the Pi ecosystem through strong participation from Pioneers, businesses, and developers. According to the team, it has seen over 100,000 bids within less than a week after its announcement (and over 200,000 in total), which shows encouraging signs of adoption and real engagement. .pi domains function similarly to traditional ones, acting as unique digital identifiers by enabling businesses, apps, and individuals to establish a clear online identity or digital storefront in a Web3 social network. They are created to operate within and outside the Pi Browser, as other wallets and browsers have the option to integrate the feature over time, similar to how other crypto-based domains work. In terms of Chrome and Safari compatibility, all .pi domains will work through the ‘.pinet.com’ extension. The team said all proceeds from this function will be “used to support the Pi ecosystem, including developer programs and events.” Recent Updates The latest on the .pi Domains Auction included two main updates and some bonuses. The first is an interface dedicated to showing statistics in real-time. Users can view domains with the most bids, the highest price, and the most recent trending bids alongside other information. This allows them to review a transparent snapshot of how the Auction is progressing and where the highest activity is occurring. The second update is the inclusion of .pi Domains Auction in the Pi App, following its initial release through the Pi Wallet, which enabled unique feature deployments, such as the stats page and email notifications. The bonus updates: refinement of the bidding interface to provide a cleaner and smoother experience; more Pionners can see and participate in the Auction as the Mainnet wallet accessibility has been “significantly” expanded; and lastly, the option to receive email notifications about updates for individual domains via the Settings tab.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $11.29, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $18.71 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price surged by 0.9% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.18 and $2.40, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for June 15 shows that the current value of Near price rose to the $2.25 mark as bulls triggered a correction. However, sellers are attempting to defend this upward move. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR faces bullish volatility toward $2.3 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the near protocol price trades in a recovery trend since declining toward $2.1. Buyers are now aiming for a strong push above $2.3 to maintain the recovery rally, defending a drop below $2.2. NEAR/USDT 1-day price chart The technical indicators suggest a drop in bullish momentum as NEAR previously declined toward $2.1, raising concerns of a short-term bearish rally. Moreover, the MACD is bearish at -0.022 units and suggests low buying demand. The EMAs are returning towards the mean position, and the latest data shows that indicator shows declining bearish pressure. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 39 from the 70.00 index level; though, it stills hints at bullish reversal. The wide Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility, indicating that the $2.3 level may not hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has met strong resistance at the $2.60 mark and the following selloff suggests high bearish momentum. If the buyers fail to defend $2.18 support, NEAR may see a freefall below that level.
