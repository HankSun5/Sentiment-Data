Speaking at the XRPL Apex event, Garlinghouse offered a forecast that, within the next five years, XRPL could facilitate as much as 14% of the total transaction volume currently processed by SWIFT, the widely used global interbank messaging system. Garlinghouse emphasized that the real challenge in cross-border payments lies in liquidity, not messaging. He pointed out that while SWIFT remains essential for moving information between financial institutions, its primary function is ultimately to support the transfer of actual monetary value. He argued that blockchain platforms like XRPL are better positioned to streamline this function through native liquidity and real-time settlement capabilities. Quantifying the 14% Projection Following the CEO’s statement, a user on X known as “XRPMillionaire” used xAI’s Grok to break down the implications. Based on SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion in annual transaction volume, 14% would represent $21 trillion processed by XRPL each year. This would amount to roughly $58 billion in daily transactions. If this market share were to be achieved gradually over five years, it would imply a steady increase of 2.8% annually, or approximately $4.2 trillion processed per year. Market Reactions and Price Estimates These projections have led to renewed optimism within the XRP community, especially regarding the potential for long-term value appreciation. Despite XRP trading at around $2.13 and still sitting below its all-time high set several years ago, many investors and analysts now see room for significant price increases if such utility materializes. Several valuation models have emerged in response to this outlook. One analysis projects a potential XRP price of $12 if liquidity demand rises in proportion to transaction volume. This estimate assumes the token would be used and recycled approximately 30 times per year, necessitating a liquidity base of around $700 billion to support the full $21 trillion annual volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other forecasts, which account for increasing institutional interest and the speculative nature of the crypto market, suggest that XRP could trade between $18 and $24 under favorable market conditions. However, some observers have called for a broader examination of the competitive landscape. If XRP were to capture 14% of SWIFT’s total volume, the question remains: which platforms or technologies will handle the remaining 86%? Projects such as Chainlink have already begun working directly with SWIFT, positioning themselves as potential players in the evolving financial infrastructure. While XRP’s capacity to handle trillions in annual payments remains speculative, Garlinghouse’s remarks and the subsequent analysis have provided concrete figures for what such a scenario might entail. The discussion now turns to whether XRP can effectively scale to meet these expectations and how it will compete in a landscape that is becoming increasingly crowded with blockchain-based solutions.

Worldcoin (WLD) is also gaining traction after crossing $1.18, helped by strong market volume. But beyond the charts, another name is turning heads for a different reason. BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just focused on price action—it’s building something broader. A large-scale US sponsorship is rumored to be in motion, and if confirmed, it could make BlockDAG one of the most widely recognized projects before even listing. The move would not only boost trust and visibility; it could bring BDAG into everyday conversation across countries and industries. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025, this mix of scale and timing is becoming hard to overlook. SUI Price Climbs Past $3.40 on ETF Buzz and Growing Demand The SUI price performance is seeing a solid recovery. From June 9 to June 11, SUI gained 7.9%, climbing back to $3.40. A key reason for the lift was Nasdaq’s 19b-4 filing to list a spot SUI ETF with 21Shares. That announcement helped push SUI through the $3.55 resistance line, turning it into support. Volume surged to $930 million in 24 hours, and SUI’s Total Value Locked now stands at $1.77 billion, showing strong usage in DeFi and gaming. The SUI price also broke out of a descending channel, with EMA crossovers and bullish momentum supporting targets of $4.50 and above if the trend continues. WLD Moves Past $1.18 as Breakout Signals Grow Worldcoin (WLD) posted a 5.4% rise on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18. This came just as Google Cloud’s partnership with OpenAI made headlines, helping boost trader interest. Volume jumped by 38% to $208 million. Technicals also support the move. WLD has cleared its 50-period EMA and is now sitting in a breakout range between $1.05 and $1.15. The MACD is signaling strength, and RSI near 62 adds to the bullish case. Chart patterns show a rising wedge and triangle formations that point to a potential surge. If WLD clears $1.20–$1.24, targets between $1.28 and $1.60 could come into play. Support at $1.05–$1.10 remains strong, making this one of the better-positioned breakout plays at the moment. BlockDAG’s US Push Could Redefine What a Presale Can Do BlockDAG has already raised $303 million and sold 22.6 billion coins. It’s currently in Batch 29 of its presale, priced at $0.0276. Those who bought during Batch 1 have already earned a 2,660% return. But the latest twist? A special extended offer now allows users to buy at just $0.0018 for six more days. With the launch price set at $0.05, this window offers a potential ROI of 2,678%. That alone is a major draw. But it’s what’s happening outside the price chart that’s capturing attention. A rumored US-based sponsorship deal could soon take BDAG’s reach global. Widespread branding and televised exposure could turn BDAG into a name recognized even beyond the crypto world. Most projects chase attention after they launch. BlockDAG is flipping that model by building mass appeal in advance. It’s already backed by a CertiK audit, is EVM-compatible, and supports zero gas fees through its DAG-based infrastructure. Its X1 Miner app has attracted over 2 million users in more than 150 countries. Features like Buyer Battles and referral streaks make it not just easy to use, but addictive. BlockDAG isn’t just checking boxes. It’s rewriting how crypto connects with people. If the sponsorship is confirmed, BDAG won’t just launch, it’ll arrive already embedded in culture. That’s what makes it such a strong pick for anyone watching for the best crypto to buy right now Final Thoughts SUI is making progress with renewed institutional interest and a push from ETF news. WLD is showing signs of breaking higher on technical strength and narrative momentum. But for those looking beyond chart patterns, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for something more powerful. With $303 million raised, a special $0.0018 entry point, over 22.6 billion coins sold, and a listing price of $0.05, the upside is clear. The 2,678% ROI window is only open for six more days. Add to that a US sponsorship on the horizon, and BDAG is shaping up to be a serious player. It’s not just another presale. It’s an early-stage opportunity with real-world branding and user traction, setting a new standard for what crypto launches can achieve. For those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG may already be leading the way.

As the broader crypto space navigates renewed attention and shifting capital flows, select assets are standing out not for noise, but for solid infrastructure and development momentum. Among the top cryptos to invest in for short term, Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Cosmos are leading discussions across the space. With Qubetics offering a truly integrated multi-chain experience through its application, and the added traction around its token presale, this project has become a critical contender for short-term upside. Meanwhile, XRP continues to demonstrate its relevance through international payment corridors and growing adoption among traditional finance institutions. At the same time, Cosmos is rapidly advancing blockchain interoperability, attracting developer interest and on-chain liquidity. These three digital assets are building strong foundations for immediate relevance in the current cycle, making them standout picks among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Qubetics Multi‑Chain Wallet: The Future of Web3 User Experience At the center of Qubetics ‘ appeal is a breakthrough in digital asset management—the Qubetics Wallet. This product is designed as a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with support across mobile and desktop operating systems. As a key component of Qubetics’ broader ecosystem, this application empowers users to manage, transact, and interact with assets across major blockchain networks from a single interface. In a fragmented environment where most users juggle multiple wallets or custodial platforms, Qubetics offers an unprecedented level of utility. The wallet supports native $TICS tokens and is compatible with iOS, Android, and web-based systems. From small business operators handling cross-border payments in stablecoins to NFT creators selling digital collectibles across marketplaces, Qubetics provides seamless, secure access with no dependency on third parties. As digital asset adoption increases globally, the demand for self-custodial, interoperable tools will only rise. Qubetics is positioning itself at the center of that trend, building real-world use for its application, and validating its place among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term Gains Qubetics has officially reached the final stretch of its public token sale, entering Stage 37 with strong momentum. Priced at $0.3370, the Qubetics presale has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 515 million $TICS tokens to a growing community of 27,900+ holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining at this final price, the window to secure entry before the listing is quickly narrowing. Once the presale concludes, $TICS will list at $0.40—offering a built-in 20% return to those who join now. What makes this presale even more strategic is Qubetics’ updated tokenomics: a dramatic supply cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion and a public allocation increase to 38.55%, reinforcing both scarcity and decentralization. With this balance of financial upside and community-driven design, Qubetics is rapidly being positioned as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term performance. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale rate. At $0.3370, that amount secures around 14,837 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this holding immediately rises to $5,934—a gain of $934 before any post-launch appreciation. For those aiming at more aggressive returns, projections ranging between $5 to $10 per token suggest that same $5,000 could scale up to as much as $74,000–$148,000 during the next market cycle. This combination of immediate ROI and high upside potential is why Qubetics is now being recognized as the best crypto presale currently live—and why it’s dominating discussions around the top cryptos to invest in for short term growth. XRP: Expanding Institutional Utility in Global Payments XRP continues to gain relevance as a solution for institutional-grade cross-border transfers. Its utility-driven design enables near-instant settlements, low fees, and minimal counterparty risk—factors increasingly valued by banks, fintech firms, and payment processors. The XRP Ledger is also integrating smart contract capabilities, allowing tokenized assets and programmable finance to live directly on the chain without requiring external solutions. Recent developments have further solidified XRP’s case as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Its presence in Asia-Pacific payment channels is expanding, and partnerships with financial platforms have increased XRP’s daily volume across regulated corridors. Regulatory clarity is also improving, providing a more favorable outlook for adoption in regions that previously held back institutional engagement. As financial platforms scale up the use of on-chain tools, XRP remains well-positioned to serve both compliance-driven needs and next-generation payment architecture. Cosmos: Redefining Blockchain Interoperability with IBC Cosmos is one of the most compelling infrastructure-layer projects making waves in today’s market, due in large part to its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Cosmos enables secure, standardized communication between independent chains, solving one of crypto’s most persistent technical challenges. The architecture allows sovereign blockchains to interact without sacrificing scalability or governance, creating a truly interoperable network of networks. Recent updates to Cosmos Hub and its expanding validator set are drawing attention from both DeFi builders and application-layer protocols. Interchain accounts, smart routing, and shared security features now allow protocols to operate across ecosystems more efficiently. As a result, protocols that once relied on Ethereum or Solana for liquidity and composability are beginning to consider Cosmos for its flexibility and development-ready environment. This unique positioning places Cosmos comfortably within the top cryptos to invest in for short term, particularly for those tracking growth in cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. Conclusion Qubetics, XRP, and Cosmos each present a unique value proposition for short-term participants seeking informed exposure. Qubetics stands out with its web3 aggregator model and a high-impact Qubetics presale, offering structured growth and compelling ROI scenarios. XRP continues to lead the institutional payment narrative through expanding real-world partnerships and regulatory momentum. Cosmos is delivering on its promise of true cross-chain operability, attracting forward-thinking protocols and community members alike. Among all available opportunities, these three digital assets earn their place on the shortlist of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Participants seeking immediate utility and future scalability should strongly consider joining this best crypto presale while opportunity remains.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00006717 to $0.00007676. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000125 with an average price of $0.00012. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine.

Bonk price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.00001468 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.42 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators favor sellers, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000125, which is approximately 691% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its value decreased to $0.00001468. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent depreciation. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000020. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000125 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

The ruling was issued on Wednesday by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and stems from a long-running digital asset fraud scheme involving the fraudulent sale of a virtual currency known as My Big Coin (MBC). The court’s decision includes a $19.3 million civil monetary penalty and an additional $6.4 million in restitution for customers who were deceived by misleading claims about the coin’s value and backing. According to the CFTC’s official press release , from January 2014 to June 2017, the defendants falsely promoted MBC as a fully functional digital currency backed by gold and actively traded on established platforms. In reality, the currency lacked any such support or market presence. Over $6 million was collected from at least 28 customers under pretenses, while the funds were largely misappropriated by co-defendant Randall Crater, who was previously convicted and sentenced to more than eight years in prison for his central role in the scheme. The court’s latest order resolves the commodities regulator’s civil enforcement claims against Gillespie, Roche, and the two Nevada-based My Big Coin companies. It also imposes a permanent trading ban on the defendants, barring them from participating in any CFTC-regulated markets or registering with the agency. Crater, the primary orchestrator of the fraud, was earlier sentenced in a separate criminal case and ordered to forfeit and repay more than $7.6 million In a statement, the agency said. “The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.” The post Court Slaps My Big Coin: Founders Hit With $25.8M Penalty for Defrauding Crypto Investors appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 21:32:27

Industry experts have highlighted how this technical upgrade could benefit digital assets like XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM). XRP and XLM are designed to work well with modern systems. Experts say they could become a larger part of global payments and transform how money moves worldwide. Global Financial Systems Are Moving to ISO 20022 Standard ISO 20022 allows financial institutions to send payment information clearly and in a structured. It improves data quality, increases transparency, and helps systems across countries collaborate more easily. In a video shared on X, the payments company Stronghold showed how it is using ISO 20022 along with blockchain technology . A company spokesperson explained that this combination improves how money is moved and makes the process more reliable and efficient. Stronghold is already using ISO 20022 messaging in real financial projects. This shows that blockchain and traditional systems can work together, rather than compete. Notably, it was revealed that all Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments moved to ISO 20022 in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced plans to adopt the standard in July. This move will replace the outdated Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM). Meanwhile, SWIFT has announced that it will fully transition to ISO 20022 by November. This global shift is poised to change how traditional and digital financial systems work together. XRP and XLM Are Built for This Change It was spotlighted that digital assets like XRP and XLM are better suited to connect with banks and payment systems. These digital currencies are fast, low-cost , and built to follow rules and standards, making them a good match for ISO 20022-based systems. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also recognises XRP and XLM as digital assets with strong potential to play key roles in future financial networks. As more banks switch to ISO 20022, they may turn to these for faster, safer, and cheaper payments. Stronghold Taps Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger for Real-World Use In a separate video clip , Stronghold’s CEO, Tammy Camp, explained that the company uses tools like Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger to link fiat money with digital systems. These technologies help bridge traditional and blockchain-based finance. They are connected through simple APIs, allowing different platforms to communicate and work smoothly. This setup helps Stronghold move money between banks and blockchain networks in real time. It also shows how XRP and XLM can support regular financial services without causing disruption.

The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Trump’s Token Windfall According to the disclosure, Trump’s income line reads “$57,437,927.” It doesn’t say if he sold tokens, earned staking rewards, or used another method. But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details The disclosure also notes his past digital ventures. He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

BlockDAG, now in batch 29 of its presale, has raised more than $302 million directly from the public. There were no hedge funds, no private rounds, no seed investors—just organic momentum powered by retail users. While major chains like Ethereum and Solana depend on insider funding, BlockDAG has chosen a community-first path. This is more than a presale. It’s a full rejection of the old model. And the numbers show it’s working. This is truly the people’s crypto. No VC Funding, No Privileges — Just Genuine Demand BlockDAG stands out not just because of the amount raised, but because of how it raised it. Most big projects depend on private sales backed by Silicon Valley and hedge funds. BlockDAG opened its doors only to the public. There were no special discounts for insiders or influencers. No early unlocks for private buyers. Everyone joined on the same terms with full transparency. This removes the usual advantage held by big funds, putting community first. The public responded strongly. With over $302 million raised purely from retail support, BlockDAG reached a level of momentum that many VC-backed projects never achieve. Ethereum and Solana: Built by Few, Owned by Few To see why BlockDAG is different, consider the usual model. Ethereum’s early supply heavily favored insiders and developers, giving them large long-term gains. Solana also benefited from big VC backers like a16z and Alameda, creating wide gaps between public buyers and early insiders. This VC-driven setup shaped today’s market—powerful chains controlled by a few, with latecomers often priced out of meaningful returns. While marketed as decentralized, their token distributions tell a different story. BlockDAG changes that story. The People’s Chain: Powered by $302 Million in Public Support Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG has sold over 22.6 billion coins. Its active community engages publicly on Telegram, Discord, and through the X1 mining app, which has more than 1.5 million users worldwide. The X1 app lets anyone mine BDAG coins from their smartphones, creating a peer-to-peer, scalable onboarding method without needing institutional backing. This grassroots approach is succeeding. Rather than chasing institutional interest or hype, BlockDAG grows from real user activity—no boardrooms, no private deals, just people. A New Chapter for 2025: Community Capital Over Venture Capital Crypto is shifting. Users want chains without hidden power behind “decentralization.” Many claim to be open but block access through high fees, opaque governance, or limited early entry. BlockDAG breaks this pattern. This isn’t a token promising “community” while serving VC exits. It’s a network funded by everyday users, shown in real time by presale growth and app engagement. Supporters aren’t betting on hype—they’re building the future. Ethereum’s power still rests with whales and Layer-2 intermediaries. Solana leans on ETFs and institutional interest. BlockDAG has 1.5 million phone miners spreading the word organically. Why BlockDAG Is Ahead While others depend on big partnerships and VC money, BlockDAG sticks to execution: Over $302 million raised with zero VC backing 1.5 million+ active X1 miners 22.6 billion+ coins sold Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276 Tools and apps live before exchange listings BlockDAG isn’t aiming to be another “Ethereum killer” or a meme fad. It builds user-level utility first and scales organically. Its batch presale rewards early supporters fairly, with transparent demand-driven pricing and no artificial scarcity or hidden unlocks. Final Word: Crypto Needs Users, Not Kings The market doesn’t need another Solana or Ethereum. What it truly needs is a project that reflects the people who support it, use it daily, and believe in its future. BlockDAG shows what happens when the gatekeepers are removed, allowing the public to take the lead. This approach raises more than just funds—it builds lasting trust and a genuine community. While other projects chase headlines and institutional deals, BlockDAG focuses on steady, organic growth with real users at the center. This foundation positions it strongly for long-term success and sustainability in crypto market.

AI chips are currently being positioned as the backbone of the next wave of global computing and defense technologies. Every disruption in supply chains matters for companies intending to capitalize on this technology, and Taiwan is standing firmly in the way of China’s innovation. Taiwan rolls out export ban on China Taiwan has blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) and restricted both companies’ access to crucial chip-building technologies. The decision was published by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. Under the new rules, both Huawei and SMIC, along with several of their subsidiaries in Russia, Japan, and Germany, have been added to an updated “strategic high-tech commodities entity list,” which requires them to have government approval for any Taiwanese company to export goods or technologies to them. Taiwan’s updated restrictions specifically target the infrastructure and materials necessary for advanced chip production, including plant construction technologies and manufacturing equipment. According to a Bloomberg report in 2023, this restriction will compromise Huawei and SMIC’s ability to continue developing their network of covert chip plants. The network of chips is located across southern China and has reportedly been receiving support from some Taiwanese companies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s most advanced chipmaker, previously ceased business with Huawei in 2020 in compliance with U.S. export restrictions. Now, the rest of Taiwan’s high-tech industry will be expected to follow suit under domestic law. This may halt Huawei and SMIC’s efforts to replicate or replace the kind of high-performance chips that Taiwan exports to firms like Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions disrupt chip markets In early 2025, Taiwan’s newly inaugurated President, Lai Ching-te, made headlines for describing China as a “foreign hostile force.” Lai’s administration also launched a suite of measures aimed at countering Beijing’s infiltration tactics and its political influence operations on the island. Beijing has repeatedly asserted that Taiwan is part of its sovereign territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve what it calls a “peaceful reunification.” It appears that, due to the unlikelihood of outright military conflict in the short term, Taiwan and China are escalating their tensions via the tech industry. Both Huawei and SMIC have spent years trying to work around the export bans of the United States and its allied countries. In 2023, the companies stunned U.S. lawmakers with a surprise 7-nanometer chip, made entirely in China. But analysts have since questioned the scalability and efficiency of the chip, especially now that the companies lack consistent access to foreign equipment and materials. Neither Huawei nor SMIC has commented at the time of reporting. The Taiwanese government did not make an official public announcement either. The listing was only revealed through changes posted on an official website.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 22:15:35

While some market participants remain convinced that altcoin season—a period when Bitcoin is outpaced by the majority of alternative coins in the crypto market—is underway, others remain unfazed, certain that altcoins will continue to bleed . Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson is part of the former group, whose sentiments about the altcoin market are more bullish than bearish. In a recent “ask me anything” live session on YouTube, the Cardano boss responded to a viewer who quizzed him on the state of the altcoin market, particularly curious to know if altcoin season was “cancelled for 2025.” Maintaining optimism for the months ahead, Hoskinson remarked that July and the months preceding it could see altcoins record a notable price run.”The second half of 2025 is going to be great for altcoins,” Hoskinson asserted. Three altcoins are going head-to-head against Bitcoin Interestingly, Bitcoin appears to be recovering quickly after failing to sustain momentum above the $110,000 price mark. The new development indicates a build-up of buying pressure likely triggered by renewed interest from market players. While this could validate the sentiment that the leading cryptocurrency will continue to outperform altcoins, alternative coins could also very possibly secure larger gains in the long term. Despite sustaining mild intra-day losses, three altcoins have outpaced Bitcoin over the last 7 days. Ether, SOL, and DOGE are leading what looks like an altcoin comeback. While Bitcoin, currently trading at $105,516 at press time, has only managed to sustain 3.87% in gains over the last 7-days, ETH, SOL and DOGE are up 7.94%, 6.10%, and 5.65% respectively.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|SHIB|SHIBA INU|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:25:29

As if to make up for Q1’s underwhelming performance, Ether bulls have been up and working of late, with the price value of $3,000 appearing more attainable in the near term. Among other factors, the rise in Ethereum’s open interest rate presents a bullish signal for market participants. Notably, Ethereum’s Open Interest—the total number of outstanding (open) contracts yet to be settled—has hit a new all-time high, exceeding $40 billion for the first time. This new development is especially remarkable for Ethereum, as high open interest typically indicates a rise in market activity and liquidity, suggesting heightened enthusiasm amongst market participants.

These investors accumulated during consolidation and now will potentially form a strong support zone.” Glassnode wrote, adding that ETH is well on its way to $3,420 if the $2,700 and $2,760 support levels hold up strongly.

Αυτό ακριβώς έρχεται να κάνει η Shopify από τις 12 Ιουνίου 2025, συνεργαζόμενη με την Coinbase για να φέρει το stablecoin USDC στον βωμό του παγκόσμιου ηλεκτρονικού εμπορίου. Η αρχή θα γίνει σε ένα περιορισμένο αριθμό ατόμων, αλλά σύντομα εκατομμύρια καταστήματα που χρησιμοποιούν το Shopify Payments θα μπορούν να δέχονται USDC μέσω του Base του γρήγορου, φθηνού και ασφαλούς δικτύου της Coinbase πάνω στο Ethereum . Στόχος; Πιο απλές, πιο οικονομικές και πιο παγκόσμιες πληρωμές με τη δύναμη των crypto. Χαρακτηριστικά και οφέλη για τους εμπόρους και πελάτες Με τη νέα αυτή δυνατότητα, το να πληρώνεις με κρυπτονομίσματα γίνεται πιο απλό από ποτέ. Οι πελάτες θα μπορούν να ολοκληρώνουν τις αγορές τους πληρώνοντας με USDC, ένα ψηφιακό «δολάριο» που παραμένει σταθερό στην αξία του. Από την άλλη πλευρά, οι έμποροι θα συνεχίσουν να λαμβάνουν τα χρήματά τους στο τοπικό τους νόμισμα, χωρίς περίπλοκες μετατροπές, win-win! Και για να κάνει την εμπειρία ακόμα καλύτερη, η Shopify σχεδιάζει να προσφέρει και 1% επιστροφή χρημάτων στους πελάτες που επιλέγουν να πληρώσουν με USDC, ένα έξτρα bonus που αναμένεται να ενεργοποιηθεί αργότερα μέσα στο 2025. Από τεχνικής πλευράς, όλο αυτό βασίζεται σε ένα ανοικτό κώδικα που σχεδίασαν μαζί Shopify και Coinbase. Αυτός ο κώδικας σκοπεύει να δώσει λύσει σε ζητήματα που αφορούν καθυστερημένες χρεώσεις και υπολογισμό φόρων, μέχρι και διαχείριση επιστροφών. Όλα είναι ενσωματωμένα στο υπάρχον σύστημα παραγγελιών, χωρίς επιπλέον κόπο για τον έμπορο. Γιατί η Shopify εμπιστεύτηκε το Base της Coinbase Όταν η Shopify έψαχνε την κατάλληλη υποδομή για να φέρει τις crypto πληρωμές στο παιχνίδι, το Base της Coinbase ξεχώρισε αμέσως. Γιατί; Επειδή είναι γρήγορο, οικονομικό και ασφαλές. Το Base αποτελεί μια λύση Layer-2 πάνω στο Ethereum και μπορεί να διαχειρίζεται πολύ περισσότερες συναλλαγές με πολύ χαμηλότερα κόστη. Αυτό το κάνει ιδανικό για χρήση σε μία τεράστια ηλεκτρονική πλατφόρμα όπως η Shopify, όπου κάθε δευτερόλεπτο και κάθε σεντ μετράει. Κανείς πελάτης δεν θέλει καθυστερήσεις ή έξτρα χρεώσεις και το Base προσφέρει ακριβώς αυτή την εμπειρία. Πέραν από το κομμάτι της τεχνολογίας, η Shopify δείχνει ξεκάθαρα ότι θέλει να προωθήσει το Web3 στο λιανικό εμπόριο. Και με τα stablecoins όπως το USDC να γίνονται πλέον καθημερινό εργαλείο για πληρωμές, το timing δεν θα μπορούσε να είναι καλύτερο. USDC στο Checkout; Δες με ποιο πορτοφόλι το κάνεις πράξη Κι αφού οι πληρωμές με USDC γίνονται πλέον mainstream, το επόμενο φυσικό βήμα είναι να έχεις και το κατάλληλο πορτοφόλι για να τα φυλάς! Εδώ έρχεται το Best Wallet , ένα ασφαλές και εύχρηστο πορτοφόλι για τα κρυπτονομίσματά σου. Τι είναι; ένα mobile app που σου δίνει τον πλήρη έλεγχο των crypto σου, με πλήρη διαφάνεια, χωρίς μεσάζοντες και χωρίς κρυφές παγίδες. Υποστηρίζει πάνω από 1.000 νομίσματα από 60+ blockchains, και σου επιτρέπει να τα ανταλλάσσεις εύκολα μέσω του ενσωματωμένου DEX. Και αν δεν έχεις crypto; Μπορείς να αγοράσεις με κάρτα ή τραπεζικό έμβασμα! Είναι δωρεάν, γρήγορο και φτιαγμένο για όσους θέλουν απλότητα, ασφάλεια και ανωνυμία! Το μέλλον των Stablecoins στο ηλεκτρονικό εμπόριο Μέχρι πρόσφατα, τα stablecoins, όπως το USDC ήταν απλώς ένα εργαλείο για όσους ασχολούνται με το crypto trading, όμως τον τελευταίο χρόνο η προσφορά τους αυξήθηκε κατά 54% και πλέον έγιναν κομμάτι των καθημερινών συναλλαγών. Και δεν μιλάμε μόνο για νεοφυείς επιχειρήσεις του Web3: μεγάλα ονόματα του χώρου όπως η PayPal και η Grab έχουν ήδη ενσωματώσει τα stablecoins στις υπηρεσίες τους για πληρωμές και τώρα ακολουθεί και η Shopify! Η δυνατότητα να πληρώνεις με ένα σταθερό, ψηφιακό δολάριο που λειτουργεί παντού, χωρίς την παρέμβαση τραπεζών, είναι κάτι που μπορεί να διευκολύνει ριζικά τον τρόπο με τον οποίο αγοράζουμε και πουλάμε online.",Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-14 22:45:45

Analyst Maps Out 3 Explosive Price Targets Using Rare Technical Signal",https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-2-today-13-tomorrow-analyst-maps-out-3-explosive-price-targets-using-rare-technical-signal/,"Whether altcoin season is in motion remains a topic of debate amongst market participants, although XRP is emerging as one of the few altcoins poised to hit a new price high soon. Ripple’s XRP, the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, might be preparing for an explosive run as market experts continue to outline bullish case scenarios for the altcoin. Cryptocurrency analyst EgragCrypto, known on X as EgragCrypto, predicts that the altcoin could soar to never-before-seen levels, notably $6.7, $13, and $27, if certain technical hurdles are surmounted. In an XRP technical chart shared with his followers on X, the analyst highlights 3 key areas using colored circles purple, red, and white to represent notable technical movements. While the purple circle, which historically follows a bullish uptrend, marks the start of a bullish rally observed across different market cycles, the red circle denotes an incoming market crash. This downward movement often occurs when the 21 EMA goes below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, a trend that is later preceded by a market pump, likely to get rejected by both moving averages. The analyst asserts that the move marks the arrival of a bear market. Conclusively, the white circle points to the 21 EMA avoiding a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on a weekly timeframe—an occurrence recorded only once, leading to a 1,200% surge in XRP’s price value. Laying out his bullish stance, the analyst wrote the following; “It’s simple. We still have one leg which will be an epic, fast, and short-lived move that will hype everyone up, claiming we’ll never go back and that utility will take us to the moon. But remember such moves have rarely continued in one direction, if ever, happened in the past and probably won’t in the future. If you’re well-off and don’t need to sell, stay patient. But if not, don’t come crying to my DMs when things don’t go as planned.” The analyst stated that should XRP surge by 1,200% from its current price of $2.24 or sustain a 600% gain in the near term, the altcoin will be valued at $27 or $13, respectively. Meanwhile, a 300% upsurge, which marks a quarter of the 2017 market rally, would value the asset at $6.70. XRP is trading at a press time price of $2.14, with 0.37% in 7-day gains.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:51:31

However, a new contender, Ruvi AI , is rapidly emerging as a high-potential alternative. With over $1.7 million raised , 150 million tokens sold , and predictions of an astonishing 13,100% ROI , Ruvi AI is gaining spotlight attention. But what truly sets it apart, and how does it stack up against Cardano? Here’s a closer look at why analysts are so optimistic about Ruvi AI. Why Analysts Draw Comparisons Between Ruvi AI and Cardano Cardano built its reputation by addressing key blockchain scalability and efficiency issues, a first for the industry when it launched. Similarly, Ruvi AI is making waves for its ability to tackle real-world challenges by integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) . Its solutions span industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance , bringing wide-ranging utility that extends far beyond traditional crypto applications. Where Cardano excels in creating a stable and scalable ecosystem, Ruvi AI adds another dimension by tapping into demand for practical, AI-driven solutions. This focus not only ensures Ruvi AI’s relevance but also positions it to thrive in a competitive landscape. Presale Success Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has garnered significant attention, with over $1.7 million raised and 150 million tokens sold during the current phase. This robust demand reflects growing confidence among investors and signals that Ruvi AI is more than just speculative noise. A standout feature of Ruvi AI is its structured growth model , which brings transparency and predictability to its token pricing. Unlike other tokens that soar or crash based on market whims, Ruvi AI is designed to steadily grow in value. When the presale concludes, tokens will increase to $0.07 , giving early investors a clear pathway to immediate returns. Analysts project even greater gains, predicting Ruvi AI could reach $1 post-listing , equivalent to a remarkable 66x return for presale participants. Maximize ROI With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI takes its presale one step further by offering exclusive VIP investment tiers . These tiers reward early investors with generous bonuses, ensuring that participants at all levels can amplify their gains. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers make Ruvi AI appealing to both cautious first-timers and seasoned whales alike. Building Trust Through Transparency and Security A major differentiator for Ruvi AI is its commitment to transparency and safety . The project is being independently assessed through an upcoming third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This ensures that Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is secure and reliable, an essential factor for responsible investors. Adding to its appeal is Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees ample liquidity and seamless trading for token holders following the presale stage. Together, these moves solidify trust in the platform and give Ruvi AI’s investors peace of mind. Real-World Applications Ensure Long-Term Demand Unlike purely speculative tokens, Ruvi AI delivers tangible value through real-world applications, ensuring ongoing demand. Key sectors benefiting from Ruvi AI’s solutions include: Marketing Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools provide businesses with enhanced customer targeting, campaign optimization, and elevated audience engagement. Entertainment By enabling personalized content recommendations and secure, blockchain-backed transactions, Ruvi AI is reshaping how content is consumed and monetized.

While Ripple has not confirmed such a move, the rumor has reignited discussions about the company’s evolving role in the global financial system. JackTheRippler’s post was accompanied by a visual breakdown demonstrating how Ripple’s infrastructure already mirrors the core functions of a modern digital bank. In the illustrated process, a sender’s bank connects to a third-party liquidity provider to replenish its XRP holdings. It then accesses RippleNet and xCurrent for pre-transaction verification, including exchange rates and transfer costs. Once the conditions are accepted, the bank executes the cross-border payment using XRP in real time. On the receiving end, the bank uses a separate liquidity provider to convert the XRP into local currency, completing the transaction seamlessly. This end-to-end flow highlights Ripple’s technical capacity to operate like a bank, even without a license. It has led many to ask whether formal regulatory approval is simply the next phase in Ripple’s institutional evolution. RUMORS: @Ripple will obtain a banking license and transform into a bank! #XRP pic.twitter.com/MfDPYel2Ed — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 14, 2025 The Banking Charter Possibility This rumor aligns closely with earlier developments reported by Timestabloid. Former Ripple board member and entrepreneur Greg Kidd revealed during a one-on-one interview with FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett at the XRP Las Vegas conference that he is developing a specialized banking charter. The charter is designed for digital-first companies that manage deposits and payments without engaging in lending or operating physical branches. Kidd emphasized that his proposal was theoretical and not linked to any official plan by Ripple. However, he made it clear that the goal is to reshape the financial system by making it more inclusive. This charter could enable companies like Ripple to acquire a form of banking license tailored to their business model, allowing them to provide core financial services without taking on the full regulatory load of traditional banks. Ripple’s Larger Ambitions In another earlier report , Timestabloid highlighted analysis by Stellar Rippler, a well-known crypto commentator, who claimed that Ripple is not just aiming to become a bank; it is preparing to operate at the very foundation of the global financial infrastructure. According to Stellar Rippler, Ripple’s goal is to rival traditional financial institutions, even central banks, by redefining how money moves across borders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While this may sound bold, it is grounded in observable developments. Ripple currently provides payment and liquidity solutions in more than 70 countries. Its suite of tools, including RippleNet, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), and its RLUSD stablecoin, positions it as a critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology. If Ripple does pursue a banking license, it would no longer need to rely on intermediary banks or third-party settlement networks. It could offer direct, real-time, cross-border payments powered entirely by blockchain, something legacy institutions have struggled to achieve. A Strategic Silence? Ripple has not commented on these rumors, but the silence could be strategic. The company remains entangled in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and may be waiting for regulatory clarity before making any significant structural changes. Still, Ripple’s direction is unmistakable. It is no longer just a fintech startup. It is building infrastructure, securing partnerships with central banks, and offering services that resemble, if not already exceeded, those of traditional banking institutions. Whether or not it becomes a licensed bank, Ripple is shaping the future of digital finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This resistance has not deterred long-term holders or analysts, many of whom remain confident that XRP’s underlying utility in cross-border payments could drive substantial gains in the future. Some analysts believe that if XRP is adopted as a key tool for international money movement, its value could climb significantly. These projections are based not on short-term speculation but on the asset’s potential role in global liquidity frameworks. Assessing the Cross-border Liquidity Market A critical factor in these forecasts is the estimated size of the cross-border liquidity pool. While exact figures are not readily available, economists often use M2 money supply data to frame the conversation. M2 includes cash, checking deposits, and other liquid financial assets, and offers a broad view of potential capital deployment. According to a macroeconomic analysis published in April 2025 by analyst Marty Party, the collective M2 money supply of the U.S., China, Japan, and the European Union stood at approximately $83.37 trillion. However, only a fraction of that total is typically designated for cross-border use. Historical data from the Bank for International Settlements suggests that banks allocate roughly 10% to 15% of M2 for international reserves and claims. This implies that the global cross-border liquidity pool may fall between $8 trillion and $12 trillion, with $10 trillion serving as a reasonable mid-range estimate. Calculating XRP’s Value at 25% Liquidity Share To determine XRP’s potential value if it facilitated 25% of the estimated $10 trillion in cross-border liquidity, an analysis was conducted using OpenAI’s ChatGPT model. At the time, XRP was priced at $2.23 with a circulating supply of about 58.82 billion tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the first scenario, where XRP is required to fully back the $2.5 trillion needed for 25% of global liquidity, each token would need to represent a portion of that amount. Dividing $2.5 trillion by the total circulating supply yields a price estimate of approximately $42.50 per XRP. Token Velocity and Adjusted Price Scenarios The second approach incorporates the concept of token velocity, how often a token is used in transactions within a year. If XRP is reused five times annually, then only $500 billion worth of XRP would be required to support $2.5 trillion in flows. This would translate to a token price of about $8.50. The model also evaluated other turnover rates. At a velocity of 10, XRP’s price would drop to around $4.25. Conversely, if the token turned over just twice a year, the required locked value would increase, raising the estimated price to $21.25. These scenarios highlight how XRP’s future price could vary significantly depending on the level of institutional adoption and how efficiently the token circulates. While theoretical, the models offer insight into XRP’s potential valuation if it becomes a core asset in the global financial infrastructure.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $2,567 following a slight recovery but remains some distance off the week’s high of $2,871. Amidst all these recent developments, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment has shared a positive report hinting at a bullish ETH future. ETH Whale Holdings Grow By 3.72% In 30 Days In an X post on June 14, Santiment provides valuable insights into Ethereum whales’ behaviors. The credible analytics firm reports that all 6,392 of such investors holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have significantly increased their holdings over the past month compared to retail investors. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash – Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast In adding data to this claim, Santiment further shares that ETH whales have acquired 1.49 million ETH, worth $38.26 million, in the past 30 days, boosting their total holdings by a significant 3.72%. Generally, whale accumulations are bullish signals that indicate an asset’s strong potential for long-term price appreciation. Therefore, ETH’s recent whale activity is likely to encourage significant levels of retail investment that could incite a price rally. Interestingly, CoinMarketCap data shows the altcoin has recorded a 2.38% decline over the past month. The token’s price has largely oscillated within a range of $2,400 to $2,800, reflecting indecision in the market amidst external pressures and a lack of clear bullish catalysts. Ethereum whales have conducted this accumulation spree during a period of market uncertainty, indicating strong investor confidence regardless of the present market situation. Ethereum Price Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,536 following a price gain of 1.18% in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 3.82% on its weekly chart after a notable brief price ascent above $2,800. According to data from CoinCodex, the general ETH market sentiment is bullish while the Greed & Fear Index stands at 61 (Greed). This report is well reflected in the reported accumulation trend.

Meanwhile, their long-term forecasts paint a strong bullish future of $4,269.40 in the next three months.

Tron (TRX) has recently surged 12% following a new stablecoin launch on its blockchain. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making progress with upgrades to Shibarium, its Layer-2 network. Both have sparked renewed interest. Yet, amid this, another project stands out with deeper traction. BlockDAG, an emerging presale initiative, is nearing the $300 million mark. It has already secured $303 million in funding and attracted over 2 million active users through its X1 mobile mining app. In a space often dominated by flashy headlines and speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing that a more grounded, user-first approach can outperform even long-established coins. TRX Jumps 12% on Stablecoin Buzz TRX rose 12% after a new USD₮ stablecoin launched on its blockchain. The coin benefited from media attention tied to the new dollar-pegged coin. This trend sparked higher network activity and boosted TRX’s market cap. Even so, this rise may be short-lived. TRX has experienced similar spikes before, which have faded once the initial buzz subsided. Its reliance on politically linked headlines leaves questions about long-term stability. Until network usage or developer growth matches these price moves, TRX’s momentum may not persist. Shiba Inu Builds Utility With Shibarium Shiba Inu continues development on Shibarium, its Layer‑2 network, aiming to improve speed and cut transaction costs. The update is designed to streamline validator operations and improve performance. These upgrades may help SHIB move beyond meme status, offering real-world use cases. Even though the Shibarium network has promise, past congestion and early bugs slow adoption. Community sentiment remains positive, yet market gains have been modest. If the improvements hold strong, SHIB may gain traction. For now, it’s in technical rebuild mode, offering potential upside but no breakout yet. BlockDAG: $303M Raised, 2M Users, and No Empty Hype While TRX enjoys attention from news cycles and SHIB focuses on rebuilding its tech, BlockDAG is gaining steady ground through real progress. It isn’t relying on famous names or viral trends to grow. So far, BlockDAG has raised $303 million in its ongoing presale, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. More than 2 million users are already active on its X1 mobile mining app. BDAG is set to launch at $0.05 and is priced at $0.0276 in Stage 29, but right now, $0.0018 buys you in. With over $303 million raised, this gap won’t last long. BlockDAG stands out because of its user-first approach. The X1 app lets people mine directly from their phones, with no need for expensive setups or complicated tools. This simple entry point has attracted users worldwide and built strong engagement, even before the coin launches. There’s no involvement from venture capital firms, no early access for insiders, and no private deals. Every contribution comes from the public. This clear structure helps build trust, especially at a time when many in the space are tired of centralized control. BlockDAG isn’t chasing stories. It’s setting the pace. And even before its official launch, it’s already outpacing many projects that are fully listed. With clear results and growing traction, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the leading crypto to watch this year. Final Verdict TRX may earn attention through stablecoin news and SHIB may build long-term utility via Shibarium. But those models depend on external momentum and delayed results. BlockDAG is different.

Jamie Selway, a veteran financial services executive, will begin serving in the role on June 17th, per a new press release from the regulator. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says Selway will help “ensure the agency’s regulations balance costs and benefits.” The SEC has adopted a more crypto-friendly stance under Atkins, who has sought to distance the regulatory agency from the high-profile enforcement actions overseen by Gary Gensler, the previous chair. Gensler launched legal battles against numerous crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. Since Gensler stepped down in January, many of those cases have been closed. Atkins said last month that the SEC’s “legacy rules and regulations” don’t contemplate the novel use cases of blockchain technology. “In order for the United States to be the ‘crypto capital of the planet’ as envisioned by President Trump, the Commission must keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Rules and regulations designed for off-chain securities may be incompatible with or unnecessary for on-chain assets and stifle the growth of blockchain technology. A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.

The deadly strikes against Iran on Friday, June 13, said to have killed at least 78 people, were praised by Donald Trump as “excellent” with promises of “more to come.” Speaking on the victims of the Israeli attack, UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani detailed: “The overwhelming majority of them [were] civilians, including women and children.” Bitcoin for bombs, Satoshi inverted “Pro-bitcoin” Trump pretended to be for peaceful resolution of the so-called Iranian nuclear issue until mere hours before the strike, posting to Truth Social: “We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue!” However, some Israeli officials have been quoted saying this was a deception designed to lower Iran’s guard. “We had a clear U.S. green light,” one of them allegedly told Axios . Similar comments by “senior Israeli officials” were also made to The Jerusalem Post. Source: Truth Social. Whatever the truth is, if there is any left in the poorly written drama called mainstream news these days, one thing is clear to O.G. bitcoiners: Politicians and bankers make wars, and innocent people on both sides are slaughtered to enrich them. As Major General Smedley D. Butler famously declared in War Is a Racket: “Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die … No one told them that dollars and cents were the real reason. No one mentioned to them, as they marched away, that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here.” Image: Pixabay. Bitcoin was originally meant to fix this. The genesis block gives us a hint with its headline message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.” Crypto was meant to separate money and state , and as early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver once said , it was meant to potentially “undermine every government on the entire planet’s ability to wage war.”Now, BTC is held largely in the hands of the same murdering psychopaths from whom we were meant to take the power back. Blackrock, which invests heavily in defense companies profiting from war, had roughly 575,810 BTC in their Bitcoin ETF as of March . The United States government holds about 200,000 BTC that we know about.Even the individual whales, like Michael Saylor, are strongly pro-state and pro-fiat money. Saylor, who privately holds well over 17,000 BTC, has called Trump “pro-crypto” and criticized advocates of permissionless use and privacy.States and their crony banks. State-embedded mega-corporations. The trend is clear. These entities now hold persuasive amounts of crypto not to be used as permissionless, peer-to-peer electronic cash but for purposes of socioeconomic control and power.Another example is crypto’s unprecedented use for directly purchasing weapons and military supplies in the Ukraine/Russia conflict. As for major centralized exchanges, they are regulated via statist legal systems. So, in essence, if the U.S. continues helping Israel in its war on everyone around and in funding terror cells like Hamas, BTC will be right there behind the cause. Source: bitcointreasuries.net . How to take crypto back in 2 steps While the masses rant and cheer like it’s a football game for either “Israel” or “Iran” to destroy the other, everyday people like you and I will be killed like dogs in the streets, in their houses, in hospitals and schools and while sleeping, in both countries. Bitcoin was supposed to “fix this.”Even “Bitcoin Jesus” Ver, the original voice of Bitcoin Not Bombs, now says he wants to help Trump “make America great again.” Maybe he hasn’t connected the dots yet on Trump’s warmongering, though that’s hard to imagine. Maybe it is (somewhat understandably) a desperate bid to regain his freedom, as he is currently being held by the U.S. Department of Justice on bogus charges. Or maybe there’s another, more disappointing explanation.Regardless, it makes bitcoiners who got into crypto for the prospect of freedom and peace reel with bewilderment. Was any of this ever real in the first place? Were we put on by state interests somehow? Perhaps Satoshi’s creation has just been co-opted. Luckily, it doesn’t matter either way if the tech works. It seems to me crypto still can bring us the separation of money and state. But we’ve got to focus on two things: uncaptured networks that can work for instant, permissionless cash transactions, and most importantly, understanding the true, inviolable source of freedom — self-ownership.The truth is, no government on earth cares for the people it professes to rule. Not Israel, not Iran, not the United States. This is a bitter pill but should be quite obvious, given the evidence. Further, no state is anything but a grouping of single individuals, no better than you or I. States aren’t some abstract, all-powerful deity, though they would have us believe them to be so (much like the old man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz). At the highest levels, even with Israel and Iran, there is a fraternity in the shadows. The enmity played out in the news keeps you distracted. Image: Pixabay. When we come to understand that we own ourselves, that our lives, bodies, and property acquired by non-violence are ours, it makes no sense why some “special” individuals should arbitrarily be able to rule us violently, appoint themselves masters over us, force us to kill strangers in another country we have nothing against personally, or extort money from us via “taxes” to pay for bombs and all other kinds of evil refuse.Like decentralized payment protocols, decentralized networks of societies and communities can order their own lives and make their own sensible rules. They already do. Bitcoin and crypto present a way out of this mess if combined with the above Voluntaryist ethos. Networks like Bitcoin Cash, which are fast, efficient , censorship-resistant, and cost next to nothing to use, can help individuals take their economic freedom back, little by little.Developing privacy tech makes this more possible than ever. How? By refusing to finance violence in whatever small or large way possible until a critical mass of non-compliance is reached. In the same way, individuals can wake up and simply refuse — one by one — to become soldiers to kill and die for Trump, Netanyahu, Ali Khamenei, violent religion, or anyone else who thinks murder is “excellent.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 00:39:27

Dogecoin (DOGE), long considered a meme favorite, still hovers near the $0.20 range and shows resilience, but the real buzz is around an emerging DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is in phase 5 of its presale. Over 10.5 million has already been raised and more than 12,000 investors have joined. With June winding down and momentum building across crypto, this might be the top token of the summer you’ll wish you grabbed early. If you’re still wondering what to buy before June ends, you may not want to sleep on this one. Dogecoin Edges Near $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.20, up about 1% on the day. The token recently bounced off support near $0.176, climbing into the $0.190 resistance zone, and has since held steady around $0.197 Indicators on the 4-hour chart show a breakout above a descending trendline, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum, although DOGE remains capped by overhead pressure near $0.3. With major cryptos rising in tandem, DOGE is regaining attention as a potentially stabilizing meme token, while other plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to draw interest at lower price points. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Blazing Ahead, Secure Tokens at $0.03 Before They Double Mutuum Finance is heating up fast in the DeFi market, now in Phase 5 of its presale with tokens priced at only $0.03, 100% from a listing price of $0.06. That means early Phase 5 investors stand to gain 2x once MUTM launches in addition to a post-launch 74x run. With over $10.5 million raised and a growing community of 12,000+ investors, MUTM is proving itself a rising star in decentralized finance. Plus, the next presale round jumps to $0.035, meaning if you buy now, you lock in an instant 16.67% profit before prices climb. Mutuum’s Hybrid Lending Model Mutuum Finance’s edge lies in its innovative hybrid lending system that merges two powerful DeFi models. In peer to contract (P2C), users place their stablecoins, for example, USDT, into smart contracts, which give them easy income from the interest generated. In P2P, borrowers and lenders talk directly, agree on loan terms, and stay private, since they do not need agents to connect them. This unique combination gives users the best of decentralization, control, and competitive yields, a real game changer in crypto lending. Leaderboard Gamification Sparks Community Excitement and Rewards Top Holders Mutuum Finance is driving engagement with a leaderboard system spotlighting the top 50 MUTM holders in real time. Those in the top spots will receive bonus tokens, turning investment into a thrilling, competitive experience that rewards loyalty and strategy. Certified Secure & Future-Proof Mutuum Finance’s open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, boosting investor confidence in the project. In addition, Mutuum is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum designed to avoid the risks of algorithmic stablecoins’ collapse. This stablecoin is going to hold the ecosystem together by improving stability and security for the system’s users and future institutional members. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $10.5M+ from 12,000+ investors. Now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03, launch price is $0.06, a 100% ROI. Real DeFi use, Certik-audited, and high upside.

Bittensor (TAO) dipped to about $399, forming a strong buy area. Aptos (APT) saw a whopping $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume, ranking it among the top two globally. But Unstaked takes the lead. It backs real AI tools, not empty promises. The presale price of Unstaked (UNSD) sits at $0.01139 in Stage 20. With a $5+ forecast, 3000x gains look plausible. Over $9.7 million has been raised, and about 1.1 billion coins sold. After launch, live AI agents will transition fully to on-chain and operational status. Bittensor’s Sub‑$400 Dip Sparks Buy Alert Bittensor (TAO) currently trades around $399 following an 8% drop this week and 5% over two weeks. This underperformance contrasts with broader market gains. Analyst Michael van de Poppe labels this zone a strong buy. He notes capitulation from weak holders and increased interest from stronger hands. A rounding bottom pattern is emerging, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. TAO remains the top‑ranked AI coin. If momentum returns, targets could range from $425 to $433, and even $700 to $800. For those tracking smart AI coins, Bittensor appears to offer a solid accumulation opportunity. Aptos Surges With $1.6B Stablecoin Activity Aptos (APT) shows impressive growth across its ecosystem. Bridging brought in over $30 million in BTC via OKX’s xBTC in one week. Stablecoin volume reached $1.6 billion, led by USDT, USDC, and USDe. Echo Protocol secured $275 million in TVL. Thala Labs contributed $850 million in DeFi volume. Transaction growth ranks Aptos among the global top two. The chain added 39 ambassadors, distributed $3.4 million in rewards and hosted a major NFT mint. It also expanded tools like Kana Learn, gaming features, naming services, plus real‑world activations such as UNTOLD Festival. With rising activity and user adoption, Aptos is gaining serious momentum. Unstaked’s On‑Chain AI Agents Drive Real Value Unstaked delivers working AI systems that users can deploy immediately after launch. These AI agents act autonomously and run on platforms like X and Telegram. They automate outreach, manage communities, and engage 24/7. Every action is verifiable with proof‑of‑activity on‑chain. No coding is needed. This means creators and crypto teams get powerful automation without hiring staff. These agents are cheaper than an intern and more scalable. They are exactly what crypto promised, but seldom delivered. The presale price is $0.01139 in Stage 20. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, the project already shows momentum. These figures are not hype. They reflect actual buyers’ interest backed by real tech. Most importantly, these AI agents will go live after launch. That means users can deploy them immediately to earn on‑chain rewards. They can customize agent behavior to fit specific goals or communities. Once live, agents will interact, learn, and earn autonomously. That level of real‑world use cements value. A project becomes strong when its product is live and working. Unstaked meets that test. Featuring coinized AI tools, seamless deployment, and on‑chain verification, Unstaked offers clear utility. With a future price target of $5+, the potential return over the $0.01139 presale price is striking. Real use cases, strong funding, and live agents after launch mark Unstaked as a utility‑driven leader. It stands apart from speculative coins by delivering actual functionality tied to actual value. Unstaked may well be the best performing crypto today by real‑world impact and math Final Verdict Bittensor’s drop under $400 may signal a buying setup toward $700+. Aptos is thriving with $30 million BTC inflow, $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume and top global transaction growth. Both projects have strong traction. But Unstaked operates differently. It builds coinized AI agents that automate outreach, grow communities and run on‑chain with proof. Priced at $0.01139 (Stage 20), with over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, it ties real use to real value. Live AI agents post‑launch will cement its utility. This makes Unstaked the standout play rather than just hype.

At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications.

Cardano (ADA) momentum builds as it eyes a $0.70 breakout, helped by inclusion in Nasdaq’s crypto index. But while both tokens rely on trend shifts and sentiment swings, Web3 ai is delivering results now. Its presale token WAI costs just $0.000422 and unlocks eight AI-powered crypto tools that already exist. With a confirmed listing at $0.005242, early buyers lock in a 1147% gain. Over $7.7 million has poured in, making Web3 ai the only project offering working tech before hype. Shiba Inu Teeters: Will Support Hold or Selloff Resume? Shiba Inu faces pressure after weeks of declines, with resistance around $0.000014 and support at $0.0000107 holding firm. The token has failed multiple attempts to stay above the upper range, keeping it in a narrow downtrend. The weekly MACD remains flat, indicating little momentum and a stalled short-term trend. However, sideways movement may offer a low-risk entry if buyers step in near support for a rebound. A break above $0.000014 on rising volume could spark upside to the $0.000015–$0.000016 zone. For cautious traders, the current setup offers clear risk management: buy near support and set tight stop-losses. Watching volume and trend shifts now may reveal whether SHIB resumes a bearish slide or consolidates toward a rebound. Cardano Price Holds Firm as $0.70 Breakout Looms Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.66 after bouncing off key support around $0.65. Analysts say this level is critical. A firm hold here could open a move toward $0.70, while a breakdown might lead to losses near $0.60. The price recently fell from April highs but has shown signs of stabilization. Technical charts show low volatility and steady support, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. Nasdaq’s move to include ADA in its crypto index later this year may boost investor confidence. For traders watching altcoins with well-defined technical setups and upcoming catalysts, ADA stands out. Monitoring the price action near the $0.65 level could offer a smart entry before a potential upward move gains momentum. Why WAI Could Be 2025’s Biggest Moonshot Web3 ai is selling WAI at just $0.000422, yet analysts are already sketching price curves that end at 4 by 2026. Their math is not wishful thinking. The project has locked a listing at $0.005242, giving Stage 8 buyers a clear 1303.95 % lift before the first exchange candle prints. More importantly, every token powers eight AI tools that traders need. There is a live risk simulator that runs GARCH models, a DeFi yield advisor that ranks pools by safety, a scam detector that scans contracts line by line, and five other modules feeding decisions in real time. Each user action burns WAI, creating permanent scarcity. Early demand shows the concept works. Web3 ai has already raised $7.7 million without billboard hype or celebrity endorsements. If daily usage grows like early Metamask adoption, token velocity could force prices into whole dollar territory faster than many expect. Investors who missed Solana at one or Polygon at pennies now have a second shot. The window stays open only until presale allocations vanish. Grab tokens now, before the valuation wakes the market. Web3 ai Transforms Speculation into Math Investors weighing the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price target against Cardano (ADA) momentum may chase charts for weeks, yet outcomes remain tied to market mood. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price target relies on retail buzz, and Cardano (ADA) momentum demands regulatory milestones before $0.70 breaks cleanly. Web3 ai removes that guesswork. Every risk scan, yield check, or sentiment sweep burns WAI, reducing supply while usage climbs. Buying at $0.000422 secures access to eight revenue-driven tools and a listing at $0.005242, mathematically locking 1147% upside. With $7.7 million secured, WAI launches are funded, making it the pick in a speculative field.

This setup allows individuals to earn rewards by offering excess hard drive space, while businesses gain better control and transparency over their data storage needs. Filecoin’s technology has already been put to use by Web3 projects, such as storing NFT metadata and other decentralized assets. With strong backing from institutional investors and a history of regular protocol updates, Filecoin is constantly evolving to meet the needs of commercial users. Recent upgrades have boosted its retrieval efficiency, enhancing its appeal. As demand for decentralized storage continues to rise, Filecoin’s infrastructure-first approach positions it for significant growth in the coming years. 4. Render: Revolutionizing GPU Computing for Creators Render is making waves as a standout contender for the top crypto coins of the upcoming bull run, thanks to its focus on decentralized GPU computing. By connecting creators, like animators, designers, and developers, with individuals offering idle GPU capacity, Render enables faster and cheaper processing of complex visuals compared to traditional cloud services. Already adopted in the creative industry, Render’s platform helps level the playing field by providing access to powerful computing resources. With the rise of the metaverse, AI, and digital design, the need for decentralized rendering power is expected to grow, giving RNDR a strong real-world use case tied to these expanding sectors. Render has also made significant platform and governance upgrades, improving transparency and giving token holders a say in the network’s future. With a functional platform and an increasing number of users, Render is poised to scale alongside the industries it serves, positioning itself for future success. Which Top Crypto Coin Should You Buy Now? As we gear up for the next bull run, top crypto coins that deliver real-world solutions are becoming the main contenders. BlockDAG is leading the way, with its live testnet supporting NFT creation and token burn trials, all backed by over $303 million in presale funding and strong community backing. NEAR Protocol shines with its developer-friendly framework, perfect for scaling dApp growth. Meanwhile, Filecoin meets the growing demand for decentralized storage in today’s privacy-conscious world, and Render is revolutionizing the creative sector by providing decentralized GPU power for faster, more affordable rendering.

46036186,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746919,1749949850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46036186.jpeg,Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/amazon-pours-13b-into-aussie-ai/,"Amazon.com Inc. will invest A$20 billion ($13 billion) in Australia between 2025 and 2029 to expand its data center infrastructure, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global firm. The prime Minister welcomed Amazon Web Services’ investment to expand data center infrastructure in Sydney and Melbourne, calling it the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global provider. He emphasized the project’s role in strengthening Australia’s AI capabilities, creating skilled jobs, and supporting high-performance computing infrastructure. The funds will boost cloud computing capacity and support Australia’s growing demand for artificial intelligence, Amazon said in a statement. The investment will center around its existing Sydney and Melbourne data centers. Albanese met with Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman on Saturday in Seattle ahead of the G-7 summit in Canada, where the deal was highlighted as a milestone in digital cooperation . Garman highlighted the company’s commitment to helping Australian organizations leverage generative AI. He said the investment will strengthen data infrastructure, increase renewable energy use, and support Australia’s ambition to become a global AI leader. Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres welcomed the investment in an interview with Sky News Australia, calling it a “very significant” step for the nation’s digital infrastructure. “It’s in Australia’s interests to lean into the opportunity,” Ayres said. “We must be makers of the technology as well as takers.” Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia As part of the expansion, Amazon will also build three new solar farms in Victoria and Queensland to power the growing infrastructure and support its clean energy goals . Amazon will commit to buying a combined capacity of more than 170 megawatts across these farms. Amazon operates eight solar and wind energy projects across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, which help power its Australian data centers and fulfillment facilities. Once all 11 of its planned renewable energy projects are online, they are expected to produce over 1.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy annually—enough to power approximately 290,000 Australian homes each year. Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon invested an estimated A$467 million in renewable energy projects in Australia. In 2024, Amazon was Australia’s third-largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and remains the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally. As per a study by Accenture, Australian organizations migrating compute-heavy AI workloads to AWS can reduce carbon emissions by up to 94% compared with on-premises data centers. This is because of AWS’s infrastructure hardware, power, cooling, and carbon-free energy procurement efficiencies. AWS powers Australia’s AI ambitions with expanding cloud footprint The investment aligns with the Australian government’s goal to boost productivity and economic growth through AI-driven innovation. It will equip hundreds of thousands of Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and partners with advanced cloud and AI tools, enabling large-scale innovation while ensuring compliance with local data residency and regulatory standards. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources estimates that AI and automation could add up to A$600 billion to Australia’s GDP annually by 2030. AWS’s presence in Australia began in 2012 with the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. This was followed by the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific in 2023, including the country’s first AWS Local Zones in Perth. In April 2024, AWS established Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed generative AI service, in the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. Moreover, in July 2024, the Australian Government linked with AWS to provide a “Top Secret” AWS Cloud to deliver cloud innovation in national security and defense and enhance the nation’s defense and intelligence capabilities.

Recent price movements have formed a classic Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, often seen as a reliable bullish reversal signal. While the breakout hasn’t roared just yet, the structure forming beneath the surface suggests growing strength. Inverse Head And Shoulders Takes Shape On SUI Chart In a recent analysis shared on X, Cleanwater highlights a potential Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern forming on SUI. The move began with a dip from $3.74 on May 29th to $3.00 by May 31st, marking the initial correction. A strong bounce followed, pushing the price up to $3.39 on June 3rd, establishing the first neckline. Related Reading: SUI Meteoric Rise: Golden Cross Signals A Potential 380% Explosion The price then reversed again, dropping to $2.84 on June 5th, forming a key support zone and the “head” of the pattern. However, a swift recovery brought SUI to $3.55 on June 10th, aligning with the neckline and reinforcing the setup. On June 13th, SUI saw one last dip to $2.91, which Cleanwater identifies as the final touch needed to validate the inverse head and shoulders formation. With the price now trading around $3.04, the setup hints at strong upside potential. According to Cleanwater, the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern took shape with an initial dip, a slight recovery, and a second, deeper drop. A push to higher resistance followed this, then capped off by a final dip, shallower than the second and hovering near the level of the first. 4H And 1D Charts Align: Market Prepares For A Break The analyst also observed that a channel is forming on both the 4-hour and daily time frames, indicating that a breakout may be approaching. While it’s difficult to predict exactly when a breakout will occur, the consistent price action within well-defined support and resistance zones shows growing strength. Sideways consolidation like this often precedes a significant move in either direction. Related Reading: Breakout In Sight? SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View In his personal view, Cleanwater leans bullish, suggesting there’s significant upside potential if momentum shifts in favor of the bulls. The repeated tests of resistance and support reinforce this view, hinting at a strong underlying structure. Though he can’t call the exact moment for a breakout, he believes the current setup favors those positioning early for a move. However, Cleanwater also expressed caution regarding the global economic environment, noting that broader news events have started to weigh on market sentiment. He sees the current range as a solid accumulation zone, but acknowledges that a bit more time is needed for the picture to fully develop.

With new regulations, network congestion, and user demand for real-world utility, certain projects are standing out. Qubetics is leading the conversation for innovation and interoperability, while long-established names like BNB and Monero continue to build on scalability and privacy, respectively. For forward-looking participants, these three assets are proving to be the best cryptos to join this month. They offer more than just hype—they bring tangible upgrades, meaningful use cases, and sustainable growth models. Whether you’re seeking tech-backed value, long-term resilience, or privacy, this shortlist highlights the best cryptos to join this month. Qubetics ($TICS): Final Public Sale, Interoperability Advancements, and Rising Community Demand Qubetics is stepping into its final crypto presale phase, and time is running out. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 at a fixed price of $0.3370, with a scheduled 20% increase upon listing. The protocol has attracted over 27,900 holders and raised $18 million. Following a major tokenomics revision, the total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, creating heightened scarcity and stronger long-term token dynamics. This isn’t just another altcoin. Qubetics introduces a cross-industry interoperability layer that simplifies how professionals, businesses, and platforms interact with decentralized systems. The surge in demand stems from its ability to integrate high-volume, data-sensitive industries without sacrificing decentralization or user control. Qubetics is engineered to avoid the congestion issues plaguing Ethereum and the centralization concerns surrounding major Layer 1 chains. What makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to join this month isn’t just scarcity. It’s the multi-layered roadmap and its delivery. The mainnet launch is anticipated by the end of Q3 2025, and early analysts have estimated price surges driven by low supply, aggressive exchange listings, and strong developer incentives. BNB Chain’s Smart Contract Dominance Strengthens In early June, Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) reported its highest-ever 24-hour developer activity spike, backed by over 2,000 verified new smart contracts. Fueled by gas cost efficiency and ecosystem grants, this surge demonstrates why BNB remains a leading Layer 1 choice, especially as Ethereum faces usability hurdles. The BNB Chain has also expanded its sidechain architecture through opBNB and Greenfield, solidifying its utility beyond DeFi. These developments have turned BNB into a multi-vertical asset, serving dApp builders, NFT marketplaces, and DePIN infrastructure alike. A key metric driving interest: BNB Chain’s daily active addresses surpassed 1.8 million last week, nearly triple the count seen in early 2023. This growth—along with newly inked partnerships with gaming studios and AI labs—underscores why BNB Chain is still counted among the best cryptos to join this month. Monero (XMR) Makes a Comeback: Privacy, Fungibility, and Anti-Surveillance Tech With rising surveillance threats and increased scrutiny of blockchain transactions by global regulators, Monero (XMR) is gaining traction again. In June, a new update to its Bulletproofs+ protocol decreased transaction sizes by 7% and improved network verification speeds by 11%, resulting in faster payments with lower resource consumption. Regulatory crackdowns on centralized exchanges have made privacy-oriented coins more appealing, and Monero leads this space with unmatched transaction obfuscation. Unlike zero-knowledge alternatives, XMR doesn’t require a trusted setup and allows true peer-to-peer transfers without metadata exposure. Monero’s relevance grows in scenarios where financial sovereignty and digital privacy are essential. While mainstream coins focus on compliance and transparency, XMR defends the ethos of permissionless freedom. For those focused on utility beyond speculation, Monero still holds a vital role in privacy-first financial systems. Its resistance to censorship and strong developer base continue to make it one of the best cryptos to join this month. Conclusion: Strategic Timing Is Everything—Final $TICS Tokens Are Running Out Fast The crypto space rewards preparation—and the smart money is already watching assets that solve real problems. Qubetics pushes interoperability to new levels, BNB enables scale for builders, and Monero safeguards privacy in a compliance-heavy era. These aren’t just trends; they’re indicators of what’s next.

Platforms that let users build, test, and deploy code offer long-term strength, not just market buzz. In this article, we examine four crypto projects that appeal to builders with working tools and promising structures. BlockDAG takes the spotlight as the only presale project already offering a working testnet and developer access, making it a practical option worth understanding. BlockDAG (BDAG): Test Smart Contracts on a Live EVM-Compatible Testnet Among the top trending cryptos in 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has earned attention for providing a developer-ready environment powered by a live testnet and high-speed architecture. Built on a DAG system combined with Proof-of-Work, it delivers both scalability and strong network security. These elements are key for anyone working on smart contract-based applications. The most appealing part of BlockDAG for developers is its hands-on testing capacity. Ethereum-compatible smart contracts can already be deployed through MetaMask and Remix on its running testnet. This setup allows for real-world trials and debugging before launching on the mainnet, giving builders an early edge. BlockDAG’s economic progress is also notable. The presale has crossed $304 million in funding, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. With $304M in presale funding and Stage 29 priced at $0.0276, BlockDAG has frozen a $0.0018 access point for buyers who act fast. This won’t stay open much longer. With over 2 million users on its X1 app and batch 29 now active, BlockDAG stands apart from typical presale projects thanks to real tech and visible demand. Render (RNDR): A GPU Rendering Protocol for Development at Scale Render plays a specific but vital role in the top trending cryptos in 2025, especially for creators working with advanced visuals. It allows builders in 3D design, gaming, and digital effects to outsource GPU rendering tasks via its decentralized network, cutting time and costs while supporting large-scale production. Its API lets developers tap into distributed GPU power using smart contracts. As AI and immersive gaming continue to expand, Render’s GPU compute tools give tech creators a solid backend. RNDR tokens are used to reward those offering GPU time. While not a general-purpose chain for smart contracts, its usefulness in graphics-heavy projects earns it a firm place among top trending cryptos in 2025. Kaspa (KAS): DAG Speed with Fast Block Inclusion for Practical Builds Kaspa is gaining momentum among developers who value speed and clean structure. Its use of a DAG model allows many blocks to be processed per second with near-instant confirmations. While it doesn’t support EVM contracts, its Proof-of-Work and DAG base make it ideal for projects needing simple scripting and real-time data handling. Kaspa’s strengths include a block-pruning system that avoids data overload and a steady block inclusion design. Builders working on microtransactions, streamlined protocols, or testing new payment flows may find its approach fits well. Kaspa may not replace EVM-based platforms, but it fills a niche in the top trending cryptos in 2025 for quick, low-weight development. Solana (SOL): Fast Smart Contract Support with Lower Network Fees Solana stays relevant in the top trending cryptos in 2025, especially for creators aiming to build apps that demand high speeds and massive output. Its network handles over 65,000 transactions per second through a unique parallel processing method, with low fees and wide smart contract support. Solana’s system uses Rust and C, not Solidity, which can pose a challenge for some developers. But its efficiency often justifies the shift. Solana now offers strong tooling, improved uptime, and a growing base of active developers. For building large-scale platforms in finance, gaming, or media, Solana remains a useful option within top trending cryptos in 2025. Final Remarks! Finding top trending cryptos in 2025 isn’t only about prices or chart patterns. Builders should focus on platforms offering working tools, early testing access, and stable developer support. BlockDAG ranks high here, as its live testnet, Ethereum compatibility, and early-stage traction make it more than just a presale name. Alongside it, Render serves developers in the design and GPU sector, Kaspa supports quick builds with low complexity, and Solana allows full-scale apps with high output needs. For anyone creating real systems, these top trending cryptos in 2025 show strong promise backed by hands-on utility and technical progress.

46041754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746935,1749956858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46041754.jpeg,Cardano Founder teases full XRP integration package,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-founder-teases-full-xrp-integration/,"Charles Hoskinson, the Cardano founder, released new information about the possible integration of XRP and its related features on the Cardano blockchain. Hoskinson replied with a wide-scope plan that is not limited to RLUSD. His comments followed a user’s inquiry about whether the Ripple-backed stablecoin RealUSD (RLUSD) would be available on Cardano. He mentioned that a full “ XRP package ” is on the way, with plans for XRP DeFi integration, support for Lace wallet, “glacier drops,’ and ongoing talks about RealUSD. He did not make a fine point about timing, but his reply confirmed that high-level discussions were taking place. Cardano gears up for XRP integration with RLUSD As soon as RLUSD was mentioned, the cryptocurrency community went into overdrive, with many hoping for information on when they could access the stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain . However, Hoskinson’s reply suggests that RLUSD is part of the bigger plan, which involves all the other Ripple-related assets. One term that emerged with greater prominence was “glacier drops.” While not commonly used in the space, the term refers to a controlled and staggered release of tokens or features — analogous to a focused airdrop effort pegged to product milestones. Lace wallet support is also on the agenda. As Cardano’s official wallet was built emphasizing user experience, Lace’s integration with XRP would streamline access for users looking to manage Ripple-based assets within the Cardano ecosystem. Equally significant is the mention of DeFi. Historically, XRP has had a limited role in decentralized finance. Its integration into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure could unlock new use cases — such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision — potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform. While no final decisions have been made public, Hoskinson’s remarks shed more light on Cardano’s dedication to interoperability, interest in stablecoin adoption, and interest in growing their presence in the DeFi space. Through the integration of RLUSD, XRP DeFi utilities, advanced wallet features, and token drops, Cardano is gearing up to vie for its share of the competitive blockchain ecosystem. If it works, this could be important for Cardano in expanding its ecosystem and offering itself a bit more than it is to an even larger crypto market. Hoskinson proposes strategic investments to grow Cardano’s treasury Hoskinson recently shared insight into what the Cardano community should expect regarding the ecosystem’s decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). He gave the update in an 18-minute-long podcast on X to ecosystem members. According to Hoskinson, the team is considering several approaches to improving and growing the Cardano SWF. He maintained that the goal is to use the fund’s resources to benefit the ecosystem. Hoskinson explained that the decentralized Cardano SWF is similar in principle to how countries like Norway invest national wealth into assets for future benefits. He proposed investing a small portion of the Cardano treasury in different assets. “Could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of a collection of stablecoins … and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin/DeFi?” he asked. The plan aims to mitigate risk, create long-term yield, and reinvest the money into buying back ADA. This sets up Cardano’s Sovereign Wealth Fund to grow the ecosystem and, consequently, the value of ADA as time goes on. Cardano could make relatively easy returns without significantly eating into its core reserves by dedicating a portion of the treasury to Bitcoin and similar assets. When used to acquire ADA, these profits may increase demand and sustain the market price. Charles Hoskinson describes an economic model designed to be self-sustaining for the Cardano community.

After hitting a low on June 5th, the cryptocurrency made a small upward move. However, the momentum since then has been weak and uncertain. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.14. Current Market Situation XRP’s price has managed to hold above its June 5th low, even as many other altcoins have fallen below their recent support levels. This is a positive sign because it shows XRP is holding up slightly better than some of its competitors. But to turn this into a strong upward move, bulls need to step in soon and push the price higher with conviction. Key Resistance and Support Levels Right now, the first important price barrier for XRP is around $2.33. A clean break above this level could mean that buyers are gaining control. If that happens, the next resistance levels to watch are at $2.36, $2.48, and ideally $2.47. These levels could act as short-term targets if the rally continues. On the downside, the key support level to watch would be $1.94 and $1.83. A fall to these levels would hint at weakness and raise concerns about a further drop. What to Expect Next For a stronger bullish trend to begin, XRP needs to show increased momentum and trading volume. If buyers manage to push the price above $2.33 and beyond $2.47, it could open the door for a move towards $2.54 or even higher. However, if the price remains weak and struggles to break above resistance, or worse — falls below $2 — the outlook would turn more bearish. The critical long-term support to watch in that case would be at $1.79. A drop below this would significantly reduce the chances of a quick recovery.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 03:13:35

This sudden fall created panic among holders, with many unsure whether to sell or wait for a possible recovery. However, the price has now bounced back, gaining 6% in the last 24 hours. Pi Coin is now trading at $0.61. The price dip comes after weeks of little progress from the Pi Core Team. Despite earlier promises of major upgrades and ecosystem development, no significant updates have been delivered. This has frustrated investors and caused the token’s price to stagnate. Can Pi Price Hit $10? Even though Pi Network’s price recently fell below $1, many in the community still believe it could reach $10 one day. Pi Network already has over 70 million registered users (called Pioneers). This is a big number for any cryptocurrency. If even a small part of this community starts using Pi for daily payments, online shopping, or services within the Pi ecosystem, demand for the token could increase — and when demand rises, prices often follow. Right now, most of the mined Pi tokens are still locked or waiting for migration. This means there aren’t many tokens freely available for trading. If the supply remains limited while demand increases through new apps or business partnerships, the price could naturally climb higher over time. Analyst Dr Altcoin said, “For Pi to be practical within the Pi Ecosystem, its price would need to reach at least $10.” Geopolitical Factors Add Pressure Part of the recent crypto market decline can also be linked to growing geopolitical tensions, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. The escalating situation, which has included military strikes and leadership losses, has injected uncertainty across global markets, including crypto. Like other altcoins, Pi followed the broader market trend — but some community members have criticized the token for mirroring negative movements without benefiting from bullish ones.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 04:18:33

With the market recalibrating, one project is positioning itself as a standout alternative in the form of Remittix —offering sharper fundamentals, stronger use cases, and far more room to run. Here’s why. XRP price prediction: Is a drop below $2 in the works? XRP’s four-hour chart has shown a bearish reversal head-and-shoulders formation since May 9. If the XRP price fails to reclaim the neckline of $2.33, projected XRP price targets tighten around $2.25. This aligns with the 200-day SMA, and extends to $2.00. Market sentiment has cooled, with bullish momentum fading. Egrag Crypto emphasized $2.30 as must-hold support. A confirmed breakdown could escalate losses, with extended downside targets at $2.15 and potentially $1.60, should sellers take control. Volume trends and price structure point toward a weakening bid side. Unless bulls reclaim technical ground quickly—or if the spot XRP ETF comes to pass—XRP price will continue to face sell-side pressure as bearish headwinds prevail. XRP price fell as low as $2.08 in the past 24 hours. Source: TradingView SUI facing heavy selling pressure Rising Layer-1 blockchain protocol SUI rejected at the 50-day SMA ($3.55), signaling firm resistance and renewed bearish pressure. Now trading near $3.00, the $2.86 support has become a key battleground. A break below this level could expose the pair to a deeper decline toward $2.50, as sellers look to take short-term control. If bulls hold the line at $2.86 and stage a rebound, the price may retest the moving averages. A failure to break above them would only strengthen bearish momentum, raising the odds of another test—and possible breach—of support. Market pressure is rising. The next move will likely define short-term direction. SUI hovers around the key psychological level of $3. Source: TradingView Remittix offers greater upside than XRP and SUI SUI and XRP may face stiff bearish headwinds moving forward—but the smart money is already on the next blue chip in the form of Remittix (RTX). Positioned to revolutionize the $190T cross-border payments industry, Remittix offers seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers without the friction or hidden fees typical of legacy platforms. Its architecture is tailored for both consumers and businesses, offering real-time settlement, staking rewards, and governance participation through its native RTX token. With over $15.7 million raised in presale funding, institutional and retail interest is already signaling strong forward momentum. What sets Remittix apart is scale. While SUI operates within niche verticals, RTX targets a global payments market—broad, essential, and underserved. Its platform aims to serve freelancers, enterprises, and remittance corridors with equal efficiency. With a 2025 price forecast of up to a 600% run in 2025, Remittix offers both utility and asymmetric upside, positioning it as a standout asset in the next market cycle. This isn’t just another token—it’s infrastructure, designed to last. The final word While SUI and HYPE are showing strong growth and market interest in 2025, Remittix presents the best opportunity for investment. Its innovative approach to crypto payments and its growing ecosystem position it for greater success in the coming years. Backed by over $15.7 million in funding thus far, Remittix is one of the few emerging assets with genuine institutional alignment and scalable upside.

Bitcoin was stuck above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens dropped to $3.28 trillion. This article explores the top crypto forecasts of coins like Pi Network (PI), Monero (XMR), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Pi Network price prediction Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi coin has come under pressure in the past few weeks as it plunged to $0.3945 on Friday, down from last month’s high of $1.6567. The token has stabilized a bit and moved to over $0.60 today, a 50% surge. Technicals point to more Pi Network gains as it has formed a triple-bottom pattern at around $0.60. A triple-bottom is made up of three distinct bottoms and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $1.6567. The token is attempting to move above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the MACD and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Pi Network token price will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $1, which is about 61% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.3945 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network forecast. Monero price forecast XMR price chart | Source: TradingView Monero, the biggest privacy-focused coin, has crashed in the past two weeks, erasing some of the gains made earlier this year. The initial gains happened as demand for privacy tokens soared. XMR token retreated from a high of $420 to $315 today as investors booked profits. Monero has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also remains slightly above the 50-day and 100-day EMA. Most importantly, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $301.05. A double-bottom pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, Monero token will likely bounce back as long as it remains above the double-bottom pattern at $301. Such a move will see it rise and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $353, which is about 12% above the current level. A drop below the support at $301 will invalidate the bullish Monero price forecast. Fartcoin price forecast Fartcoin chart | Source: TradingView Fartcoin, a top meme coin on the Solana network , has been one of the most actively traded tokens this year. Its recent surge saw it peak at $1.6520 in May. It then pulled back and reached a low of $0.8715, its lowest point on June 5, and then bounced back to the current $1.20. Fartcoin token remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated and moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the Fartcoin price will likely resume the uptrend, and potentially retest the psychological point at $1.50. A drop below the support at $0.8715 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

On Saturday, an Israeli strike hit the Phase 14 processing plant of the South Pars gas field , causing a major explosion and fire, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The blast forced the shutdown of a nearby production platform. South Pars, located in the Persian Gulf, is the world’s largest gas field and is shared between Iran and Qatar. Iran uses most of its gas domestically. The strike marked a serious shift in the conflict, which began Friday when Israel carried out a series of attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. By targeting energy infrastructure, Israel has now opened a new front in the crisis. The strikes will further cripple Iran’s economy and shake the markets The recent attacks come at a time when Iran is already struggling with severe power outages. Iran has already seen widespread blackouts in recent months, hitting businesses and households. The Iran Chamber of Commerce estimates the economic cost of these outages at around $250 million a day. Though the damage may mainly impact Iran’s internal energy supply, global markets are bracing for more volatility when trading resumes after the weekend. Oil markets had already reacted strongly before this latest attack. U.S. crude prices jumped by as much as 14% on Friday, finishing near $73 per barrel. Experts warn that further attacks could deepen the threat to oil production and shipments in the region. “This is pretty significant,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects Ltd. He added, “We appear to be in an escalatory cycle,” and warned that Israeli forces may continue to strike Iranian energy sites. In a separate incident, a fire also broke out at the Fajr Jam gas plant, another key processing facility in Iran. This plant handles gas from South Pars as well as the Nar and Kangan fields. Tasnim described it as one of the largest facilities of its kind in the country. Goldman Sachs analysts have already raised their short-term oil price forecasts by $2 to $3 a barrel in response to the rising tensions. They noted the potential for oil prices to spike above $100 per barrel if the situation worsens, though their base forecast still expects prices to fall below $60 by the end of the year. “The potential of further escalation in the Middle East implies that the short-term risks to our price forecast are now skewed to the upside,” Goldman analysts, including Daan Struyven, wrote in a recent note.

46047506,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-303-million-presale-surpasses-worldcoin-price-jump-solana-price-trend/,1749963600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/46047506.jpeg,BlockDAG’s $303 Million Presale Surpasses Worldcoin Price Jump & Solana Price Trend,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-303-million-presale-surpasses-worldcoin-price-jump-solana-price-trend/,"In a market where attention constantly shifts, one presale is quietly dominating the spotlight: BlockDAG. Despite being in its early phase, the project has already raised over $303 million, placing it side by side with two of 2025’s most watched names, Worldcoin (WLD) and Solana (SOL). While Worldcoin gained a boost from renewed OpenAI ties and Solana trends on speculation around a potential ETF, neither has matched BlockDAG’s steady stream of capital and user growth. BlockDAG is not relying on hype alone. It is attracting users, delivering tools, and progressing ahead of schedule. The real question is whether WLD or SOL can keep pace with what BlockDAG (BDAG) has already rolled out. Solana Shows Promise but Awaits Key Breakout to Confirm Uptrend Solana continues to rank among the most followed coins this cycle, driven by technical setups that favor a bullish breakout. The token displays both a bullish flag and an inverse head-and-shoulders formation, targeting a breakout that could climb to $295. A move above $200 might trigger a potential five to tenfold rally, particularly if the Canary Marinade ETF, scheduled for review on July 24, receives approval and draws in institutional capital. Open interest in SOL increased by 8.3% over 24 hours, with the long-to-short ratio now at 1.67. Analysts like Ali Martinez highlight a cup-and-handle setup that could take Solana to $1,000 in the long run. Yet, all of this remains speculative. Unless Solana clears its psychological resistance, the Solana price trend stays in limbo. That pause gives BlockDAG a lead by delivering concrete outcomes while others wait for signals. Worldcoin Gains on OpenAI News but Still Lacks Independent Traction Worldcoin surged 5.4% on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18 after OpenAI revealed its transition to Google Cloud. This allowed OpenAI to expand beyond Microsoft Azure and sparked interest in its AI capabilities. Since Worldcoin is closely tied to OpenAI through Sam Altman and its focus on decentralized identity, the news drove strong price and volume increases. Trading volume jumped 38% to $208.6 million, while RSI flashed bullish indicators and targets rose between $1.25 and $1.62. Despite the Worldcoin price jump, the rally seems rooted more in association with OpenAI than in independent user growth or real-world utility. As WLD remains tethered to OpenAI’s trajectory, investors who value scalability, autonomy, and native adoption are starting to consider alternatives. BlockDAG presents a much different and more self-sustaining proposition. BlockDAG Breaks $303 Million as Presale Momentum Builds Fast While Worldcoin and Solana await triggers, BlockDAG is moving ahead decisively. The project’s presale has passed the $303 million mark, drawing far more attention than typical for a pre-launch coin. With the official launch price set at $0.05, early buyers stand to gain significantly when the token becomes tradable. For the next six days, the price remains locked at $0.0018 in Batch 29, fueling strong demand. Analysts have forecast returns of up to 10,000x, and some even suggest a long-term target as high as $20. BlockDAG offers more than just speculation. Its dual blockchain and DAG framework allows for parallel block validation, solving key limitations found in older Layer 1 chains. Developers can build using Ethereum tools, thanks to full EVM compatibility. Additionally, its Smart Contract Wizard enables simplified deployment, lowering the barrier for non-technical users. A recent teaser of a US partnership has also stirred discussion, drawing attention from broader cultural and investment circles. This momentum extends beyond crypto, placing BlockDAG at the intersection of mainstream curiosity and blockchain innovation. BlockDAG’s X1 App provides a mobile-first mining system with over 2 million users across more than 100 countries. Through a Proof-of-Engagement model, users mine BDAG by checking in daily, making participation accessible and habit-forming. The app combines gamified elements with social engagement, positioning it not just as a crypto tool but as a scalable acquisition engine. This real-time user growth demonstrates that BlockDAG is not waiting to go live, it is already building a user base that most projects only dream of at this stage. Summing Up While Solana and Worldcoin remain key topics of discussion, BlockDAG is making measurable progress. The Worldcoin price jump is more about OpenAI than WLD’s own traction. The Solana price trend looks technically solid, but still needs ETF decisions and breakout validation. BlockDAG, in comparison, is checking all the boxes. With $303 million raised and the presale price at $0.0018, it’s ahead on execution. Its scalable architecture and mobile mining app are delivering real solutions, not just plans. In 2025, success belongs to projects that take action, not the ones still waiting. Right now, BlockDAG is where that action is happening.

The Japanese government confirmed today that the two continued discussing a possible trade agreement. Akazawa also had in-person talks on Friday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for around 70 minutes and with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for 45 minutes. Japan’s PM hopes to talk with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 Summit The Japanese government described the talks on Saturday similarly to Akazawa’s Friday statement, terming the conversation as “very in-depth” and that the two parties explored the possibility of reaching an agreement that would benefit both countries. It added that their Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US President Donald Trump could meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit starting Sunday in Canada, where they hope they can finalize a deal. The country is still in for a 24% tariff rate on their exports starting in July unless it can secure a deal with the US. Tokyo is also pushing to shield its auto industry from a separate 25% US levy. In earlier talks, Japan offered to increase imports of US agricultural goods and review its “non-tariff trade barriers” to American car sales to respond to the concerns of the Trump administration. In addition, the government is mulling to collaborate with the US to secure supply chains of rare earth magnets and semiconductors. So far, China is the primary producer of high-performance rare earth magnets. However, Japan hopes to promote building supply chains with the US without relying on China. Often, rare earth magnets manufacture electric vehicle motors and missile devices. Regarding neodymium magnets, China produces more than 80%, while Japan accounts for only about 15%. The US has been scrambling for ways to deal with China’s dominance and restrictions on rare earths exports, and Japan could very well be the solution the country has been looking for.

The Japanese company’s offer aroused much criticism and opposition over national security concerns. The order by Trump requires that the merger only go ahead if a deal is signed with the Treasury Department to resolve any national security risks. US Steel and Nippon Steel announced that they had reached a deal, which satisfied a critical requirement for Trump. They cited $11 billion in planned investments by 2028 and commitments on governance, production, and trade. Sources have said that the US government will also receive a golden share, which doesn’t involve an ownership stake. Other reports say some of the top jobs will also be reserved for Americans, and Nippon Steel would also be required to invest $3 billion to build a new mill after 2028. White House spokesman Kush Desai believes the deal will help Pennsylvania retain ownership of US Steel and protect the company as a critical element of the nation’s national and economic security. Japan’s Economy, Trade, and Industry Minister Yoji Moto also expressed confidence that the investment will enhance innovation in Japanese and US steel sectors while deepening their strong bilateral partnership. The merger agreement deadline is June 18, though the companies’ statement did not specify exactly when it will close.

Experts Split,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-at-105k-breakout-or-breakdown-next-experts-split/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?

The trajectory of meme coins proves it’s more than possible. From lighthearted digital jokes to serious investment vehicles, meme tokens have captured the imagination of a new generation of crypto enthusiasts. In a market increasingly driven by community engagement and viral potential, meme coins have transcended novelty and become some of the most watched, most traded, and most celebrated digital assets in the blockchain space. The wave is far from over. With tokens like Bonk, Floki, Brett, Popcat, Cat in a Dog’s World, Neiro, Book of Meme, Turbo, Ponke, and Troller Cat climbing charts and captivating communities, 2025 is poised to become the year of the meme coin evolution. Among these, Troller Cat stands apart with a live presale already drawing investor attention. For those looking to buy TCAT early, this is a critical moment to join and gain maximum perks. Troller Cat is not just riding the meme wave—it’s engineering it. Its features are why it’s consistently ranked among the top 10 meme coins. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Where Viral Culture Meets High-APY Crypto Innovation Troller Cat’s presale launched at a modest $0.000005 per token and has reached Stage 9 with the price rising to $0.00002834. The token will list at $0.0005309, and this momentum translates to an ROI of over 1773.32% from the first stage. Over 1,100 holders have already joined the initiative, raising $250,000 in under a month. With 26 presale stages and the next one poised to surge, the opportunity window narrows. Stage 9 is proving Troller Cat isn’t just a presale—it’s a precision-calibrated entry point into serious ROI. A $5K stake grants over 176.4 million tokens, tracking toward a projected value of $93.6K. Each new stage tightens the margins. Every delay lowers the upside. The setup is ready—will you take the position or miss the momentum? This presale isn’t just structured for hype. With 69% APY staking, a deflationary play-to-earn Game Center, and zero glitches due to a fully audited smart contract, Troller Cat exemplifies presale engineering done right. KYC verification adds trust, while the ability to join with no minimum buy-in—and $25 required only for referrals—makes it accessible. These features mark TCAT as one of the top 10 meme coins with built-in utility and strategic upside. Hold, Earn, Repeat: Troller Cat’s 69% APY Staking Power Troller Cat isn’t just serving up internet chaos—it’s delivering serious earning potential with every token held. While the memes draw you in, the staking rewards make you stay. During the presale, holders can tap into a jaw-dropping 69% APY staking, turning idle $TCAT into a nonstop earning machine. This isn’t fluff or gimmicks—it’s a real strategy designed for long-term impact. Each staked token contributes to a stronger, more stable ecosystem, rewarding commitment and discouraging quick flips. And unlike overinflated reward systems that crash under their own hype, Troller Cat’s staking model is built with balance, precision, and sustainability at its core. The result? A loyal base of holders who aren’t just along for the ride—they’re building wealth as they go. With rewards rolling in passively, participants can focus on enjoying the experience, spreading the word, and watching their stacks grow. In a space full of noise, Troller Cat turns loyalty into leverage—and it pays in more ways than one. 2. Bonk ($BONK): The Fast-Moving Underdog of Solana’s Meme Ecosystem Bonk emerged as Solana’s answer to the Ethereum-based meme coin explosion. With a fair launch and wide airdrop strategy, it instantly captivated thousands of wallets and created a grassroots movement that spread like wildfire. Built with speed and low fees, Bonk complements Solana’s infrastructure and delivers lightning-fast transactions ideal for micro-payments and community engagement. Bonk’s core appeal lies in decentralization and accessibility. It lacks a centralized development team and is entirely community-driven. The token experienced wild price volatility in 2023 but gained a reputation for resilience and a loyal user base. Analysts view Bonk as one of the few Solana-native meme coins capable of matching Ethereum-based contenders in both scale and sentiment. Bonk made this list for its strategic launch model, Solana integration, and ability to rally decentralized momentum, proving it’s a top 10 meme coin candidate by both speed and spirit. 3. Floki ($FLOKI): A Norse Legend Reimagined for the Blockchain Age Floki combines Norse mythology with DeFi infrastructure, creating an immersive metaverse-backed ecosystem. Unlike traditional meme coins, Floki isn’t just about the brand—it’s also about the build. From FlokiFi (its DeFi arm) to Valhalla (a metaverse play-to-earn game), the project expands utility into both entertainment and finance. Floki’s marketing is relentless, with global campaigns seen on public transport, stadiums, and major billboards. Its DAO governance, NFT marketplace, and charity arm showcase its commitment to innovation and social impact. Floki balances humor and high-function with surprising effectiveness. This project makes the top 10 meme coins list due to its cross-sector ecosystem, brand recognition, and focus on long-term scalability. 4. Brett ($BRETT): A Comedic Take with Cutting-Edge Ambition Brett is both a meme and a message. Launched as a tribute to the irreverent side of crypto culture, Brett quickly distinguished itself with community-led initiatives and bold, edgy branding. It doesn’t aim to be polished—it aims to be loud, real, and impossible to ignore. What Brett lacks in formal whitepapers is transparent governance, meme-friendly engagement, and bold takes on the future of crypto culture. Brett is unapologetically himself, and investors appreciate that. It’s building partnerships with meme-centric NFT communities, bolstering both relevance and reach. Brett earns its place as a top 10 meme coin by turning cultural commentary into crypto capital. 5. Popcat ($POPCAT): The Meme King with Viral Kinetics Popcat is one of the most recognizable meme coins, inspired by a viral image and built on pure community momentum. While many meme tokens rely on sustained marketing, Popcat thrived through the simplicity of its name and an instantly viral appeal. It started as a token of fun, but quickly snowballed into a broader project with staking, NFTs, and gamified community participation. What sets Popcat apart is its cultural stickiness. The token’s memeability remains its primary strength, and its ability to reinvent through digital culture makes it endlessly relevant. Its roadmap includes interactive gaming utilities and cross-platform meme integration. Popcat is on this list because of its sheer viral power and potential to evolve into a gamified, utility-rich ecosystem—a true contender among the top 10 meme coins. 6. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW): A Parody Turned Powerplay Cat in a Dog’s World is exactly what it sounds like—a contrarian meme coin pushing back against the dominance of dog-themed tokens. It leans into its feline identity with humorous branding while simultaneously rolling out serious crypto mechanics, including auto-burn, reflections, and community-funded liquidity pools. Its branding is wildly creative, and its contrarian concept appeals to those tired of “yet another dog coin.” With creative marketing campaigns and regular token burns, the project has maintained a strong community base while ensuring deflationary value gains. This coin made the top 10 meme coins list for reimagining meme coin narratives with sharp wit and smart economics. 7. Neiro ($NEIRO): The AI-Driven Meme Marvel Neiro stands at the junction of AI and memes, a futuristic combination that has fueled its rapid rise. It integrates artificial intelligence with crypto rewards, enabling users to generate memes through a neural network and earn tokens based on community votes. This use case is unique in the meme coin landscape. Its growth has been methodical, supported by regular community engagement, algorithmic token burns, and strategic partnerships with AI incubators. Neiro also incorporates gamified staking and a machine learning-backed rarity system for its NFT line. Neiro earns its place for pioneering the AI + meme coin hybrid model, making it a standout in the top 10 meme coins of 2025. 8. Book of Meme ($BOME): Crypto Lore as Asset Class Book of Meme is a cultural archive as much as it is a digital token. It aims to catalog and tokenize meme history on the blockchain, giving nostalgic and iconic memes their own traceable value. Each meme becomes an NFT chapter in the blockchain’s ongoing story. This coin resonates with collectors and meme historians, turning pop culture into a monetized database. The token’s roadmap includes a publishing platform, meme auctions, and educational meme modules for Web3 literacy. Book of Meme deserves a place among the top 10 meme coins because it is highly original in its blend of entertainment, education, and crypto-native art. 9. Turbo ($TURBO): The Ultra-Fast Meme Coin with Gasless Ambition Turbo lives up to its name. With a focus on blazing-fast transactions and zero gas fees through Layer-2 integrations, Turbo is positioning itself as the efficient meme coin for the next-gen blockchain. It utilizes smart routing and on-chain compression to deliver one of the smoothest transaction experiences. The project is highly technical for a meme coin, emphasizing throughput and scalability while keeping its branding loose and accessible. It has also started bridging across EVM-compatible chains, boosting interoperability and attracting cross-chain traders. Turbo is listed among the top 10 meme coins for showing that speed and scalability can merge with meme culture without compromising performance. 10. Ponke ($PONKE): The Community-Fueled Underdog With Tactical Fire Ponke began as an inside joke and evolved into a strategic, community-driven movement. It operates on a frictionless yield-generation protocol, redistributing tokens with every trade to holders and burn wallets. What began as humor turned into tokenomics brilliance. Ponke’s secret weapon is its highly engaged Discord community and strategic timing around cultural events. It often launches meme-driven campaigns during major crypto news cycles to harness trending attention. Its agility and community-first approach give it unique staying power. Ponke stands strong among the top 10 meme coins for transforming humor into organized momentum and token-based economics.

46050583,https://invezz.com/?p=2762281,1749966480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"DOGE price risks 66% drop to $0.06, but all eyes are now on MUTM",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/15/doge-price-risks-66-drop-to-0-06-but-all-eyes-are-now-on-mutm/,"In a climate where political spectacle increasingly dictates market sentiment, Dogecoin (DOGE) is once again facing heightened volatility. Recent tensions between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have ignited a fresh wave of uncertainty surrounding the meme coin’s future. With Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price already teetering near unstable support zones, some analysts foresee a sharp correction as deep as 66%, bringing the token down to $0.06. While Dogecoin (DOGE) wrestles with public narratives and celebrity-driven swings, many retail and institutional investors are now rotating into fundamentally solid assets — and one of the most notable among them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Dogecoin (DOGE)’s sentiment spiral highlights need for utility-driven assets The rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) was powered by memes, viral social media moments, and endorsements from high-profile individuals. Yet its long-term growth has been questioned repeatedly due to its lack of foundational utility. The speculative nature of DOGE has left it vulnerable to unpredictable price swings — and the current drama involving Trump and Musk has only intensified investor uncertainty. Despite widespread brand recognition, Dogecoin (DOGE)’s use cases remain minimal, and that absence of real yield generation has pushed many holders to reconsider its role in a sustainable portfolio. In stark contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a protocol grounded in genuine utility. It is built to serve real needs in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena — with working products, passive income features, and robust token mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raises over $10.55 million as presale momentum builds At the time of writing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised more than $10.55 million in its presale. The token is currently priced at $0.03, making it one of the most attractive entry points in DeFi for value-focused investors. With over 12,000 holders and rising, it is clear that the market recognizes the project’s potential. A $100,000 giveaway is also ongoing, offering immediate value for early adopters while broadening exposure across new audiences. The beta version of the Mutuum platform is scheduled to go live by the time the token is listed. This means MUTM will enter public markets with a functioning ecosystem rather than promises — a rare approach that puts investor confidence at the forefront. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another DeFi project. It will combine a dual-lending architecture with both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) functionalities. In the P2C model, users will deposit blue-chip assets into lending pools to earn interest. These deposits will help other users borrow against their collateral, creating a circular ecosystem. Interest rates in each pool will be dynamically adjusted based on supply and demand, allowing lenders to enjoy higher returns during periods of high borrowing activity. Meanwhile, the P2P model will introduce broader flexibility by allowing lenders and borrowers to negotiate directly using tokens that are often unsupported by other lending platforms. This will include memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE)—giving users new ways to extract value from idle assets. One of the protocol’s most innovative tools will be the introduction of mtTokens—minted immediately when a user deposits an asset into a pool. For example, depositing ETH will result in mtETH, which will reflect the principal plus accumulated interest. These mtTokens will be freely tradable on secondary markets or reusable within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem for new strategies, including staking and collateral reuse. This model will give participants continuous access to liquidity without the need to withdraw from lending pools, preserving yield while enhancing optionality. Layer-2 integration and CertiK audit set a high technical standard Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to outperform legacy DeFi platforms by integrating with Layer-2 networks. This ensures fast, low-cost transactions that remove the barriers typically caused by congestion and high gas fees. It also greatly enhances usability, making Mutuum’s tools more accessible for everyday users. Security is equally prioritized. The protocol has been fully audited by CertiK, with a Token Scan score of 80.00. The audit involved both manual code review and static analysis, and was revised in late May 2025. These checks help verify the reliability of smart contracts and are a strong signal of long-term protocol safety. In addition to its lending pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized stablecoin that will be fully overcollateralized by assets already held in the protocol. This stablecoin will not rely on fiat reserves or centralized custodians. Instead, it will be minted from on-chain collateral with algorithmic adjustments ensuring a consistent and transparent supply. By redirecting borrowing interest payments into the ecosystem’s treasury, this system will fortify platform sustainability while giving borrowers a dependable stable asset. The native token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is the heartbeat of the protocol. With a total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens, its utility includes staking rewards and revenue redistribution. A portion of protocol profits will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This feedback loop drives token demand while incentivizing long-term participation. As the platform grows, this model will increase staking activity, deepen liquidity, and apply upward pressure on demand. Additionally, part of the protocol’s earnings will be allocated toward marketing and pool growth, reinforcing the ecosystem’s momentum.

The idea behind the feature is to be used for functional Web3 identifiers – anchors for Pi-powered apps, services, and storefronts. What Are pi Domains? Pi Network’s team described the .pi Domains Auction as a platform-level utility that “harnesses the collective resources of the Pi community and Open Network’s external connectivity to further Pi’s role in real-world commerce and digital interactions.” It’s supposed to expand the Pi ecosystem through strong participation from Pioneers, businesses, and developers. According to the team, it has seen over 100,000 bids within less than a week after its announcement (and over 200,000 in total), which shows encouraging signs of adoption and real engagement. .pi domains function similarly to traditional ones, acting as unique digital identifiers by enabling businesses, apps, and individuals to establish a clear online identity or digital storefront in a Web3 social network. They are created to operate within and outside the Pi Browser, as other wallets and browsers have the option to integrate the feature over time, similar to how other crypto-based domains work. In terms of Chrome and Safari compatibility, all .pi domains will work through the ‘.pinet.com’ extension. The team said all proceeds from this function will be “used to support the Pi ecosystem, including developer programs and events.” Recent Updates The latest on the .pi Domains Auction included two main updates and some bonuses. The first is an interface dedicated to showing statistics in real-time. Users can view domains with the most bids, the highest price, and the most recent trending bids alongside other information. This allows them to review a transparent snapshot of how the Auction is progressing and where the highest activity is occurring. The second update is the inclusion of .pi Domains Auction in the Pi App, following its initial release through the Pi Wallet, which enabled unique feature deployments, such as the stats page and email notifications. The bonus updates: refinement of the bidding interface to provide a cleaner and smoother experience; more Pionners can see and participate in the Auction as the Mainnet wallet accessibility has been “significantly” expanded; and lastly, the option to receive email notifications about updates for individual domains via the Settings tab.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $11.29, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $18.71 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price surged by 0.9% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.18 and $2.40, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for June 15 shows that the current value of Near price rose to the $2.25 mark as bulls triggered a correction. However, sellers are attempting to defend this upward move. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR faces bullish volatility toward $2.3 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the near protocol price trades in a recovery trend since declining toward $2.1. Buyers are now aiming for a strong push above $2.3 to maintain the recovery rally, defending a drop below $2.2. NEAR/USDT 1-day price chart The technical indicators suggest a drop in bullish momentum as NEAR previously declined toward $2.1, raising concerns of a short-term bearish rally. Moreover, the MACD is bearish at -0.022 units and suggests low buying demand. The EMAs are returning towards the mean position, and the latest data shows that indicator shows declining bearish pressure. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 39 from the 70.00 index level; though, it stills hints at bullish reversal. The wide Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility, indicating that the $2.3 level may not hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has met strong resistance at the $2.60 mark and the following selloff suggests high bearish momentum. If the buyers fail to defend $2.18 support, NEAR may see a freefall below that level.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 06:00:00

This rapidly growing Web3 infrastructure project, priced at just $0.0276 in Batch 29, is on track to move from an early-stage token to a fundamental Web3 asset. With the market shifting back into an optimistic gear, driven by BONK’s bullish comeback and Algorand’s stability, BlockDAG ’s unique technical advantages and its community-driven momentum are turning heads. The big question now: Could this Layer 1 project surge to $1 and become a key player in the Web3 revolution? Many investors think it’s possible. BONK Shows Resilience: A 10% Rally and Bullish Signals After a tough 21% drop over the past few weeks, BONK has made a surprising comeback, jumping 10% in just 24 hours. This bounce is backed by a promising technical signal: a Golden Cross on the MACD, where the blue line is about to cross above the orange signal line. At the same time, there’s been a noticeable increase in open interest and trading volume, with OKX traders leading the way. The platform reported a 1.27 buyer-to-seller ratio, showing a clear bullish trend. On top of the technicals, BONK is seeing impressive figures in the derivatives market, ranking second in both open interest ($5.54M) and trading volume ($14.55M). With daily spot purchases nearing $987K, the mood around BONK is shifting quickly from bearish to bullish. This reversal could spark renewed interest across other altcoins, especially for traders looking for quick, high-potential plays. ALGO’s Rebuild: Why Investors Are Watching Closely While BONK is riding the waves of volatility, Algorand (ALGO) is taking a steadier approach, showing signs of being in a critical accumulation phase. This suggests that long-term investors might be getting ready for a bigger move. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has set his sights on a target between $0.90 and $1.00, pointing to Fibonacci retracement levels and the completion of a correction phase. Currently sitting at $0.2036 with a daily volume of $69.45 million, ALGO is holding its ground even in these unpredictable market conditions. What sets Algorand apart from meme coins is its solid fundamentals. With ongoing development, strategic enterprise partnerships, and a growing presence in Web3 infrastructure, it’s more than just market noise. As the sentiment shifts and capital moves back into altcoins, ALGO might just lead the charge for rallies based on real utility and long-term value, rather than short-term hype. BlockDAG: The Layer 1 Star Ready for $1 Growth BlockDAG is capturing the spotlight as a cutting-edge Layer 1 protocol that combines powerful scalability, accessible mining, and real-world use. With a presale raise of over $303 million and a current price of just $0.0276 in Batch 29, it’s emerging as a major contender in the blockchain space. The projected launch price of $0.05 is sparking buzz, indicating strong early gains and even greater potential if the momentum continues. Unlike Algorand (ALGO), which has built a solid foundation with institutional backing, BlockDAG is making waves by appealing to a wider, more engaged audience. Its innovative X1 mobile mining app allows anyone with a smartphone to get involved through a Proof-of-Engagement model, a strategy that taps into the viral excitement seen in meme coins like BONK, but with robust, tech-driven infrastructure at its core. What sets BlockDAG apart is its advanced DAG-based architecture, designed for lightning-fast transaction speeds and scalability. With EVM compatibility, it seamlessly supports Ethereum dApps, and its low-latency P2P engine minimizes congestion and keeps fees low. On top of this, a comprehensive suite of developer tools ensures that BlockDAG is more than just a trend—it’s a serious platform for the future of Web3. With five exchange listings already confirmed, BlockDAG is primed for immediate visibility and liquidity, making it a standout in the Web3 space. If you’re eyeing the next big opportunity, BlockDAG is one to watch closely. Looking Ahead The competition for top Web3 coins is heating up, but BlockDAG is quickly carving out its space. While Algorand remains a solid choice for regulated DeFi and BONK continues to drive short-term trades, neither offers the same combination of scalability, grassroots access, and Layer 1 innovation that BlockDAG brings to the table. Investors are no longer chasing small gains; they’re hunting for projects with major growth potential—think 5x, 50x, or even 100x. In a time when institutional mistrust is high and retail investors are searching for the next big breakout, BlockDAG’s $0.05 to $1 growth target seems far from out of reach. With the market sentiment around BONK heating up and Algorand maintaining steady momentum, BlockDAG stands out as a blend of speculative opportunity, strong foundations, and broad accessibility. It’s the underdog with serious potential to lead in the Web3 space.

The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel’s strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin’s trend remains intact. Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin’s appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals. According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they’re focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline."" Park added that bitcoin’s global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty. As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded between $104,480.15 and $105,696.12, closing near $105,590, up 0.15%, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Support was reinforced in the $104,400–$104,500 zone, with high-volume accumulation during the 16:00–20:00 GMT window. A bullish reversal followed at 21:00, driving BTC above $105,000 on strong volumeIntraday breakout occurred at 02:01, with price jumping from $105,486 to $105,550 on elevated activity. Consolidation above $105,470 suggests further upside potential toward $106,000, pending sustained demand.

As mainstream players adopt blockchain technology with growing confidence, digital assets such as Qubetics are capturing attention for their innovation and community-driven models. Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a standout among the top trending cryptos to buy in June 2025, attracting a wide spectrum of users through its interoperability and scalable ecosystem. This recent surge follows a wave of pivotal announcements across the crypto world. Major partnerships, technological upgrades, and regulatory developments have bolstered confidence, lifting the entire market’s sentiment. For example, several Layer 1 blockchains have showcased increased adoption metrics, while oracle providers have secured integrations that promise enhanced data reliability. These advances create fertile ground for projects like Toncoin and Chainlink to assert their value as foundational layers within decentralized finance and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): The Interoperability Powerhouse Fueling Top Trending Cryptos to Buy in June Qubetics has rapidly become one of the top trending cryptos to buy in June, driven by its strategic focus on interoperability—a critical hurdle for widespread blockchain adoption.

Qubetics aims to bridge this gap through a robust, decentralized network that caters to diverse use cases from corporate solutions to individual finance. Interoperability stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, addressing the fragmentation that currently limits broader adoption. It ensures that distinct blockchain networks can communicate and operate cohesively, unlocking new levels of functionality and efficiency. The current $TICS crypto presale has entered its 37th stage, offering tokens at a fixed price of $0.3370. To date, the presale has distributed more than 515 million tokens among over 27,900 holders, generating upwards of $18 million in funding. Notably, only 10 million tokens remain at this price point, highlighting the urgency for participation before the price increases by 20% upon listing. This tokenomics overhaul has significantly reduced the total supply from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens, fostering scarcity and aligning incentives toward long-term ecosystem growth. Beyond its market mechanics, Qubetics focuses heavily on community governance and decentralization. With 38.55% of the total supply allocated to the public sale, control is shifting to the community, reinforcing transparency and collective decision-making. This design contrasts with earlier blockchain projects where centralized control hindered organic development and user trust. As blockchain adoption expands in sectors such as finance, supply chain, and identity verification, Qubetics positions itself as a critical infrastructure. Analysts forecast a strong price movement post-listing, driven by limited supply and robust demand, marking Qubetics as one of the top trending cryptos to buy in June 2025.

After initial development by Telegram, the TON ecosystem now operates independently, maintaining momentum through vibrant community development and technical upgrades. Toncoin’s architecture supports fast transaction speeds and low fees, positioning it as a practical alternative for decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social applications. Its sharded blockchain design enhances throughput, a key factor in scalability challenges facing many competitors. Such technical strengths contribute to Toncoin’s standing as one of the top trending cryptos to buy in June. The network’s focus on interoperability through bridges connecting TON with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain further solidifies its position as a versatile blockchain solution. These efforts underpin Toncoin’s prominence among the top trending cryptos to buy in June. Chainlink: Decentralized Oracles at the Core of Top Trending Cryptos to Buy in June Chainlink remains the leading decentralized oracle provider, enabling smart contracts on various blockchains to interact with real-world data securely and reliably. As the demand for blockchain-based financial products and automated agreements grows, Chainlink’s role becomes indispensable. Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network aggregates data from multiple sources, ensuring accuracy and resistance to manipulation. This functionality supports a vast array of applications, from DeFi to insurance and supply chain monitoring. Chainlink’s partnerships with major DeFi platforms and enterprise clients continue to grow, reinforcing its status as a cornerstone in blockchain infrastructure. These developments have solidified Chainlink’s standing among the top trending cryptos to buy in June 2025.

Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Explains,https://coinpedia.org/news/whats-going-on-in-the-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-explains/,"The post What’s Going On in the Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit? Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Explains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The never-ending legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC is back in the news — and pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton recently broke down exactly what’s happening. What’s This Settlement About? The SEC and Ripple have reached a proposed settlement. In it: The SEC wants to lower Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million The agency also wants the judge to remove an injunction (a legal order stopping Ripple from violating securities laws) If the judge agrees to this, the case would finally be settled and closed. But Judge Torres Pushed Back Many thought Judge Analisa Torres would quickly approve the deal, but she surprised both sides. According to Deaton, the judge told them: They cited the wrong legal rule They haven’t shown “exceptional circumstances,” a very strong legal reason — for why she should undo a decision she already made. Deaton explained that a judge can’t simply reverse an order without serious justification, especially after 4.5 years of work and resources poured into this case. Is a Deal Still Possible? Yes. Deaton believes the judge will likely approve the settlement eventually, giving it about a 70% chance, but she’s demanding a better explanation first. Both sides now need to show how this deal serves both private interests (Ripple and SEC) and the public interest (protecting other crypto investors and companies). They also need to convince her that settling now would save time, money, and resources for the courts and avoid risky appeals for both sides. Why Does It Matter? This case has been one of the most important for crypto regulation in the U.S. If the injunction is removed and the fine reduced: Ripple avoids a bigger penalty The SEC avoids risking a total loss on appeal The case officially closes without affecting Judge Torres’ earlier ruling that XRP itself is not a security in the U.S. Deaton stressed that the judge’s past ruling would still stand, and crypto companies would still need to follow U.S. securities laws.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 06:50:45

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an undecided trend regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has been maintained at $0.614 for the last 24 hours. If a downward momentum initiates, the SNX price might retest buyers’ support at the $0.585 level. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.88 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish trend, and SNX is following suit. From a larger picture, the token is following a bearish trend; however, the SNX price slightly increased to $0.614, gaining 1.32% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.29 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.60, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.60 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and at the start of June, the token is trading near $0.71 as the current Synthetix sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 07:00:00

As the market approaches a key inflection point, a recent update from crypto analyst XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) has brought renewed focus to the technical setup. The analyst has been tracking this price trend and provided a chart showing XRP hovering near the apex of a multi-month symmetrical triangle. The price recently faced resistance along the trendline that has capped upward movement for nearly six months, but XRPunkie expects a breakout soon. The chart shows the asset trading at $2.1, with price action now positioned just below the resistance boundary. The updated trendline, extending from the January 2025 high, reinforces the same structural formation XRPunkie highlighted earlier in the week. #XRP is finally coming to the apex of this huge 6 months accumulation triangle. If U haven't gotten enough XRP, now is NOT the time to wait for lower entry prices. We could be days away from a massive breakout.

Compression Building Toward Potential Breakout The symmetrical triangle , reinforced by the converging yellow trendlines and the visible compression in recent candles, shows that the asset is nearing the end of its consolidation range. Exponential and simple moving averages (EMA 21 and SMA 33) remain tightly wound near current levels, further emphasizing the stalling momentum. XRPunkie notes that the price is at a critical juncture: “Either we get a strong rejection here & continue to chop sideways more, or we’re gonna break out of it soon.” His updated chart retains a bullish bias, supported by a projected breakout zone highlighted in green, with a measured move potentially targeting the $13 to $15 range. This range is notable, as other analysts have expressed confidence that XRP can reach $15 . The asset is currently trading at $2.15, and its trajectory remains contingent on whether it can decisively flip the descending resistance into a support level.

A successful retest and hold above the trendline would represent a shift in market structure, implying that bullish momentum is regaining control. The importance of this trendline cannot be understated, as it has consistently capped every bullish attempt since January. The digital asset is now ready for lift-off , and the potential upside around the $13–$15 zone could bring life-changing gains to XRP Investors.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Gundlach says recent behavior in the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market appears “strange” to him, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, investors are beginning to sniff out the looming risks tied to the US government’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory. “In the last 15 years, there has been a number of corrections on the S&P 500, and in every single one of them, when the S&P goes down by more than 10%, the trade-weighted dollar index goes up. This time, the dollar went down when the S&P 500 went down by almost 20%. That’s strange, things are behaving differently. Usually when the Fed starts cutting interest rates, rates across the yield curve go down. The 10-year Treasury almost always goes up [in price] immediately following the first Fed rate cut, and then it keeps rallying for a while. This time, the 10-year yield went up, and the yield curve is steepening. So I think what we have is recognition that the interest expense for the United States is untenable – if we continue running a $2.1 trillion budget deficit and we continue to have sticky interest rates.” The Bond King zeroes in on foreign investors, noting that they hold tens of trillions of dollars in US assets. Gundlach says it is now within the realm of possibility for the investor cohort to start exiting US markets. “There’s a net investment position; foreigners were investing more in the US than the US was investing outside the country to the tune of $3 trillion. That was about 15 or 17 years ago. It’s now over $25 trillion is the net investment position, and the dollar is falling. It’s not inconceivable that some of that $25 trillion that came in not even two decades could go out.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Notably, Ripple's expansion ambitions led to the acquisition of Hidden Road , a well-known prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion last month. This move confirmed Ripple's growing focus on serving institutional clients and expanding its presence in traditional finance. Ripple Confirms Use of RLUSD for Post-Trade SettlementInterestingly, following the acquisition, Ripple confirmed that Ripple USD (RLUSD), its proprietary stablecoin, will handle Hidden Road's post-trade transactions, placing the stablecoin at the center of this new strategy.Since RLUSD also runs on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), most transactions will pass through the XRPL network. While XRP won't settle these trades directly, the asset is necessary as a transaction fee. The network burns these fees, which slowly reduces the total amount of XRP in circulation.Notably, Hidden Road processes around $3 trillion worth of transactions each year. If all of that activity moves to the XRPL, the network could see a sharp increase in traffic. To better understand what this might mean for XRP's price, we asked Grok, the AI chatbot from xAI, for an assessment.Grok Presents Factors That Could Impact XRP Price GrowthGrok explained that predicting the exact price is difficult because several factors play a role. These include how much of Hidden Road's volume actually lands on the XRPL, how many transactions it involves, how much XRP gets burned, and how investors react to the development. Ultimately, it predicted a possible rise in price to a range of $3.5 to $28.However, according to Grok, the burn rate on its own won't have a huge effect. If $3 trillion worth of transactions result in about one billion operations on XRPL, that would burn around 100,000 XRP each year. At the current price of $2.16, that's about $230,000, barely a dent in the total supply of around 58 billion XRP. Even if activity increases tenfold, the burned amount still remains small compared to the overall supply. Grok Analysis Grok Analysis However, Grok stressed that real value growth could come from rising demand and greater adoption. If RLUSD helps bring more institutional transactions to XRPL, XRP's role as the fuel that powers the network becomes more important. This utility could raise demand for XRP, especially if financial institutions start building more use cases around the XRPL.Further, Grok also pointed out that market sentiment could push the price higher. Ripple's acquisition of Hidden Road has already triggered excitement in crypto circles. If more investors and analysts start viewing this move as a sign of Ripple's strength in institutional finance, XRP could benefit from that optimism.XRP Price if XRPL Handles All of Hidden Road's TransactionsSpecifically, regarding price predictions, Grok presented a few possibilities. In a realistic scenario, where XRPL sees steady growth and RLUSD gains traction, XRP could climb to between $3.50 and $4.50 within the next six to twelve months. XRP Price if XRPL Handles All of Hidden Road Volume Grok XRP Price if XRPL Handles All of Hidden Road Volume | Grok If adoption picks up faster and market enthusiasm grows, XRP might reach between $5 and $10 over the next year or two.

According to Laffont, despite Bitcoin’s 13% increase so far in 2025, its volatility has decreased significantly compared to previous years. BTC’s sharp price swings have caused Coatue to avoid investing in the past. But that’s changing now. “The cost of entry into Bitcoin may be decreasing. If beta is decreasing, that would be really interesting,” Laffont said, noting that Bitcoin’s beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has decreased over time. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs by giants like BlackRock is a clear indication that BTC is maturing, according to Laffont. He also recalled that Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, but this decline was more striking compared to the fluctuations experienced, for example, after Trump's tariff announcement in April 2025. “Bitcoin is down only 5%, while Nasdaq is down more than 6% between April 2nd and April 10th. This shows that Bitcoin is now becoming a more resilient asset to risk events in the market,” he said. Additionally, the rate at which coins held in Bitcoin wallets for at least a month are being sold out has dropped significantly, suggesting that investors are moving away from short-term speculation and starting to view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Pointing out that Bitcoin’s share in total global wealth is still very low (0.4%) at around $2 trillion, Laffont said that this rate will inevitably increase over time: “If people continue to believe that Bitcoin is valuable, then that asset will become more valuable over time, which means it should become more central in portfolios.” Despite this, Laffont warned investors that Bitcoin’s weight in the portfolio should not be exaggerated: “Even if you think Bitcoin is going to be important, don’t put a large portion of your portfolio into it. A small but long-term position can make you less stressed and more profitable.” Related News: List of Today's Top 15 Trending Altcoins Published Laffont, who admitted that Coatue had previously missed the Bitcoin opportunity, attributes this mostly to their inability to think simply. According to Laffont, in the investment world, it is usually more profitable to focus on assets that people believe are valuable, rather than complex models: “For something to be valuable, everyone has to believe it is valuable. It was that simple, and we missed it.” Technology-focused hedge fund Coatue has invested in cryptocurrency and technology companies such as Dune Analytics, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave. CoreWeave also has a partnership with Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Dividing his investors into three, Laffont said that there are those who leave crypto completely to themselves, those who question why Bitcoin was entered late, and cautious investors who want to stay away from crypto. However, he stated that this cautious audience is decreasing a little more every year: “This group of abstainers is disappearing. They are becoming smaller and smaller every year.” *This is not investment advice.

It noted that there was a soaring interest from companies, with 81% of crypto-aware small and medium businesses (SMBs) expressing interest in using stablecoins. Additionally, Fortune 500 companies showing stablecoin interest have tripled compared to 2024, and 82% of SMBs said crypto can solve at least one major financial challenge. The Q2 2025 State of Crypto report just dropped. TL;DR: The world loves stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/agOZ8naqoF — Coinbase ️ (@coinbase) June 10, 2025 Stablecoins: The Future of Finance The firm also reported that organic stablecoin transfer volume has reached unprecedented levels, with the two highest monthly volume transfers in history over the past year in December and April. The stats don’t stop there. There are more than 160 million stablecoin holders worldwide, and global stablecoin supply grew 54% year-over-year. Additionally, stablecoin transfer volume in 2024 hit $27.6 trillion, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. “Regulatory clarity is the unlock for crypto’s next chapter,” the report noted, citing the GENIUS Act and other bills that are making their way through US Congress. “An overwhelming 9 in 10 Fortune 500 executives agree that clear, consistent US regulation around crypto, blockchain, and onchain technologies is essential to support ongoing innovation. “ The United States is not the only nation pushing for stablecoin regulation. This week, the newly elected president of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, made good on his campaign pledge by proposing the Digital Asset Basic Act. The legislation allows local companies to issue stablecoins with a minimum equity capital of 500 million KRW ($US368,000), and they need to guarantee refunds through reserves and get regulatory approval. However, the wheels are turning much more slowly in Europe, where the European Central Bank wants its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) and regional governments want to maintain their tight grip on monetary flows. Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook The current stablecoin ecosystem is dominated by just two players, Tether and Circle. Tether has a 61% stablecoin market share with $155 billion in circulation. USDT supply has surged around 38% over the past 12 months to an all-time high on June 10. Circle’s USDC has also surged with a circulation of $61 billion, giving it a market share of 24%. The two companies produce 85% of the stablecoins in the market at the moment. Maker’s USDS, formerly DAI, is the third-largest with $7.2 billion and the only true high-cap decentralized stablecoin.

XRP Army Reacts,https://timestabloid.com/what-is-the-minimum-price-you-are-willing-to-sell-your-xrp-at-xrp-army-reacts/,"A tweet posted by prominent crypto enthusiast “XRP Avengers” has gotten attention from the XRP community after posing a direct question to holders: “What is the minimum price you are willing to sell your $XRP at? $5, $10, $50, $100, $500 or $1000?” The question prompted numerous responses from long-term investors and crypto community members, many of whom articulated strong personal strategies for holding or selling the digital asset. The tweet reflects the sentiment from XRP holders who view the asset not only as a medium of exchange or investment but as a key component of their future financial plans. What is the minimum price you are willing to sell your $XRP at? $5, $10, $50, $100, $500 or $1000? #XRP — XRP Avengers (@XRP_Avengers) June 11, 2025 Long-Term XRP Price Projection One community member, identified as “yves,” responded by stating that if the ecosystem surrounding XRP develops positively, he has no intention of selling at all. According to yves, XRP is his “generational wealth coin,” and he claimed that in his forecast, XRP could reach $100,000 within the next ten years. He clarified that while he does hold other digital assets that he may choose to liquidate, XRP is not one of them. Specifically, he pointed to SHX as a coin he intends to sell, setting a sell price of €3.33. He concluded by referencing his long-term commitment to the XRP community, saying he has been involved in the space “for too long,” and characterized his stance as a reflection of his broader investment philosophy. Some Holders Emphasize Utility Over Liquidation Another reply came from a user identified as “Charlie Sunshine,” who rejected the idea of selling XRP entirely. Instead, he advocated for leveraging XRP as a long-term asset through investment rather than liquidation. In his words, “Sell?? Invest it and you’ll never have to sell it. That’s the point. Its uses are limitless.” His view aligns with others who believe XRP’s potential lies in its future utility rather than in short-term price targets. More Cautious Voices Point to Current Market Levels In contrast to those projecting high valuations or indefinite holding strategies, a third community member named “S.M” offered a more tempered perspective. S.M highlighted the current market valuation, noting that at the time of their comment, XRP was priced at $2.24. From this standpoint, they regarded all the hypothetical price points mentioned in the original tweet as speculative. S.M emphasized that XRP must first surpass the $5.00 mark before more ambitious targets can be taken seriously, framing the discussion in more immediate and realistic terms. Varied XRP Investment Approaches These varying responses illustrate a range of investor attitudes toward XRP’s future. Some are focused on the digital asset’s perceived long-term potential and institutional adoption, while others maintain a more price-conscious and incremental approach. The community includes both those who regard XRP as a key store of value and those who view it within the context of broader portfolio strategies. While opinions differ on what constitutes an acceptable exit price, the level of engagement highlights the significance XRP still holds within the crypto investor base.

According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, stablecoins could soon reach their breakthrough moment, akin to the iPhone’s launch in 2007. In a post on Saturday, Allaire said the industry is “not quite yet at the iPhone moment ” when developers universally recognize the potential of programmable digital dollars. However, he acknowledged that the day was fast approaching. Calling stablecoins “the highest utility form of money ever created,” Allaire’s remarks responded to a post from a16z Crypto partner Sam Broner, who argued that stablecoins foster competition and reduce the costs of building financial applications. Broner noted that stablecoins allow anyone to program money, fostering more competition, which leads to better prices, improved user experiences, and greater access. Retail giants and e-commerce leaders embrace stablecoins Allaire’s optimism coincides with reports that US retail giants Walmart and Amazon are exploring their own US dollar-backed stablecoins, signaling increased institutional interest. Meanwhile, e-commerce powerhouse Shopify recently confirmed plans to integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin for payments by the end of 2025. The global e-commerce giant is rolling out the early access in collaboration with major US exchange Coinbase. According to a spokesperson for Shopify, a limited number of merchants will immediately have access to the full product starting on June 13 as part of the early access rollout. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke said in an X post on Thursday that they think that stablecoins are a natural way to transact on the internet and worked with Coinbase to develop the commerce payment protocol smart contract that powers this work. Daren Matsuoka, a data scientist at a16z, emphasized the transformative potential of stablecoins in onboarding the next billion crypto users. In a June 6 post, he highlighted the staggering $33 trillion in transaction volume processed by stablecoins over the past year — nearly 20 times more than PayPal and almost three times that of Visa. Circle surges as stablecoin momentum grows and the GENIUS Act advances The spike in the adoption of stablecoin comes just days after the public debut of Circle on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5. Shares of the company jumped 167% on its first day of trading, a sign of keen investor interest. However, rival stablecoin USDT’s issuer, Tether, has no intention of following suit. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said on June 8 that Tether will continue to be a private company for the foreseeable future. Allaire’s forecast of an “iPhone moment” for stablecoins is starting to look plausible as competition heats up and use cases multiply. The future of stablecoin issuance for many companies may depend on the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. This bill seeks to establish clear rules around collateralization and enforce Anti-Money Laundering compliance. These regulations could pave the way for greater institutional adoption in the world’s largest US economy. On Thursday, the US Senate advanced the bill with a 68–30 vote, as Majority Leader John Thune called on lawmakers to rally behind the legislation. A bipartisan majority, including several Democrats, voted to invoke cloture, moving the bill toward a full floor vote before it heads to the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, firms associated with major banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo have reportedly explored launching a joint stablecoin initiative.

Deaton clarified that his analysis was not aimed at discrediting the lawyers involved, but instead focused on what he believed was missing from the recent motion. He emphasized that his critique should not be interpreted as a call for deference or excessive flattery toward Judge Analisa Torres. Responding to a comment implying that he and fellow commentator Freddy Rizzo believed Ripple and the SEC should have been more deferential to Judge Torres, Deaton refuted the suggestion directly. He stated that he sees a 70% chance that the requested relief will be granted, and he plans to further elaborate on his reasoning in a subsequent post. Someone posted a comment that said “we get it: you and @freddyriz believe @Ripple and the @SECGov should’ve kissed Judge Torres’ ass more. That’s not it. In fact, I believe there’s a 70% chance she grants the relief requested and I’ll discuss it more in detail tomorrow. … https://t.co/QXf65N87dR — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 14, 2025 Expectations Around SEC Accountability Deaton expressed disappointment that the SEC did not acknowledge prior overreach in its enforcement actions against crypto firms . He believed the SEC could have benefited from recognizing how past leadership had engaged in aggressive tactics, citing judicial rebukes such as the appellate court’s finding of “arbitrary and capricious” actions and the sanctions imposed on SEC attorneys in the Debt Box case. He also referenced Judge Sarah Netburn’s prior comment that SEC lawyers “lacked faithful allegiance to the law” in the Ripple proceedings. From Deaton’s perspective, a more effective argument would have included some recognition of these developments. He thinks the SEC had an opportunity to demonstrate an evolution in its stance by referencing these prior legal setbacks and using them as context for supporting the relief request. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Missed Opportunity to Emphasize Regulatory Shifts Deaton also believed that Ripple’s legal team, which includes a former SEC Director of Enforcement, could have done more to explain the real-world implications of continuing to operate under a potential injunction. He noted that the pending legislative developments —such as the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act—constitute exceptional circumstances that could be relevant to the court’s decision-making. According to him, this legislative context and its implications for business competitiveness were not fully brought forward. He added that Ripple is disadvantaged as long as an injunction hangs over it, particularly when compared to competitors like Circle , which operate without such legal restrictions. Financial institutions and corporate partners tend to favor legal certainty, and Ripple’s position could be weakened if these risks are not removed. Legal Strategy Versus Judicial Standards Ultimately, Deaton summarized that the legal argument seemed to lean on the political shift following the U.S. presidential election, rather than offering a robust rationale that would meet the court’s standards for reconsidering a prior decision. He suggested that merely referencing a couple of case precedents was insufficient and that the legal team appeared to be assuming the judge would be willing to reverse her earlier position based on minimal legal reasoning. Deaton closed by acknowledging that his expectations might reflect a lack of experience in such high-level legal proceedings. Nevertheless, he indicated that he had anticipated a more detailed and strategic approach aimed at persuading a judge who believes her prior ruling aligns with existing law. He concluded his post by encouraging followers to tune in the next day for an objective breakdown of both the arguments for and against granting the requested relief. He also noted that CryptoLawUS would follow up with a poll regarding the likely outcome. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Trump disclosed over $600 million in 2024 earnings, much of it from crypto ventures. His total asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, with significant income from NFTs, token sales, and real estate. The revelation raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest during his presidency. The filing , made public Friday, outlines the president’s sprawling business portfolio, including significant gains from digital assets and meme coin projects. While the exact timeframe isn’t specified, the report appears to cover income through the end of December 2024. Trump Assets Top $1.6 Billion, Earnings Surge Trump’s estimated asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis . Notably, a large portion of his 2024 windfall came from crypto-related endeavors, including over $320 million in estimated fees from the meme coin $TRUMP, and more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm. The disclosure also shows Trump received $57.35 million from token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The report sheds light on the growing entanglement between Trump’s business interests and the U.S. crypto industry. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office.

While exact valuations are unclear, revenue from branded merchandise and licensing deals continue to flow in. Among them, $2.8 million from Trump Watches, $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances, and over $1 million from his NFT trading cards. In the physical world, Trump’s Florida golf resorts brought in $217.7 million, led by the Trump National Doral, which earned over $110 million. Additional income came from real estate projects in India, Dubai, and Vietnam, with licensing and development fees totaling over $30 million. The filing also included $12 million in passive income through investments in Blue Owl Capital and U.S. bond funds. Despite previously claiming to have distanced himself from day-to-day management, the disclosure confirms Trump remains deeply tied to the financial performance of his vast network of businesses, including crypto. SEC Approves Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-Linked Registration As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. While the approval gives TMTG flexibility to raise capital, the firm says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. After Pi Coin doubts, investors eye Neo Pepe Coin, a tech-powered memecoin blending utility with DeFi and NFT potential. Table of Contents Pi Coin experience vs. Neo Pepe’s movement Why Neo Pepe Coin stands out Smart contracts driving real value Ethereum liquidity pool integration Deflationary tokenomics creating scarcity How Polygon innovations strengthen Neo Pepe’s model Polymarket case study Presale alert, Neo Pepe Coin’s big opportunity Think smarter with smart contracts and memecoins Pi Coin once promised to change the crypto space with its ambitious goal of accessibility. However, many have now begun questioning whether it has turned into one of the biggest rug pulls of the year. For those that are burned by Pi Coin (or almost fell for it), they may be wondering where to look next for potential high-value investments. Enter Neo Pepe Coin, a memecoin powered by cutting-edge technology and smart contract functionality that offers real value far beyond just hype. Neo Pepe Coin isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan memecoin. With promising applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and play-to-earn gaming, it positions itself as a hybrid of fun branding and serious utility. Buyers looking to cash in on the next big crypto opportunity may want to explore this ecosystem model, especially with its presale currently underway . Below, we’ll deep-dive into Neo Pepe Coin’s groundbreaking features, the role of smart contracts, and how its ecosystem leverages Ethereum liquidity pools and deflationary tokenomics to deliver long-term value. Stick around to find out why joining this early could be a smart move for your investment portfolio. You might also like: Pepe price due for a healthy pullback after 30% rally Pi Coin experience vs. Neo Pepe’s movement Before we explore Neo Pepe Coin, we need to reflect on one of the most debated crypto stories this year. Pi Coin launched with enormous hype, marketed as a game-changing platform that made mining accessible through mobile devices. Yet, its utility and transparency have been marred by criticism, with many calling it a borderline rug pull. Investors placed their faith in Pi Coin, only to discover limited real-world utility and questionable long-term potential. Learning from such experiences, the crypto community seeks coins that integrate robust functionality, community-driven governance, and transparency. This is where Neo Pepe Coin stands apart, with its focus on innovation and utility. Why Neo Pepe Coin stands out Unlike purely speculative tokens, Neo Pepe Coin is backed by tangible utility and unique features that redefine what a memecoin can achieve. From its smart contract capabilities to Ethereum liquidity pool integration, Neo Pepe Coin creates a comprehensive ecosystem for savvy crypto investors. Smart contracts driving real value Neo Pepe Coin leans heavily into the power of smart contracts to offer real-world value. These contracts automate agreements between parties without relying on intermediaries, making them ideal for: Staking and Farming: Invest Neo Pepe Coins in DeFi protocols to earn passive income while contributing to the ecosystem. NFT Compatibility: Neo Pepe’s smart contracts enable seamless integration with decentralized NFT exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, or trade digital collectibles. Gaming Rewards: The play-to-earn gaming sector is growing rapidly, and Neo Pepe Coin is positioning itself as a go-to token for transparent and secure in-game rewards. This application of smart contracts ensures Neo Pepe Coin has utility well beyond the humor-filled image of its meme origins. Ethereum liquidity pool integration Neo Pepe Coin thrives on integration with Ethereum liquidity pools, offering investors several tangible benefits: Smooth Trades: The liquidity pool eliminates price fluctuations during transactions, allowing for efficient and cost-effective trading. Ecosystem Strength: By participating in Ethereum’s liquidity pool, Neo Pepe contributes to sustaining and expanding one of the largest blockchain ecosystems. Enhanced Returns: Investors enjoy dual exposure to the proven stability of Ethereum and the explosive growth potential of Neo Pepe Coin. By linking itself with Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, Neo Pepe Coin creates a synergistic relationship that amplifies its value proposition. Deflationary tokenomics creating scarcity Unlike inflationary tokens that flood the market with excess supply, Neo Pepe Coin adopts a deflationary model. Here’s why this matters: Token Burning: Periodic token burns reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and driving long-term value. Sustainable Growth: Lower supply combined with rising demand ensures steady upward pressure on token prices. Community Incentives: This setup rewards early adopters and holders by making their tokens more valuable over time. This deflationary mechanism ensures Neo Pepe Coin doesn’t fall victim to the pitfalls of oversupply, as many other coins have. How Polygon innovations strengthen Neo Pepe’s model Neo Pepe Coin’s affiliation with the Polygon ecosystem amplifies its strengths. Often called the “Internet of Blockchains,” Polygon addresses Ethereum’s scalability issues with faster transaction speeds and lower fees. Platforms like Polymarket have thrived on Polygon’s infrastructure. Neo Pepe Coin similarly leverages Polygon’s capabilities, promising investors and users a seamless experience within its ecosystem. Polymarket case study Polymarket’s success on Polygon demonstrates how tokens like Neo Pepe can thrive. By offering real-time trade settlements at minimal costs, Polymarket has set the standard for what a next-gen crypto platform can achieve. Neo Pepe Coin mirrors this ethos, making DeFi, gaming, and NFT transactions efficient and affordable. Presale alert, Neo Pepe Coin’s big opportunity Now that Pepe Coin’s incredible potential has been explained, it’s time to talk about strategy. The presale phase is where the smart money moves in. Here’s why: Exclusive Pricing: Token prices during presale are significantly lower than their listing price, creating a perfect entry point for early supporters. Community Perks: Earn access to exclusive NFTs, governance rights, and bonus rewards as part of the early adopter family. Rapid Growth Potential: Joining before public launch means you’re at the forefront of one of the most promising crypto revolutions. Getting involved is easier. How to Join its presale Visit the Official Website: Head over to Neo Pepe Coin’s verified page to get started. Connect a Wallet: Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet for safe and seamless transactions. Buy Tokens: Select how much to invest and complete the purchase. (Tip: Act early for the best deals.) Hold and Watch: Secure tokens and keep an eye on their rise as the ecosystem grows. Think smarter with smart contracts and memecoins Neo Pepe Coin isn’t just another token riding on the memecoin wave. It’s a thoughtful, utility-driven platform marrying smart contracts, deflationary tokenomics, and Ethereum liquidity pools to offer something truly valuable in the crypto space. While other tokens might deliver short-term hype with little substance, Neo Pepe Coin has all the ingredients for long-term success. Ready to make smarter investments and join the future of memecoins with real value? Don’t miss out on the presale and the chance to be part of a community that turns jokes into serious profits.

Investors and market watchers both find great interest in this forecast. The issue now is whether XYZVerse will really redefine the scene and fulfill on high standards. Is a 30x Jump Possible for XYZVerse ($XYZ)? Price Prediction XYZVerse entered the meme coin space at a period when community-driven tokens still rule speculative trading. The emergence of meme coins such as PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows how powerfully community involvement, viral marketing, and strong branding can propel large increases. The potential of XYZVerse depends much on the general mood of the market as well. Lower-cap meme coins are attracting more interest as the altcoin season gets underway. XYZVerse could profit from this wave if it gets strategic exchange listings and keeps community buzz after launch since it is still in presale. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: The Future of Fast and Free DeFi Trading Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform aiming to change decentralized finance (DeFi). Built from the ground up, it offers a custom Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability. At its heart is HyperBFT, a unique consensus mechanism that ensures transactions are finalized quickly and securely. One of Hyperliquid’s standout features is its focus on perpetual futures trading directly on its native blockchain. Unlike many platforms, it eliminates gas fees for transactions, making trading more affordable and efficient. With a fully on-chain order book, Hyperliquid provides transparency and security, as every transaction is verifiable on the blockchain. In today’s market, Hyperliquid looks promising. Its approach to fast, cost-free trading meets the growing demand for efficient DeFi solutions. The development team, with backgrounds from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT, brings strong expertise to the project. Being self-funded, Hyperliquid operates independently, focusing solely on its vision without outside pressures. Compared to other coins, its zero gas fees and high-performance blockchain give it an edge. As the DeFi space evolves, platforms that offer speed, security, and low costs are likely to attract more users. Hyperliquid’s unique features position it well in the current market cycle. ICP: Paving the Way for a Decentralized Internet Revolution Imagine an internet where apps run at lightning speed without relying on big tech companies. That’s the vision of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation. ICP aims to transform the internet from just a network for sharing information into a global computing platform. It seeks to enable decentralized applications to operate swiftly and securely, reducing costs and boosting efficiency. This could reshape the way we experience the digital world, making it more open, secure, and user-friendly. In today’s market, ICP stands out with its bold goals and cutting-edge technology. While many cryptocurrencies focus on digital money, ICP is building the backbone for a new kind of internet. This sets it apart from other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the market looks for projects with real-world use, ICP’s approach could make it an attractive option. By challenging traditional cloud services and decreasing reliance on big tech, ICP has the potential to revolutionize the digital landscape. For those watching market trends, ICP might be a coin worth keeping an eye on. Conclusion Though HYPE and ICP are commendable, XYZVerse’s sports-meme fusion and community focus make it poised for exceptional growth, offering early adopters a chance to ride the 2025 bull run.

However, each attempt was met with an immediate rejection, and the last one pushed BTC south to under $106,000. Although the bulls managed to recover some ground on Thursday and pushed bitcoin to $108,400, the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East resulted in an immediate price drop that drove the asset south to under $103,000. Although the attacks continued in the following 48 hours, including a few retaliations by Iran, BTC’s price recovered some ground and even jumped above $106,000 hours ago. However, US President Trump weighed in on the matter once again at that point and threatened Iran with “the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces” if Tehran decides to retaliate against the US in some form.

Saylor stated that the United States should not miss this change, saying, “It is in the interest of the United States to have as much Bitcoin as possible before other countries realize this transformation.” According to Saylor, the BTC network will form the basis of future capital flows as a decentralized financial infrastructure, so it is strategically important for countries, especially the US, to invest in Bitcoin early.

With a near 600% rally from November 2024 to January 2025, XRP was the best-performing asset among the top cryptocurrencies during the Trump-led market-wide rally, as confirmed by CNBC . However, while some might consider XRP holders lucky, they fail to acknowledge the years of agony suffered by these investors.John Squire, a market commentator, recently called attention to this. According to him, if patience was a crypto token, XRP holders would have already assumed billionaire status. This is due to their ability to hold the asset through seven years of price struggles. John Squire on X John Squire on X XRP Faced a Turbulent Period After 2018For context, after surging over 68,000% from March 2017 to January 2018, XRP price stumbled considerably. This downturn continued for over two years, with XRP reaching a new low of $0.1140 by March 2020. Notably, this marked a massive 97% crash from the $3.8 all-time high.When XRP attempted a recovery push in November 2020, soaring 177% that month, it encountered a fundamental issue. Specifically, the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple began the month after, triggering a 67% crash in December, XRP's highest-ever monthly loss.The asset witnessed a bearish campaign after December 2020, as several U.S. and Canadian exchanges ceased trading. Massive selloffs also engulfed the asset, triggering intense bearish pressure. As a result of this, XRP missed the 2021 bull run and faced relegation below the top 5 list of largest assets.While other assets posted new gains in 2021, XRP failed to leverage the uptrend due to the bearish pressure, only rising to $1.96 in April 2021, 92% away from its 2017/2018 all-time high. XRP Holders Remained Unperturbed Amid the StrugglesNotably, despite the bearish campaign, most XRP investors held strong. Interestingly, the number of XRP holders continued to increase during this turbulent period. Specifically, data from Santiment confirms that there were about 986,000 XRP holders in January 2018 amid the all-time high.However, despite the downturn that followed, the number of XRP holders quickly crossed the 1 million threshold and continued to increase. Over the next few years, amid the price collapse and the SEC lawsuit, existing holders held strong, and the market welcomed new entrants. Total XRP Holders Santiment Total XRP Holders | Santiment Between January 2018 and December 2022, XRP welcomed over 3.53 million new holders. Ironically, the growth pace saw a remarkable uptick from November and December 2020 when the SEC lawsuit began. This pace dropped after the effects of the May 2022 Terra collapse.Reward for Patience?Now, XRP is attempting to make up for years of what many have believed to be an elaborate price suppression campaign. The near 600% rally from November 2024 to January 2025 is the first step toward this recovery effort.Multiple analysts believe a much larger upsurge is imminent, citing XRP's 2017 price action. Analysts like BarriC believe their patience will be rewarded, and not at meager prices such as $2.

According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter say that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Such a move would mark a major shift away from the traditional finance system, which includes the nation’s largest banks and credit providers. Other firms that are reportedly exploring the potential use of stablecoins include Expedia Group and unnamed airline companies. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to other assets – such as the dollar, precious metals, or other crypto assets – and are typically backed on a one-to-one basis. Stablecoins have been gaining traction recently due to their low transaction fees and faster payment processing times. The firms’ decisions may ultimately depend on the fate of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill still making its way through Congress and yet to pass either chamber. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, aims to establish a regulatory framework for alternative payment systems, opening the door for new players to compete with giants like Visa and MasterCard. The sources say that Amazon’s stablecoin exploration has mostly revolved around creating one for online purchases, while Walmart has lobbied to change the GENIUS Act to introduce more competition in the credit-card sector. The firms are also considering how to use existing stablecoins if they decide not to create their own.

Experts Break Down the Math,https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-handle-14-of-swift-volume-experts-break-down-the-math/,"At the APEX 2025 developer summit, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that XRP could facilitate up to 14% of SWIFT’s total volume within five years. With the global interbank messaging network handling over $30 trillion in annual cross-border transactions, such a goal implies a dramatic expansion in XRP’s utility. While some dismissed the claim as aspirational, the post-event analysis has introduced rigorous, data-driven models suggesting XRP could fulfill that role under the right conditions. Conservative Liquidity Calculations Crypto expert and commentator Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) offered a grounded view of how much XRP would be needed to handle a $4.2 trillion annual volume, representing just a fraction of SWIFT’s total, under conservative assumptions. Based on a token price of $2.15 and an average transaction cycle of three minutes for liquidity management, the calculation estimates that 11.15 million XRP could facilitate that volume, amounting to only 0.0190% of the 58.82 billion circulating supply. The key factor underpinning this conclusion is high token velocity. If each XRP is reused every three minutes, that enables up to 480 bridge transactions per day per token. On a VERY CONSERVATIVE calculation, 11.15 million XRP (at $2.15) is needed to facilitate $4.2 trillion annually. That is approximately 0.0190% of the circulating supply of 58.82 billion. The exact number depends on real-world velocity & liquidity. We know the settlement times… https://t.co/ZDtHHV2WMZ pic.twitter.com/QZohB8CGIX — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) June 14, 2025 The Critical Role of Velocity in XRP Valuation However, this high-frequency assumption is theoretical and rarely mirrored in actual market conditions. Another contributor, responding to Eri’s model, elaborated on the practical realities of using XRP as a bridge asset . If liquidity recycles more slowly, for instance, at 100 or even 50 transactions per day, the price of the asset must increase significantly to maintain the same transaction capacity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The example given shows that at only 50 transactions per day, XRP would need to be priced at approximately $20.64 to handle the same $4.2 trillion throughput. At 10 daily transactions, the price would have to hit $103.20. This shift shows how reduced velocity increases demand per token, exerting upward pressure on price. Some experts believe the pressure from this volume could push the asset even higher, with one expert recently suggesting a potential 16,400% surge to $357 is conservative. Can XRP Handle This Volume? XRP settles in 3 to 5 seconds, but real-world frictions, such as uneven transaction flow, regulatory delays, and fiat off-ramps, limit effective reuse, forcing liquidity providers to hold extra XRP and reducing practical turnover despite automation. However, XRP is still significantly faster than SWIFT and similar legacy systems, leading to louder calls for the adoption of the digital asset as a SWIFT replacement . If XRP is to support a sizable share of global payment volume, the required price depends less on how quickly and efficiently each token can be cycled through the system.

This growth has been supported by recent development, including the recent inflows from institutional investors. Amid this positive performance, several coins are flashing bullish signals, which warrant a closer look. These three coins could be your ticket to massive gains in the crypto world in June 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is leading the way amongst altcoins, rising over 9% in the past week, something that has not happened in a while. It is currently above $2,640, with some analysts forecasting that it could rise to $2,800 in the next few weeks. So far, its weekly gains are almost double those of Bitcoin (BTC). However, for investors looking for bigger gains, the best place to look would be in the presale market, where coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have captured the attention of investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is still in the presale phase, is causing a lot of excitement with forecasts of 2,345% in gains or higher. XRP The XRP coin has been in the news a lot lately, and mainly for positive reasons. Recently, the CEO of Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, made clear his intentions to make XRP a replacement for SWIFT. In his estimation, XRP could take over as much as 14% of the market from SWIFT. However, regulatory challenges remain for the global adoption of XRP. Even in the US, its home market, the project is still not in the clear with the SEC. It is expected that it would face similar challenges in large markets globally, such as in the EU, which has a tougher stance on crypto. Despite these challenges, XRP is up nearly 5% in the past week. However, it is still down over 15% in the past month. As these price swings continue, savvy investors are increasingly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for long-term sustainable growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The Source Of Growth In 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been throwing a lot of bullish signals since the presale began. For instance, it has over 20k followers across all its social media channels, which is a major indicator of the potential for community growth once it goes live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for the current phase have been sold, barely two weeks after it began. The presale has managed to raise over $10.6 million from around 12,000 unique buyers. All these figures point to a high participation rate, which foreshadows massive gains when the tokens go live. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The stepped increase in the price started back in phase 1, when prices were at $0.01 per token. These increases are designed to ensure that the earlier supporters get the biggest benefits. The Technical Innovations Of The Protocol The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a marvel of innovation that pushes the limits of what is possible with DeFi technology. Users of the protocol can join as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their funds in pools to earn interest, with the rate based on the pool utilization rate. Lenders receive mtTokens in exchange for their deposits, which are based on the ERC20 token standard. As such, they can trade them on exchanges that support the standard. They ensure that holders can benefit from crypto market opportunities in real time, while still earning interest. The mtTokens represent the value of the initial deposit plus any interest accrued, which helps to simplify the overall user experience. That is because holders of the mtTokens do not have to actively claim or compound their gains. Instead, the value of their tokens is updated in real time on-chain to reflect the accrued interest. A People-Focused Approach Mutuum Finance is a people-focused protocol that aims to ensure their earnings are protected and they continue to earn interest and make profits sustainably. In line with this, the project does token vetting to ensure users are not exposed to poor-quality assets. Additionally, all borrowers must over-collateralize their loan positions. That ensures the lenders’ assets are protected in case of massive price movements. Additionally, it ensures that the protocol can liquidate positions quickly when they fall in danger of under-collateralization. In support of the safety of its community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a bug bounty program. This is an open invitation to blockchain experts, security analysts, and researchers to investigate the code and identify any vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program will be a continuing program that will use incentives to ensure that any bugs are identified fast and acted upon in good time. With a people-focused approach and the presale blazing past milestones, the analysts’ forecast of gains of over 20x is something to take seriously. This project could be one of your biggest crypto gainers of this summer if you take advantage of the opportunity and get your MUTM tokens at the low price of $0.03 per token.

Every month, another token distribution falls prey to coordinated bot attacks. Within minutes of launch, automated programs claim a significant portion of the supply, leaving genuine users with nothing but frustration. The pattern repeats with alarming regularity: a project announces an airdrop, bots flood the system, and real users find themselves crowded out––from Kaito (systemic flaws enabling bot predation) to Linea (the sheer scale of Sybil farming) to Magic Eden (technical vulnerabilities exploited by bots), and more. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion Beyond token grabs, governance systems across web3 also face increasing manipulation. Voting mechanisms designed to serve as vox populi become puppet shows instead, with single entities controlling multiple identities to sway outcomes in their favor. What appears to be community consensus often masks the influence of a concentrated few operating via bot armies. This problem intensifies as new tokens launch daily, with each facing the same fundamental challenge of reaching real humans rather than automated scripts. Without solving this identity verification challenge, web3 remains vulnerable to exploitation, undermining its foundational promise. Enter zero-knowledge cryptography, which offers a logical and attainable solution. This technology, evolving from mathematical theory into practical applications, can solve this core contradiction by enabling the verification of humanity without exposing personal information. The privacy paradox Web3 advertises the promise of decentralized systems that preserve user privacy while enabling trustless interactions. Yet today, projects face a seemingly impossible choice when verifying users. On one hand, there are conventional KYC solutions—intrusive identity verification systems that demand personal documentation and create centralized repositories of sensitive data. These systems not only contradict web3’s ethos but also present security vulnerabilities. In an era where deepfakes and AI-generated content can easily circumvent traditional verification methods, KYC has become both philosophically and practically problematic. On the other hand, there are soft spam prevention mechanisms that preserve privacy but fail to provide meaningful protection against bot attacks. Captchas, email verification, and social media checks can be effortlessly bypassed by determined attackers, leaving projects exposed to Sybil attacks. What’s revealing is that users themselves recognize this dilemma. While few prioritize privacy for casual social media interactions, sentiment changes dramatically when financial transactions or personal identification come into play. People want privacy for what truly matters—their money and their identity. A human problem, not a technical one Crypto’s deepest challenges don’t solely lie in blockchain mechanics, consensus algorithms, or smart contract optimization. They exist at the boundary where digital systems meet human reality. While the industry has made significant strides in reducing gas fees and speeding up transactions, it has struggled to translate real-world trust into the digital realm. This represents a human problem first and foremost. Without reliable human verification, the web of trust that underpins all social and economic systems can’t translate to digital spaces. We need systems that recognize genuine human participants without requiring them to surrender their privacy. Too many projects have attempted to solve this by building entirely new trust infrastructures from scratch. They launch new networks, create isolated verification mechanisms, and inevitably fail to generate meaningful network effects. These isolated efforts fragment the ecosystem rather than strengthen it. How do we verify someone’s humanity without demanding they surrender their personal data? The zero-knowledge solution Zero-knowledge proofs—once theoretical mathematical constructs—now offer a practical solution to this paradox. This cryptographic approach allows users to prove specific facts about themselves without revealing any underlying data. For identity, this means that one can verify they possess a valid government-issued ID without sharing any of the personal information contained within it. They can prove they’re of legal age without revealing their birthdate; confirm they’re from an eligible jurisdiction without disclosing their address; or establish they’re a unique human without exposing their identity. This technological approach enables truly Sybil-resistant systems while preserving the privacy principles that define web3. A person can only register once, preventing bot farmers from creating thousands of fake accounts while maintaining complete control over their personal information. This works through mathematical verification of cryptographic signatures already embedded in modern electronic passports and IDs. When a country issues a passport, it digitally signs the document’s data with its private key. Using zero-knowledge circuits, users can prove this signature exists and is valid against the country’s public key without exposing its data. The verification confirms the government vouched for this person without sharing who they are, functioning like a mathematical black box that outputs only “valid” or “invalid” while keeping all personal details sealed inside. Practical applications are already emerging across the web3 landscape. Airdrops can now implement genuine one-verification-equals-one-claim systems, preventing bot armies from draining token supplies. Projects can verify a user’s age for compliance without collecting birthdate information. Services can confirm a user’s country of origin without storing precise location data. DeFi protocols can restrict specific functions based on regulatory requirements without compromising user privacy. Building bridges between trust systems The solution to web3’s identity crisis doesn’t require reinventing trust from scratch. It can be done by building secure bridges between existing trust infrastructures, like government-issued IDs and digital systems. By extracting the cryptographic signatures from electronic passports and other official documents and then verifying them against issuing authorities’ public keys, we can create a privacy-preserving pathway between established trust systems and emerging digital economies. This approach leverages existing infrastructure rather than building parallel systems. It recognizes that trust already exists in the world––the challenge is translating it to digital contexts without compromising personal sovereignty. In sum, zero-knowledge verification dissolves the false tension between privacy and trust that has limited web3. Through mathematical certainty, users prove their uniqueness without revealing themselves. This shift enables bot-free token distributions, sovereign compliance with regulations, and manipulation-resistant governance systems. These technologies create selective disclosure on user terms by tapping into existing trust infrastructures, removing the need for a parallel system. The result brings what web3 always needed most: verified humans interacting with full data sovereignty.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol, has just raised over $10.55 million in its ongoing presale. With a current price of $0.03 per token and over 12,000 holders already on board, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the DeFi space. Unlike speculative price movements seen in Avalanche (AVAX), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building core utility designed to support sustainable long-term growth through real financial infrastructure. Quiet capital, loud fundamentals While AVAX holders ride volatile price waves tied to short-term market sentiment, early participants in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are investing in a fully decentralized, overcollateralized lending protocol. Backed by a transparent, audited architecture and driven by real DeFi usage rather than hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has opted for Layer-2 blockchain integration. This enables faster and cheaper transactions, directly addressing network congestion and high gas fees that continue to limit many DeFi platforms. What sets this project apart is its focus on actual usability. The development team plans to launch a beta version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform at the token launch. This move will give early investors immediate access to lending and borrowing utilities for testing that work across both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to deposit assets like ETH, AVAX, or DAI into a shared liquidity pool and earn interest that adapts with market demand. These lending pools feature dynamic interest rates that change based on how much liquidity is borrowed. When demand increases, yields go up. That brings in more depositors who want to earn higher returns, creating a self-regulating balance between borrowers and lenders. For example, when a user deposits $5,000 worth of DAI into a pool that reaches high utilization, the annual returns can reach double-digit percentages. These yields are automatically paid out, and depositors also receive mtTokens (like mtDAI), which reflect the value of their deposits plus accumulated interest. These mtTokens provide instant liquidity and can be traded or used as collateral to unlock further opportunities within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. The peer-to-peer (P2P) system also introduces a unique edge. On most DeFi lending protocols, users are limited to high-cap known tokens. But in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), P2P lenders and borrowers will have access to a much wider token set, including memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This makes the lending platform more versatile and attractive for those holding assets that are often excluded from conventional DeFi systems. Stablecoin and layer-2—built for the future In the coming months, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its own fully overcollateralized decentralized stablecoin. Unlike USDT or USDC, which rely on opaque reserves and centralized custody, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be algorithmically adjusted and backed by on-chain assets already stored within the protocol. All interest collected from stablecoin loans will be redirected into the ecosystem to strengthen the platform’s treasury. The architecture supports fast growth while maintaining operational efficiency, making it ideal for both institutional backers and retail users seeking yield with minimal risk. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards its community through a comprehensive token utility structure. All protocol profits will be partially used to buy back MUTM tokens from the market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts, ensuring that active participants are rewarded. This setup applies natural demand pressure on the token price and encourages long-term holding. Additionally, users can stake their mtTokens or use them to provide liquidity in platform pools. These activities not only help the protocol function but also earn passive dividends for the participants. As platform adoption grows, these reward streams will deepen, offering high-yield, low-risk passive income that isn’t tied to speculative market behavior. CertiK audit signals safety and compliance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a comprehensive audit from CertiK, which included both manual review and static code analysis. The protocol scored 80.00 on CertiK’s Token Scan, validating its code quality and safety mechanisms. This level of scrutiny is rare in early-stage DeFi and speaks to the team’s commitment to building a compliant, reliable platform from the ground up. While Avalanche (AVAX) rides momentary rallies driven by market emotions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is locking in capital from informed investors. Over $10.55 million has already been raised in Phase 5, with more than 12,000 holders showing strong belief in the protocol’s long-term vision.

In a thread on X, he outlines a detailed argument centered on global debt concerns, the devaluation of fiat currencies, the rise of asset tokenization, and Ripple’s expanding institutional reach. According to Pumpius, the long-term decline of the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power, particularly since it was decoupled from the gold standard in 1971, has set the stage for digital assets to play a central role in future settlements. He highlights that the United States’ national debt has surpassed $34 trillion, with interest payments now exceeding $1 trillion annually. Under these conditions, he argues, the Federal Reserve will be forced to continue expanding the money supply, further distorting traditional asset valuations. Within this backdrop, he believes XRP can emerge as a high-efficiency bridge asset . Its ability to settle transactions rapidly and cheaply could allow it to gain significant ground as confidence in fiat systems continues to erode. If you think $XRP can’t hit $10,000… You’re already priced out of the future. This isn’t hopium. It’s math, markets, and macroeconomics. Let me walk you through the biggest monetary reset in human history — and why XRP sits right at the center of it. pic.twitter.com/NI60FREIcJ — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 7, 2025 Real-World Asset Tokenization and the Growing Ecosystem One of the more compelling elements of Pumpius’ pro-XRP argument is the anticipated growth in tokenized real-world assets . He draws attention to the fact that major financial institutions such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Citi are actively investing in blockchain-based tokenization frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Estimates from various analysts suggest that between $16 trillion and $30 trillion in real-world assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. The Dubai Land Department is already making significant progress in this sector with tokenized land deeds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Pumpius argues that XRP’s fast settlement, DEX features, interoperability, and other features position it as a core player in the tokenized economy. Ripple’s ecosystem already spans over 300 financial institutions, and its Ripple Payments platform (formerly On-Demand Liquidity) eliminates pre-funded accounts. The launch of the RLUSD stablecoin and investment in custody solutions also highlight Ripple’s institutional focus and support Pumpius’s bullish case. Challenging the Conventional Valuation Model Pumpius’s boldest claim centers on monetary velocity, as he sees XRP facilitating segments of FX markets, tokenized assets, and sovereign debt. With high turnover and fixed supply, he argues XRP could justify far higher valuations, irrespective of traditional market capitalization logic. Critics reject such valuations as unrealistic, but supporters insist XRP is infrastructure, not a speculative asset. Pumpius believes that ignoring the shift in institutional adoption and global liquidity needs means missing the deeper transformation already underway, and believes that those who can’t see XRP at $10,000 are already priced out.

46060565,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=747073,1749981566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46060565.jpeg,AI could take over more jobs says BT CEO,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/british-telecom-says-ai-may-deepen-job-cuts/,"British Telecom (BT) Group CEO Allison Kirkby believes artificial intelligence advances could rile up job cuts at the company. The British Telecom company is already planning to slash 40,000 jobs and trim 3 billion pounds, roughly $4 billion in costs, by the end of the decade. Kirkby says that the figures may not fully capture AI’s potential impact. She argued that if AI makes it possible to operate with fewer resources, they must respond accordingly to remain in the game. She commented, “Depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” Kirkby sold off their Italian and Irish business to focus on the UK Before Kirkby took over, the company in 2023, under the then-CEO Phillip Jansen, declared it would reduce the workforce by about 55,000, including contractors, by 2030. Back then, Jansen asserted they would depend on a much leaner workforce and a lower cost base by the end of the 2020s. Kirkby seems to hold a similar stance on working with a smaller workforce, having sold off their Irish wholesale and enterprise division to focus on their UK operations. The company also sold its Italian Business, British Telecom Italia, to telecoms provider Retelit. BT Italia had about 350 corporate clients, earning roughly €160 million, about $217 million in 2024. However, the platform had legal trouble over possible document manipulation, which bruised investor confidence in the company’s non-UK business. In May, the company also reorganized its international operations into a standalone unit and is reportedly open to selling the entire division, according to a source familiar with the matter. Some investors have supported Kirkby’s restructuring efforts, like Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal, who holds a 24.5% stake. Not to mention, British Telecom’s shares have also surged 65% since Kirkby became CEO. BT weighs Openreach spin-off as fibre rollout nears milestone Kirkby is considering separating Openreach, the company’s network infrastructure business, into an independent entity at some point in the future, though no final decision has been made. She argued that she did not feel the value of Openreach was reflected in the company’s share price, and if that continued, the company would have to consider other options. The firm will have time to look into what could be done to Openreach while the business upgrades its network to full fiber. After the upgrade , capital spending is expected to return to normal, and free cash flow should recover. Openreach expects to hit its 25 million home coverage target next year, after which the expansion will ease to 1 million homes per year—well below the current quarterly pace. Nonetheless, British Telecom aims to expand to 30 million homes by 2030. According to New Street Research, Openreach is worth about £30 billion, about $40.7 billion—significantly higher than British Telecom’s current market capitalization of £18.5 billion, estimated at $25 billion. Despite the valuation gap, Kirkby claimed she would rather see the network’s value recognized in BT’s share price than pursue a spin-off. Meanwhile, British Telecom wants to take advantage of the hype and uncertainty around the recent partnership of Vodafone and Three to expand its retail platforms, EE and Plusnet. Kirkby believes that their merger presents an opportunity for them to market their brands. She added that she might have their retail brands operate in an alternative part of the UK where it isn’t cost-effective for Openreach to deploy its own fibre network.

Investors Ask as Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the Ultimate Bitcoin Replacement,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-is-xrp-investors-ask-as-bitcoin-solaris-emerges-as-the-ultimate-bitcoin-replacement/,"XRP once held the promise of revolutionizing global payments. Fast, cheap, and bank-friendly—it was pitched as the future of cross-border finance. But years of regulatory battles, stagnant token utility, and centralized control have left many investors wondering: Is this still the future, or just another chapter in crypto history? As attention shifts, a bold new name is rising with far more than promises. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just aiming to improve the blockchain—it’s redefining what decentralized money can do. With blazing speed, mobile-first mining, and a full ecosystem that empowers users instead of institutions, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a Bitcoin alternative, but the upgrade Bitcoin never had. XRP Had Potential—But the Space Moved On XRP deserves credit for challenging the banking sector and pioneering real-time settlement. But with Ripple entangled in legal skirmishes and token utility tied closely to corporate control, cracks have shown. Decentralization remains a concern. And for users seeking freedom, speed, and income, not just transaction rails, XRP now feels like a limited play. Investors are beginning to shift their gaze to a project that’s not just faster or cheaper, but fundamentally more empowering. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Replace, Not Just Compete BTC-S was built from the ground up to combine what Bitcoin started with what modern tech makes possible. It features a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work (PoW) for core chain security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability. Together, they deliver unmatched performance. Key highlights include: Base Layer PoW using SHA-256 (Bitcoin-compatible) with 5-minute block times Solaris Layer DPoS with 21 rotating validators every 24 hours and 15-second blocks Cross-layer integration where validator data is secured on-chain through PoW anchoring Smart contracts in Rust, enabling DeFi, tokenization, and secure automation Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) It gets even better with throughput: the Solaris Layer pushes up to 100,000 transactions per second, finalizing in just 2 seconds, while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. This isn’t theoretical—it’s audited and tested. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the code, and early influencers like Ben Crypto are already spotlighting BTC-S as one of the most promising chains of the year. Mobile Mining with Real Rewards Unlike XRP, which can’t be earned directly through network participation, BTC-S opens the doors to daily income through mining—without expensive hardware. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine using: Smartphones (Android and iOS) Laptops and desktops ASICs and GPUs (for power users) With adaptive mining algorithms, in-app wallets, and energy-optimized performance, it’s truly accessible. Just tap, and you’re earning. Want to estimate your earning potential? The BTC-S mining calculator helps you visualize your daily impact. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Liquid Staking That Doesn’t Lock You In Beyond mining, Bitcoin Solaris also introduces a breakthrough in staking. With liquid staking , users can earn rewards without locking away their tokens. How it works: Staked BTC-S becomes sBTC-S (1:1 ratio) sBTC-S remains fully liquid, tradable, and DeFi-compatible You earn rewards while retaining full control It enhances decentralization, validator rotation, and network health It’s integrated right into the Solaris Nova App, with no complex setup required, making staking easy, flexible, and profitable for everyone. A Roadmap That’s Actually Being Followed Many coins brag about roadmaps. BTC-S is executing one. Its forward-looking roadmap spans: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2026) with full support for smart contracts and governance Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain tools by Q4 2026 Quantum-resistant upgrades and layer-2 scaling in 2027 Enterprise-grade integrations with AI and IoT in late 2027 It’s a roadmap backed by action, not just whitepaper buzzwords. Every phase is designed to increase adoption, unlock real-world use, and build sustainable value. The Presale Is Moving Fast—and It’s Not Just Hype We’re currently in Phase 7 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale, with over 11,000 users already onboard and more than $4.5M raised. Current price: $7 Next phase: $8 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 9% With only around 7 weeks left before the July 31, 2025 launch, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most dynamic presales in crypto history. The growth is organic, driven by real use, not marketing gimmicks. If you’re watching from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris is your window into the future. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin? Or Something Better? XRP may have started as a disruptor. But Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a revolution. With mobile mining, powerful staking, lightning-fast scalability, and a clear roadmap, BTC-S isn’t just an upgrade to Bitcoin—it’s what Bitcoin would be if it were built today.

The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $105,000 level, with its value down by merely 0.8% in the past week. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price might not be down for too long, as investors seem unbothered by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Below is what the BTC investors have been up to since the military action started in the past week. BTC Investors Still Holding On To Their Assets: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, CryptoMe revealed that the Bitcoin market has remained relatively quiet despite the ongoing geopolitical events. The relevant indicators here are the Bitcoin exchange netflow and Open Interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke To start, CryptoMe analyzed the BTC Exchange Netflow, which measures the difference between Bitcoin sent to and withdrawn from centralized exchanges. Typically, this metric helps to gauge the selling pressure on a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Given that one of the services offered by exchanges is selling, exchange inflows are often considered a bearish signal for the Bitcoin price. However, CryptoMe noted that there has been no significant change in Netflow, meaning that investors are not looking to offload their assets. The on-chain analyst also highlighted the Open Interest on centralized exchanges, which estimates the amount of capital flowing into a cryptocurrency at every given time. CryptoMe attributed the reduced Open Interest to the liquidated long positions following the price correction. The crypto pundit added: But when we look at the bigger picture, Open Interest still looks strong, and investors are still keeping their positions open FOR NOW despite all the WAR news. Furthermore, CryptoMe mentioned the Bitcoin Open Interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and speculators trade. The analyst noted that while some positions were closed and the Open Interest dropped after the event, there has still not been any significant exit movement on the CME. Ultimately, the absence of major movements into centralized exchanges suggests that the investors are not in panic mode yet. While most positions on Bitcoin derivatives are still open at the moment, there is no telling what will happen if the war tension escalates further. Hence, investors might want to approach the market with caution over the next few days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,760, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

46060300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70957,1749981639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Coin to Hold Through 2025? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Faces a New DeFi Rival with Huge Potential,https://timestabloid.com/top-coin-to-hold-through-2025-bitcoin-cash-bch-faces/,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) entered the crypto market with strong momentum as a transactional fork of Bitcoin, promising faster payments and lower fees. But in 2025, the conversation is shifting. While BCH’s utility has largely plateaued—with limited innovation and minimal presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector—a new protocol is emerging that directly challenges the old guard. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another DeFi token; it is an all-in-one ecosystem built for passive income, smart lending models, and long-term scalability. DeFi Needs More Than Speed—It Needs Vision Bitcoin Cash (BCH) once offered a compelling alternative to Bitcoin, but as blockchain innovation moved toward smart contracts, DeFi lending, and protocol-owned liquidity, BCH failed to evolve. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is executing a phased roadmap that includes everything from a CertiK-audited smart contract to the launch of a testnet demo and eventual exchange listings. Unlike BCH, which remains fixed in a transactional mold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is addressing real user needs: lending, borrowing, earning, and transparency. Its dual lending model—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—gives users maximum control and flexibility, something legacy chains never prioritized. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building toward its live platform release with a structure and intent that few projects can claim. With a major part of Phase 1 already completed—including presale launch, CertiK audit (Token Scan Score: 80), and a $100K giveaway (ongoing)—the team is now advancing through backend development, DApp integration, and rigorous internal reviews. By the time the token goes live, users will be able to interact with a fully functional beta version of the platform. Beyond that, the roadmap includes exchange listings, regulatory compliance, and even institutional partnerships. This is not just about launching a token—it’s about delivering a long-term financial product that works for both individual users and large-scale stakeholders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Makes Passive Income Truly Passive In the P2C model, you deposit assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, or BNB into a liquidity pool. The interest you earn depends on actual borrowing activity—driven by real-time demand. When pool utilization is high, APYs go up, providing lenders with competitive returns without constant oversight. In the P2P model, lenders set their own terms and can support tokens like DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE. This opens up custom earning strategies unavailable on traditional lending platforms. Whether you want passive rewards or hands-on lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) puts the power in your hands. Additionally, when you stake your mtTokens in the safety module, you gain a share of protocol profits. A portion of these profits will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to stakers. This creates both scarcity and reward in one loop, boosting price support while offering long-term passive income. Locked-In Value: Real Math, Real Gains The MUTM token is currently in Phase 5 of its presale, priced at just $0.03 with over $10.60 million already raised and more than 12,000 holders onboard. With the total supply of 4,000,000,000, early positions are increasingly valuable. Let’s break it down: A user who locks in 100,000 MUTM at $0.03 secures a position worth $3,000. Should the token rise to just $0.75—a 25x return backed by platform demand and protocol profits—that same position becomes $75,000. This isn’t hypothetical growth based on hype; it’s a calculation rooted in Mutuum’s utility, architecture, and revenue model. One of Mutuum’s most user-friendly innovations is its mtToken system. When you deposit assets into Mutuum’s pools, you receive mtTokens (like mtDAI or mtETH) that represent your principal plus earned interest. These tokens can be used as collateral, traded on secondary markets, or held as interest-accruing assets—introducing new flexibility that traditional DeFi platforms lack. This liquid staking model means your funds are never trapped, and your earnings are always working for you. It’s a simple idea with transformative results: freedom of movement and continuous compounding. A Stablecoin Built for the Long Game Mutuum’s ecosystem will also include a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stable assets that rely on fiat reserves or corporate governance, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be minted using assets already within the protocol. That means complete transparency, on-chain security, and automated supply regulation. This stablecoin will not only offer a reliable borrowing option but also redirect interest payments into the protocol, strengthening the treasury and opening additional revenue paths for MUTM holders. It’s another way Mutuum is building a sustainable ecosystem, not just a token. Where Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its moment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering a future. With Layer-2 integration for fast and low-cost transactions, a fully audited smart contract, and an upcoming exchange listing, MUTM is positioned for real-world traction. The ongoing roadmap includes platform launch, cross-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships—all critical components for long-term success in DeFi. Whether you want to earn from pool lending, P2P strategies or mtToken liquidity, Mutuum gives you the tools and the structure to grow your holdings with confidence. BCH paved the way for faster payments. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is paving the road for financial freedom in a fully decentralized world. With a functional beta release approaching and a roadmap filled with utility milestones, MUTM isn’t just a new token—it’s the future of DeFi, designed for sustainability, scalability, and user prosperity.

Recent market trends suggest that these digital assets might be gearing up for significant upward movement. Curious about which tokens are poised to make new highs? Discover the altcoins capturing attention and see why they're generating buzz in the crypto community. Solana Struggles: Analyzing Past Decline and Current Range Dynamics Solana experienced a noticeable decline over the past month, dropping by about 21.57%, and a steeper decrease of around 34.48% over the past six months. Its weekly performance was nearly flat at -0.24%, amid fluctuating prices within the range of $136 to $182. The coin's downward trend highlights the absence of consistent upward recovery, suggesting persistent pressure on its valuation. These movements reflect overall market sentiment and investor caution, indicating a period of adjustment and consolidation in trading behavior. The historical trend emphasizes a market struggling to regain momentum, presenting challenges for traders navigating this landscape. Currently, Solana’s price is situated between $136 and $182, facing a nearest resistance level at $207.9 and stronger resistance near $253.93. On the support side, key levels are at $115.84 and a secondary support at $69.81. The technical indicators lean bearish, with negative momentum and an RSI reading of 38.03 suggesting oversold conditions. The absence of a clear trend creates potential for short-term trading opportunities. Bears appear to dominate as traders monitor these key levels closely, with strategies focused on entering near support zones while awaiting decisive movements beyond resistance levels to signal a recovery in this challenging market. Chainlink Price Fluctuations and Key Market Levels Analysis Chainlink faced a steep one-month decline of nearly 24% along with a significant six-month drop of roughly 54%. Price action during these periods showed a consistent bearish trend, with selling pressure outpacing buying interest. The decline has eroded investor confidence, leading to significant volatility and rapid shifts in market sentiment. This has made traders cautious, prompting many to reassess their risk strategies while navigating a challenging landscape. Chainlink currently trades in a range between $12.14 and $16.89. Resistance at $19.80 acts as an immediate ceiling, while a stronger barrier is found at $24.55. Support is identified at $10.30, with a deeper level near $5.55. Bears retain a slight edge as indicated by negative momentum readings, despite a minor weekly gain of 2.8%. The recent losses contribute to a market characterized by caution. Traders should monitor for bounces off the $10.30 support and consider a break above $19.80 as a potential buy signal. Balancing risk and potential gains will be crucial as market pressures persist. Resilient Cardano Amid Recent Downturns and Key Price Boundaries Cardano has experienced a steep decline in the past month, with prices dropping nearly 24% and around 40% in the last six months. The market has shown significant volatility, contracting the trading range and creating an environment of caution among investors. Price fluctuations have pointed to weakening momentum, with corrective pressure evident as the coin tested lower support levels. Uncertainty remains, reflected in the overall negative trends from technical indicators. Currently, Cardano is trading between approximately $0.60 and $0.82, encountering immediate resistance around $0.95 and a higher barrier at $1.17, while support stands near $0.51 and further at $0.29. Bears dominate the market, with indicators signaling a short-term bearish scenario. The absence of a clear upward trend results in choppy price action. Traders should monitor support levels for potential rebounds or await a solid break above resistance before entering long positions, though caution is advised due to the prevailing bearish sentiment. Conclusion SOL , ADA , and LINK show strong potential for growth. These coins have demonstrated resilience and consistent performance. With positive market trends, new all-time highs appear achievable for each currency. Confidence in their future remains high. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Qubetics Emerges as the Best Performing Crypto to Watch,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-bitcoin-cash-surge-qubetics-emerges-as-the-best-performing-crypto-to-watch/,"Just days after Bitcoin surged past a major milestone, attention rapidly turned elsewhere. One name now dominates crypto forums, Discords, and market watchlists: Qubetics —the Best Performing Crypto contender that could rewrite 2025. Best Performing Crypto is more than a label—it’s the benchmark that separates transient hype from meaningful innovation. As market watchers reflect on missed gains from Bitcoin Cash, Qubetics offers a forward-facing narrative. This isn’t just another digital asset; it’s a protocol engineered to reshape decentralized utility from the ground up. If you’re still chasing the next big opportunity, the Best Performing Crypto may already be here. Bitcoin Cash: A Monumental Climb That Came and Went Bitcoin Cash’s revival, while remarkable, echoed a familiar pattern in the crypto market—steep rises followed by equally steep FOMO among latecomers. Launched in 2017 as a fork of Bitcoin to address transaction scalability, BCH had its heyday during the 2017 bull run. Fast forward to 2025, and its recent explosion was largely driven by institutional whisperings and network efficiency upgrades. Despite its technical upgrades, Bitcoin Cash lacks fresh utility layers that reflect today’s Web3 demands. Its primary use case remains transactional, and while it remains respected for its speed and low fees, its ecosystem hasn’t expanded into the domains that define modern blockchain relevance—DeFi, data provenance, AI integration, or real-world adoption. The recent price action showed the market’s appetite for older assets regaining attention. But once the peak passed, much of the trading action shifted to next-gen protocols—those built not just on speed but on real-world adaptability, community governance, and scarcity engineering. That’s where Qubetics enters with a commanding presence. Qubetics: The Best Performing Crypto of 2025 Takes Shape Qubetics ($TICS) is more than a speculative coin. It’s a full-fledged protocol engineered for scalable, secure, and decentralized applications with a direct focus on cross-border transactions. In a time when inflation, global remittance friction, and digital access gaps widen daily, $TICS proposes tangible solutions for the everyday user and multinational enterprises alike. The presale figures speak volumes: Over 515 million tokens sold 27,900+ holders onboarded $18 million raised Current price: $0.3370 in Stage 37 Only 10 million tokens remain at this price With a reduced total supply of 1.36 billion (down from 4B+), the protocol has set the stage for long-term scarcity and valuation. By reallocating 38.55% of supply to the public sale, Qubetics rebalances token access toward community hands—eliminating over-centralization and shifting decision-making toward a user-governed model. Analysts have responded in kind. Leading crypto researchers forecast $TICS could reach $10 to $15 post-mainnet launch based on its limited supply, real-world use cases, and deflationary tokenomics. Qubetics is currently seen as the Best Performing Crypto presale in 2025, attracting both retail attention and whale activity. And with the listing price already set at $0.40, participants at this stage are looking at a 20% ROI even before public trading begins. How Qubetics Solves What Others Couldn’t: Real-World Utility Beyond Hype Unlike traditional tokens or meme-driven coins, Qubetics integrates a powerful suite of applications built for global use. Its architecture supports cross-border transactions with faster settlement times and lower fees—ideal for freelancers, digital nomads, and remote workers needing streamlined payments across jurisdictions. The protocol’s lightweight design also suits developers building DeFi tools, P2E games, or data-driven AI interfaces. While Bitcoin Cash was revolutionary in 2017, it never moved past basic transactions. Qubetics, by contrast, reimagines blockchain as a tool for seamless global coordination. As regulatory clarity improves and traditional systems reveal limitations, market demand now favors scalable blockchains with real-life application layers. In this light, $TICS stands out not merely as a crypto presale opportunity—but as the Best Performing Crypto opportunity by functionality, design, and timing. Time-Sensitive Momentum: Why Qubetics Is Generating Scarcity Buzz With only 10 million $TICS tokens left at the $0.3370 price and a scheduled 20% rise post-listing, momentum has become time-sensitive. The protocol’s latest tokenomics overhaul not only reduced total supply drastically—it shifted incentives and control toward its global user base. A rare move in a space often driven by centralized teams and short-term whales. Market analysts highlight the power of limited access in shaping crypto valuation. With most early-stage protocols still figuring out monetization or lacking distribution, Qubetics delivers both. Price models project steady appreciation beyond $1 by Q3 2025 and potential $10–$15 surges within the next market cycle. In light of recent market corrections, such breakout moments are rare and tightly watched. Qubetics has not only held its momentum—it has accelerated it. Those still recovering from missing Bitcoin Cash’s 70% climb now face another defining moment. With Qubetics nearing the finish line of its public sale, hesitation could lead to a repeat of missed upside potential. This isn’t a promise. It’s a market indicator too loud to ignore. Conclusion: Final Call for the Best Performing Crypto Opportunity of 2025 Bitcoin Cash’s recent rally captured attention, but it highlighted a recurring pattern: big gains come fast—and disappear faster. Those left on the sidelines during BCH’s climb now seek an opening that’s both strategic and grounded in substance. Qubetics offers that window. With fewer than 10 million tokens remaining in its crypto presale, a price floor that delivers instant ROI, and a scalable use case centered on financial inclusion, Qubetics stands positioned as the Best Performing Crypto of 2025—not just by projection but by design. Access remains open—but not for long. This may be the last and best chance to secure a stake in the Best Performing Crypto before it breaks into mainstream exchanges. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics and how does it differ from Bitcoin Cash? Qubetics is a decentralized protocol offering cross-border solutions, unlike Bitcoin Cash which focuses on transactional efficiency without deeper application layers. How many Qubetics tokens remain in crypto presale? Only 10 million $TICS tokens are left at $0.3370 before a 20% price increase. What is the predicted price of Qubetics post-listing? Analysts estimate a $0.40 listing, with long-term projections ranging between $10 and $15. What real-world problems does Qubetics solve? Qubetics supports borderless payments, transparent governance, and token scarcity—all critical for today’s global economy. Why is Qubetics considered the Best Performing Crypto? Its strong crypto presale performance, tokenomics upgrade, and real-use integration make it the top-performing asset in current crypto metrics. The post Missed the Bitcoin Cash Surge?

Meme coins continue to capture investor excitement, with key tokens on Ethereum like Shiba Inu and Neo Pepe making waves. Neo Pepe Protocol’s innovative presale structure, decentralized governance, and robust liquidity mechanisms set it apart. A comprehensive guide for newcomers exploring promising Ethereum meme coins and presales in the evolving crypto landscape. Who’s Buying all the Ethereum? Ethereum investors are witnessing an exciting resurgence, as the cryptocurrency attracts renewed attention from institutional investors and crypto whales. Recently, an Ethereum whale made a staggering $435 million purchase, signaling significant confidence and fueling widespread speculation about Ethereum’s bullish potential. Alongside this, a comprehensive bullish report targeted at institutional investors further validates Ethereum’s increasing credibility and appeal. For first-time investors navigating Ethereum's vibrant ecosystem, meme coins and presale opportunities offer an accessible and exciting entry point. These tokens combine entertainment, community-driven governance, and potent financial mechanisms to attract enthusiastic supporters. Meet ETH’s Hottest Picks Ethereum meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Turbo (TURBO) remain among investor favorites due to their widespread popularity, community-driven growth, and substantial market caps. Shiba Inu, notably, continues to thrive, fueled by a dedicated community and a diversified ecosystem that extends beyond a mere meme token into robust DeFi utilities. However, one emerging player drawing significant attention is Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP). Branded as a fast growing memecoin , Neo Pepe is distinguishing itself within Ethereum's crowded meme coin sector through a powerful combination of innovation, structured financial mechanisms, and an evocative cultural message. Investors seeking fresh opportunities would do well to explore the Neo Pepe Protocol. 4 Game-Changing Reasons Neo Pepe Is Best Meme Coin to Watch Neo Pepe’s strategic approach sets a new benchmark among meme coins, offering compelling reasons for first-time Ethereum investors to take notice: Presale: Neo Pepe features a meticulously designed 16-stage presale, each stage incrementally increasing in price. Early entrants reap the benefits of lower token prices, making prompt participation highly rewarding. Auto-Liquidity Mechanism: Each transaction incurs a 2.5% fee, automatically enhancing liquidity on Uniswap by pairing half of these tokens with ETH, then permanently burning the resulting liquidity tokens. This mechanism ensures sustainable market liquidity and boosts investor confidence. Governance Model: Fully decentralized from inception, Neo Pepe leverages on-chain voting via its sophisticated governance system—the NEOPGovernor contract. Token holders with at least 1 million $NEOP can propose and vote on key decisions, ensuring genuine Community Ownership. Symbolic Messaging: Beyond finance, Neo Pepe encapsulates a compelling cultural narrative, embracing decentralization and resistance against centralization, regulation, and market saturation. This ideological stance resonates deeply with crypto enthusiasts, elevating Neo Pepe from mere memecoin to symbolic movement. Neo Pepe vs. Everyone Else—Why It’s Crypto’s Top Presale Right Now Amidst numerous crypto presales, Neo Pepe Protocol stands as a Top Crypto Presale thanks to several factors that uniquely position it in the Ethereum ecosystem: Transparent Tokenomics: With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale participants, and clearly defined distributions for liquidity, marketing, and development, Neo Pepe offers transparency and trust. Strategic Stage Allocation: Each presale stage has a capped token allocation designed to foster urgency and exclusivity. Investors acting swiftly secure optimal pricing, directly benefiting from early-stage entry. Robust Security and Trustless Mechanics: Utilizing Chainlink oracles and audited, immutable smart contracts ensures transactional security and integrity. Funds raised during presales are meticulously tracked and verifiable, bolstering investor confidence. Unlike traditional meme tokens such as FLOKI or SPX6900, Neo Pepe offers serious financial incentives backed by sophisticated governance and liquidity frameworks, reflecting genuine DeFi innovation beneath its memetic exterior. Don’t Miss Out—Ethereum’s Meme Coins Are Set to Explode Ethereum’s landscape in June 2025 presents a potent combination of mainstream credibility and meme-driven excitement, creating fertile ground for both novice and seasoned investors. While established meme coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe remain strong contenders, Neo Pepe emerges prominently, characterized by strategic innovation, rigorous financial structures, and compelling symbolic narratives.

That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered the conversation with force. Rather than riding short-term waves, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily building an ecosystem designed around sustainable yield, transparent lending, and decentralized control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): building quiet strength through utility Solana (SOL)’s rise back above $147 has reignited short-term optimism, driven largely by market-wide recovery and renewed retail participation. Yet, while SOL has long been a favorite for its fast Layer-1 architecture, it still lacks key DeFi lending innovations that institutional and passive-income-driven investors demand. With no native interest-bearing token system and limited decentralized lending options, SOL’s value remains tied to speculative trading rather than protocol-level utility. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is crafting an entirely different narrative—one rooted in usability, sustainability, and user incentives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol currently in Phase 5 of its presale, offering its native token MUTM at $0.03. Since its initial phases, the token price has increased significantly, already offering early investors gains of over 200% from the Phase 1 level. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, a strong financial foundation of $10.55 million raised, and more than 12,000 holders, this is no longer just a small presale—it’s a well-funded ecosystem in the making. Unlike speculative Layer-1 tokens, MUTM is the engine powering real DeFi functionality. Users will earn by supplying assets like ETH, DAI, or BNB into Mutuum’s P2C lending pools, where returns dynamically adjust based on utilization. When lending pools are highly utilized, interest rates automatically increase, maximizing passive income. At full utilization, some pools are expected to offer annual returns upwards of 18–22%, depending on demand. That’s significantly higher than what most centralized exchanges or passive yield platforms currently offer. Innovative P2P lending model and mtTokens for real-time liquidity Where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further separates itself is with its P2P lending model. In this peer-to-peer system, users can lend and borrow directly—no middlemen, no fixed rates. Unlike traditional P2C pools, this opens up borrowing and lending for assets rarely supported elsewhere, including memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Pepe (PEPE). These tokens are often excluded from major lending platforms, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will give them a place, along with dynamic market pricing and trustless smart contract execution. To complement both lending models, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will issue mtTokens—tokenized representations of user deposits. These automatically accrue interest and serve as proof of liquidity pool ownership. When you deposit ETH or DAI, for example, you will receive mtTokens that grow in value, meaning you maintain liquidity and can redeem them—subject to available pool liquidity—without interrupting yield accumulation. Another way to maximize MUTM utility is through borrowing strategies. For example, depositing $5,000 worth of ETH into Mutuum’s smart contract pools will not only earn passive interest but also make the user eligible to borrow stablecoins without selling the ETH. That means access to liquidity while maintaining price exposure—a strategy that makes sense in bull markets and sideways conditions alike. Collateral remains user-owned and secured in non-custodial smart contracts, further enhancing trust. To ensure user experience isn’t compromised by high network fees, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built on a Layer-2 architecture. This design choice provides near-instant transactions and dramatically reduced gas costs, making lending, borrowing, and reward claiming accessible to more users globally. DeFi has long struggled with scalability, but Mutuum’s infrastructure directly addresses this gap, giving it a competitive edge over legacy platforms still battling congestion. Stablecoin innovation adds depth and sustainability One of the most anticipated features is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming decentralized stablecoin. This asset will be fully overcollateralized and minted directly from on-chain protocol reserves. It won’t rely on fiat or centralized backing. Instead, it introduces algorithmic supply adjustment based on transparent collateral ratios. Borrowers will access a stable currency, while interest payments on those loans are recycled back into the Mutuum ecosystem, strengthening its treasury and long-term viability. To reinforce its commitment to transparency and user protection, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a full security audit by CertiK. The token scan score sits at 80.00, with both static analysis and manual review conducted. With growing concerns over smart contract vulnerabilities in DeFi, this audit provides confidence to both retail and institutional participants alike. By the time the token goes live, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to launch its beta platform, offering users early access to its suite of DeFi products. This milestone will mark the protocol’s transition from presale to full utility—something that few other DeFi projects actually accomplish. To boost community participation, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway further rewards users joining early. For those looking beyond the next price candle, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an entry into long-term passive income, lending flexibility, and protocol-driven rewards. Whether you are a retail investor, DeFi power user, or yield-seeker, the time to enter is now—before later stages dilute your returns.

Analysts are observing patterns that may hint at a rapid surge, possibly reaching unprecedented price levels. This development raises questions about whether these digital assets are on the verge of a major breakout. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milesto ne The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Player – Is It the Next Big Thing? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a playful spin on cryptocurrencies, using the Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. Though it began as a joke, Dogecoin gained popularity. In 2021, its value soared, reaching over $50 billion in market cap and placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies. This surge was fueled by social media hype and support from personalities like Elon Musk, showing how online communities can influence markets. So, is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology enables fast, cheap transactions. The low price per coin, due to its high supply, attracts many investors. However, its value is tied to social media trends, leading to high volatility. In the current market, some prefer more stable coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have established utility. Yet, Dogecoin’s strong community keeps it relevant. Whether it’s an attractive investment depends on your risk tolerance and belief in its community. While it may not have the same technical features as other coins, its rise from a meme to a top cryptocurrency is noteworthy. Solana’s SOL: The Fast Lane of the Crypto Highway Solana is turning heads in the blockchain world. It’s a platform designed for speed and growth, offering a space for decentralized apps, or dapps. While competitors like Ethereum and Cardano have made their mark, Solana stands out by handling more transactions at a faster rate. It doesn’t rely on splitting the network or adding extra layers to keep things moving swiftly. This approach makes it a hot spot for developers who want to build big, bustling projects without delays. At the core of Solana is the SOL coin. This is more than just another cryptocurrency. SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. In the current market cycle, SOL looks attractive. Its technology is geared for high performance, and it supports multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. As the crypto market evolves, platforms that combine speed with capacity are gaining attention. Compared to others, SOL’s potential to host high-activity services gives it an edge. It’s positioned to be a key player as more users seek fast and efficient blockchain solutions. Conclusion Strong bullish signals for DOGE, SOL, and XYZVerse suggest a parabolic rally, with XYZVerse pioneering a community-driven sports memecoin targeting massive growth.

As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.16, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, it has slipped by 2.3%, continuing a mild downtrend. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, overall sentiment around XRP remains bearish . However, there is some sense of optimism from a technical standpoint. The token’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) is at $2.30, offering short-term support, while the 200-day SMA, at $1.88, signals potential for longer-term bullish momentum. Meanwhile, XRP’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 44.38, still in neutral territory, pointing to a balanced market with room to move either way. ChatGPT predicts XRP price Looking ahead, OpenAI’s ChatGPT projected that XRP will likely trade between $2.08 and $2.32 by July 1, with $2.22 identified as the most probable mid-range target. This prediction is based on technical indicators, momentum analysis, and overall market conditions. The model noted that XRP’s recent breach of the psychological $2 level has established a key support zone, which could act as a base for future gains. On the other hand, resistance appears between $2.30 and $2.35, with support holding near the $2.05 to $2.10 range. XRP AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT A limiting factor, however, is the current absence of major catalysts. Without headline developments, such as an ETF approval or a major partnership announcement from Ripple, any sharp price movements appear unlikely in the short term. ChatGPT pointed out that broader market dynamics could still play a role. For example, a stable or rising Bitcoin ( BTC ) price could offer enough tailwind to push XRP toward the upper end of its projected range. Grok predicts XRP price Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok model took a more bullish stance, forecasting a trading range between $2.25 and $2.40 by July 1. It cited an ascending channel pattern and potential positive momentum from Ripple’s ecosystem as key drivers. Still, Grok also flagged resistance around $2.50 as a likely cap on near-term gains. Both AI models seem to agree that a major XRP breakout is unlikely over the next couple of weeks. A gradual climb toward the low-to-mid $2.30s appears within reach, provided market conditions remain steady.

The CEO made the statement while in Singapore at the XRP APEX 2025 event. If his forecast came true, it could transform the global financial system and position XRP at the heart of the global system of finance. Revolutionizing Global Settlements During the packed event, Garlinghouse stated that Ripple’s vision would focus on the liquidity part of the SWIFT system, and not the messaging part. According to him, this focus could see XRP dominate 14% of global liquidity transactions in the next five years. If XRP were to capture 14% of the global SWIFT volume of $5 trillion in daily volume, it could have huge implications for the value of XRP. Even if it captured just 1% of the volume, its price could rise to over $35. However, that is unlikely to happen due to regulatory challenges and the cost of making such a switch, especially in the 5-year period that the Ripple CEO forecasts. A more realistic scenario is that Ripple continues to face legal challenges in its quest. In the meantime, a better alternative in the crypto market has got investors talking. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves in the crypto world, thanks to its focus on utility and creating real value for its community. A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM is an innovative DeFi project that aims to transform the entire decentralized finance sector with innovative solutions. The protocol allows users to participate as either lenders or borrowers. As lenders, users can deposit their assets in the liquidity pools to earn interest. The interest they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. Mutuum Finance’s utilization rate is expected to be extremely high, which will generate massive returns for its lenders. The reason for this positive forecast is the project’s design, which targets high-quality assets that have high demand from borrowers. One of the strategies it plans to use is liquidity mining, which will see providers of high-value assets like stablecoins and ETH receive MUTM token rewards. Besides the lucrative liquidity rewards, Mutuum Finance will also offer numerous protections for protocol users. For instance, it will carefully check new assets before they can be added as collateral or liquidity in the pools. This will ensure that the protocol’s health is maintained, ensuring long-term growth for all its users. Over time, that will boost protocol participation, ensuring lenders can continue to earn massive rewards. The mtToken System Another incentive that Mutuum Finance has created is the mtToken system. In this system, lenders who deposit their assets will receive mtTokens in exchange. For instance, if a user deposits $1,700 worth of ETH, they will receive mtETH tokens on a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens will be based on the ERC20 token standard, which means they can be traded on secondary exchanges that support the standard. That will open trading opportunities for lenders while they are still earning interest on their assets in the pools. Since mtTokens represent the value of the assets plus any interest accrued, it will simplify the lending process for users. They can track their earnings in real time and will not need to actively compound or claim their interest in the pools. Benefits For Borrowers For borrowers, Mutuum Finance has several incentives as well, one of which is the stable interest rate. The stable rate will boost the pool utilization rate as borrowers looking for predictable repayments will seek it out. This stable rate starts high, based on a time-weighted average of the variable rate. It will then be regularly monitored to ensure that the variable rate does not rise too high above it. When the variable rate rises too high, the protocol will automatically rebalance it to maintain fairness and to protect liquidity on the protocol. Borrowers on Mutuum Finance also have an opportunity to earn interest on their collateral. This will be made possible through the stablecoin that the team plans to launch on the protocol. The interest payments they earn on collateral will go towards covering some of the interest payments due on their stablecoin loan. Planned Beta Version Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of the platform on day one of the token listing. This beta version launch is expected to spur interest in MUTM tokens, which is part of the reason why analysts are so optimistic about MUTM tokens once they go live. The MUTM tokens are currently in the presale, where they are going for $0.03 in phase 5 of the presale. So far, over $10.6 million has been raised in the presale from around 12,000 participants. The price is expected to rise by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. The presale numbers, coupled with the awesome protocol design that offers huge long-term benefits, make the MUTM token presale one of the most exciting crypto investment opportunities of June 2025.

Recent Attempts to End the Legal Dispute In early May, Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion seeking Judge Torres’s indicative ruling. They aimed to reduce Ripple’s $125 million penalty to $50 million and lift the injunction against Ripple preventing institutional XRP sales. However, on May 15, the judge dismissed the motion as procedurally improper, citing their failure to invoke the correct federal rule and to show “exceptional circumstances” under Rule 60(b). Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), confirmed that the dismissal did not undermine previous legal victories or XRP’s status and was only a procedural error. Rather than accept defeat, the parties refiled the motion on June 12. The new version addresses Judge Torres’ concerns and again requests lifting the institutional sales injunction and a $75 million return to Ripple after the SEC payment. Both parties backed up their stance with established precedents and are seeking an indicative ruling. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP Holders Anticipate June 16 June 16 has been widely interpreted as the day the case will conclude. The date marks a deadline for the SEC to file a status report with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This report must describe whether the parties have settled, requested an extension, or allowed the appeal to resume. While both parties stayed silent for some time, the new motion has stirred hope that Judge Torres will deliver the ruling on the settlement on that date. Fred Rispoli, a popular attorney who predicted the joint motion filing , noted that filing before the June 16 deadline would make the Second Circuit extend the status report deadline by another 60 days rather than resuming appeal proceedings. If Judge Torres grants the new motion, both parties are expected to move to dismiss the appeals in the Second Circuit, paving the way toward final settlement procedures. With the joint motion resubmitted, the court has the opportunity to resolve the four-and-a-half-year-long case and bring Ripple and XRP close to freedom from legal troubles.

But Nguyen says answering that phone call led him to lose $500,000 – the entirety of his life’s work. “I lost maybe $500,000… I may be homeless now.” The con artists who masterminded the scam convinced Nguyen that his identity was being used to commit various crimes overseas, like money laundering, and in order to clear his name, the soon-to-be-retired man supposedly had to wire over his money to another bank. The criminals, who are yet to be identified, used an encrypted messaging app called Viber to send wire transfer details, along with fake government documents to make it seem more legitimate. After losing everything, Nguyen’s daughter, Kathy, is now supporting him, and says she is in the process of selling her house to make ends meet. Says Kathy, “Watch out for your family. Your mom, dad, grandma, grandpas. Just let them know that something like this could happen, and just be careful.” The Nguyens have filed a report with the FBI, but at time of writing, the scammers are at large.

Major announcements included Cardano’s Cardinal protocol for Bitcoin DeFi, XRP Ledger’s upcoming EVM sidechain, and Coinbase’s Bitcoin rewards card. Meanwhile, regulators delayed ETF decisions and the Senate advanced stablecoin legislation. Bitcoin Amid major strikes by Israel across Iran, the Bitcoin price fell almost $6,000 through Thursday and into Friday. A comprehensive bounce is now underway, with experts wondering if the recovery will continue. DeFi Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has officially introduced Cardinal , a new protocol designed to bring Bitcoin into decentralized finance (DeFi) through a trustless, cross-chain solution. Technology XRP Ledger is set to launch an Ethereum-compatible EVM sidechain in Q2 2025, aiming to integrate Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications into its ecosystem while onboarding new contributors and enhancing DeFi functionalities. Business Coinbase has partnered with American Express to launch the Coinbase One Card , offering up to 4% Bitcoin rewards on purchases and expanded crypto benefits as part of its growing payment ecosystem GameStop has announced a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, signaling a deepening commitment to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. US authorities have charged crypto entrepreneur Iurii Gugnin with operating a $500 million money laundering scheme through his crypto companies, helping sanctioned Russian banks and entities bypass international financial restrictions. Web3 Web3 at present only bestows its rewards on the bravest adventurers who dare to expose themselves to all of its fanfare and bluster. With a good UI and user experience, Web3 can transform its highly functional dApps into an experience that’s not only fun, but also extremely worthwhile for its users. These five crypto exchanges have successfully weathered the storm and managed to retain the trust of their customers over the course of the past decade. Pudgy Penguins has partnered with *My Neighbor Alice*, granting holders of Pudgys and their spin-offs land access in MNA’s new interoperable archipelago. For over two decades, cloud giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have dominated global digital infrastructure, but their market concentration raises concerns over outages, censorship, and data privacy risks. The crypto market is maturing beyond meme hype and speculation, and the industry has firmly left the ICO mania of 2017–18 behind. Community alignment, sustainable tokenomics, and real utility, which tokens like Mosaic Galaxy's Kodexa embody, are becoming the benchmarks. The recently launched crypto exchange KuCoin EU Exchange GmbH, based in Vienna, Austria, has announced two new C-Suite level executives to its stacked team of professionals - Christian Derler and Tamara Rubey, who will share their experience in banking, finance, and legal matters to bolster the expansion of the crypto exchange across Europe. Security A false announcement claiming Paraguay had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender was posted from President Santiago Peña’s hacked X account, prompting swift clarification from the government and raising concerns over digital platform vulnerabilities. Regulation The Trump Media and Technology Group has announced that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has declared effective the company’s registration for its Bitcoin treasury deal . The SEC has postponed decisions on ETF proposals for Polkadot, Hedera, Avalanche, and Dogecoin, citing the need for further evaluation and public feedback. The U.S. Senate advanced the GENIUS Act , a bipartisan bill to regulate stablecoins, toward a final vote next week, with Trump’s backing and divided Democratic support.

Early this week, SHIB's burn rate surged to over 112,000%, with more than 116 million coins transferred to wallets that cannot spend money. In other words, these coins were permanently taken out of circulation. The daily burn rate refers to the number of SHIB tokens permanently destroyed or removed from circulation each day. Token burns are designed to decrease the supply of the cryptocurrency over time, bringing a deflationary appeal to the digital asset. ""Over 527 trillion SHIB tokens are approaching profitability, while the burn rate exploded 112,839% with 116 million tokens removed from circulation,"" CoinDesk's AI insights noted. Furthermore, SHIB's ecosystem fundamentals demonstrated strength, with record wallet growth exceeding 1.5 million unique addresses and significant increases in Shibarium layer-2 transactions. Still, the memecoin remained locked in a downtrend at press time, last changing hands at $0.00001190, representing a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and a nearly 5% decline for the week.

Historically, lower interest rates drive liquidity into riskier assets. Among the growing list of top coins on analysts’ radar, three names stand out: Pi Network (PI), FARTCOIN, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) , the breakout underdog that’s generating serious FOMO and promising up to 50,000% gains. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin That Might Front-Run the Market FloppyPepe (FPPE) blends meme coin with an AI-hybrid that’s actively disrupting the norm. Analysts already compare it to early-stage AI projects, with even more upside potential due to its early presale valuation. With a smart contract audited by SolidProof, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a secure top coin for investors and traders alike. Its standout AI tools include: FloppyAI : A crypto-native AI bot that delivers trading insights, scans Twitter sentiment in real-time, and detects emerging altcoin trends before they go viral. Meme-O-Matic : An AI-powered meme generator that transforms simple prompts into viral-ready memes and videos, making it a powerful tool for creators, influencers, and marketers. Astute Floppynomics For Competitive ROI FloppyPepe (FPPE) is not hype-dependent; its economic structure is based on strong utility and a scarcity model that mimics Bitcoin’s halving logic by limiting supply while increasing demand. With a tightening supply and skyrocketing demand, this meme coin is set for a massive 50,000% upside potential—especially ahead of the proposed FED rate cut. Its Floppynomics structure is engineered for long-term growth and community rewards, featuring: 1% of every transaction is burned, making the token deflationary by design. 1% is redistributed to holders, incentivizing long-term commitment. Zero transaction tax for users, encouraging fluid trading without friction. Experts believe this could catalyze a 50,000% rally from the current price of $0.00000035 , especially with stage 2 of the presale offering an 80% bonus using the code FLOPPY80 . FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the top coin investors are hunting for before the next FED’s move And the numbers don’t lie: A $1,000 investment at current prices could yield $500,000 if the projected 50,000% gain hits, while a $10,000 investment could balloon to $5 million. This meme coin is the number one recommendation from analysts to buy for a potential 50,000% gain before the FED cuts rates. Pi Network (PI): Breakout Incoming Pi Network (PI) is officially a top coin. With over 35 million users worldwide, Pi Network (PI) is finally moving toward full mainnet deployment. Technical analysts are closely watching as Pi Network (PI) sits on the resistance at the $0.55 support level, offering a strategic entry point for investors. An analyst’s projection estimates a move to $1.50, offering massive upside. With the possibility of the FED rate cut confirmed , investors’ buying continues to build momentum, Pi Network (PI) could benefit from sector-wide bullishness. It’s clear that Pi Network (PI) remains a must-buy top coin. FARTCOIN: A Sensation Needing Direction FARTCOIN is one of the most talked-about meme coins of 2025, riding the wave of irreverent humor and Gen Z meme culture. FARTCOIN is trying to solidify its utility with strong social engagement and a few viral wins. FARTCOIN has proven itself to be a top coin. An analyst on X shared a promising chart , showing that with enough traction, FARTCOIN could see spikes, but serious investors are eyeing it as more of a short-term gamble, possibly before the FED rate cuts. This is because FARTCOIN lacks the technical depth that FloppyPepe (FPPE) delivers. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 80% Bonus Captures Smart Investors As we count down to the FED’s potential rate cuts, market sentiment is turning decisively bullish for altcoins. But among Pi Network (PI), FARTCOIN, and FloppyPepe (FPPE), it’s clear which project leads the pack. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale and priced at just $0.00000035 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers one of the most affordable entry points for investors looking to seize potential gains ahead of the anticipated FED rate cuts approval. Even better, buyers can double their token allocation by using the bonus code “FLOPPY80” . Additionally, with each new presale stage, early investors secure over 70% in potential gains, making FloppyPepe (FPPE) a smart pick for investors in search of top coins. With an expected 50,000% rally, the regret for missing out will be monumental. Buy the dip? No, invest in the meme. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the meme coin that might just fund your retirement.

The market is still moving sideways, with prices stuck within a narrow range. While there’s been a little bit of downward pressure, it hasn’t been enough to trigger any big changes. Some experts have wondered if Bitcoin’s current pattern might turn into a triangle, but there’s no clear sign of that happening. Triangles are rare patterns in the market, and it’s too early to say if this will develop into one. Bearish Update: For now, the focus remains on a correction phase that began after Bitcoin’s May high. The price has been pulling back since then, and it’s expected to possibly head lower before finding strong support. The key areas to watch are around $99,200 to $92,800. There’s even a chance it could dip as low as $81,340, which is considered an important support level. If Bitcoin breaks below that, it could signal the end of the bull market. Bullish Update: On the other hand, if Bitcoin holds above this zone, the long-term outlook remains positive. Once this correction ends, Bitcoin could target a move towards $130,000, and if market conditions improve, it might even rally higher, possibly up to $190,000. Looking at shorter timeframes, the price is currently holding above minor support levels. Over the weekend, it’s been expected that Bitcoin might see a small bounce or move sideways before heading lower again. A break above $108,822 could mean the market is turning more bullish in the short term, but for now, there’s no clear sign of that happening. In summary, Bitcoin is still in a correction phase with no confirmed breakdown or breakout. As long as it stays above key support levels, the larger uptrend remains intact.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 12:16:30

The company stated that altcoin dominance has reached historical support levels and warned that high volatility could be on the way in the coming days. Alphractal made the following statement in its statement: “Something big is about to happen in altcoins! Altcoin Dominance has reached historical support levels. We are on the verge of a wave of volatility in the coming days. Whether Bitcoin rises or falls, many altcoins are likely to outperform BTC in the coming months, so it is critical to be prepared.” Related News: Giant Whale Shorted These 16 Altcoins, Made Huge Profits Focusing on two important metrics in its analysis, Alphractal argued that these were the harbingers of serious rallies in the altcoin market in the past. Altcoin Dominance (excluding Stablecoins): It was stated that this metric found strong support at the 25% level and this level is often tested before major altcoin rallies. Altcoin Dominance (excluding ETH and Stablecoins): It was stated that this indicator has a critical support area around 18%. Falling below this level has historically triggered periods when altcoins gained significant market share against Bitcoin. The company noted that the levels in question do not directly guarantee an “altcoin season,” but that such technical signals have appeared before major market moves in the past. *This is not investment advice.

46069129,https://invezz.com/?p=2762234,1749990300,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"LINK soars on major oracle partnership, while MUTM sees record wallet sign-ups",https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/15/link-soars-on-major-oracle-partnership-while-mutm-sees-record-wallet-sign-ups/,"While Chainlink (LINK) continues to climb following news of a major oracle integration, another DeFi project is turning heads with explosive user growth and utility-driven innovation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale, has recorded over 12,000 holders and raised approximately $10.55 million so far. The project’s current token price sits at $0.03, triple the value offered during Phase 1—delivering a 200% increase for early investors. With six more phases remaining, entering now means capturing more upside before prices increase in the final rounds. Presale momentum signals strong investor confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started its presale at just $0.01 in Phase 1, gradually increasing in subsequent phases. With Phase 5 priced at $0.03, early participants have already secured significant returns. The next phase will bring the token price to $0.035, reducing the return potential for latecomers. As demand surges and allocation tightens, the incentive to act early grows stronger. Unlike many speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is actively building a functional and audited DeFi infrastructure. A beta version of the protocol is scheduled to launch by the time the token goes live, and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway further fuels user acquisition. Backed by a CertiK audit and a high Token Scan score of 80.00, the team is demonstrating its commitment to transparency and security. P2C and P2P lending models, layer-2 integration and passive income Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will support both pool-based (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, assets will be lent and borrowed from shared liquidity pools with dynamically adjusting interest rates based on real-time usage. Meanwhile, the P2P model will allow users to lend or borrow directly with custom terms. What will set the P2P model apart is its flexibility. It will support tokens that are rarely available on pool-based platforms, such as memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). This will open the door for holders of unconventional tokens to access liquidity or earn yield without needing to convert their assets. It will be an appealing option for traders who prefer niche assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing on a Layer-2 network to address one of the biggest challenges in DeFi—high gas fees and slow transaction speeds. By integrating Layer-2 scalability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to deliver a superior user experience. Traders, lenders, and borrowers will benefit from near-instant transactions and significantly lower fees, making the protocol practical for both retail and institutional users. One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s key value propositions is its dynamic income-generation model. Investors who deposit tokens such as Ethereum (ETH) or Avalanche (AVAX) into the protocol will receive mtTokens like mtETH or mtAVAX—interest-bearing representations of their deposits. These mtTokens not only track principal and accrued interest but also make users eligible for passive dividends. For example, an investor who deposits $5,000 worth of ETH into the protocol can expect annual returns aligned with the utilization of the pool. At an average utilization rate of 5-6%, this will generate approximately $275 annually in interest, excluding any additional dividend rewards. These passive earnings come with non-custodial control, as the deposited assets remain secured in smart contracts. Utility of the MUTM token The MUTM token isn’t just a placeholder—it’s a revenue-generating asset. Users benefit from protocol-driven buybacks where a portion of revenue is used to purchase MUTM on the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This creates upward demand pressure on the token while rewarding long-term contributors, tying MUTM’s value to the protocol’s success. By staking mtTokens, participants gain access to passive income, reinforcing the token’s role in the Mutuum ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also building a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed entirely by on-chain assets already held within the protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins that depend on off-chain fiat reserves, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be minted directly from existing protocol assets, with supply adjusting algorithmically. At the current Phase 5 price of $0.03, an investor who buys $100 worth of MUTM tokens will see that amount grow to $3,000 if the token appreciates 30x. With the token expected to hit $0.06 in Phase 11, investors entering now are securing their position at a 100% discount compared to the final presale price. Those who bought during Phase 1 at $0.01 have already tripled their investment before the token even goes live. The data speaks for itself: users are actively participating, the token’s value is rising with each phase, and utilities are rolling out with speed and transparency. CertiK audit and roadmap transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts underwent a comprehensive audit by CertiK, including static analysis and manual review. The audit process began on February 25, 2025, and was revised on May 20, 2025, culminating in a robust security profile and an audit score of 80.00. The team has publicly shared its development roadmap, which includes the beta launch of the platform with the public listing of the token. The ongoing community engagement, and rapid presale traction underscore a project built for growth. As Chainlink (LINK) rides the momentum of a major partnership, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a DeFi ecosystem from the ground up—prioritizing security, speed, and income-generation. From Layer-2 optimization and overcollateralized stablecoins to dynamic lending pools and peer-to-peer innovation, the project offers real solutions backed by audited infrastructure. Investors who recognize this early have already locked in 200% gains. With only six phases left before the final listing price, now is the time to get in—before the price climbs and early-phase profit margins shrink. Whether you’re seeking passive income, long-term growth, or utility-driven rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers.

Passed on June 14 and set to come into force on January 1, 2026, the law is considered a landmark in promoting digital innovation in the nation. Vietnam enacts standalone digital tech law Local publications reported that under the new law, digital assets will be classified into two large groups: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both use encryption and digital technology to authenticate and transfer. However, they also specifically remove securities, digital fiat, and other financial instruments from the definition. It is now up to Vietnam’s government to specify, for example, what kind of business is allowed and what kind of scrutiny will apply to the use and transferability of such assets. The law requires cybersecurity processes and anti-money laundering (AML) actions to comply with the global requirements issued by the law. It must be in sync with international best practices. This move is possibly in response to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) including Vietnam on its “gray list” in 2023 for increased scrutiny. In addition to regulating crypto, the laws symbolize Vietnam’s larger aspiration to take its place as a regional digital technology center . It would offer sweeping incentives to companies in areas like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. Those perks include tax breaks, friendly land-use policies, and research and development investments—especially for chip design companies and AI data centers. Push for digital literacy and investor protection intensifies The law also aims for a digitally literate workforce. Provincial governments have been tasked with developing education and training plans, and national curricula will be reformed to include digital technology skills. “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry,” the Vietnamese government said. In the meantime, Vietnam still grapples with crypto scams. Vietnamese authorities have recently arrested key figures behind a nationwide cryptocurrency scam that defrauded tens of thousands of investors out of nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (approximately $400 million). According to local reporting, the fraud ring operated under the guise of a fake virtual currency exchange called MTC (Matrix Chain). The Dong Nai Provincial Police led the months-long investigation with support from the Ministry of Public Security and other regional forces. After nearly 200 days of surveillance and evidence collection, officers arrested the group’s ringleader, Nguyen Quoc Hung, and four accomplices during coordinated raids across multiple provinces. Police also rounded up four suspects earlier this year, accused of coming up with BitMiner, a bogus cryptocurrency mining company that pretended to be based in Dubai. More than 200 people lost more than 4 billion Vietnamese dong (about $157,300) in a scheme that sold fraudulent mining packages and educational content. In December 2024, Hanoi City Police foiled a large-scale crypto scam that defrauded around 100 businesses and 400 individuals of 30 billion Vietnamese dong (approximately $1.17 million). Authorities intervened just in time to stop an additional 300 people from falling victim. Operating under Million Smiles, the company promoted an in-house cryptocurrency, QFS, or Quantum Financial System, using deceptive advertising that linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims. Vietnam’s new laws help fill the legal void around cryptocurrencies and signal the country’s willingness to be a global leader in the next era of global technology.

The content of the supposed document focuses on a supposed long-standing and undisclosed partnership between Amazon and XRP, asserting that Amazon has held a stake in 5 billion XRP since a deal allegedly negotiated in 2015. The post revives an old narrative that has circulated in XRP circles for several years, particularly among groups that discuss theories surrounding XRP’s future utility and price movement. Allegations of Locked XRP and Delayed Disclosure According to the excerpt, Amazon’s XRP holdings are currently locked, and the partnership has not been announced publicly. The supposed rationale behind this secrecy is to avoid prematurely inflating the asset’s value before it has widespread utility and usage . The text implies that public disclosure of such a partnership would result in a significant price increase for XRP, which is why, according to the author, it is being withheld strategically. What if??? https://t.co/fwsZfbN3QW pic.twitter.com/lY3bbN7pKW — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) June 13, 2025 Predicted Impact on XRP Price and Market Behavior The second section of the document speculates on the motivation for the secrecy. It argues that XRP’s price has not moved significantly in response to new developments because the token currently lacks practical use cases. However, the author predicts that when such use cases are introduced, they will trigger rapid price appreciation. It further suggests that large-scale investors are given time to accumulate XRP at low prices before any major announcements occur.

No Evidence or Confirmation from Amazon or Ripple While Digital Asset Investor did not add commentary beyond the phrase “What if???,” the inclusion of this material points to a broader interest within certain segments of the XRP community in theories that propose significant, yet unrevealed, corporate alliances. The original text does not provide external verification or documentation of the alleged Amazon agreement, and it does not cite any specific sources other than making general claims. There is also no official statement or confirmation from Amazon, Ripple, or any related entity supporting the existence of such a partnership.

Inspired by internet culture and driven by viral attention, PEPE has drawn in waves of traders hoping to ride short-term price swings. While the frenzy around memecoins like PEPE may capture headlines, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are steadily building long-term value through real-world utility, robust infrastructure, and a clear vision for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). PEPE: popular, loud, and lacking substance but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) building for the future Pepe (PEPE) has become the face of a renewed memecoin mania, capturing the imagination of speculative traders. The appeal lies in its meme-driven branding and rapid price movements. These features generate hype but often lack substance. Traders jump in hoping to double or triple their returns in days, only to exit just as quickly when the next trending token appears. As with many meme-based tokens, PEPE’s value is largely sentiment-driven, dependent on social media trends and community enthusiasm rather than any underlying technology or utility. Such assets rarely offer mechanisms for sustainable growth, nor do they provide passive income. While they make for exciting headlines, they typically do not contribute to long-term ecosystem development or investor security. Their volatility can lead to significant short-term gains—but also steep losses when the market shifts direction. In contrast to the hype-driven chaos of memecoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating real-world value through its fully decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol. With a total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens and a clear development roadmap, MUTM offers a structured and sustainable approach to DeFi. It will surely be gaining strong traction among users and investors seeking meaningful financial tools rather than speculative pumps. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to lend assets into liquidity pools and earn interest based on a dynamic, utilization-driven model. As demand for loans increases within a specific pool, interest rates rise, encouraging more lenders to participate. When borrowers step back due to high costs, rates naturally stabilize. This balance is achieved through smart contract automation, creating a market-efficient yield system that rewards participation without artificial inflation. Users receive mtTokens representing their deposits and accrued interest, providing them with immediate liquidity. These mtTokens can be traded on secondary exchanges or used as collateral to access additional opportunities within the platform. This real utility positions MUTM far beyond the scope of meme tokens, offering actual passive income backed by protocol activity. Strong presale results and rapid community growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already achieved several significant milestones. In Phase 5 of its presale, the project has raised approximately $10.55 million, offering tokens at just $0.03. With more than 12,000 holders and growing, interest in the platform is building steadily. The ongoing $100K giveaway has also helped expand the community and reward early supporters. Unlike memecoins that rely solely on hype, Mutuum is focused on transparency and security. The project recently completed a CertiK audit—one of the most respected blockchain security assessments—with a Token Scan Score of 80.00. The audit included both manual review and static analysis, providing strong assurance to participants and investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with Layer-2 integration to enhance its technical performance. This infrastructure choice will significantly reduce transaction costs and speed up operations, addressing two major pain points in traditional DeFi platforms. With faster and cheaper transactions, the platform becomes more user-friendly, ensuring broader accessibility and adoption. By the time the token goes live, Mutuum plans to launch a beta version of its platform, marking the transition from a presale token to experience functional DeFi protocol. This milestone will allow users to experience its features firsthand, including lending, borrowing, and mtToken generation. Stablecoin innovation and treasury strength Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing to launch a decentralized, fully overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike traditional stablecoins that depend on fiat reserves or centralized banks, Mutuum’s stable asset will be backed by on-chain collateral already held within the protocol. The minting process will be algorithmic, ensuring full transparency and dynamic supply adjustment. This stablecoin will offer a more secure borrowing option and provide additional stability to the protocol. Interest payments generated from borrowing activities will be redirected into the ecosystem, strengthening the protocol’s treasury and increasing sustainability. This approach enhances MUTM’s long-term value and opens new utility channels for its users. MUTM is designed to grow alongside its protocol. A portion of the platform’s profits will be used to repurchase tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This incentivizes long-term holding, deepens protocol liquidity, and creates demand pressure on the token’s price. Additional funds will support pool growth and strategic marketing initiatives, ensuring that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to expand its reach. As development continues, the team remains committed to completing all roadmap phases, including institutional partnerships, expansion to multiple blockchains, and the implementation of advanced analytics and compliance standards. These steps will elevate MUTM from a powerful DeFi platform to a cornerstone of decentralized finance infrastructure. For those seeking more than fleeting gains, the time is now to look beyond the memecoin hype and invest in real-world DeFi solutions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a token—it’s a financial ecosystem built for the future.

With fresh coins emerging and projects pushing boundaries, figuring out the top crypto to buy in 2025 can feel overwhelming. That’s why this guide highlights key coins expected to perform well in both utility and growth. These picks are based on long-term potential, practical use, and solid performance outlooks. Whether new to crypto or already active, these are the names worth tracking as 2025 approaches. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) Among the most talked-about choices for 2025 is BlockDAG (BDAG) , now drawing attention for all the right reasons. One of its standout moves is its vesting smart contract, which activates two weeks before its listing and allocates 40% of presale coins to early backers. This means those who joined the presale get to use BDAG on-chain before it’s live on exchanges, giving them a major head start. BlockDAG’s presale has now hit $304.5 million, selling over 22.6 billion coins. The batch 29 price is currently $0.0276. Since batch 1, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. The project’s solid delivery, smart contract execution, and clear roadmap keep it ahead of many rivals. As it nears official launch with strong community backing and a US-based sponsorship, BDAG is lining up as one of the top crypto to buy in 2025. 2. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot continues to stand out for those seeking dependable projects with tech that serves real-world needs. Its multi-chain structure lets different blockchains communicate, offering better scale, speed, and flexibility. This kind of interoperability makes it a smart choice for future-focused crypto users. With parachains already deployed and more in progress, Polkadot supports dApps and various blockchain-powered tools. As more chains enter the space, Polkadot’s design could be vital in helping them work together. That’s why many see DOT as a top crypto to buy in 2025, given its ongoing upgrades and role in expanding blockchain’s overall use. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) BNB has become much more than a coin linked to the Binance exchange. It powers Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a major player in the DeFi sector. BNB’s rise has followed Binance’s own growth, and that trend shows no signs of slowing in 2025. Its built-in demand remains strong due to its use in transaction fees on Binance platforms. As DeFi adoption rises globally and more projects choose BSC, BNB’s role expands. This gives it both real usage and staying power, placing Binance Coin firmly among the top crypto to buy in 2025. 4. XRP (Ripple) XRP continues to be a major name, especially in cross-border money transfers. Even with past legal pressure, Ripple’s coin is still used by major banks and services for faster, cheaper global payments. That alone keeps XRP in the spotlight. In 2025, outcomes in Ripple’s legal cases may strengthen XRP’s standing even more. If barriers ease, the coin could scale up in global financial systems. With a strong real-world function, XRP remains a top crypto to buy in 2025 for those eyeing international finance solutions. Final Call! Choosing the top crypto to buy in 2025 means more than chasing hype. What really counts is long-term strength and real use. BlockDAG’s early use case, smart contract rollout, and US-based sponsorship add up to a strong profile. Its steady growth to $304.5 million and 2,660% presale gains highlight why it’s turning heads. Polkadot, Binance Coin, and XRP also bring serious advantages, offering blockchain links, DeFi infrastructure, and payment speed. All four have features that could shape the crypto space in 2025 and beyond.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation movement between $105,000 – $106,000 following slight, after prices crashed to below $103,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, prominent analytics company Glassnode has shared some valuable insight into the Bitcoin market dissecting the growth of the current bull cycle so far. Bitcoin Demand Matches Maturation Rate In an X post on June 14, Glassnode draws comparisons of Bitcoin price growth in the present market cycle to previous ones. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection Notably, the crypto market cycle is a recurring four-year period marked by consecutive phases of accumulation, a bull market, distribution and a bear market. In the last two cycles i.e 2015-2018 and 2018-2022, Bitcoin achieved price gains of 1076% and 1007%, respectively, significantly multiplying its market cap. For the current cycle from 2022 till date, Bitcoin’s prices have now grown by 656%. While this figure is far off previous cycles, Glassnode reports that it’s a commendable achievement considering the premier cryptocurrency’s maturation in the past four years marked by an exposure to institutional investors and a $2 trillion valuation. Generally, assets are expected to produce little exponential growth with continued price growth. This can be seen with gold only achieving an estimated 192% growth over the past 10 years. Therefore, Glassnode notes that Bitcoin’s 6x market gain since 2022 is highly positive development that reflects a sustainable market demand even as the asset’s market cap grows. Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $105,540 following a slight 0.20% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 35.39% representing significant fall in market participation. Interestingly, reputable analytics firm Sentora reports the Bitcoin network weekly fees fell by 3.31% following recent negative political events coupled with an already uncertain market sentiment. Meanwhile, exchange inflows also grew by $2.4 billion indicating a significant amount of investors are looking to distribute their holdings while the premier cryptocurrency struggles to re-establish a bullish price direction.

According to the post, if the court approves the latest motion, XRP could “rise above $5 quickly.” But not everyone shares this optimism. Legal expert Bill Morgan has issued a sobering reminder that history and legal precedent suggest caution, not celebration. Why Bill Morgan Is Urging Caution Responding to the growing excitement, Bill Morgan, a well-respected lawyer and cryptocurrency legal analyst, urged XRP holders to temper their expectations. He pointed to the court’s recent history in handling a similar motion—one that Judge Analisa Torres swiftly rejected despite being jointly filed by both Ripple and the SEC. Perhaps you should not hope for that. It only took 7 days for Judge Torres to reject the last joint motion to modify the judgment to reduce the fine and dissolve the injunction. Less than 7 days to decide the current joint motion may not be the best sign she will grant it. https://t.co/9yFksn6Jrq — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 15, 2025 “Perhaps you should not hope for that,” Morgan warned. “It only took 7 days for Judge Torres to reject the last joint motion to modify the judgment to reduce the fine and dissolve the injunction. Less than 7 days to decide the current joint motion may not be the best sign she will grant it.” His concern is based on timing. A quick ruling, while seemingly efficient, may indicate that the judge is not open to altering her original judgment. This mirrors the court’s earlier rejection of a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s penalties and dissolve the ban on certain XRP sales. That motion was denied in just one week. Price Speculation vs. Legal Reality XRP Governor’s claim that XRP could surge past $5 if the motion is approved has fueled bullish speculation. But Morgan’s warning serves as a reminder that legal processes don’t operate on price predictions. Even if the motion were granted, it wouldn’t necessarily trigger an immediate or sustained rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s market performance is influenced by a wide range of factors, including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory clarity. A positive court ruling could enhance Ripple’s legal position, but it doesn’t necessarily promise a dramatic price surge, given the crypto market’s volatility. What’s Really at Stake on June 16 The motion currently before the court seeks to finalize the penalty phase of the case and potentially lift the injunction that prevents Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors in the U.S. While it’s a critical step in closing the multi-year legal battle, it’s not the dramatic conclusion some are expecting. This case began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. In July 2023, Judge Torres issued a split ruling, finding that XRP sales on exchanges did not violate securities laws, but institutional sales did. As June 16 approaches , Morgan’s advice is both timely and necessary: don’t confuse legal procedure with market momentum. A quick decision isn’t always a favorable one, and expecting a $5 XRP based solely on a court filing could lead to disappointment.

Key Takeaways: Russian intelligence is using Bitcoin to fund covert operations, including the recruitment of teenage spies. Blockchain forensics traced espionage payments to wallets linked to the FSB, showing structured laundering patterns. This case is part of a broader trend, with crypto also used to finance propaganda and sabotage across Europe. A Reuters investigation , conducted with blockchain forensics firms Global Ledger and Recoveris, has revealed how the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) used crypto to finance espionage. One case involved Canadian national Laken Pavan, who was just 17 when he was recruited by the FSB after traveling to Donetsk to join pro-Russian forces. Teen Spy Case Reveals Russia’s Use of Coercion and Crypto Payments After several days in detention, Pavan was coerced into spying for Russia and assigned a handler known as Slon, Russian for “elephant.” His instructions included traveling across Europe to collect intelligence, with payments sent in Bitcoin. After receiving just over $500 in BTC while in Copenhagen, Pavan fled to Poland, where he turned himself in on May 22, 2024. He was later sentenced to 20 months in prison by Polish authorities. The payment Pavan received was traced to two intermediary wallets by blockchain analysts, which had received significant funds from a larger wallet created in June 2022. That wallet has since processed more than $600 million in Bitcoin, including transactions routed through Garantex, a sanctioned Russian crypto exchange. JUST IN: Russia's central bank showcases #Bitcoin as the most profitable investment over the past year pic.twitter.com/y9MB4vyGAD — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 15, 2025 Global Ledger’s analysis found that the wallets linked to Pavan’s payments operated exclusively during Moscow business hours, pointing to a highly structured laundering network. “Transactions from wallets linked to the FSB followed a structured laundering pattern, involving fund splitting, mixing with larger sums, and routing through unconnected deposit wallets,” Global Ledger said in its report. The case is not isolated. According to Marcin Zarakowski, CEO of Recoveris, Russian intelligence has used Bitcoin to fund multiple covert operations. “This method has been uncovered on multiple occasions,” he said, citing a 2023 case involving young Belarusians and Ukrainians who were paid in crypto by the GRU to install surveillance devices and spread propaganda in Poland. Some were even paid in BTC to commit acts of arson. 161 Bitcoin Wallets Tied to Russia’s FSB Show Patterned Activity Recoveris has also identified a network of 161 Bitcoin addresses linked to the FSB, with hundreds of transactions occurring within 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Moscow time. Russia’s reliance on crypto extends to mercenary funding in Donbas and payments to European politicians for disseminating pro-Kremlin narratives. As reported, Russia is exploring ways to use cryptocurrencies to settle grain export payments, as the country looks to bypass Western sanctions and modernize its trade infrastructure. More recently, Russia’s central bank announced that it is allowing qualified investors limited access to crypto-linked financial products. Under the new guidance, banks and financial firms can offer derivatives and securities tied to cryptocurrency prices, though these products must be non-deliverable and settled in fiat.

Meanwhile, institutional Ethereum plays, such as SharpLink’s $463 million buy-in, signal growing crypto interest, even if short-term momentum leans toward contenders like ETH. Retailers’ Stablecoin Push Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring their stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Why Did Bitcoin Dip as Gold Surged Amid Israel-Iran Tensions? ► https://t.co/qOgkORaiao https://t.co/qOgkORaiao — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) June 13, 2025 Despite the “digital gold” narrative, Bitcoin trailed volatile tech equities, while gold prices jumped due to demand for safer assets. ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum slowed, reflecting waning investor confidence amid global fear. Though headline risk keeps Bitcoin under $105K, sustained institutional buying could prevent a drop beneath $100K. Bitcoin Technical Setup and Price Structure On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin has formed a rising trendline off early-June lows near $102,817, printing higher lows that suggest durable support. Trading between the 23.6% Fib retracement at $104,643 and 38.2% Fib at $105,772, BTC finds itself sandwiched under the 50‑EMA at $105,940. A Doji candle near the lower boundary signals market indecision. Momentum indicators add nuance: the MACD line is converging with its signal, and the histogram is shrinking from negative territory—both signs of cautious bullish sentiment. Absence of bearish patterns like “Three Black Crows” and presence of a spinning top candle point to consolidation rather than capitulation. Risk Zones and Bitcoin Trade Strategy Here’s a potential Bitcoin price prediction you can follow: Bullish Entry : Watch for a breakout above $105,772 and the 50‑EMA. Stop‑loss : Place it below today’s swing low near $104,500. Targets : $106,685 (50% Fib) $107,598 (61.8% Fib) Alternatively: Bearish Strategy : If Bitcoin drops below $104,600 (trendline + 23.6% Fib), it could revisit $102,817 support.

Although the asset has recovered some ground since the Friday lows, there is still a considerable threat that it could plummet by another 30% if it breaches a certain support line, according to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez. #Dogecoin $DOGE must hold above $0.168 to avoid a 30% price drop! pic.twitter.com/PDhqo7fpcK — Ali (@ali_charts) June 15, 2025 The support in question is the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern, which has been formed since the early 2025 highs when DOGE’s price challenged the $0.4 level on a few occasions. However, the largest meme coin has been unable to maintain its run and dumped hard in the following months. It bottomed in early April, during the worst period of the trade war between the US and the rest of the world, at roughly $0.13. Its recovery since then saw DOGE go above $0.25 in May, but that was short-lived, and it’s now trading close to $0.175 following a 4.5% weekly decline and a 23% monthly decrease. If the painful scenario outlined by Martinez materializes, DOGE’s price will tumble to a new yearly low of under $0.12. Andrew Griffiths’s analysis also leaned toward a bearish future for the largest meme coin, as it had charted a few consecutive lower highs.

The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $104,951. BTC lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $110,355 thanks to macroeconomic factors and escalating geopolitical tensions after Israel struck key targets in Iran. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Could Become A Challenge Roxom Global CEO Borja Martel Seward has warned that when the Bitcoin bull market ends, a bearish phase could cause several Bitcoin treasury companies to struggle. Bitcoin has charted its own course despite growing macroeconomic uncertainties impacting the traditional and crypto markets. According to Seward, Bitcoin operates to its own “beating drum rhythm,” operating as an independent and contrarian asset in an economy dealing with cooling Fed rate cut expectations, quantitative tightening, US Treasury General Account replenishment, and potential Bank of Japan rate hikes. “Bitcoin goes at its own pace, bitcoin is independent, bitcoin has its own cycles.” Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are experiencing a bull run, which Seward believes could continue for a few months. Several other proponents of the asset, including Tim Draper, echoed the sentiment, asserting that Bitcoin could surge to new highs by the end of 2025. However, Seward cautioned against Bitcoin and crypto, stating, “Eventually, the bull market will finish. We will enter into a more bearish phase. This euphoria, this mania will dissipate. Some companies will go underwater, and the market structure will reset.” The warning comes amid a growing trend of public and private companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. The trend was pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . According to Seward, these companies' adoption of Bitcoin presents a unique dynamic for upcoming market shifts. “We will have to see how what today right now is a blessing regarding the bitcoin treasury companies turns out to play once the bear market hits, and we’ll see if treasury companies start selling or not.” Top Indicators Hint At $230,000 Peak CoinGlass has urged investors to “hold 100%” at current prices even as the asset reported record price levels and 30% gains in Q2. While Bitcoin may be consolidating after reaching record highs, a list of classic on-chain indicators is showing no signs of market exhaustion. CoinGlass’ “bull market peak” selection contains 30 potential selling triggers that aim to highlight long-term Bitcoin price tops. According to CoinGlass, none of the indicators are flashing a top signal. Popular trader Cas Abbe posted on X, stating, “None of the 30 major top indicators on Coinglass have triggered yet. Not Pi Cycle, Not MVRV, Not even RSI. According To these models $BTC will be $135K to $230K this cycle. This ain’t the top.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum this week after crossing $110,000 on Monday. While it stalled after reaching this level, market watchers were hopeful of a push higher as bullish sentiment persisted. However, a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions saw markets plunge, with BTC dropping to $105,828 on Thursday and falling to a low of $102,832 on Friday as bearish sentiment took hold. According to analysts, BTC has encountered downside volatility after it failed to stay above the crucial $106,000 level. Analyst Michael van de Poppe flagged the $106,000 level as vital for maintaining upward momentum. According to van de Poppe, BTC’s latest rally was rejected after testing $106,000, with the price falling back between the $104,000-$105,000 region. If BTC dips below $105,000 again, it could drop to $100,000 by the end of June, mimicking a similar rejection that saw the price drop sharply to $100,000. BTC registered a sharp drop on Monday (June 2), falling to a low of $103,768. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,092. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Source: TradingView BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Sellers took control on Wednesday as buyers lost momentum. As a result, BTC fell 1.42% and settled at $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 3% and settled at $105,828. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. Price action was back in the red on Saturday, with BTC down nearly 1%, trading at $105,482. The current session sees the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.

46070100,https://finbold.com/?p=247136,1749994090,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Experts predict when quantum computers will break Bitcoin’s encryption,https://finbold.com/experts-predict-when-quantum-computers-will-break-bitcoins-encryption/,"Recent advances in quantum computing have reignited concerns about the security of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Most notably, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) plans to launch the world’s first fault-tolerant quantum computer, IBM Quantum Starling, by 2029, a major leap from today’s error-prone machines. As these developments unfold, experts are debating when quantum technology might break Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses, specifically, its elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and SHA-256 hashing, which secure wallets and transactions. In this context, Finbold has gathered expert insights on when quantum computing could threaten Bitcoin. Craig Gidney In May 2025, Google quantum researcher Craig Gidney warned that the timeline might be shorter than expected. His findings revealed that breaking RSA encryption may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. While Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA, it does rely on ECC, which, like RSA, can be broken by Shor’s algorithm. Although Gidney didn’t directly mention Bitcoin, his research targeted encryption methods that underpin crypto wallets and, in some cases, transactions. He suggested a potential threat window between 2030 and 2035, depending on advancements in error correction. “I estimate that a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in under a week by a quantum computer with fewer than one million noisy qubits,” Gidney wrote. Adam Black In contrast, Adam Back, an early Bitcoin adopter and CEO of Blockstream, remains more cautious. In April 2025, he argued that quantum computers likely won’t pose a serious threat for at least two decades. Still, he acknowledged that future breakthroughs could force holders to migrate their coins to quantum-resistant addresses, including possibly Satoshi Nakamoto’s untouched stash, which could reveal whether the mysterious founder is still alive. David Carvalho Meanwhile, in a June 2025 opinion published by Cointelegraph , David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol, issued a more urgent warning. He claimed that quantum computers could crack Bitcoin within five years unless it quickly upgrades its cryptography. Carvalho specifically pointed to the emergence of technologies like Microsoft’s Majorana chip as a sign that powerful quantum systems are already on the horizon. According to him, about 30% of Bitcoin is currently stored in vulnerable addresses, and a single breach could shatter the trust built over the network’s 16-year history. “A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late,” he said. Chamath Palihapitiya Similarly, back in December 2024, as reported by Finbold, billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya cautioned that Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption might be broken within two to five years due to the pace of quantum progress. His warning came after Google unveiled its 105-qubit Willow chip, which was viewed as a significant milestone. He estimated that around 8,000 such chips could potentially break Bitcoin’s encryption. While scaling to that level remains a major hurdle, Palihapitiya urged blockchain developers to start reworking hashing algorithms now. Ultimately, the quantum threat to Bitcoin hinges on creating fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits, a milestone that’s still years away.

However, the cryptocurrency sector has witnessed more widespread adoption than ever before over the past year. According to the State of Crypto 2025 report from the digital asset exchange Coinbase’s research team, small business operations and real-world use cases, like payroll and remittances from institutional investors, have been driving stablecoin growth. U.S. Businesses Embrace Crypto Coinbase conducted surveys for small and medium businesses (SMBs) and institutional investors in April and January 2025, respectively, for the report. The exchange found that claimed ownership of crypto is more common than people think; a rising number of institutions are working on blockchain initiatives and have included such plans in their corporate strategies. Six in ten executives of Fortune 500 (F500) companies said their firms are building on-chain initiatives. Roughly 47% of respondents reported that their companies have increased their investment in blockchain technology. Also, the number of on-chain projects per company has risen 67% year-on-year (YoY) from 5.8 to 9.7. The top types of on-chain initiatives seen among the F500 include payment/settlements, cross-border transfers, supply chain management, corporate treasury, and blockchain infrastructure. Coinbase found that 17 unique on-chain initiatives were announced by F100 companies last quarter and 46 between Q3 2024 and Q1 2025. There is also increased diversity from financial service and technology companies to auto and transportation, retail, food and beverage, and healthcare firms. How Can Regulatory Clarity Help? Examining SMBs, Coinbase found that 34% of such businesses currently use crypto; 46% of those who do not are likely to start within the next three years. At least 82% of SMBs believe crypto can address some of their financial pain points. “2025 has been a triple-double for crypto among SMBs,” Coinbase stated, adding that the number of SMBs using crypto and stablecoins has doubled YoY. This increased crypto adoption has driven stablecoin transfer volumes to unprecedented levels. The sector witnessed its two highest monthly organic transfer volumes in December 2024 ($719 billion) and April 2025 ($717.1 billion). Since 2019, the number of people holding stablecoins has grown to over 160 million. Stablecoin holders have surpassed the population of the ten largest cities in the world combined and exceed the 142 million combined users of the U.S. Big Four mobile banking apps. Meanwhile, Coinbase highlighted the role regulatory clarity could play in the full realization of crypto’s potential. Nine in ten F500 executives agree with the exchange, as well as 72% of SMBs.

Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) price was trading at $40.4 on Sunday, June 15, a few points below the all-time high of $43.96. Its market capitalization has moved to $13 billion, while its fully diluted valuation rose to $40.75 billion. DeFi Llama data shows that the total value locked of Hyperliquid’s layer-1 chain has jumped to $2.01 billion after soaring by 70% in the last 30 days. This growth makes it the 11th biggest chain in the crypto industry, passing popular networks like Cardano, Hedera Hashgraph, and Near Protocol. The biggest players in Hyperliquid’s layer-1 network are Hyperliquid itself, Hyperlend, Felix, Morpho, and Hyperbeat. Further data shows that Hyperliquid has become one of the biggest players in the stablecoin industry. It has $3.7 billion of stablecoins in its layer-1 network, a big increase from $2 billion in January this year. You might also like: Bitcoin price eyes multi-year breakout as ETF inflows hit $1.3 billion An increase in stablecoin volume is a sign that the network is highly active. Most importantly, Hyperliquid is the sixth biggest player in the stablecoin industry after Ethereum, Tron, Solana, BNB Chain, and Base. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s perpetual exchange has continued to gain share in its industry. It handled over $4.43 billion worth of transactions in the last 24 hours, much higher than the other top-ten platforms combined. Its monthly volume jumped to $242 billion. More data shows that investors are staking their HYPE tokens, as the staking market cap has jumped by 16% in the last seven days to $17.1 billion. HYPE price technical analysis Hyperliquid price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows the HYPE price has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months, moving from a low of $9.29 in April to $40 today. It has moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest points since May 12. Hyperliquid token is above the 50-period and 100-period moving averages and the key support at $39.94, the highest point in May. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target an all-time high of $43.95. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point of $50.

Bitcoin fell nearly 4%, Ethereum and Solana dipped more than 8%, and the total market cap slid by over $250 billion. Barron’s reports that gold, not crypto, is attracting flight-to-safety flows. The Economic Times links this drop directly to renewed conflict and market stress. While price dips dominate headlines, a growing cohort of investors is moving capital into assets with clear frameworks, capped supply, and meaningful participation models. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris enters the picture — a protocol quietly offering structure in a market often ruled by speculation. Scarcity That’s Locked, Not Leveraged Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) follows the same foundational limit that gave Bitcoin its power: a maximum of 21 million tokens. But unlike most presale models, Solaris doesn’t leave room for manipulation after launch. There are no token printing functions, no inflation-based emissions, and no surprise unlocks. Only 4.5 million tokens, 20% of total supply are reserved for presale across all phases. Early buyers could see massive gains at the projected $20 exchange listing: even now in phase 7 at $7, presale participants are still positioned for an expected 186% return. These figures aren’t abstract — they’re derived directly from the stated public benchmarks and token supply math. Participation Without Barriers The typical mining story begins with capital: GPUs, rigs, validators, locked capital in staking pools. Bitcoin Solaris breaks that mold. Its mobile-native infrastructure allows BTC-S to be mined using smartphones. Not through gimmicks, but by contributing real computing resources to idle CPU and storage through the upcoming Nova App, tested in beta and now rolling out. What this unlocks is user access that doesn’t depend on wealth or technical skills. Earning BTC-S becomes something thousands can do while the phone sits unused — making crypto yield part of daily life, not a speculative gamble. Performance That Matches the Pitch Bitcoin Solaris isn’t selling future deliverables. Its dual-layer blockchain architecture is already operational. At the base, Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity deliver secure validation. The Solaris Layer stacks on top with Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time — enabling over 10,000 transactions per second, confirmed in under two seconds, using 99.95% less energy than legacy models. This isn’t a roadmap. These are tested outputs that redefine what accessibility in crypto infrastructure can mean. Security That’s Verified, Not Promised BTC-S stands out as one of the few early-stage projects with independent audits from day one. Cyberscope completed a full audit of its smart contract logic. Freshcoins reviewed its mobile mining backend. The team behind the project has undergone KYC verification , confirming their identities and roles. In an environment filled with anonymous wallets and speculative launches, this level of transparency offers something much rarer: accountability. Analyst Signals Confirm Market Interest Crypto researcher and influencer Ben Crypto released an in-depth breakdown this month, comparing Bitcoin Solaris’s architecture and incentive system to Bitcoin’s early days — not in branding, but in structure. He highlighted that a fixed supply paired with permissionless earning access gives BTC-S a path to organic adoption not seen since Bitcoin itself gained traction post-2012. The community response reflects that confidence. More than 11,500 wallets have participated, and over $4.5 million has been raised without private rounds, venture allocations, or whitelist-only manipulation. The Final Window Is Narrowing Phase 7 is active, with BTC-S priced at $7. That presale window closes soon. After this, public listings are expected to begin around $20, with liquidity incentives and mining competition ramping up significantly. Waiting means paying more. It also means entering a much more competitive yield environment. For those still on the sidelines, there’s a very real choice to make: join the protocol while participation is affordable or watch from the outside once market attention drives exposure.

The Tenkan, also known as the conversion line, is an intriguing indicator for short-term trend strength in Ichimoku analysis. According to the analyst, the current setup on Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the conditions aligning for a golden cross where the shorter-term average overtakes the longer-term one, which is a potential long-term bullish shift. This crossover, if confirmed, would be one of the most reliable trend-reversal patterns in technical trading. Right now, Bitcoin’s price action is consolidating around $105,000. However, if this golden cross does play out well, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward the key resistance level around $111,600. However, current geopolitical instability, especially the rising tensions in the Middle East, could disrupt this technical picture at any moment and cause a reassessment of the bullish outlook. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Support And Whale Activity Clash With Bullish Setup Despite the bullish technical backdrop, other market signals are flashing warnings for Bitcoin. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez identified $104,124 as an important support level for Bitcoin. This price point is not just arbitrary, as it represents a heavy concentration of UTXO realized prices. Many investors bought in at that level, and if Bitcoin falls below it, the next likely destination could be $97,405. The URPD chart confirms that the safety net between $104,000 and $97,000 is somewhat thin. This means that once $104,000 is breached to the downside, a swift and steep correction could follow due to the lack of strong buying interest in that gap. Image From X: Ali_charts Further complicating the picture is the behavior of large Bitcoin holders. On-chain data shows that some of the biggest whales, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, have started reducing their holdings in recent days. This decline in whale wallet count initially began shortly after Bitcoin reached its new all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. The reduction in whale count resumed again after Bitcoin was rejected at the $110,000 region early last week. Image From X: Ali_charts Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection As such, whale addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have fallen from a recent peak of 2,114 to a recent reading of 2,094 addresses. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,505.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 670,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin treasury companies will be the source of tremendous selling pressure in the next bear market. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that private and public companies across the globe hold 1,112,904 BTC worth more than $117.445 billion at time of writing. Says DonAlt, “Bitcoin treasury companies… will be the reason for the next bear market being as violent as prior bear markets, and no one can convince me otherwise. Good Ponzi while they’re going though so keep going.” According to DonAlt, the next Bitcoin bear market could be as devastating as the one witnessed in 2018 when BTC collapsed from $20,000 to $3,000. “Whatever the top ends up being, 70-80% down from that would be my guess.” While DonAlt sees a crippling Bitcoin bear market once BTC tops out this cycle, he remains bullish on the crypto king for now. In a new strategy session, he says that a Bitcoin move below a key support level could trigger an over 11% correction from current levels. “If we set a new low below $101,000, I could easily see us wipe towards $95,000 if not $90,000 pretty quickly.” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,438.

46073802,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=29191,1749998891,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png,Bitcoin-Backed Loans Unlock Real Estate Market for Crypto-Rich Investors,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-backed-loans-unlock-real-estate-market/,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Open Door for Property Purchasers Increasingly, Bitcoin holders are leveraging crypto-backed loans to purchase property—without losing a single satoshi or paying capital gains tax. “It’s becoming more mainstream by the day,” declared Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of cryptocurrency lender Ledn. “Early adopters, entrepreneurs, high-net-worth crypto investors who don’t necessarily qualify for traditional lending—this is how they’re gaining access to property.” How It Works: No Sale, No Tax Bitcoin-backed lending allows clients to borrow against their BTC holdings—typically a 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio—and be paid back in fiat or stablecoins. Since lending is not considered taxable in most jurisdictions, clients get access to liquidity while still being subject to potential gains in the price of BTC. “Borrowing against your Bitcoin as collateral does not usually trigger capital gains tax because you are not selling your Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said. Quick Funding, Flexible Terms Funding of the loan is fast, with a minimum of just 9.6 hours using Ledn. The loans are used by borrowers either as a deposit or to purchase property outright. There are no monthly repayments; interest accumulates over time and borrowers are free to repay at any time without incurring a penalty—if the LTV is limited below 60%. If Bitcoin increases in value, one can withdraw excess collateral. But if BTC declines and the LTV reaches 80%, the lender auto-liquidates sufficient BTC to repay the loan, keeping the transaction safe while letting the borrower retain the property. No Credit Check, Only Bitcoin Unlike conventional lenders, crypto lenders such as Ledn do not perform credit checks. Having 2:1 collateral provides lenders with assurance, particularly as Bitcoin is traded 24/7 and provides extensive liquidity. “Bitcoin is the world’s cleanest collateral,” Di Bartolomeo stated. During Q1 2025, Ledn disbursed more than $300 million worth of retail loans and is projected to reach more than $1 billion by the end of the year. In 2024 alone, customers allegedly withdrew more than 1,000 BTC as excess collateral due to increasing prices—far exceeding what they paid in interest. They prefer this method in order to acquire hard assets such as property without selling their top-performing investment. “They want to invest in a new property without selling their Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said. Demand Surges Among High-Net-Worth Crypto Owners Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca also testified in May that BTC holders are becoming more and more at ease with taking advantage of crypto as collateral. Xapo began lending against BTC with a maximum $1 million USD loan in March. Increasing confidence, loans backed by crypto are a powerful financial tool—without compromise enabling real estate purchase.",Bitcoin|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-15 14:48:11

Every new filing hints at deeper capital and a stronger seal of legitimacy than retail enthusiasm alone can provide. The latest catalyst is Solana. On 13 June, the Securities and Exchange Commission quietly asked a cluster of heavyweight issuers to submit refreshed S1 documents for proposed spot Solana funds, a move many analysts interpret as an informal green light to keep the process moving. When the same regulator that only recently waved Bitcoin products through begins reviewing another chain, it shows that digital assets are no longer a single-coin story. Hope for a broader institutional embrace has returned just as prices struggle under geopolitical stress. Solana’s ETF Moment Could Set the Altcoin Market on Fire Within a short window, some of the largest names in asset management delivered updated filings for spot Solana ETFs. Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and even Canary all appeared on the list. These aren’t speculative newcomers. These are firms with decades of institutional reach now attempting to wrap Solana into something Wall Street can trade with a click. More importantly, this round of filings includes a serious feature: staking. That opens up the possibility of Solana ETFs not only tracking price but also generating native yield. UPDATE: Multiple stories broke the news earlier this week that the SEC had reached out to issuers requesting them to submit updated documents for their Solana ETFs & to include staking. As of 5 PM EST we have 6 of the 7 hopeful Solana ETF issuers that have submitted those S-1's pic.twitter.com/WqPI2jf2CW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 It’s a striking change in tone. Until recently, the assumption was that altcoin-based ETFs were still years away. Now it feels like the floodgates could open, and Solana is first in line. The impact of that is not limited to just SOL. Whenever fresh institutional money enters a major chain, the effects bleed into everything that operates in its orbit: meme tokens, infrastructure projects, and DeFi applications. Add to that the growing chatter around companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring stablecoins for real-world utility. These aren’t just theoretical discussions. Blockchain is being scouted for high-volume commercial use, and if that materializes, Solana stands as one of the top contenders to support it. The network is fast, relatively low-cost, and already trending among developers. All of this builds a perfect backdrop. Solana’s possible ETF approval might not just lift one asset. It might ignite the next rotation. And if that happens, the smartest bets may be on what moves next, not just what moves first. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Altcoins Worth Checking Out Solaxy Solaxy is a layer two ledger created to relieve pressure on both Solana and Ethereum. Validators collect thousands of user interactions, compress them into a single proof, and post that proof to whichever base chain the sender prefers. Fees drop to almost nothing and finality settles in roughly one second. Developers keep the familiar Solana programming model, so migrations involve only a change of endpoint instead of a full rewrite. A portion of every network fee moves to a burn address, reducing supply as volume grows. Proposed Solana exchange-traded funds could send unprecedented traffic through the chain, and stress tests show that Solaxy absorbs those bursts without raising costs. Large desks can route trades through Solaxy, rebalance across chains, and settle on their chosen ledger while retaining the trust guarantees of each base network. It's now clear... NOTHING can slow $SOLX down. 🛸🪐49M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/uEFZXiROcQ — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 13, 2025 Having raised close to a whopping $50 million, SOLX, the native token of the project, is likely to go live across multiple exchanges very soon. The same mechanism lets consumer apps confirm in-game asset changes instantly yet still anchor ownership on a public ledger. With a live validator set, auditable throughput, and a supply curve that tightens whenever volume rises, Solaxy offers a direct line to any institutional wave that follows the first Solana fund approval. Snorter Snorter operates inside Telegram, the same chat windows traders already use each day. The bot monitors new liquidity pools on Solana, checks bytecode against a risk engine that screens for honeypots, and fires orders if the token passes. The entire cycle finishes in about a second, so users often enter before price trackers even list the pair. Preferences live locally, and keys never leave the owner’s wallet. Experienced scouts can publish playbooks for followers who mirror trades automatically, paying a portion of realised profit to the strategist. That fee flows to token stakers who keep servers online and fund recurring audits, creating an ecosystem where every role earns something. The project’s theme itself is exciting too, since it features an aardvark which, as the name suggests, sorts and finds out gems and opportunities for investors to make more profits. A creative use of design elements like this is often what intrigues and attracts attention, something that the developers have managed to understand and apply strategically. A Solana ETF wave would draw more builders and traders, and Snorter is prepared for that surge. It already aggregates pool data from Orca and Raydium, with Ethereum and Base support scheduled next month. A recent audit financed by the Solana Foundation cleared critical issues, giving newcomers confidence that orders route safely. For anyone who wants speed and security in the same interface, Snorter turns Telegram into a launchpad instead of a chat room. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper delivers the speed of the Solana Virtual Machine to the world’s oldest blockchain without surrendering Bitcoin’s security principles. The process begins when a user deposits native bitcoin into a monitored address. A relay contract written for Solana’s runtime then checks the incoming block headers and transaction proofs. Once verification passes, an equal amount of wrapped bitcoin appears on the Bitcoin Hyper network, ready for transfers that confirm almost immediately. Activity on this layer two does not remain in isolation. Transactions batch into concise proofs, and every cycle a summary of network state returns to Bitcoin’s first layer, anchoring the ledger in familiar proof-of-work territory. Withdrawals simply reverse the path. A request on the faster rail instructs the canonical bridge to unlock the original coins, so custody never leaves the user’s control. The native token forms the system’s economic engine. Guardians who watch for double spend collect it as payment, liquidity providers earn it for keeping channels full, and stakers receive a share of network fees while also voting on upgrades. Current distribution allocates 30% to ongoing development, 25% to a treasury for expansion, and the remainder across marketing, exchange listings, and community rewards. An audit by Coinsult has already cleared the codebase, easing common concerns around new infrastructure. The project has been recommended as a top token worthy of consideration by leading crypto-based publication websites and creators like Cilinix Crypto , among others. Roughly $1.2 million has entered the current presale stage already and is likely to fill soon before the next price advance. That early traction arrives at a moment when spot Solana funds are inching toward approval. If institutional traders gain regulated access to Solana, they will also seek rapid pathways between bitcoin pairs. Bitcoin Hyper provides that route today, marrying the liquidity of the flagship asset with a settlement speed that aligns with modern markets. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token powers a multi-chain crypto wallet built for users who need both simplicity and serious control. It connects to over sixty networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and even lesser-known EVM chains, with balances, NFTs, and positions all visible in one unified dashboard. The design feels more like a banking super app than a traditional wallet, yet everything remains fully self-custodial. You hold the keys, and the interface never cuts corners on privacy. The utility of the token runs throughout the experience. It governs staking tiers, unlocks early access to high-interest pools, and secures the smart contract modules that power everything from swaps to analytics. One of its most unique features is the Upcoming Tokens tab, which is an in-app portal that curates trending presales and early launches before they go mainstream. This section is already becoming a magnet for both retail and influencers looking for signal over noise. Where this wallet starts to stand apart is its positioning around the incoming ETF wave. If institutional interest widens the crypto funnel, retail users will demand a platform that simplifies everything without limiting what they can do. Best Wallet is designed to be that bridge. Its layered security uses social recovery, local encryption, and smart contract backup options, all working quietly in the background. The project recently earned a spotlight in the New York Post, which profiled it as a rare case of a wallet that balances intuitive design with advanced functionality. That kind of mainstream attention often arrives late in a cycle. This time, it may have landed right on cue. Conclusion Institutional doors do not swing open often, yet every sign now points to a wider entryway for crypto. The request for Solana fund prospectuses hints at a future where regulated products track more than one flagship asset. Each new filing raises the odds that deep capital will pour across the broader market, rewarding networks that prove they can handle real volume under pressure. Investors who position early could benefit from the momentum that usually follows a landmark approval, while those who wait may find themselves paying a premium for the same exposure. Projects mentioned above may be worth checking out, alongside similar altcoins which may hold 10x potential or more in the coming weeks or months.

What makes this projection striking is not just the number itself, but the rationale behind it— XRP’s potential to underpin a future global financial infrastructure , not merely serve as a speculative asset. $60.52 XRP: A Market Cap Comparison X Finance Bull’s figure of $60.52 per XRP is based on a market capitalization scenario where XRP reaches parity with Microsoft, whose valuation currently stands at approximately $3.2 trillion. Given XRP’s circulating supply of 58.88 billion tokens, a price of $60.52 would result in a total market cap of roughly $3.56 trillion. $XRP at $60.52? That’s just if it matches Microsoft’s market cap. But Ripple’s target isn’t software. It’s global liquidity, trillions more. You’re not late. You’re staring at the most obvious asymmetric bet in crypto. #XRP What happens when the world figures it out? pic.twitter.com/GDaPVHEO8X — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 14, 2025 While this surpasses Microsoft’s present valuation, it reflects the notion that XRP’s ultimate utility— serving as a bridge asset for real-time liquidity across global financial markets—could justify a market capitalization that rivals or even exceeds today’s largest tech giants. This projection is not anchored in retail hype, but in the structural transformation of how money could move worldwide. Ripple’s Vision: Beyond Software, Into Global Liquidity Ripple, the company behind XRP, isn’t building productivity tools like Microsoft. Instead, it’s targeting the multi-trillion-dollar global liquidity problem, facilitating instant, low-cost, cross-border payments between banks, institutions, and even central banks. This ambition positions XRP as a core infrastructure asset for modern finance. With the emergence of RippleNet, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), and the company’s growing engagement with central bank digital currency (CBDC) platforms, XRP is being engineered not just as a token but as a global utility . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Consider that SWIFT, the traditional messaging system for cross-border payments, facilitates over $5 trillion daily. If Ripple were to capture even a small fraction of that market, say 5%, the daily value settling through XRP could exceed $250 billion . This level of consistent utility could create substantial demand pressure on XRP, justifying significantly higher valuations. What Happens When the World Realizes? The most compelling part of X Finance Bull’s argument is not the $60 price tag itself, but the question he poses: “What happens when the world figures it out?” It’s a reflection of a broader awakening that could happen once institutional finance, central banks, and global markets fully recognize XRP’s utility. When that realization sets in, the price appreciation might not just be rapid, it could be exponential. In that scenario, $60 may not just be plausible. It may be conservative.

Here’s Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-eth-rises-5-in-a-week-but-mutuum-finance-mutm-steals-the-show-heres-why/,"Ethereum (ETH) may have rallied over 5% this week, climbing to around $2,628, but that’s not where the real fireworks are. The crypto spotlight is rapidly shifting to a viral new altcoin that’s making early investors sweat with excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Trading at just $0.03, this emerging DeFi token is gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. The official presale of Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5, with MUTM priced at just $0.03, rapidly approaching the Phase 6 price of $0.035. That’s after already soaring 200% since launch. With the token set to go live at $0.06, early buyers are locking in a guaranteed 2x ROI. As FOMO grips the market and June winds down, savvy investors are racing to load up on what could be one of the top tokens of the summer. If you’re wondering what to buy before June ends, MUTM is leading the list of top crypto coins poised to explode. Ethereum Holds Steady Around $2,750 as Momentum Builds Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $2,744, following a strong 6.5% weekly rally that pushed prices above the $2,700 resistance zone. This breakout came on robust trading volumes, over 560,000 ETH, indicating healthy buying interest. Technical indicators, including rising DMI/ADX and RSI climbing into overbought territory, suggest the current consolidation could precede a move toward the $3,000 mark. On‑chain data also reflects strong fundamentals: over 34.8 million ETH is staked, about 28% of supply, a new record that may limit circulating availability. Amid growing institutional inflows and an increasingly bullish structure, Ethereum remains a focal point for mid‑2025 market watchers, while attention is also turning to emerging cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for outsized upside potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Mania: $10.6 M Already In Mutuum Finance is exploding in popularity, and it’s not hard to see why. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi powerhouse has already attracted over 12,000 investors and raised $10.6 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price is set to jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 16.67% surge, meaning those who get in now are positioned for major gains. Early adopters are locking in profits. Certik-Approved and DeFi-Ready: Mutuum’s Lending Revolution Is Here Mutuum combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, giving users reliable returns from USDT pools via the P2C model and full control of direct crypto transactions via the P2P model. The Next Big Stablecoin? Mutuum’s USD-Backed Token Could Be a Game-Changer Mutuum Finance is riding the DeFi wave it’s building its own. Their upcoming overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability and avoid the pitfalls of algorithmic stablecoins. With the infrastructure already audited and certified, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and those paying attention now could reap the biggest rewards later. In addition, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance is gaining serious ground, raising $10.6 million from over 12,000 early investors, all while priced at just $0.03. With a confirmed launch at $0.06, early participants are set for 100% gains. Backed by a Certik audit, a unique dual-lending model, and an upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, MUTM stands out in the crowd of low-cost cryptos. Act now before the presale price climbs to $0.035 in Phase 6.

Litecoin ( LTC ) was trading at $85.98 on Sunday, down by almost 20% from its highest point in May. This pullback has mirrored that of other altcoins like Cardano ( ADA ) and Chainlink ( LINK ). Litecoin has pulled back despite data showing that the odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a LTC ETF have jumped to 76%. The probability that the agency will approve the ETF is high because it is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Its main difference from Bitcoin is its supply limit of 84 million coins, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. You might also like: Bitcoin price eyes multi-year breakout as ETF inflows hit $1.3 billion Therefore, since the SEC has already approved Bitcoin ETFs, there is a good chance it will do the same for Litecoin. An LTC ETF approval would be good for the coin since it would likely lead to more inflows from American investors. Another potential catalyst for LTC price is that whales have continued accumulating it. Santiment data shows that the accounts holding between 100,000 and 1 million tokens have increased their holdings from 25.8 million on April 15 to 27.8 million today. Further data shows that Litecoin’s social dominance has pointed upwards in the past few days, a sign that it is attracting attention from social media users. It rose to 0.734% from 0.512%. LTC whales and social dominance | Source: Santiment Litecoin price technical analysis LTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the LTC price dropped to $63.30 in April and then bounced back to $106.72 as the crypto market rally happened. Recently, however, it has pulled back and moved below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. Falling below that level is a sign that bears have prevailed. Litecoin price has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises of a vertical line, which in this case starts at $63.29 and ends at $106.72. It is now forming the flag section in the form of a descending channel. Therefore, Litecoin price will likely rebound, and initially target the resistance at $106.7, which is up by 25% from the current level. A climb above that resistance will point to more gains, potentially to $140, the highest swing in January and February this year.

With the move, crypto holders must now pay a flat 17.5% rate on their monthly profits. The resolution is part of Provisional Measure 1303 from the country’s Ministry of Finance as part of the government’s effort to raise revenue. Before its implementation, investors who sold up to 35,000 Brazilian Real ($6,300) digital assets within a month did not have to pay tax. In contrast, those who sold above got taxed progressively, varying between 15% and 22.5%. However, the new flat rate of 17.5% means that everyone will pay the same amount regardless of the value of their transactions. This represents a positive development for largeholders, while smallholders may have to deal with the tax burden. Interestingly, crypto was not the only one affected by the new rule. Fixed-income securities were also affected as the government has imposed a 5% tax on the previously tax-free financial products. The tax on betting revenue also increased from 12% to 18%. Under the rule, taxation assessment will be done quarterly instead of monthly, as is currently the case with investors able to offset losses from the previous five quarters. Concerns from stakeholders about the impact of new tax rules Meanwhile, the new tax regime has attracted concerns from crypto stakeholders, many of whom believe that it could force many investors to opt for exchanges and brokers that do not have headquarters in the country so they can avoid the tax burden. According to Brazil-based crypto news outlet Portal do Bitcoin, crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin questioned the reasoning behind the new rule in a public statement, noting that policymakers failed to engage with industry stakeholders before announcing the rules. It said: “The decisions were made hastily, without dialogue with the sector and without technical basis, even generating doubts about its legality.” The exchange further noted that the rules would make the Brazilian crypto sector less competitive. Thus, it is expected that the country’s legislature, the National Congress, will still review the rules, and the government will engage industry participants. Unsurprisingly, other crypto organizations also seem to agree with this. Advocacy groups such as the Brazilian Association of Cryptoeconomics and The Brazilian Association of Fintechs agree that the decision is a setback for the country’s crypto sector. They noted that the rules would likely make investors opt for offshore and non-compliant platforms or alternative financial products exempt from the tax. Such moves may not just weaken the market but could also expose investors to more risks. Interestingly, the crypto bank Bitybank said that the rule contradicts the consultative efforts of the Brazilian Central Bank. Even more of a concern is the complexity of this new rule for the crypto sector because it would affect most investors. According to Boost Research CEO Andre Franco, many investors would be confused because of the changes as they may not know how to calculate their taxes. Brazil lawmaker file decree to annul the Provisional Measure Unsurprisingly, some pro-crypto legislators have started opposing the bill. One such lawmaker, Deputy Gustavo Gayer, has already filed a legislative decree to annul the new rules, according to local media reports . Gayer claimed the Provisional Measure exceeds the powers of the Executive and contravenes the country’s tax system because there was no approval from the legislature. He also noted that taxes on crypto assets create legal uncertainty at a time when the sector is awaiting government regulation. He said: “The imposition of taxes on crypto assets and the creation of new tax obligations without due legislative discussion, without a broad technical debate and without the participation of the affected parties, compromises the predictability and transparency of the tax system.” Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies has reportedly warned that Provisional Measure 1303 will not be approved until a substantial change shows the Executive is more committed to cutting expenses.

Trading under the ticker XRPH11 on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange, the ETF closed at 18.65 BRL ($3.37) on June 13, down 6.33% for the day and 6.75% from its all-time high. However, the more significant decline has come over the past month, with the product down a steep 20.6%. XRPH11 all-time price chart. Source: TradingView Historically, the launch of a spot ETF tends to have a positive effect on the price of the underlying asset. However, the fund has remained volatile since XRPH11’s debut in late April, closely mirroring XRP’s choppy price action. Despite brief rallies, XRP has struggled to break out above the $2 mark sustainably. To this end, analysts suggest the ETF’s limited influence may stem from the relatively small size of Brazil’s capital markets compared to the United States. U.S. spot XRP ETF Now, attention is shifting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is reviewing multiple spot XRP ETF applications. Notably, one decision is expected on June 17 regarding Franklin Templeton’s proposed Franklin XRP Fund. The regulator is also evaluating the WisdomTree XRP Trust, filed by the Cboe BZX Exchange. This application aims to offer investors direct exposure to XRP via traditional brokerage accounts. The agency began its formal review in May, opening a public comment period to weigh whether the ETF design addresses key regulatory concerns. Additionally, the SEC’s ultimate decision may hinge on the outcome of its ongoing legal battle with Ripple. In a recent development , a joint motion filed on June 12 by both parties requests an indicative ruling from Judge Analisa Torres to vacate the injunction restricting XRP sales to institutional investors and reduce the $125 million penalty, potentially paving the way for a resolution to the years-long dispute. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.17, up 0.1% on the day, though still down 4.4% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold In the short term, a green light from the SEC on June 17 regarding the spot ETF could boost investor confidence and drive XRP toward the $2.50 resistance level.

Failure to bounce back could result in a significant setback in the short term. Considered as one of the top gainers in the second quarter of the year, Fartcoin halted bullish action last month and pulled back, taking a short break after two months of steady recovery from the early-year crash. Luckily, the bulls intercepted the pullback at $0.8 and pushed back. That led to a bounce near the recent high, and it lost steam due to a rejection in the mid-week. The price dropped and quickly turned weak on the day. Despite that, the asset remains under the bulls’ watch as they now seek solid ground to launch a fresh increase on the daily chart. Considering the recent drops to the important $1 level, which looks more like a pullback, we can expect a rebound possibly in the coming week. If that comes into play, the price could break to a new high by the end of the month. A pullback below the monthly low could result in a major decline, invalidating further bullish moves on the short-term trend. Nevertheless, Fartcoin remains strong on the monthly scale. The coming days should determine where the market will head next. FARTCOIN’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Currently, the $0.95 level is considered support for the market. A drop below it could trigger a crackdown to the $0.645 support level. The lower support for drops is located at $0.355. A rebound above the $1.646 resistance level could fuel more increases to $2 before tapping the $2.74 resistance level. Breaking through these levels should shoot the price to a new high.

Regulatory worries and mixed sentiment have outweighed XRP’s long-term potential. Technically, the token seems to be in a consolidation phase: A descending trendline defies rallies at around $2.28–$2.29 XRP stays under the 50-period EMA near $2.20 Support is forming between $2.10 and $2.14, suggesting underlying buyer interest XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is gradually turning mixed-to-bullish. The MACD histogram is advancing toward neutral, and recent spinning–top candles highlight indecision rather than decisive downward action. Notably, XRP hasn’t produced bearish formations like the “Three Black Crows,” which suggests sellers are not firmly in control. This sets the stage for a potential breakout if buyers gain conviction. XRP Trade Plan Here’s a short-term XRP price prediction : Bullish Trigger: Look for a 4‑hour candle closing above $2.20 and the downward trendline Targets: First at $2.285, then extended to $2.338 Stop-loss: Just below the recent swing low near $2.145 Bearish Option: A drop below $2.145 could open the door to a $2.086 test Final Take XRP’s modest slide this week reflects the tug-of-war between doubt and opportunity. While settlement chatter fuels optimism, technical indicators remain range-bound. The catalyst could come from a decisive move above the 50‑EMA and $2.20, potentially paving the way for a rally to $2.29–$2.34. Conversely, a breakdown below $2.145 would likely lead to a retest of $2.09. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With XRP trading near $2.17, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

Among these emerging contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves by combining innovative technology with real-yield lending models designed to reward users and active participants alike. While Bitcoin (BTC)’s price action remains uncertain, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily gaining traction thanks to its unique lending options, a growing community, and a solid roadmap that promises significant developments in the near future. Understanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its dual lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized protocol designed to facilitate lending and borrowing across a broad range of digital assets. What sets Mutuum apart is its dual approach to lending: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to deposit assets such as ETH, SOL, BTC, BNB, or AVAX into liquidity pools where they earn interest that adjusts dynamically based on borrower demand. The P2P model takes this one step further by allowing lenders to offer direct loans to other users with fully customizable terms. This option opens the door to lending assets typically unsupported by centralized platforms, such as popular memecoins Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). By enabling direct negotiations and flexible rates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides lenders with enhanced earning potential and borrowers with access to more diverse funding sources. One of the key technical advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasts is its Layer-2 integration, which promises faster and more cost-effective transactions. Layer-2 solutions address major pain points in the DeFi world, such as network congestion and high fees, by processing transactions off the main blockchain while maintaining security. This architecture will allow Mutuum users to enjoy a seamless and efficient experience, positioning the protocol ahead of many competitors struggling with slow or expensive networks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a fully decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed entirely by on-chain assets held within its protocol. This approach diverges from traditional stablecoins that rely on fiat reserves or centralized backing. The stablecoin will be minted algorithmically based on collateral deposited into the system, ensuring transparency and stability. By redirecting interest payments from loans into the protocol treasury, this stablecoin mechanism will further solidify Mutuum’s financial foundation and expand utility options for MUTM users. How MUTM holders benefit beyond price appreciation The native token of the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a total supply capped at 4 billion tokens. With over 12,000 holders and $10.55 million raised during Phase 5 of its presale at a current price of $0.03 per token, MUTM represents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking both capital appreciation and passive income. The token serves as a vehicle for earning dividends generated from protocol revenues. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to use a portion of its profits to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This continuous buyback and redistribution cycle strengthens liquidity, incentivizes long-term holding, and applies upward demand pressure on MUTM. By staking mtTokens—tokenized representations of user deposits that accrue interest—participants gain eligibility for these passive income rewards while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. Security remains paramount in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has demonstrated commitment by completing a comprehensive CertiK audit. The manual review and static analysis process resulted in a Token Scan Score of 80.00, with the audit timeline initiated on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025. This rigorous assessment provides users with confidence in the protocol’s smart contracts and operational integrity—an important consideration for any investor or user seeking to engage with a trustworthy DeFi platform. Roadmap promises beta launch and continued growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made significant progress in its roadmap, successfully completing major elements of Phase 1, including the presale, marketing campaigns, and giveaway commencement. The team is actively working on core smart contract development, front-end and back-end infrastructure, and is preparing for the beta launch. By the time the token becomes live on exchanges, users will have access to test the beta version of the platform to explore its lending and borrowing capabilities firsthand. Alongside this, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway further stimulates community engagement and broadens awareness, encouraging more participants to discover the platform’s unique features and earn rewards early. Conclusion: a clear alternative to stalled crypto giants As the crypto market watches Bitcoin (BTC) hesitate near its resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building the foundation for sustained growth through practical use cases and community rewards. For investors seeking more than price swings—those wanting to earn passive income through a transparent and secure protocol—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a smart choice. With a solid roadmap leading to a beta platform launch, an active presale community, Layer-2 speed and cost advantages, and a comprehensive dividend model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token. It is a functional DeFi ecosystem that rewards users and active participants alike, making it a top contender to watch closely in 2025 and beyond.

Whale investors have gobbled up more than $500K worth of $SOLX tokens over the past 24 hours, taking Solaxy’s total presale raise to over $51M. Some of these include transactions worth $113K , $59K , and $58K . Keep reading to find out why the industry can’t keep their hands off Solana’s best crypto project yet and why buying the $SOLX presale now could be one of the smartest moves you make as a crypto investor. What’s the Hype About Solaxy? Solaxy is a new meme coin currently on presale , but it’s different from other meme cryptos in that it has a real-world application. It’s what the industry calls a utility token. $SOLX’s selling point is that it plans to restore Solana’s efficiency and performance by building the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the network. Despite its otherwise meme coin-tailored infrastructure, Solana was never designed to service a truckload of transaction requests at once. However, this is exactly what it has been asked to do ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, as well as other top trending cryptos . They flooded Solana with new investors. Thanks to Solaxy’s new L2, though, Solana’s mainnet will finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief. It will reduce the burden on the mainnet by offloading transactions onto a sidechain. As for the sidechain, think of it as an express lane on a busy highway (the L1), helping it service the extra traffic during peak hours. Optimizing Solana: Lower Fees Without Sacrificing Security In addition to creating a more scalable and efficient blockchain environment, Solaxy will also contribute to lowering investor costs on Solana. It will do so by bundling transactions into single, optimized batches. Essentially, this means that it will process multiple transactions in bulk rather than one by one, thereby lowering the cost per transaction. It’s also worth noting that Solaxy will revitalize Solana without compromising security. Its cutting-edge roll-up technology will validate the transactions on the network’s Layer 1. Solaxy’s Hyperlane Collaboration In its quest to ensure Solana occupies the center stage of the rapidly growing DeFi and Web3 space, Solaxy has joined hands with Hyperlane . Hyperlane, in case you didn’t know, is a Web3 infrastructure project that will help $SOLX make bridging (which means transferring tokens from one blockchain to another) between Solana and Ethereum easier, quicker, and more seamless. Developers, investors, and traders on Solana will, therefore, be able to transfer cryptos between Solana and Ethereum with as much ease as though they were using an everyday mobile app. And consider the enrichment this will bring to Solana and its users. Not only does Ethereum have a lot more liquidity than Solana, but it also has a huge network (over 10x that of Solana) of decentralized applications, with over 5K dApps live right now. Solaxy Presale: Your Last Chance at 11,200% Gains As mentioned earlier, Solaxy’s presale, which is currently ongoing (over $51M in funding as of now), has generated a lot of buzz among both crypto whales and retail investors alike. Solaxy’s presale officially kicked off in December 2024, with an initial per-token price of just $0.001. Through multiple presale rounds, however, one $SOLX currently stands at $0.00176. So, had you joined the best crypto presale while it was brand-new, you’d have already seen a nifty 76% increase in your investment. However, you can let bygones be bygones and make it up to your crypto portfolio by buying into the Solaxy presale now. According to our $SOLX price prediction , the token can reach a whopping $0.20 by 2030. This means you can eke out a brain-melting 11,200% return (calculated from current prices) on your investment. Here’s the most important piece of information, though: Solaxy’s presale ends in less than 24 hours from now, so this is really your last chance to grab potentially the next crypto to explode before…it explodes. Real Utility, Big Ambitions, and a Limited-Time Offer Backed by real utility, a Hyperlane partnership that promises to make it more than just a scaling tool, and bold price forecasts, Solaxy ($SOLX) could be crypto’s next big thing. Don’t sit this one out; invest in Solaxy before the presale ends tomorrow. One token is currently selling for just $0.00176. However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are highly risky.

An influential financial expert anticipates that XYZVerse might soar by an astonishing rate, potentially leaving HYPE and ICP behind.

Currently halfway through its journey, XYZ has already raised over $14 million, with the token priced at $0.003333. As the project enters Stage 13 of its presale, the price will rise again to $0.005, offering early backers a final window to buy in at a steep discount. Big exchange listings coming soon After the presale, XYZ will make its debut on leading centralized and decentralized exchanges. While the project team hasn’t revealed which platforms yet, teasers hint at a major launch event, sparking further hype in the community. Born for fighters. Built for champions. XYZVerse isn’t just another memecoin; it’s a rallying cry for those chasing glory in the high-stakes world of crypto. Designed for the bold and ambitious, it aligns with the spirit of athletes, fighters, and thrill-seekers. Its mascot, XYZepe, represents the underdog fighting to climb the charts and carve out a place alongside legends like DOGE and SHIB. A memecoin powered by community XYZVerse puts its community front and center. With 10% of the total token supply (10 billion XYZ) set aside for airdrops, it’s one of the largest community incentive programs in the space.

Join the movement — claim rewards, airdrops, and early access Hyperliquid Source: TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been on a remarkable run, surging 1464% over the past six months. In the last month alone, it climbed 51.67%, and the past week saw an additional 15.03% gain. These impressive figures highlight strong investor interest and significant momentum behind HYPE. However, recent technical indicators suggest caution. The current price range of $32.05 to $38.23 sits below both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $39.28 and $40.24, respectively. The Relative Strength Index stands at 40.14, and the Stochastic indicator is at 28.84, both hinting at potential oversold conditions. The MACD level is negative at -0.7361, indicating possible bearish momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $41.49, and surpassing this could open the path to the second resistance at $47.67. On the downside, the nearest support is at $29.13, with a secondary support at $22.95. If HYPE can break above its moving averages and overcome resistance levels, we might see significant gains. Conversely, failure to hold support could lead to further declines. Investors will be watching closely to see if the bullish trend continues or if a correction is imminent. Internet Computer Source: TradingView Internet Computer (ICP) has seen notable price changes recently. In the past week, the price rose by 12.35%, showing short-term positive movement. However, over the past month, it decreased by 7.61%, and over six months, it dropped by 57.41%. The current price ranges from $5.01 to $5.90, highlighting ongoing market volatility. Technical indicators offer mixed signals for ICP’s future price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 27.91, indicating oversold conditions that might lead to a price increase. The Stochastic indicator at 6.19 also suggests oversold status. Despite this, the MACD level of -0.1395 points to continued bearish momentum. ICP is nearing the resistance level at $6.25. Breaking above could target the next resistance at $7.14, potentially rising around 20% from current prices. If the price falls, the support at $4.47 is critical; dropping below it could lead to the next support at $3.58, a possible 30% decline. With 10-day and 100-day moving averages at $5.59 and $5.97, ICP trades below its longer-term average, possibly signaling bearish trends.

What if the next explosive rally is fueled not only by hype, but by clever tokenomics and investor rewards? That’s the exact question driving headlines around the best meme coins to invest in June 2025. Captivating communities and portfolios alike, these coins blend viral culture with structural innovation. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) leads the charge with a presale that reads more like a global expedition than a token launch. Meanwhile, Zerebro, TokenFi, Brett, Fartcoin, Fartboy, and Shiba Inu each bring their own twists—community engagement, utility, partnerships—that make them candidates in today’s hot field. This list dives into their most exciting features and competitive edge, spotlighting what makes each a contender, but pointing to Arctic Pablo Coin as the standout opportunity. 1. Best Meme Coins to Invest in June 2025: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Adventure Arctic Pablo Coin rewrites the rules of traditional meme coin presale by ditching stages and embracing locations. It’s currently navigating Blizzard Borough—the 27th “destination” in its global-themed journey. The entry price sits at an exceptionally low $0.0003 per token, with total funding surpassing $2.76 million. Once trading begins at $0.008, early backers could see an astronomical 2566.66% ROI. It’s a bold departure from preset tiers, tapping into momentum and location-specific excitement that drives participation. What sets Arctic Pablo Coin apart is its narrative-driven hype. Each “travel” simulates a real-time expedition, creating community buy-in as the price increases with each destination. That storytelling momentum, paired with scalable ROI and transparent mechanics, cements Arctic Pablo Coin’s status among the best meme coins to invest in June 2025 . Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Excitement: Price, Burns and Urgency in Blizzard Borough The Blizzard Borough phase is the final gateway before launch, making the current $0.0003 pricing a rare window. As the coin progresses, token burns occur weekly—any unsold tokens vanish forever, slashing supply. Post-presale burns further reinforce scarcity, and every transaction is verifiable on Binance Smart Chain. These mechanics aren’t theoretical—they’ve already fueled rising demand as each location sells out faster. The combination of transparent burns, storytelling, and an imminent price jump builds palpable urgency. For investors seeking the best meme coins to invest in June 2025, Arctic Pablo Coin delivers an alternative that’s more strategic than mere social media hype. 2. Zerebro: A Community-Driven Meme EntrepreneurHub Zerebro thrives on community, combining lighthearted memes with entrepreneur-style token mechanisms. Its latest development is a decentralized grant pool enabling holders to propose and fund mini projects—everything from NFT art to grassroots marketing. Recent burn activity trimmed supply, and the token has seen a 45% volume uptick in two weeks. Despite its grassroots vibe, Zerebro offers utility: voting rights, content collaboration, and a rewards pool for active stakeholders. Its ecosystem feels like a collaborative creative workshop mixed with investment returns, earning its spot through engagement and sustainability. That’s why Zerebro earned a place among today’s top meme token picks—it merges culture with community value. 3. TokenFi: Layered DeFi Tech With Meme Culture Vibes TokenFi packages DeFi interoperability into a meme-style wrapper—an ironic nod to both grassroots capitalization and serious tech. Fresh integration with cross-chain bridges has extended access beyond Ethereum, and new yield-farming mechanics allow holders to stake tokens for liquidity rewards. Recent developer updates teased a DAO launch, giving holders governance power and suggested revenue-sharing with tokenized assets. While still early, TokenFi combines yield potential with decentralized autonomy, helping it stand out as a nominee among meme coins backed by real finance. 4. Brett: Exchange Listings Ignite Trading Frenzy Brett turned heads after listing on multiple mid-tier centralized exchanges, sparking a 240% volume surge within 48 hours. This move gave it broader access and liquidity, drawing new users and speculation. The team is teasing upcoming DeFi integrations and NFT tie-ins—pump primed by listing exposure and community buzz. Brett’s performance suggests that meme coin success isn’t just about Twitter hype—it’s about earning spots on active trading venues and building momentum beyond. 5. Fartcoin: Lowbrow Hype, High-Test Engagement Don’t underestimate a coin named after a bodily function—it comes with viral, lowbrow energy. Fartcoin has gained a cult following on meme forums, and its recent “Toot & Trade” event offered token grants to anyone sharing a meme with specific tags. The community-driven challenge generated thousands of posts, boosting awareness and social metrics. While lacking deep tokenomics, Fartcoin thrives as a cultural fad. It’s a test case in meme contagion, showing how big ideas start small, make no sense, and light up viral engagement. It made today’s best meme coins list thanks to its pure social momentum and engagement gimmickry. 6. Fartboy: The Silly Spin-Off with NFT Aspirations Fartboy emerged as a cheeky offshoot of Fartcoin, featuring butt-themed NFT art and airdrop mechanics that rewarded early supporters with collectible “tooter” images. A recent collaboration with a small indie NFT marketplace resulted in a modest mint of meta-art tokens. Though niche, Fartboy combines novelty with collectability. Its founders modeled the token as an experiment in ultra-low-content viral marketing combined with asset tokenization. Its presence reflects how creativity—even of the absurd variety—can shape listing awareness, and it’s a reminder that meme coins aren’t always driven by utility. 7. Shiba Inu: The Established Meme Legend That’s Still Evolving Shiba Inu is the OG meme contender. Despite its 2020 origins, its ecosystem continues to develop: SHIB staking, loyalty programs, and even Shibarium, its layer-2 solution, are live or in development. Recent announcements emphasize partnerships with gaming and NFT projects, as well as decentralized exchange migrations. Shiba Inu holds weight with its brand recognition and staying power. Even when newer tokens steal headlines, SHIB remains relevant due to infrastructure expansion and loyal community support. Its place on the list stems from being a proven entry point and a benchmark for all other meme coins. Conclusion Based on the latest research, Best meme coins to invest in June 2025 are: Arctic Pablo Coin , Zerebro, TokenFi, Brett, Fartcoin, Fartboy, and Shiba Inu. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the field thanks to its immersive presale model, massive ROI potential, and strategic tokenomics like location-based phases, weekly burns, and transparent tracking. For those seeking the next breakout, Arctic Pablo Coin offers both narrative resonance and financial opportunity—making it the most compelling investment among today’s meme coin cohort.

Here’s What this Means to XRP Price,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-says-xrp-is-the-next-bitcoin-heres-what-this-means-to-xrp-price/,"In a recent broadcast from Bloomberg Live in Singapore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reignited optimism in the XRP community by suggesting that XRP could be the “next Bitcoin.” The statement, captured in a video clip shared by crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, has stirred renewed debate about XRP’s long-term potential, particularly its ability to rival Bitcoin in relevance, adoption, and price growth. Garlinghouse’s remarks come at a pivotal time, as Ripple continues to expand its global footprint in cross-border payments and institutional partnerships . His confident tone during the interview signals Ripple’s renewed push to solidify XRP’s role as a foundational asset for global financial infrastructure. Just a reminder that you are the lucky one holding the next #Bitcoin called #XRP ! $10,000 pic.twitter.com/UXj2WvxtMM — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Regulatory Advantage What sets XRP apart from many other digital assets is its regulatory positioning. Garlinghouse noted that “from the get-go, XRP has worked with regulators and regulated institutions like banks.” This emphasis on compliance is not new, but in the current climate, where regulatory uncertainty continues to cloud much of the crypto industry, it becomes increasingly crucial. Unlike Bitcoin, which was born out of a libertarian ethos of decentralization and minimal oversight, XRP has always aimed to complement the existing financial system rather than disrupt it. Ripple’s enterprise-grade payment solutions are being built in partnership with financial institutions, not in rebellion against them. This orientation toward working with regulators may help XRP scale in a manner that’s palatable to governments and banks, critical stakeholders in the trillion-dollar global payments market. The Bitcoin Comparison The Ripple CEO did not shy away from directly addressing the comparison with Bitcoin. When asked whether XRP could be the next Bitcoin, Garlinghouse responded, “If we work with the system to solve this problem, and we can solve the problem at scale —a problem measured in trillions of dollars—it is a lot of opportunity to create value in XRP.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This isn’t merely hyperbole. Ripple has long argued that global liquidity inefficiencies—especially in cross-border payments—represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. XRP, as an on-chain liquidity solution, is central to Ripple’s vision for solving this. If it can indeed scale and offer settlement speeds and cost efficiencies far beyond traditional systems like SWIFT or correspondent banking networks, then the comparison to Bitcoin becomes less about ideology and more about market value. What This Means for XRP Price The speculative implications of Garlinghouse’s comments have not gone unnoticed. JackTheRippler, in sharing the clip, boldly declared: “Just a reminder that you are the lucky one holding the next Bitcoin called XRP! $10,000.” While such a price target may sound sensational to many, it underscores the long-held belief among XRP proponents that the asset remains grossly undervalued in light of its potential use cases. If XRP succeeds in becoming the liquidity layer for international payments, backed by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and global utility, then a significant price appreciation could follow. The idea is not necessarily that XRP would copy Bitcoin’s trajectory point for point, but that it could experience a similar exponential rise driven by mainstream acceptance and institutional integration.

Binance Coin ( BNB ) token dropped to $650 today, June 15, down by 6.70% from its highest point this year and 18% from the year-to-date high. Nansen data shows that BNB Smart Chain has become the fastest-growing chain in the last 30 days. It handled over 405 million transactions, up by 243% from the same period a month earlier. BSC’s transaction count was much higher than all the other blockchains except Solana ( SOL ), which handled over $1.9 billion in the same period. Its transaction grew as the number of active addresses on the network jumped. Its monthly transactions rose by 17% to 21.9 million, higher than most blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX). This growth led to a 3% fee increase, as it made $14.8 million. Chain transactions, addresses, and fees | Source: Nansen BNB Smart Chain has also overtaken Solana and Ethereum regarding decentralized exchange volume. Data shows that protocols on its platform handled over $147 billion in volume in the last 30 days. This volume exceeded Sona’s $79 billion and Ethereum’s $65 billion.

It handled over $3.3 billion in the last 24 hours, higher than Uniswap’s $1.7 billion, Raydium’s $545 million, and Aerodrome’s $343 million. Rising BSC transactions is important for BNB price because it leads to higher fees, which contribute to its burn rate. BNB price technical analysis BNB price chart | Source: crypto.news The 12-hour chart shows that the BNB token price has come under pressure in the past few weeks. It is consolidating at the 100-period moving average and slightly above $644, the highest swing on March 25. BNB price has formed a bullish pennant pattern, comprising of a vertical flagpole and a symmetrical triangle. The two lines of this triangle have a long way to converge, meaning that its price will likely continue consolidating for a while. BNB will then bounce back, and possibly retest the key resistance at $697.55, its highest point on May 27. A drop below $625, the lowest point on June 5, will invalidate the bullish forecast.

But while the giants tread water, a new coin is stealing the show, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is rapidly gaining momentum across social media and crypto circles, with growing whispers of reaching $1 before summer ends. Already, more than $10.6 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 12,000 people participating so far.

Ethereum and Bitcoin Hold Gains Amid Rising Institutional Interest Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to hold their ground amid increasing institutional activity and market optimism. Bitcoin is trading around $107,803, consolidating just below its recent peak of $112,000. The market is watching closely as BTC shows signs of a potential breakout, driven by ETF inflows and a bullish technical setup including a golden cross. Meanwhile, Ethereum sits at approximately $2,754, up over 6% on the week, supported by strong network fundamentals and record-high staking levels with more than 34.8 million ETH locked. While Bitcoin maintains its dominance, Ethereum continues to strengthen its position as a key player in decentralized applications. In parallel, newer projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gaining traction among investors looking beyond the top two digital assets. $10.6M Raised and Counting: Mutuum Finance Presale is Breaking Records Mutuum Finance is on fire, with over $10.6 million raised and 12,000+ investors already in, this DeFi powerhouse is performing really well.

Based on latest data, that rally made it the top performer among major cryptocurrencies during the US President Donald Trump-led market-wide upswing. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt According to market commentator John Squire, the real story is the seven years of setbacks that preceded this jump. “If patience was a crypto token, XRP holders would already be billionaires,” he said, pointing to the years of holding through crashes and legal fights. If patience was a token, $XRP holders would be billionaires already. 🧘‍♂️ — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 8, 2025 XRP Rallies As Markets Turn After a rough patch, XRP’s jump has caught many off guard. The coin rocketed from roughly $0.11 at the start of November 2024 to near $0.75 by the end of January 2025. Volume ticked up on most trading platforms, suggesting fresh money is pushing the price higher. Traders who stuck it out through years of mild gains and deep dips finally saw a payoff. Seven Years Of Price Struggles From March 2017 to January 2018, XRP shot up more than 68,000%, peaking at $3.84. Based on on‑chain data, that blistering run led to a brutal 97% slide by March 2020, when prices hit $0.1140. In November 2020, another bounce nearly doubled the price—but the US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit undercut that move, sending XRP down 67% in December 2020, its largest monthly loss ever. Holder Numbers Climb Amid Lawsuit Despite all that, the number of XRP holders kept growing. According to Santiment, about 986,000 wallets held XRP in January 2018. By December 2022, over 3.53 million new addresses had joined the network, pushing the total past 4.5 million. That surge of interest came even as many US and Canadian exchanges paused trading. It shows that newcomers and long‑time believers piled in while regulators and markets wrestled with the fallout. Recovery Faces Headwinds From Market Cycles While the latest rally is impressive, it comes against a mixed crypto backdrop. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown uneven strength, and overall sentiment is cautious. Some traders warn that sharp gains can trigger profit‑taking events, especially if the wider market cools or if the SEC lawsuit sees new twists.

Built from the ground up, it offers a custom Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability. At its heart is HyperBFT, a unique consensus mechanism that ensures transactions are finalized quickly and securely. One of Hyperliquid’s standout features is its focus on perpetual futures trading directly on its native blockchain. Unlike many platforms, it eliminates gas fees for transactions, making trading more affordable and efficient. With a fully on-chain order book, Hyperliquid provides transparency and security, as every transaction is verifiable on the blockchain. In today’s market, Hyperliquid looks promising. Its approach to fast, cost-free trading meets the growing demand for efficient DeFi solutions. The development team, with backgrounds from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT, brings strong expertise to the project. Being self-funded, Hyperliquid operates independently, focusing solely on its vision without outside pressures. Compared to other coins, its zero gas fees and high-performance blockchain give it an edge. As the DeFi space evolves, platforms that offer speed, security, and low costs are likely to attract more users. Hyperliquid’s unique features position it well in the current market cycle. Aave: Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with Flash Loans and Smart Contracts Aave is changing the way we think about lending and borrowing in cryptocurrency. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers a decentralized platform where users can lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without middlemen. Smart contracts manage all transactions, ensuring trust through code instead of institutions. Supporting 17 different cryptocurrencies, Aave provides flexible options for users. One of its standout features is the introduction of flash loans—instant loans without collateral that must be repaid within the same blockchain block. This innovative concept leverages Ethereum’s quick 13-second block time, allowing for rapid and efficient transactions. The AAVE token is central to this ecosystem. Holders enjoy benefits like fee waivers and voting rights on protocol changes. The token also serves as collateral with added perks. Aave’s Safety Module enhances security by allowing users to stake tokens, mitigating risks within the platform. With a limited token supply and a deflationary mechanism that reduces circulation through fee revenue, AAVE holds strong potential for value appreciation.

Its unique features, like flash loans, set it apart from other coins, making it an attractive option in the evolving world of decentralized finance.

In a bold move to reward loyalty, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users. If you used Uniswap before then, you might have received 400 UNI tokens, worth over $1,000 at the launch! What makes Uniswap stand out is its unique approach to trading. Since 2018, it has operated without a traditional order book. Instead, it uses an automated system that lets users trade directly from their wallets. This means you have full control of your funds at all times. Being open-source and allowing free token listings, Uniswap prioritizes accessibility and security. As the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets, it’s a significant player in the market. In a landscape where decentralized exchanges are gaining traction, UNI’s innovative technology and community focus make it an interesting coin to watch in the current market cycle. ICP: Paving the Way for a Decentralized Internet Revolution Imagine an internet where apps run at lightning speed without relying on big tech companies. That’s the vision of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation. ICP aims to transform the internet from just a network for sharing information into a global computing platform. It seeks to enable decentralized applications to operate swiftly and securely, reducing costs and boosting efficiency. This could reshape the way we experience the digital world, making it more open, secure, and user-friendly. In today’s market, ICP stands out with its bold goals and cutting-edge technology. While many cryptocurrencies focus on digital money, ICP is building the backbone for a new kind of internet. This sets it apart from other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the market looks for projects with real-world use, ICP’s approach could make it an attractive option. By challenging traditional cloud services and decreasing reliance on big tech, ICP has the potential to revolutionize the digital landscape.

As it stands, the crypto market could be on the brink of an explosion due to the kind of growth being recorded in the stablecoin sector. The latest weekly report from the market research platform CryptoQuant has revealed that the market capitalization of stablecoins is expanding and has reached unprecedented highs. This indicates that liquidity is growing in the crypto market, and there is more capital waiting to be deployed. Market Sees Rise in Liquidity According to CryptoQuant, the stablecoin market cap has grown 17% year-to-date (YTD), increasing by $33 billion to a record $228 billion. Analysts say this growth has been supported by the wider adoption of stablecoins for payments and transfers, increased crypto trading activity, and improved regulatory clarity in the United States, thanks to the Trump administration. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) have been driving the growth in the stablecoin market cap. Since the beginning of the year, USDT has grown its market cap by 13% to $155 billion, adding $18 billion. Within the same timeframe, USDC has significantly recovered from the hit it suffered in March 2023, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) during the U.S. banking crisis. At the time, USDC depegged from $1, and its market cap fell as low as $24 billion before the end of that year. So far in 2025, the market cap of USDC has increased by 39% to $61 billion, representing an increase of $17 billion. Staked Stablecoins Record Growth Furthermore, CryptoQuant found that the amount of stablecoins on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has rallied to record-high levels. The value of ERC20 stablecoins on CEXs has reached approximately $50 billion. Analysts attributed most of this growth to USDC, which has seen its exchange reserves increase by 1.6x to roughly $8 billion so far in 2025. Besides the growth seen in USDC, CryptoQuant also noted that the value of yield-bearing stablecoins, which are also staked assets, has recovered and reached a level not seen since late March. Since they plunged to a local low on May 23, the total value of yield-bearing stablecoins has risen 28% to $6.9 billion. “This recovery was driven by sUSDe, which increased by $1.23 billion, and sUSDs, which gained 35%—or $0.7 billion—in market cap over the same period,” CryptoQuant analysts added.

But in true crypto style, things turned fast — the price has since dropped to $1.59. Still, if there’s one thing this token knows how to do, it’s to surprise people. So, is there a bright future ahead for SPX? Let’s dig into it in our SPX6900 price prediction. Table of Contents What is SPX6900? SPX6900 crypto price prediction: general outlook SPX6900 price prediction 2025 SPX6900 price prediction 2030 What is SPX6900? SPX6900 ( SPX ) is a meme token born from trading culture and internet humor. Launched in August 2023, it takes its name from the iconic S&P 500 index — a nod to market ambition, but with a playful twist. The token mocks traditional finance while building a loyal community of investors who love memes and markets. With its edgy branding and growing hype, SPX6900 stands out in the crowded crypto space. Whether you’re here for the gains, the fun, or both, it’s bringing fresh energy to the memecoin scene. Is SPX6900 a good investment? What can we expect from SPX in the future? Let’s turn to the SPX6900 price prediction. SPX6900 crypto price prediction: general outlook At the time of writing, SPX6900 is trading at around $1.47. The price has varied by 23.07% over the last 7 days and by 102.63% in the past month.Earlier today, the price even touched $1.73, coming just shy of its all-time high of $1.77, which it hit back in January. SPX 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: CoinMarketcap Like most memecoins, SPX6900 is anything but stable — wild swings are part of the game. That said, the current pullback doesn’t necessarily spell the end of the rally. With strong community hype, growing visibility, and momentum still on its side, the price could easily make another run at its ATH in the near future. Just don’t expect a smooth ride — with SPX, the only predictable thing is unpredictability.

SPX6900 price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s SPX6900 price prediction, the token might dip, potentially dropping about 22.5% to around $1.26 by July 11. But don’t let that fool you — overall sentiment still leans bullish, with 25 technical indicators pointing up and only 4 signaling bearish trends. Based on CoinCodex’s long-term expectations for SPX6900, the meme coin is projected to trade between $1.167 and $4.16 this year — meaning it could significantly surpass its all-time high if it hits the top of that range. Other platforms share equally optimistic projections for SPX6900. DigitalCoinPrice also thinks SPX will beat its previous high of $1.77 in 2025 and then settle between $2.96 and $3.42. Wallet Investor is a bit more cautious, predicting a max price of $1.90 by the end of 2025 — but hey, that’s still above its current all-time high. So, will SPX6900 go up or down in the next five years? Let’s see. SPX6900 price prediction 2030 CoinCodex’s SPX price prediction estimates that by 2030, the token could be trading anywhere between $2.12 and $6.43. DigitalCoinPrice is even more bullish, suggesting SPX6900 could break past $8.41 by 2030, with a price range between $7.43 and $8.55 — pointing to some serious long-term growth potential. Wallet Investor’s SPX6900 price forecast is a bit more conservative, but still positive overall, estimating the token could hit a max of $4.69 by June 2030. Should you invest in SPX6900? If you’re into big swings and bigger potential wins, SPX6900 might be worth a look. Some forecasts have it soaring past its all-time high — but let’s be real, it’s a memecoin, and things can get wild fast. There’s definitely room for gains, but losses can come just as quick. If you’re down for the ride and only putting in what you can afford to lose, it could be a fun one to watch.

Allaire said the community is not quite experiencing an iPhone moment regarding using stablecoins. He said we’ll know when we’ve reached that moment when developers universally recognise the value of programmable dollars. Circle is the issuer of the widely used stablecoin USDC. Allaire believes that stablecoins are on the verge of being widely recognised worldwide. Allaire responded to a post by Sam Broner, partner at a16z Crypto, who stated that stablecoins improve competition and enable companies to build low-cost financial applications. Broner further commented that stablecoins allow anyone to program money, which leads to better access to economic applications. Sam Broner, partner at a16z Crypto, stated that fixed and marginal costs of creating a financial startup are now significantly cheaper due to the accessibility of stablecoins. Broner argued that stablecoins enable better competition in the FinTech market, lower product prices, and benefit the community overall. These comments by Broner and Allaire come as Walmart and Amazon plan to release their dollar-backed stablecoins . E-commerce giant Shopify announced it will integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin by the end of 2025. There seems to be a lot of momentum gearing up behind stablecoin adoption. Allaire believes the hype is significant and indicates further progress in using stablecoins. Circle was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, jumping 165% in price due to traders buying the newfound stocks. There is a keen interest in crypto and AI companies on the stock market, adding to the speculative value of crypto stocks. Circle CEO Allaire believes the excitement has just begun and will culminate in an iPhone-like event. Stablecoins have been building momentum lately due to their practical use as a remittance medium. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by market capitalisation, announced on June 8 that they had no plans to create a public listing in the foreseeable future. Tether issues the stablecoin USDT and dominates the market. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said that the company will remain a private entity and will not follow suit with Circle’s IPO. As Allaire puts it, an “iPhone moment” could be just around the corner due to the amount of competition heating up around stablecoin use. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may contribute to the breakout moment that Allaire envisions. Stablecoins are digital currencies often pegged to a real-world asset such as US dollars. Due to their underlying algorithm, stablecoins are very fast to transact and can be programmed for various purposes. Conversely, due to their high volatility, traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are cumbersome to transact across borders. Stablecoins were invented to overcome Bitcoin’s limitations and attract institutional investors to the world of digital assets. The latter goal has been very successful if the current hype about stablecoins is anything to go by. There was much uncertainty surrounding using stablecoins due to the conflicting regulatory reports in America. At one stage, it was thought that stablecoins would be regulated as securities, which would have put a lot of unnecessary pressure on stablecoin issuers. The regulatory environment has changed significantly since then, and stablecoins could be on the verge of experiencing a golden age. Conversely, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are issued by governments instead of private companies. The benefit of stablecoins is that they can be used easily by companies such as Amazon and Walmart. Circle, meanwhile, has released its stablecoin USDC on the XRP ecosystem , furthering the reach of the pegged US dollar and stablecoins in general. The move extends USDC across Ripple’s ISO accredited business services, boosting USDC’s legitimacy in the crypto market. Developers will benefit from this integration because they can utilise the stablecoin without engaging in complex bridging operations. The integration of stablecoins into major blockchain networks such as Ripple is a sign that stablecoins are on the verge of having an iPhone moment.",Cryptocurrency|News|Circle|Stablecoins|USDC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-15 16:05:20

It was observed that the total value of the ZKJ tokens sold was $3.1 million, and the total value of the KOGE tokens was $550,000. Following the developments, ZKJ lost approximately 80% of its value in the last 24 hours, while KOGE lost approximately 50%. Chart showing the decline in KOGE price.

But as of June 15, it’s trending upward and has gained around 18% over the past 30 days. So, is EigenLayer a good investment? Let’s break it down in our Eigen Layer price prediction. Table of Contents What is Eigen Layer? Eigen Layer coin price prediction: general outlook Eigen Layer price prediction 2025 Eigen Layer price prediction 2030 What is Eigen Layer? EigenLayer builds on Ethereum and allows ETH that’s already staked to be restaked — so it can help support and secure other blockchain systems at the same time. Its core goal is to extend Ethereum’s security model without requiring new, standalone validator networks. In October 2024, the project launched its own token, EigenLayer ( EIGEN ), which now plays a key role in how the whole EigenLayer system works.It’s used both for on-chain governance, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades, and for staking, offering participants additional rewards while reinforcing network security. Since launch, EIGEN has attracted strong attention from the crypto community. But beyond its market value, the token’s real strength lies in its utility — empowering users to actively shape and support one of Ethereum’s most promising infrastructure layers. What is the Eigen Layer crypto price prediction for the short and long term? Eigen Layer coin price prediction: general outlook As of June 15, EigenLayer is sitting at $1.27, down -8.63% over the past week, and around -4.84% for the month. Not bad — but still a far cry from its all-time high of $5.65, hit during the big crypto rally in December 2024, just a few months after launch. Since then, it’s dropped about 71% from that peak. At the same time, the current upswing marks a strong recovery from its all-time low of $0.6688, reached just two months ago on April 8, 2025. Since then, the token has climbed about 144%, showing there’s still plenty of interest — and volatility — in play. EIGEN 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news Where the price heads next in 2025 will likely depend on broader market conditions, how the EigenLayer ecosystem develops, and whether more projects start building on or integrating with it. If momentum continues and the team delivers, a stronger recovery is definitely possible — but for now, it’s still a wait-and-see story.

Eigen Layer price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s EIGEN price prediction, the token might take a hit in the short term — they expect it to drop by around 25%, potentially landing at $1.21 by July 10. Over the rest of the year, they see EIGEN trading anywhere between $1.11 and $4.42, which shows just how wide the range of possibilities still is. That said, as of June 11, the overall Eigen Layer price forecast remains fairly upbeat. 17 technical indicators are flashing bullish, while only 4 suggest a bearish trend. Over at Changelly , their outlook for 2025 is more stable — they expect EIGEN to trade between $1.89 and $1.94. On the other hand, Wallet Investor paints a much more pessimistic picture, predicting the coin could slide hard by the end of 2025, with a maximum price of just $0.266. Will Eigen Layer go up or down in five years? Eigen Layer price prediction 2030 According to Wallet Investor’s expectations, things aren’t looking too bright for EIGEN long-term — they predict the price could max out at just $0.0762 by June 2030. Changelly’s projections for EIGEN are way more bullish, suggesting EIGEN could trade between $11.25 and $13.24by the end of the decade. CoinCodex’s Eigen Layer price prediction for 2030 lands somewhere in the middle, with estimates ranging from $2.17 to $6.82. Should you invest in Eigen Layer? The coin’s got real potential, but it’s also a bit of a wild ride. Some forecasts see big gains, others call for major drops — so it really depends on how the market and the project evolve. If you’re into long-term investments and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth a closer look. Just don’t skip the research.

Laffont argued that crypto’s beta values have decreased, making digital assets like Bitcoin a key component of a modern-day portfolio. Philippe Laffont manages a tech-focused hedge fund and is interested in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced dramatic swings over time, turning off investors from buying the digital asset. Laffont was one of those investors who stayed away from Bitcoin due to its volatility. Bitcoin has surged through 2025 but has reduced its volatility over time. Laffont argues that Bitcoin has less volatility than it did years ago and may become even more attractive to future investors. Bitcoin has changed its market dynamics over time. Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin dropped 60% during 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite only dropped 33%. Conversely, Bitcoin only fell 5% in 2025 when President Trump introduced tariffs, while Nasdaq dropped 6%. The hedge fund manager believes this signifies Bitcoin’s growing maturity. Laffont also believes institutional investors drive down volatility by making informed decisions about adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Bitcoin trades above $100k and fluctuates moderately given its high price bracket. Laffont, an experienced hedge fund manager, said that Bitcoin was once considered a speculative asset, but was now becoming more foundational, and could start to look more like a legacy market. Laffont avoided Bitcoin in the past due to how unstable it was. But now, according to Laffont, the math is changing, and the cost of getting into Bitcoin is decreasing. Laffont surmised that if the beta value of Bitcoin continues to go down, then the crypto market will become even more interesting. A beta value compares the volatility of an asset to the broader market. Coatue Management has invested in various crypto businesses, including Dune Analytics and Hut 8. Coatue specialises in technology investments, which fits the market of cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence. However, Laffont avoided crypto for some time due to issues with its underlying pricing structure. Laffont claims that he wakes up at 3 AM every night and bemoans what an ‘idiot’ he had been for not getting into crypto earlier. He asks himself over and over again why he didn’t invest more in crypto. During Laffont’s time as a hedge fund manager, he gained experience. He learned that simple ideas are much better than complicated ones regarding investment decisions. He admits that his team deliberated for years over use cases for Bitcoin and failed to see its simplistic value right before them. Laffont analysed the dynamics of Bitcoin and noticed that traders were holding their tokens for more extended periods, specifically concerning the number of traders holding tokens over one month. According to Laffont, the rate of traders selling Bitcoin after just one month has been dramatically reduced. Traders are making fewer in-and-out transactions, and are contemplating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Traders, therefore, are treating Bitcoin more like an investment and less like a speculative asset. According to Laffont, this behavior change is changing the portfolio dynamics of digital assets. Laffont also noticed that big names were getting involved in cryptocurrencies, which was another key sign that the market was changing. He saw that BlackRock was getting involved in Bitcoin and was even playing a pivotal role in introducing crypto ETFs to the investment community. Laffont reasoned that more big names were bound to get involved after a few announced their interest in Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-15 16:10:54

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP eyes $10 as Bitcoin targets $200k, but rising memecoin LILPEPE may outshine Ripple in 2025’s bullish crypto market. Ripple is in the news again as the cryptocurrency market readies itself for a potential growth spurt. Analysts are predicting Bitcoin to surge to $200,000, which in turn would allow XRP to reach $10. They attribute this to a potent combination of positive technical indicators, institutional demand, and favorable regulations. But XRP is gaining ground. While Little Pepe, a memecoin, is gaining prominence, it is also becoming a significant player in the market. Powered by meme magic and battle-hardened blockchain engineering, LILPEPE is a breakout penny crypto that has the potential to surpass even XRP’s stellar projections in 2025. Here’s why investing in LILPEPE could be a lucrative opportunity during this meme-fueled bull market. You might also like: XRP price nears big move as RLUSD flirts with $500m milestone BTC at $200,000? XRP’s path to $10 looks real The conditions are favorable for Bitcoin to make a significant surge towards $200,000. With over $126 billion now locked into spot Bitcoin ETFs and exchange balances dwindling, the case for BTC’s 83% rise from $109K is becoming increasingly compelling. Altcoin surges historically follow a breakout to these levels, and XRP sits at the front of that wave. XRP has outperformed BTC by a massive 343% over the last 12 months. Analysts, based on projections of the XRP/BTC ratio, anticipate clear targets at $4.35 and $5, with a potential peak at $10. Add Ripple’s ongoing legal wins and increasing institutional usage as a payment solution, and there is a fundamentally strong asset with explosive potential. The meme kingdom: Why LILPEPE will shine brighter than XRP While XRP has institutional respect, LILPEPE commands the culture. The memecoin revolution has minted millionaires from mere memes. Launched on June 10, 2025, LILPEPE is revolutionizing the industry with a Layer 2 chain designed explicitly for memes, offering speed, affordability, security, and legendary status. Imagine a memecoin that doesn’t just exist on Ethereum but out-memes Ethereum itself. LILPEPE is the world’s first Layer 2 dedicated entirely to memes, with sniper-bot protection, zero tax, and a Launchpad (“Pump Pad”) tailored to launch viral meme projects straight to the moon. Why LILPEPE could dominate in 2025: Zero Tax, No Bots: Built-in sniper bot resistance ensures fair launches. Fast Finality: Transactions confirm faster than Elon tweets. Presale Still Live: Stage 1 ongoing; over $447,000 already raised at $0.001 per token. Tokenomics Made for Mooning: 100b total supply, with 26.5B allocated for presale. That’s your low-entry opportunity. CEX Listings: Plans confirmed for two top-tier exchange listings post-launch, strategically targeting the world’s biggest exchange. Buy LILPEPE with ETH or USDT via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Tokens are claimable after the presale ends; just connect a wallet and flex the memecoins. Not just another frog: The rise of the meme empire From the swamps of Solidity and the jungles of JavaScript, a small yet powerful hero emerged — Little Pepe. LILPEPE isn’t some recycled Pepe wannabe. He is the inheritor of the meme throne. With a narrative that blends web3 storytelling and community power, LILPEPE is giving rug-pulled frogs and boring Layer 2s something to cry about. Penny crypto, gigabrain potential At a token price of $0.001, LILPEPE represents the pinnacle of early adoption. This isn’t just a token floating in a pond. This is a frog equipped with a jetpack, equipped with meme magic, and backed by a community eager to take action.

Its DAG-based structure and high-speed execution brought serious gains to those who believed early. But now, many of those same investors are pivoting fast. The destination? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically engineered blockchain designed not just for speed or security, but for unlocking real wealth for the everyday person. For many, it’s not just another altcoin—it’s Bitcoin’s second coming. Kaspa Had Its Run—But the Momentum Has Shifted There’s no denying Kaspa’s early promise. With block times measured in seconds and an innovative take on consensus, it drew praise from technologists and traders alike. But despite its brilliance, it’s facing limitations. Kaspa lacks a layered architecture, has no native staking, and remains too niche for widespread adoption. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is proving irresistible to those who profited from Kaspa’s rise and are now seeking the next transformative leap. With stronger architecture, a mobile-first strategy, and an entirely different approach to community growth, BTC-S is emerging as the smarter play. Bitcoin Solaris: Where Power Meets Purpose At the core of Bitcoin Solaris lies a dual-consensus model. Its Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work to maintain the Bitcoin ethos—decentralization, fairness, and security. But layered on top is the Solaris Layer, a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system that delivers 100,000 TPS and 2-second finality. Together, they form a blockchain that is: Scalable beyond legacy limits Energy-efficient, consuming 99.95% less than Bitcoin Fully ready for smart contracts and real-world utility The upcoming Solaris Nova App takes this even further, allowing users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones, without any need for expensive rigs or technical setup. (You can preview the rewards using this mining calculator ). Liquid Staking Built for Real Users Bitcoin Solaris goes beyond passive holding with its liquid staking system. Once staked, BTC-S tokens become sBTC-S, a fully tradable version that can still earn rewards while remaining usable in DeFi. Rewards + Liquidity in one Compatible with DeFi protocols Strengthens the network through participation Managed easily through the Solaris Nova App Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Referrals That Reward Both Sides Unlike most projects that only reward one party, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double rewards referral program . When someone joins through a referral, both the inviter and the new buyer receive 5% in BTC-S tokens automatically. Growing Buzz from Influencers and Analysts The buzz surrounding Bitcoin Solaris is impossible to ignore. A comprehensive review by 2Bit Crypto dives into why so many believe BTC-S is the only serious challenger to Bitcoin’s original mission. Meanwhile, Ben Crypto highlights its unique technical strengths and how mobile mining could redefine mass adoption. It’s not just a trend, it’s a migration. From Telegram groups to X threads, crypto enthusiasts are calling it a fresh start for people priced out of traditional mining or slow chains. Presale Demand Hits New Heights Bitcoin Solaris is now in phase 7 of its presale, with the price currently at $7 and climbing soon to $8. The launch is locked for July 31, with a $20 token price target—a potential 187% return for today’s buyers. Over 11,500+ users already joined $4.5M+ raised, gaining momentum by the day Only weeks left before the presale ends Recognized as one of the shortest and most aggressive launches in 2025 This is where Bitcoin Solaris truly shines . It’s not just about tech, it’s about access. It’s about giving everyday people a fair shot before the whales even wake up. The Final Word: Why This Matters Now Bitcoin Solaris isn’t here to replace Bitcoin. It’s here to complement it with better tools, more access, and faster pathways to growth. It carries the spirit of early Bitcoin but upgrades the infrastructure to serve today’s reality. No massive rigs, no centralized mining pools, only speed, fairness, and utility in your hands. Kaspa was a brilliant chapter. But the next chapter is already being written, and BTC-S is on the cover.

Investors are keen to know if this dump will be retraced, considering that many altcoins are bouncing, due to the recent surge in price of Bitcoin. Let’s find that out in detail in this Mask Network price prediction. Table of Contents What is Mask Network? Mask Network price prediction Mask Network coin price prediction: short-term outlook Mask Network price prediction 2025 Mask Network price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Mask Network ( MASK ) has seen an all-time high of $97.92, followed by a -5867.2% drop in price.

Mask Network is a protocol that enables users to transmit encrypted communications via Facebook and Twitter. In essence, it serves as a link between a decentralized network operating on top of the Internet. When Mask Network was first introduced in July 2019, its primary application was to enable users of Facebook and Twitter to encrypt posts on these social media sites. Subsequently, HashKey and Hash Global co-led a $2 million investment round in November 2020, while Digital Currency Group and Fundamental Labs participated in a subsequent $3 million funding round in February 2021. Mask Network now allows Gitcoin grant campaigns to be funded straight from Twitter. It also intends to provide decentralized storage and peer-to-peer payments. Known as a decentralized Applet (DApplet) ecosystem, it is a decentralized portal that enables users to use DApps such as cryptocurrency payments, decentralized finance, decentralized storage, e-commerce (digital goods/NFTs), and decentralized organizations (DAOs) on top of pre-existing social networks without migrating. Now let’s discuss MASK price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Mask Network price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the MASK token? Let’s dive into the MASK price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Mask Network coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Mask Network price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 41.61% and reach $2.36 by July 10, 2025.. As of June 10th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the MASK price outlook has shifted slightly bearish, with 17 technical analysis indicators displaying bearish signals, 11 indicating bullish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Mask Network price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the MASK token’s price could fluctuate between $1.47 and $3.61, and may likely hold a yearly average of $2.83. CoinCodex projects that the MASK token can trade in the price channel of $1.636636 and $1.636636 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in MASK or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Mask Network price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Mask Network crypto price prediction for 2030, MASK’s price could vary between $3.58 and $4.57. DigitalCoinPrice expects that MASK’s price could climb to $4.84 or $5.99 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the MASK price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the MASK token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including MASK. A great way for MASK to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the MASK token.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including MASK, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the MASK token. Will Mask Network go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the MASK token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Mask Network price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low MASK can go. Should I invest in Mask Network? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Mask Network price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the MASK token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

You might also like: What Is Ravencoin (RVN) and Is It a Legit Cryptocurrency? What is Ravencoin? The goal of Ravencoin, a digital peer-to-peer (P2P) network, is to deploy a use case-specific blockchain that is intended to effectively manage a single function: the transfer of assets between parties. Built on a fork of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) code, Ravencoin was first announced on October 31, 2017, and on January 3, 2018, it released binaries for mining. This was known as a fair launch because there was no premine, initial coin offering, or masternodes. Its name was inspired by the Game of Thrones television series. Ravencoin, which is a fork of the BTC code, has four major features: a mining algorithm (KAWPOW, formerly X16R and X16RV2 respectively) designed to lessen the centralization of mining brought on by ASIC hardware; a modified issuance schedule (with a block reward of 5,000 RVN); a block time reduction to one minute; and a coin supply cap of 21 billion, which is a thousand times greater than BTC. Ravencoin seeks to address the issue of blockchain trade and asset transfers. In the past, an asset produced on the BTC blockchain could unintentionally be destroyed when the coins used to create it were traded. Token assets on the Ravenchain can only be issued by burning RVN coins, which are intended to function as internal currency within the network. A stake of a project, such as equities and securities, airline miles, an hour’s pay, or real-world custodial items like gold or actual euros, can all be represented by the assets.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Hyperliquid: The Future of Fast and Free DeFi Trading Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform aiming to change decentralized finance (DeFi). Built from the ground up, it offers a custom Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability. At its heart is HyperBFT, a unique consensus mechanism that ensures transactions are finalized quickly and securely. One of Hyperliquid’s standout features is its focus on perpetual futures trading directly on its native blockchain. Unlike many platforms, it eliminates gas fees for transactions, making trading more affordable and efficient. With a fully on-chain order book, Hyperliquid provides transparency and security, as every transaction is verifiable on the blockchain. In today’s market, Hyperliquid looks promising. Its approach to fast, cost-free trading meets the growing demand for efficient DeFi solutions. The development team, with backgrounds from Harvard, Caltech, and MIT, brings strong expertise to the project. Being self-funded, Hyperliquid operates independently, focusing solely on its vision without outside pressures. Compared to other coins, its zero gas fees and high-performance blockchain give it an edge. As the DeFi space evolves, platforms that offer speed, security, and low costs are likely to attract more users. Hyperliquid’s unique features position it well in the current market cycle. Aave: Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with Flash Loans and Smart Contracts Aave is changing the way we think about lending and borrowing in cryptocurrency. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it offers a decentralized platform where users can lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without middlemen. Smart contracts manage all transactions, ensuring trust through code instead of institutions. Supporting 17 different cryptocurrencies, Aave provides flexible options for users. One of its standout features is the introduction of flash loans—instant loans without collateral that must be repaid within the same blockchain block. This innovative concept leverages Ethereum’s quick 13-second block time, allowing for rapid and efficient transactions. The AAVE token is central to this ecosystem. Holders enjoy benefits like fee waivers and voting rights on protocol changes. The token also serves as collateral with added perks. Aave’s Safety Module enhances security by allowing users to stake tokens, mitigating risks within the platform. With a limited token supply and a deflationary mechanism that reduces circulation through fee revenue, AAVE holds strong potential for value appreciation. In the current market, Aave stands out with its advanced technology and commitment to decentralization. Its unique features, like flash loans, set it apart from other coins, making it an attractive option in the evolving world of decentralized finance. Uniswap’s UNI Token: Empowering Users in the World of DeFi Uniswap’s UNI token is shaking up the decentralized finance scene. Introduced in September 2020, UNI gives holders the power to influence the platform’s future. Users can vote on key decisions like fee changes and how tokens are distributed. In a bold move to reward loyalty, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users. If you used Uniswap before then, you might have received 400 UNI tokens, worth over $1,000 at the launch! What makes Uniswap stand out is its unique approach to trading. Since 2018, it has operated without a traditional order book. Instead, it uses an automated system that lets users trade directly from their wallets. This means you have full control of your funds at all times. Being open-source and allowing free token listings, Uniswap prioritizes accessibility and security. As the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets, it’s a significant player in the market. In a landscape where decentralized exchanges are gaining traction, UNI’s innovative technology and community focus make it an interesting coin to watch in the current market cycle. ICP: Paving the Way for a Decentralized Internet Revolution Imagine an internet where apps run at lightning speed without relying on big tech companies. That’s the vision of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation. ICP aims to transform the internet from just a network for sharing information into a global computing platform. It seeks to enable decentralized applications to operate swiftly and securely, reducing costs and boosting efficiency. This could reshape the way we experience the digital world, making it more open, secure, and user-friendly. In today’s market, ICP stands out with its bold goals and cutting-edge technology. While many cryptocurrencies focus on digital money, ICP is building the backbone for a new kind of internet. This sets it apart from other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the market looks for projects with real-world use, ICP’s approach could make it an attractive option. By challenging traditional cloud services and decreasing reliance on big tech, ICP has the potential to revolutionize the digital landscape.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are still the most well-known and valuable tokens, but savvy investors are now seeking the next big thing, rather than relying on these established ones. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is a meme coin initiative that is making headlines for all the right reasons. This new Layer 2 meme coin is more than just another viral meme; it’s a full-fledged blockchain ecosystem that promises to surpass its predecessors. It costs less than $0.002. Can it eliminate more zeros than SHIB and PEPE did when they were at their peak? The History of SHIB and PEPE To see why Little Pepe can pass the big guys, you must look at how SHIB and PEPE are doing. Shiba Inu was launched as a competitor to Dogecoin, and over the years, it has developed a solid ecosystem. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) development has surely been remarkable since its meme origins, not only its tokenomics but also the launch of its layer 2 solution – Shibarium. Currently, the price of SHIB sits at $0.00001220 with a market cap exceeding $7.1 billion. That is impressive, but the fact that about 600 trillion tokens are in circulation makes it harder for the token to increase even more quickly. The coin may still make the news, but the time may have passed if you want to 100x your portfolio. Another frog-themed token, Pepe (PEPE), became popular in 2023. It had a circulating supply of 420 trillion and a market cap of under $5 billion. It caught the meme world by storm, trading primarily on its viral appeal and cultural awareness. PEPE, like SHIB, gave anyone who bought it on the first day a significant amount of money, but its current price of $0.00001146 and the fact that the market is already saturated with it mean that its most substantial gains are probably behind it. Why Little Pepe Could Be the Summer’s Biggest Surprise Hit Little Pepe is distinct from its predecessors in that it enters the arena as both a meme and an infrastructure. It is the native token of a Layer 2 blockchain that is fully working and built on Ethereum. This isn’t just another coin riding a viral wave; it’s a whole ecosystem built to support the next generation of meme coins and decentralized applications. And most importantly, it’s still early. Little Pepe is a good investment right now because it is currently priced at only $0.001 in the presale. This is an excellent opportunity to get in on the ground floor before major listings and increased market exposure occur. That is a significant difference from SHIB and PEPE, which many people only discovered after their major rallies. The Layer 2 design of $LILPEPE ensures minimal gas fees, transactions are almost instantaneously final, and users have a smooth experience. The platform also features a dedicated meme currency launchpad, marking a first in the meme coin market. This lets new viral tokens launch with their own infrastructure and community support. There are no taxes on transactions with Little Pepe. That means that users and investors won’t lose money if they trade or move their tokens. The network won’t slow down because of high fees. It’s a purist’s approach to crypto: rapid, free-flowing, and designed with the community in mind. The Strength of Deleting Zeros What does it mean to “erase zeros” in the realm of meme coins? It’s a simple way of saying “exponential growth,” which is the kind of rally that can change a token’s value from a few cents to a substantial amount of money. SHIB, for example, notoriously removed a significant number of zeros during its run, making billionaires overnight. However, due to its substantial market cap and circulating supply, it’s much less likely that it will follow that path again. On the other hand, Little Pepe has all it needs to be a machine that erases zeros. A slight rise to $0.01 from $0.001 means a 10x return. If the token reaches $0.10, which isn’t too expensive for a Layer 2 business with numerous uses and meme potential, investors would get 100 times their money back. Little Pepe is in a whole other league from SHIB and PEPE, whose prices are limited by their size and inflationary token schemes. How to sign up for the Little Pepe presale The Little Pepe presale is still open for anybody who wants to be ahead of the crowd. It’s easy to participate: investors simply need to connect their wallet (such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet) to the official presale site and send ETH or USDT. This gives people early access to $LILPEPE before it is made public and listed on centralized exchanges. This is likely to lead to the next phase of growth. There is a clear plan for the future, starting with the “Pregnancy” phase, which includes the introduction of the mainnet and partnerships, followed by ecosystem expansion, and ultimately, market dominance. Early supporters are gearing up for what could be substantial rewards. Conclusion It’s not just about who yells the loudest in the meme coin market anymore. In 2025, projects that combine viral enthusiasm with genuine technological utility will be the most successful. SHIB and PEPE made a big splash, but they may be too big to achieve the same level of success again. Little Pepe is a great alternative: it’s a small-cap meme coin with a solid technological base and room to expand. As the summer rally picks up speed, $LILPEPE could be the unexpected hero of meme season, getting rid of zeros faster than any of its predecessors. The benefits for those brave enough to back it early could be just as crazy as the memes.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum already moving higher, many believe XRP could be next. The key question is when to exit for the best profits. Even though XRP remains a strong pick, a new rising crypto is turning heads. It’s tackling payment issues that XRP hasn’t fully solved. Let’s first look at where XRP could go and what project might quietly outperform it. XRP Price Forecast: Can an ETF Push XRP to $27? XRP is trading below $3, but some experts believe it could shoot up. If the SEC allows a spot ETF, XRP might hit $27. Polymarket places the odds of approval at 87%, thanks to a more crypto-friendly SEC chairman. Ripple is moving fast. It’s expanding its payment network and forming deals worldwide. CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes XRP could soar after the SEC case ends. But rivals like Circle are moving fast too, and could take XRP’s place if delays happen. Still, a $27 price would need a $1.9 trillion market cap. That’s huge. While XRP’s performance is strong, any big move now depends on regulation more than charts. New Exchange Launching: Zero Fees and Smooth Swaps While XRP is stuck in a legal wait, another crypto is building its foundation. This project is developing an exchange where only valuable tokens get listed and without paying fees. It has a swap system that works across Ethereum, Solana, and BNB. For everyday users and merchants, it offers instant fiat settlement through crypto payments, no more hopping between platforms. Now, the demo version of the exchange is about to be revealed. With over $5M raised and strong community backing, many are watching closely. Real utility like this is hard to find in the current market full of meme hype. Presale Is Live: Demo Launch Soon + 278% Staking Rewards Pepeto’s presale is in full swing, pulling in more than $5.3M and building a fanbase of 70,000+. The token is still very early just 1 $Pepeto = $0.000000135. Why the excitement? Many believe Pepeto completes what Pepe started. Rumors point to a co-founder returning with the real vision adding T for Technology and O for Optimization. Want in?

This Cheap Crypto Under $0.05 is Poised to Join the Top 10 Too,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/missed-solana-sol-this-cheap-crypto-under-0-05-is-poised-to-join-top-10-too/,"The post Missed Solana (SOL)? This Cheap Crypto Under $0.05 is Poised to Join the Top 10 Too appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $159, holding steady as it continues to dominate DeFi and meme coins discussions. While Solana remains one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, some investors feel they’ve already missed the biggest gains. That’s why attention is quickly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap crypto under $0.05 that’s generating serious hype during its presale. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, ahead of an increase in Phase 6 to $0.035. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when the presale started, Mutuum Finance will officially go live at $0.06, giving current buyers a minimum 100% return on investment. MUTM is quickly being talked about as the next big crypto, one that could follow a Solana-style trajectory into the top 10 cryptocurrencies before the next bull run peaks. Mutuum Finance Presale Picks Up Steam, Raises Over $10.5M as Excitement Builds Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining traction in the altcoin scene, and investors are taking notice. With its official launch set for 2025, momentum around the project is growing fast. The presale has already crossed a major milestone, Phase 4 sold out quicker than expected. Now in Phase 5, the token is priced at $0.03, giving early buyers an instant 16.67% gain when the next price jump hits. So far, over 12,000 investors have joined in, helping the project raise more than $10.6 million. With strong community backing and a clear roadmap, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the more promising altcoin investments heading into next year. Smart Tokenomics Set Mutuum Apart Compared to most other crypto projects which are purely based on hype in the market, Mutuum Finance is different. Its Buy-and-Distribute system implies that the project will routinely purchase its tokens back on the market and reward it to users who lock their MUTM. This not only encourages holding but also helps support the token’s value over time, something that could give long-term investors a real advantage. Rewarding Early Supporters with a $100K Giveaway To thank the early community, the Mutuum team has launched a $100,000 giveaway. Ten winners will be chosen to receive 10,000 MUTM tokens each. It’s a nice gesture, and a smart way to reward those who believed in the project from the start. Stablecoin Launch and Certik Audit Add Legitimacy On top of everything else, Mutuum is developing a fully backed, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Designed to hold its value even in tough market conditions, it aims to be a safer alternative to some of the unstable algorithmic stablecoins we’ve seen in the past. Security-wise, Mutuum has passed a comprehensive audit by Certik, a respected name in blockchain safety. That kind of stamp of approval goes a long way in showing investors that the project takes protection and transparency seriously. Mutuum Finance is quickly proving it is more than just hype, having raised over $10.5 million from 12,000+ early investors and securing a Certik audit to validate its security and credibility. Priced at just $0.03 in its current presale phase, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, investors today are looking at a potential 100% return before the token even hits major exchanges. With features like a buy-and-distribute tokenomics model, a USD-pegged stablecoin on the horizon, and a $100K giveaway rewarding early supporters, MUTM stands out as one of the most compelling low-priced altcoins heading into Q3 2025. If you missed Solana’s early run, this is your second chance to secure your stake before the next price jump.

Ethereum, Ripple, and the next top-5 candidates may be trading beneath your notice. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) and Kaspa (KAS) are under $0.50 but have huge potential. These aren’t just low-cost submissions; they possess crypto’s most potential tech and cultural value, which is why $LILPEPE and KAS could join XRP and ETH by 2026. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): Holding a promise of Top 5 With the listing price at, at $0.003, Little Pepe is the native utility token of Little Pepe, a Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem designed exclusively for meme culture. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a next-gen Layer 2 chain built to scale Ethereum while adding a heavy dose of humor, culture, and utility. The platform blends ultra-low transaction fees, warp-speed finality, and top-tier security, all while being the only meme-centric chain in existence. This isn’t hype without substance. Little Pepe plans to host a dedicated Launchpad for meme tokens, allowing creators to deploy and grow within a purpose-built ecosystem. With advanced technology, sniper bots are completely neutralized on the Little Pepe chain, ensuring fair launches and eliminating front-running. That alone makes it a game changer in DeFi circles. Little Pepe is also backed by anonymous experts who have already contributed to the success of major meme coins in the space. With experienced developers, strategic advisors, and a plan already in motion to list on two top centralized exchanges at launch, $LILPEPE isn’t just aiming for relevance—it’s gunning for dominance. The team has also teased plans to pursue a listing on the world’s biggest exchange, though names are being kept under wraps for strategic reasons. Little Pepe Tokenomics Tokenomics can make or break a project, and Little Pepe has built its structure to fuel long-term sustainability: 10% Liquidity: Deep, stable markets to ensure fair pricing and reduce slippage. 26.5% Presale: Rewards early believers—those who join before the general public catches on. 30% Chain Reserves: Funds the operation and maintenance of the L2 infrastructure. 10% DEX Allocation: Readiness for decentralized trading right out of the gate. 10% Marketing: From viral meme campaigns to influencer collabs, the marketing war chest is built for visibility. 13.5% – Staking & Rewards: Designed to reward long-term holders and ecosystem supporters. 0% Tax: That’s right—no buy or sell tax. Because true DeFi is meant to be frictionless. Roadmap: From Meme to Monarch The Little Pepe journey is broken into three key stages: Pregnancy The presale phase kicks off, alongside strategic partnerships and community hype. It’s the calm before the meme storm. Birth Little Pepe launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Marketing goes full throttle, and the race to a $1 billion market cap begins. Growth The meme grows into a movement. Little Pepe becomes a secure, fast, and EVM-compatible Layer 2 chain, aiming to rank among the Top 100 on CoinMarketCap. The chain becomes the ultimate playground for meme developers and fans alike. The ultimate goal? For Little Pepe to become the king of meme chains, offering the cheapest, fastest, and fairest blockchain environment for creators and traders. Kaspa (KAS): The Fastest Layer 1 You’re Not Watching On the opposite end of the meme spectrum sits Kaspa (KAS), a project known more for its technical prowess than its memes. Priced around $0.17, Kaspa is a Layer 1 blockchain that utilizes the GHOSTDAG protocol, allowing it to confirm multiple blocks simultaneously. This achieves a block time of less than one second, supports near-instant verification, offers tremendous scalability, all while retaining decentralization and security. Unlike most Layer 1s, Kaspa doesn’t rely on complex gimmicks. It’s a pure Proof-of-Work chain that maintains Bitcoin’s security ethos while improving on its speed and throughput. Kaspa is a community-driven, open-source, and energy-efficient project. Miners, developers, and investors who believe it can grow high-volume applications are adopting it quickly. Like Little Pepe, Kaspa has strong community backing and growing interest on exchanges. Rumors of upcoming major exchange listings continue to build excitement, and its presence across mining communities gives it organic growth momentum. Why These Two Could Crack the Top 5 Real Utility Little Pepe delivers a full-featured Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme culture—a bigger niche than most people realize. Kaspa provides scalable, secure Layer 1 infrastructure with real-world applications. Ultra-Low Prices, Massive Upside Retail investors can purchase both tokens for under $0.50, which have the potential for exponential growth. Community & Credibility Known experts behind successful meme launches are quietly building Little Pepe. Kaspa’s dev team and community are transparent, committed, and growing rapidly. Strategic Exchange Listings Little Pepe will launch on two top-tier exchanges and aims to reach the world’s largest. Kaspa is steadily expanding its exchange footprint as institutional interest builds. Long-Term Vision Little Pepe is creating an entire meme economy with Layer 2 scalability. Kaspa fixes the most critical issues in blockchain technology which include speed, security, and decentralization all at once. Final Thoughts The next crypto market cycle will reward hype and innovation paired with culture. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is building a meme-powered Layer 2 empire, while Kaspa (KAS) is redefining what Layer 1 speed and scalability should look like. As Ethereum and Ripple solidify their blue-chip status, these two under-$0.50 gems are preparing to make history.

According to a new report from the New York Post, records released by the Office of Government Ethics show that Trump’s stake in WLFI raked in just over $57.3 million for him, one of his largest sources of income in the past year. WLFI, which was launched last year, was co-founded by Trump’s three sons – Donald Jr., Eric and Barron – and others as a response to what they say is the growing politicization of the banking system. Previously, Donald Trump Jr. said that his family was debanked after getting into politics and described the banking system as a “pyramid scheme.” “There was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” The disclosure reports that Trump’s personal crypto wallet is valued at between $1,000,001 and $5 million while listing millions of dollars worth of royalty payments he received for selling items with his name and likeness. Some of the President’s noteworthy liabilities include $100 million worth of mortgage loans for various properties, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lawsuits and tens of thousands of dollars worth of credit card bills.

In a recent X post, Crypto Beast declared, “XRP top is NOT in yet,” asserting that the market has not fully priced in XRP’s long-term value or recent developments. He emphasized that XRP holders are “about to make A LOT of money,” and assured followers that he will announce publicly when it’s time to exit the market. Technical Structure Suggests Major Breakout The analysis presented by Crypto Beast is based on a long-term XRP/USD chart, which displays a compelling pattern. The chart highlights two major symmetrical triangles—one from 2014 to 2017 and another from 2018 to 2024. The 2014–2017 triangle preceded XRP’s explosive rally to over $3.00, and the new breakout appears to be following a similar trajectory. XRP top is NOT in yet My minimum target is $8 The SEC ruled that it’s not a security and I don’t think the market fully priced that in yet. $XRP holders are about to make ALOT of money. When it’s time to sell, i will announce it here publicly. You’ll regret not following me. pic.twitter.com/f39ADfGZex — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) June 15, 2025 According to Beast’s chart, XRP has recently broken out of a massive consolidation range , signaling the end of a multi-year accumulation phase. This technical structure often precedes major bull runs, especially in historically volatile assets like XRP. The upward projection he drew reflects a steep rise, placing XRP’s price above $8 in the months ahead. The Undervalued Impact of Regulatory Clarity While Crypto Beast didn’t dwell heavily on the fundamentals, he did point to one critical factor that many believe the market continues to overlook—regulatory clarity. XRP remains one of the few digital assets with a legal determination in the U.S. confirming that it is not a security. This ruling, delivered in 2023, removed a significant cloud of uncertainty that had long weighed on investor sentiment. Crypto Beast argues that the implications of this clarity have not yet been fully factored into XRP’s price. In his view, the market has been slow to recognize the advantage this gives XRP over competitors still entangled in legal ambiguity. This regulatory clarity, combined with an emerging bullish pattern, sets the stage for what could be an aggressive upward move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Community Poised for a Breakout Beyond the chart and legal backdrop, Crypto Beast’s post reflects the broader sentiment among XRP holders. Many in the community believe that XRP has been unfairly suppressed for years due to legal battles and media skepticism . With much of that pressure now easing, bullish traders are betting on a dramatic shift in momentum. Crypto Beast’s track record and confidence have earned him a large following, and his commitment to announcing when to sell only adds to his credibility. For now, he’s staying firmly in the bullish camp, urging investors not to lose sight of the opportunity. Looking Ahead Whether XRP reaches $8 or not, Crypto Beast’s forecast underscores a renewed optimism within the XRP community. With technicals aligning, legal uncertainties resolved, and market sentiment heating up, XRP appears to be entering a new phase of its lifecycle. If the patterns repeat and history rhymes, holders could indeed be on the brink of substantial gains. As always, market conditions can change rapidly. But for now, one thing is clear—Crypto Beast believes the real XRP rally hasn’t even started. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Yet, beyond the headlines, a quieter surge is unfolding inside the DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol currently in its presale phase, is making waves with soaring participation numbers, aggressive volume growth, and unmatched investor momentum. With over $10.55 million already raised and more than 12,000 holders onboarded, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most in-demand tokens of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building for function, not just FOMO Unlike speculative assets driven only by hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with strong DeFi fundamentals. The protocol will allow users to lend and borrow a variety of crypto assets using two mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will deposit assets like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), or Solana (SOL) into shared liquidity pools. In the P2P model, users will be able to negotiate lending terms directly, bypassing automated rates to set custom deals. This will be especially useful for trading in tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—assets not usually supported on major platforms. At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward users who provide liquidity through non-custodial smart contracts. When users deposit assets, they will receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens will represent both the initial deposit and the interest earned, growing in value as borrowing activity increases. Unlike staking systems that rely on inflationary rewards, interest on Mutuum will come from actual borrower demand—ensuring more sustainable returns. Users aiming for passive income can stake their mtTokens in a safety module to receive dividend distributions in the form of MUTM tokens. These dividends will be funded by the protocol’s revenue, primarily from borrower interest. To maintain upward demand pressure on the token price, the protocol will use part of its earnings to buy MUTM on the open market and distribute it to stakers. While the crypto world watches Bitcoin (BTC)’s dominance climb with renewed excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly outpacing most of the market in volume and holder count. The presale’s strong engagement reflects growing investor confidence in protocols with real utility, especially those that are still undervalued ahead of major exchange listings. With a fixed total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens and a listing price expected to open at $0.06, many believe the current $0.03 presale rate presents an entry opportunity with high upside. With the ongoing $100K giveaway , this early-stage advantage is becoming rare in a market where many altcoins have already priced in future expectations. The stablecoin advantage and layered ecosystem growth One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s most important innovations is its upcoming decentralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized or fiat-backed options, this stablecoin will be minted directly from overcollateralized on-chain assets already held in the protocol. This system will increase transparency and maintain algorithmic supply adjustments, allowing users to borrow against stable value without relying on external reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already achieved key milestones in its first phase. These include executing the presale, launching marketing campaigns, listing on crypto tracking platforms, and initiating a smart contract audit by CertiK. As the roadmap progresses into development-focused phases, the team will deliver key infrastructure: smart contracts, frontend dApps, and full backend integration. Phase 3 will include testnet beta testing and a functional demo version. Once this is complete, the project will move into Phase 4, where the live platform will go public. The MUTM token will be listed on major exchanges, and investors will be able to claim and use their tokens in the working platform. At that stage, the dividend mechanisms, smart contract lending, and user dashboard will become fully operational—solidifying MUTM as a functional asset rather than just a speculative token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers use, not just hype As Bitcoin (BTC) climbs toward new peaks, investor attention naturally gravitates toward established names. But history shows that once top-tier coins reach all-time highs, smart money begins rotating into newer protocols offering real utility and stronger upside. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself: not as a hype machine, but as a working product with yield, utility, and growth potential. Its passive income structure, overcollateralized borrowing system, and smart contract-driven ecosystem offer clear financial pathways for both cautious and active participants. The upcoming stablecoin and expanding cross-chain features will only deepen its market relevance, while token buybacks and dividend mechanisms will support long-term value for users. While Bitcoin (BTC) holders are celebrating the $112K milestone, those who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.03 are watching their early-stage investment move toward real-world application, token appreciation, and income-generating possibilities. As the protocol prepares for its official launch, one thing is clear—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not waiting for permission to lead the next wave of DeFi.

Circle CEO says stablecoins are almost there,https://crypto.news/stablecoins-are-almost-iphone-moment-circle-ceo/,"Stablecoins are nearing a breakthrough moment, according to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who likens their current state to the early days of the iPhone — full of untapped potential waiting on better infrastructure and developer tools. Allaire described stablecoins as “the highest utility form of money ever created” while suggesting widespread developer adoption remains ahead. The CEO’s comments respond to the growing recognition of stablecoins’ competitive advantages in financial services. The highest utility form of money ever created.

However, users could still earn returns by swapping between stablecoins and tokenized money market funds instantly across different providers.

This cost disadvantage currently restricts stablecoin usage to customers without access to traditional financial services or those requiring specific cryptocurrency functionality. The fee gap must close before mass market adoption becomes viable. However, Revolut is beginning to blur these distinctions by offering USDT deposits and withdrawals. Allaire’s iPhone analogy suggests that widespread developer adoption requires better tooling, documentation, and infrastructure rather than just technological capability. The original iPhone succeeded because Apple created comprehensive development platforms that made mobile programming accessible.

With analysts highlighting its strong fundamentals, massive growth, and potential for significant profits, Ruvi AI is attracting investors eager to capitalize on its unique blend of blockchain and AI technology. Cardano (ADA): A Pioneer in Blockchain Sustainability Since its inception, Cardano (ADA) has been a trailblazer in the blockchain world. Launched with a focus on academic research and peer-reviewed protocols, Cardano has built a robust ecosystem centered on scalability and long-term sustainability. Its Ouroboros proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is lauded for being highly energy-efficient while maintaining security and decentralization. Known for its emphasis on real-world applications, Cardano has facilitated numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, digital identities, and supply chain solutions. The platform’s measured approach to development ensures reliability but has often been perceived as slow compared to faster-moving competitors. This opens the door for forward-thinking projects like Ruvi AI to challenge Cardano’s position as a leader in the blockchain ecosystem. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain and AI Combine to Disrupt Industries Ruvi AI is redefining blockchain innovation by integrating artificial intelligence into a decentralized platform. Aiming to address real-world needs, Ruvi AI provides a superapp that generates AI-powered content in formats like text, video, audio, and images. This approach makes the platform highly versatile, appealing to industries such as marketing, creative production, and automation. The $RUVI token powers the platform by facilitating transactions, staking rewards, governance participation, and access to premium services. Unlike many speculative cryptocurrencies, Ruvi AI focuses on creating tangible value, bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical applications. This unique combination positions Ruvi AI as a potential disruptor across multiple industries. Explosive Presale Growth Ruvi AI’s presale performance highlights its immense growth potential. Phase 1 of the presale sold out in just two weeks, with tokens priced at $0.010. Early supporters immediately saw a 50% return on their investment when Phase 2 launched at $0.015. Over 1600 holders have already joined, and the project has raised $1.7 million to date. Momentum continues to build as Ruvi AI recently announced its first exchange listing and a strategic partnership with a major trading platform. These developments ensure liquidity and expand the project’s visibility. With additional updates expected shortly, Ruvi AI’s trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. Cyberscope Audit Reinforces Trust and Credibility Building trust among investors is a top priority for Ruvi AI, evidenced by its ongoing audit with Cyberscope, a highly regarded blockchain security firm. The rigorous assessment evaluates Ruvi AI’s smart contracts, platform security, and code integrity, ensuring the project meets the highest industry standards. The audit not only strengthens Ruvi AI’s credibility but also positions it as a reliable competitor to established projects like Cardano. By prioritizing transparency and security, Ruvi AI appeals to cautious investors looking for trustworthy opportunities in an otherwise volatile market. Investment Scenarios with Exceptional ROI Ruvi AI’s presale offers structured VIP tiers, providing significant bonuses to early investors. Below are the potential returns based on a $0.015 presale price, a $0.07 listing price, and an anticipated $1 post-listing valuation: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Listing : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). The Final Takeaway While Cardano continues to set standards for sustainability and academic rigor in the blockchain space, Ruvi AI’s innovative approach to integrating AI and blockchain offers a fresh alternative with immense growth potential. Its successful presale, transparent audit, and focus on real-world applicability make it an attractive option for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, Ruvi AI represents a chance to secure a position in a groundbreaking project early on. With analysts predicting exceptional returns, now is the time to act before Ruvi AI reshapes the cryptocurrency landscape.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 17:00:00

Both are seeing some serious action, with XRP holding strong near $2.10 and looking for a breakout above $2.36. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is hovering just under $0.20, and traders are waiting for a move past $0.21. While both coins are setting up for potential breakouts, there’s a bigger story that’s flying under the radar. Yet, BlockDAG’s (BDAG) launch plan is shaping up to be a real game changer. CEO Antony Turner’s GO LIVE roadmap makes one thing clear: BDAG isn’t just another meme or hype-driven token. The project is focused on infrastructure, with a $600M presale goal to power mining tools, enhance DAG security, and fuel DeFi tools. BlockDAG is growing globally and bringing real value to the market. XRP’s Next Move: Consolidation or Breakout? XRP is holding steady near the $2.10 mark after a sharp drop earlier this week, and traders are closely watching its next move. Technical indicators suggest that if XRP can break through the resistance at $2.27–$2.36, the coin could target upside levels between $2.60 and $3.40. The RSI has recovered from oversold levels, and tightening Bollinger Bands hint at a potential breakout. However, if XRP falls below $2.00, it could face a downside correction toward $1.79. The fundamentals are also compelling: XRP futures are being reviewed by CME, Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road strengthens its institutional access, and a possible SEC case outcome could shift the market in a heartbeat. With everything in play, XRP’s next move could be a game-changer. Dogecoin (DOGE) Rally Forecast: Big Move Ahead? Dogecoin (DOGE) is holding below $0.20, fluctuating between $0.189 and $0.204, and traders are waiting for a decisive move. A clean breakout above $0.210 could unlock targets in the $0.22–$0.30 range, with RSI and MACD indicating early bullish signs. Tightening Bollinger Bands suggest that DOGE is primed for a big move. But if DOGE slips below $0.189, it may revisit lower levels around $0.179 or even $0.165. Key catalysts like the potential for a DOGE ETF, institutional accumulation, and Musk-related speculation keep the rally forecast in play. With recent Coinbase integration adding utility, DOGE’s rally could go either way, making it a critical asset to watch for short-term traders and long-term holders alike. BlockDAG’s GO LIVE Plan: A Fully Operational Crypto Ecosystem BlockDAG is not just preparing for another token launch; it’s executing a full-scale infrastructure rollout. The six-week GO LIVE plan is designed with precision, covering everything from mining hardware to smart contract tools and exchange listings. CEO Antony Turner has laid out a clear and detailed roadmap that includes presale closure, node activation, token vesting, DeFi deployment, and a 7-day exclusive exchange window: all before the coin hits 20+ exchanges. This level of clarity and structure is uncommon in the crypto world and is exactly why BlockDAG is becoming a prominent topic in any serious crypto discussion. The presale has already raised over $304 million, and BlockDAG is targeting $600 million. This figure is not arbitrary; it’s directly linked to specific deliverables like liquidity provisioning on centralized exchanges, mining infrastructure, developer grants, and decentralized application growth. The current $0.0018 price is part of a limited-time offer in Batch 29, while the regular price is already set at $0.0276. With 22.6 billion tokens sold and 45 total batches planned, the early entry window is rapidly closing. BlockDAG is already making waves with its mobile mining platform, X1 app, attracting 2 million users. Alongside this, the upcoming launch of higher-capacity mining devices like X10, X30, and X100 will add even more value to the ecosystem, all launching in real time. For anyone wondering which crypto to invest in, BlockDAG offers a solid answer. With a funded plan, a growing user base, a working infrastructure, and a clear path to listing, it is poised to dominate the market. The GO LIVE reveal marked the official start of a new era, and early participation is key. The Bottom Line XRP is sitting near a critical breakout zone, with ETF news, legal updates, and institutional interest building momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also in play, holding steady under $0.20, but a potential surge is on the horizon if resistance breaks. Both coins are preparing for a move, but if you’re looking for the clearest opportunity, BlockDAG stands out. BlockDAG is not relying on hype. With a clear $600M target, real infrastructure, and a six-week go-live plan, it’s executing on all fronts. With 2 million mobile miners, DeFi tools, and 20 exchange listings lined up, the $0.0018 offer is a limited-time entry. For those looking for real conviction, BlockDAG has the setup to deliver.

Hoskinson is confident that converting millions of ADA tokens to Bitcoin and other stablecoins could accomplish this. More precisely, the Cardano boss told viewers on a recent YouTube live stream that setting aside $100 million worth of ADA tokens from its treasury and converting them to Bitcoin and selected stablecoins could strengthen Cardano’s DeFi network. As he is quoted as saying; “What I’d like to see is could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury and convert it to a blend of a collection of stable coins and incumbent in Cardano, so USDM, USDA, as well as ADA-backed stablecoin synthetics like IUSD, and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin DeFi.” He asserts that the goal is to increase the DeFi to stablecoin ratios, bringing them into line with those of other DeFi ecosystems. Hoskinson targets a 33% to 40% ratio between stablecoin issuance and total locked value (TLV) on the network. Hoskinson further explained that with millions of ADA transfers being recorded daily, a significant transfer of funds might have little to no impact on the price of the ADA token as liquidity could still be enhanced with over-the-counter trades, among other things. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands on a daily basis, and the markets are deep enough that it could absorb within 30 to 90 days using TWAPs, OTCs, and other mechanisms, a hundred million dollar sale without moving the ADA price in any significant fashion.” He stated. At report time, ADA is valued at $0.6 per token. With altcoins collectively taking a hit, ADA has also not been spared. While 30-day losses have crossed 20%, over 4.35% has been sustained in losses over the last 7 days.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-15 17:02:35

The move aims to provide clear legal direction on handling crypto assets. This will, in turn, position Vietnam as a key digital hub in the region and address global concerns about regulatory gaps. Clear Definitions for Digital and Crypto Assets It is worth noting that the new law defines digital assets using clear categories. Digital assets are split into virtual assets and crypto assets. Virtual assets refer to those used for exchange or investment. However, securities, fiat currency representations, or financial instruments covered under civil and financial laws should be excluded. Conversely, crypto assets are digital assets that rely on encryption to confirm ownership and transactions. They do not include digital versions of currency or other regulated financial tools. The government is now responsible for setting rules guiding how these digital assets are classified, traded, and managed. These rules include specific business conditions and oversight measures that will align with international standards. Vietnam’s regulators are also required to implement systems that protect against cybersecurity threats, money laundering, terrorism financing, and illegal weapons funding. This update comes a few months after Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance announced that it is working on a plan to test a legal local crypto exchange in partnership with Bybit. Boosting Innovation and the Digital Technology Sector Aside from regulating digital assets, the law focuses heavily on the growth of Vietnam’s digital technology sector. It introduces a range of incentives to support digital enterprises, promote innovation, and develop technical infrastructure. Furthermore, this includes state-backed support for startups, subsidies for hiring skilled personnel, and talent development programs in fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Local governments are expected to assist in building a strong workforce, particularly for key digital projects. Training, retraining, and certification will be encouraged per global benchmarks. Crypto Assets Framework Tied to International Monitoring Goals This new framework is also expected to improve Vietnam’s standing on the global stage. Since 2023, Vietnam has been on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) gray list due to unclear virtual asset rules. It is essential to state that by passing this law, Vietnam takes a major step toward meeting FATF’s recommendations, which may lead to the country being removed from the list. The law will come into force on January 1, 2026, laying a strong legal and economic foundation for Vietnam’s digital future. Meanwhile, in 2024, the Government of Vietnam took a significant step in becoming a regional leader in blockchain technology. The country’s Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Ho Duc Phoc, signed and issued the National Blockchain Strategy into the national framework.

Qubetics May Be Among the Next Most Popular Cryptocurrency,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-solana-qubetics-may-be-among-the-next-most-popular-cryptocurrency/,"The crypto market is no stranger to latecomer regret. For every early participant who caught a 100x gem, there are thousands more still reeling from having missed the train. Solana was once one of those sleeper picks that transformed into a powerhouse—moving from under-the-radar status to being a widely acknowledged project. Those who recognized its potential in the early days saw exponential returns. Now, with Solana cemented among the elites, eyes are scanning for what might be next. Enter Qubetics , a project that has steadily carved out a new niche in the blockchain world. As the sector turns toward real-world use cases, Qubetics isn’t just ticking the right boxes, it’s redefining the checklist. While Solana has largely already awarded its early community, Qubetics is still deep in its last presale phase, with many analysts suggesting its true ascent is just beginning. The key question becomes: Could this be the best performing crypto of the next breakout phase? With the crypto presale near the end and over $18 million already raised, this project is being viewed as the top contender for those seeking exposure before the next wave of crypto adoption. Solana’s Path from Underdog to Market Leader Is Nearly Complete Solana is the benchmark every layer-1 dreams of becoming. From its lightning-fast throughput and low fees to widespread ecosystem expansion, it captured the imagination of a community tired of congestion and high gas costs. But Solana’s story isn’t about what it might do anymore—it’s about what it already has done. That difference matters. Now that it consistently ranks among the top digital assets by market cap, the days of massive 100x returns are likely behind. Still, its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and even gaming remains unshaken. Solana has also seen support from institutions, and its recent ecosystem growth has proven it’s not just a one-cycle wonder. But for those who didn’t enter early, it may now represent stability rather than asymmetric opportunity. This is where Qubetics naturally becomes part of the discussion. Much like Solana’s rise in previous years, Qubetics is now standing at a similarly pivotal presale moment. Analysts who missed Solana in its early phases are watching Qubetics more closely. The shared traits—clear utility, growing ecosystem, and token velocity potential—are all aligned. It’s now just a matter of timing, and the clock is ticking. Qubetics ($TICS): The Second Chance You’ve Been Waiting For Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another crypto project, it’s redefining how blockchains connect and share data. Its standout feature? Interoperability. Unlike most networks that operate in silos, Qubetics builds a Web3-aggregated chain, seamlessly linking blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This feature removes barriers to data sharing and cross-chain transfers, unlocking possibilities for everyone. This means faster, cost-effective cross-border payments for small businesses that sidestep the usual delays and high fees. A local shop can now accept payments from buyers using any blockchain token, while freelancers in one country can instantly get paid in their preferred currency from clients overseas. No more lost time waiting for third-party payment processors or struggling with currency conversions—Qubetics’ interoperability smooths it all out. Even developers see fresh opportunities. Building apps that run on any blockchain without complex bridges saves time and money. They can reach broader markets and serve users who prefer different networks, all while keeping costs low and security high. Qubetics’ approach also helps enterprises. Big brands in global supply chains can track goods in real-time and settle payments instantly across different currencies—no more waiting for separate networks to catch up. Artists and creators get to mint and sell NFTs, knowing they can accept payments from fans using any crypto network they like. The real-world applications of Qubetics’ interoperability are clear from small business owners to large enterprises. It’s a versatile solution that opens doors, helping people move money, share data, and build new blockchain-based tools without barriers. This unique feature places Qubetics firmly among the best cryptos to buy this month, catching the eye of those who missed earlier waves of opportunity. Qubetics Crypto Presale: A Rare Entry Point for Community Members Qubetics’ crypto presale is in its last stage, offering $TICS at just $0.3370 per token. So far, more than 27,900 backers have scooped up over 515 million tokens, raising over $18 million. Those who joined at just $0.01 in stage 1 already see a 3270% gain. But the window isn’t closed yet. Current participants are locking in a 196.65% return if $TICS hits $1 after the presale and potentially a massive 4349.76% return when it reaches $15 after the mainnet launch. The momentum is building fast, making Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy this month while the crypto presale remains active. Conclusion: The Next Top Crypto Asset It’s easy to look back at Solana and say, “If only.” But in this market, that phrase can become costly if it keeps happening. Solana has reached the point where it is rightly viewed as a foundational layer—stable, reputable, and deeply integrated into the broader crypto economy. However, the door for early outsized returns on Solana may have closed. Qubetics, on the other hand, is just entering its most vital phase. With a well-structured crypto presale still underway, Qubetics offers what Solana no longer can, a legitimate ground-floor opportunity with significant upside. For those seeking exposure to a top crypto asset before the market fully catches on, Qubetics may be the most strategic move to make before 2025 accelerates further. It is undoubtedly among the most popular cryptocurrency For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Is Qubetics still in presale? Yes, Qubetics is currently in last stage of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.3370. Over 514 million tokens have already been sold. What makes Qubetics different from other presale tokens? Qubetics offers real-world applications in the enterprise and public sectors. It emphasizes interoperability, automation, and practical blockchain solutions for various industries. What’s the potential ROI for Qubetics investors? Post-launch predictions range from $1 to $15, depending on adoption and partnerships, translating into a potential ROI of over 4000% from the current presale price. When will Qubetics launch on exchanges? The official exchange launch is expected after the presale and mainnet deployment, with dates to be announced on the official Qubetics channels.

The new laws, titled the Law on Digital Technology Industry, will take effect on January 1, 2026. The new laws categorise digital assets into two categories, namely virtual assets and crypto assets. Local media outlets have reported on the new laws as paving the way for Vietnamese citizens’ future innovations and employment opportunities. The new regulations further offer guidelines for local governments to create programs to encourage the crypto industry’s growth. The new guidelines form part of a broader strategy of the Vietnamese government to recover the national economy and stimulate trade. The new laws for the digital technology industry cover two major categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Virtual assets cover digital assets that can be transacted or stored as investments. According to the new laws, both virtual assets and crypto assets do not include securities, stablecoins, or other types of financial instruments. Crypto assets, moreover, use encryption methods to validate transactions and ownership. The new laws specify how business practices should operate when dealing with crypto and virtual assets. The new legislation, which comes into effect in 2026, also includes other forms of technology to establish Vietnam as a forward-thinking technology hub in Asia. The legislation also specifies a framework for dealing with Artificial Intelligence, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. The government will create technology incentives such as tax breaks, land deals, and Research and Development support. The government is expected to develop training programs to boost participation rates in the chosen industries. A significant focus of these new frameworks is to embrace the fields of semiconductors and AI data centres. The training programs will be integrated within national tech colleges so Vietnamese citizens can access more training and employment opportunities. The Vietnamese government has set up new policies to incentivise digital tech companies, including shared digital infrastructure and perks for emerging startups. Local governments will be tasked with promoting human resource departments, allowing the industry to thrive and grow. Although the new policies include digital assets, the main focus is promoting AI data centres and semiconductors. However, the package consists of digital assets as a key focus for the country to regulate and encourage. Local governments will be tasked with subsidizing costs for hiring key personnel. Subsidies will also include upskilling, trade colleges, and training staff. Certification of trade professionals will be an important part of the training guidelines, especially with adherence to international standards so that the Vietnamese tech industry will remain competitive globally. Countries across the globe are debating ways to take advantage of the new digital assets market, with some countries such as Vietnam taking an incentive-based approach. Many countries have remained cautious about the latest technology and have focused on regulating digital assets to ensure tax departments can keep up with the changes. However, a proactive approach, such as creating targeted tax incentives for key industries, may be a winning strategy for countries that wish to compete in the global market. Time will tell which plan works best for stimulating the digital economy. Vietnam aims to be a leader in digital technology by 2030. A competitive approach between nations may enrich the crypto market further because investors will have the choice to embrace proactive countries rather than invest with countries that remain draconian with a regulatory approach.",Cryptocurrency|News|Vietnam,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-15 17:18:06

Mentions of HOLD have broken out on social platform X, with volume spiking accordingly. One market commentator stated, “Volume just absolutely exploded on this little dip here.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has struggled to sustain a breakout above the $2,600 resistance zone, despite the inflows into Ethereum Spot ETFs last week. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection One event that has sparked interest, and possibly concern, among Ethereum holders is the reactivation of a dormant whale wallet holding millions worth of ETH. The sudden awakening of this long-inactive address raises questions about a potential selling pressure and its market impact. First Transaction From Dormant ETH Address Since 2015 On-chain tracker Whale Alerts was the first to report the reawakening of a pre-mined Ethereum address that had been inactive for nearly a decade. According to the large on-chain transaction tracker, the wallet, which held 2,000 ETH, initiated its last transaction 9.9 years ago. When the wallet last moved any funds in 2015, the entire stash was worth just $620. Today, that same amount is valued at over $5 million, making the owner’s profit roughly 820x based on current prices. At Ethereum’s all-time high price of $4,878 in 2021, the cryptocurrencies reached an unrealized gain of 1573x. 💤 A dormant pre-mine address containing 2,000 #ETH (5,063,918 USD) has just been activated after 9.9 years (worth 620 USD in 2015)!https://t.co/G0i8Rif0XX — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 14, 2025 The alert by Whale Alerts, which noted the first transaction after 9.9 years, involved the transfer of 0.0001 ETH from the whale address “0xcF26” to address “0x2C12,” which is a newly created ETH address. However, Etherscan’s on-chain transaction data reveals that the whale address sent 500 ETH into the newly created address shortly afterward. Following the string of transaction data from Etherscan shows that these 500 ETH eventually made their way into address “0x28C6,” which is known to be owned and controlled by crypto exchange Binance. This means that the 500 ETH may have already been sold through the exchange or are currently being prepared for liquidation. Brace For Impact: Will The Remaining 1,500 ETH Be Sold? As of now, the original whale address still holds approximately 1,500 ETH, currently valued at $3.796 million. However, it opens up the question of whether the rest of the funds will also be sold. Although we cannot be sure of a planned full liquidation, the pattern of the 500 ETH transfer and the involvement of an exchange address indicate that the possibility cannot be dismissed. Right now, Ethereum is in a fragile price action around the $2,500 price level. If more ETH is offloaded by the whale, the added selling pressure could make it even harder for Ethereum to break out of its current consolidation phase, especially if there isn’t enough buying pressure to absorb the ETH sold off.

Both billionaires are asserting that Bitcoin has the capacity to become the reserve currency of the world. Speaking at this year’s State of Crypto Summit, the Coinbase head highlighted the struggle faced by different governments in their attempt to contain deficit spending. He shares his optimistic outlook for Bitcoin as an alternative currency capable of containing the rise in deficit spending, adding that mass adoption is underway. The crypto billionaire further expressed confidence in this series of events, adding that it could position Bitcoin as a universal reserve currency. “Democracies around the world are really struggling to get their deficit spending under control. I guess my crazy little idea is that I think Bitcoin is going to provide an important check and balance on deficit spending, and if it gets out of control too much, people will flee to it in times of uncertainty, and it could actually end up that Bitcoin is the new reserve currency of the world.” He asserted . Paul Graham, who reacted to Brian Armstrong’s statement, explained that the driving force behind his decision to purchase Bitcoin in its early days was tied to the possibility that it would eventually become a global store of value. “When I first bought some (or at least talked to you about buying some) in 2013, that was the reason: as insurance against it becoming the world’s reserve currency.” He wrote . When asked if his Bitcoin holdings were still intact, he responded in affirmation: “I assume so,” he wrote in a follow-up post. At report time, Bitcoin is valued at $105,566 per coin.

In a long post on Truth Social, the president said he believes both countries “should make a deal, and will make a deal,” and he plans to use American trade to make it happen. He compared it to how he claims he calmed things down between India and Pakistan last month. The method then, Trump said, was straight-up trade leverage. “TRADE with the United States brought reason, cohesion, and sanity,” he posted, calling the leaders he dealt with “excellent” and “able to quickly make a decision and STOP!” Meanwhile, according to a report by Reuters, Trump has already blocked an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Two senior US officials told the outlet that Trump rejected the idea on the grounds that no American had been killed yet. One of them reportedly said, “Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do, we’re not even talking about going after the political leadership.” That veto, paired with Trump’s sudden push for peace, suggests that he wants a deal, not a new war. Trump says Iran and Israel are ready to talk Trump also claimed that talks were already underway, though he didn’t say who was in the room or what was being said. “Many calls and meetings now taking place,” he wrote. He said his work in Serbia and Kosovo, and later Egypt and Ethiopia shows his ability to stop decades-old fights from turning into full-blown wars. “There is peace, at least for now, because of my intervention,” he wrote about the Nile River dispute. He promised the same approach would be used to cool things between Tehran and Tel Aviv, closing with: “MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!” But there’s one problem. That story doesn’t match what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying. Over the weekend, Benjamin told reporters that Israel’s campaign against Iran would intensify. That message goes directly against Trump’s claim that talks are on. But Trump doubled down in an interview with ABC News, saying, “Something like this had to happen… They want to talk, and they will be talking. May have forced a deal to go quicker, actually.” Conflict pushes oil, inflation, and interest rates into chaos zone The fallout from the growing conflict is already blowing through the global economy. If things don’t cool off soon, JP Morgan says oil prices could hit $130 a barrel. That’s high enough to push US inflation from current levels up to 5%, doubling what it is now. That would also delay any possible interest rate cuts this year, something that investors are already pricing in. Every major market that touches oil is bracing. Iran is currently pumping out 3.3 million barrels a day, or about 3.5% of global supply, but it’s not just production that people are watching. The real danger is the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow 21-mile-wide strip of water that handles 20 million barrels per day—almost the exact amount the US uses daily. If Iran locks it down, 88% of Persian Gulf oil exports get stuck. There’s no detour. All Iran has to do is scare Lloyd’s of London, and ships start backing off. That’s why analysts think the question isn’t just about price anymore. The bigger issue is whether global supply chains, built on just-in-time deliveries, can survive this kind of energy shock. Everything depends on the strait staying open. The world bet that it never closes. That bet might fail. Meanwhile, Israel’s inflation rate dropped more than expected in May, landing at 3.1%, below the 3.4% analysts predicted in a Reuters poll. Still, it remains above the government’s 1%-3% target range, and officials are warning that this war could undo any progress. Israel’s central bank blames ongoing supply issues tied to conflict while admitting that local demand is helping keep prices high.

While Ripple supporters expressed excitement over Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 court ruling, which established that the secondary sale of the XRP token does not make the asset a security, it remains uncertain where the case is headed this time. In the most recent development, Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion requesting that $125 million be released from the escrow account, $50 million be distributed to the SEC as settlement costs, and the remaining funds be transferred to Ripple. As market onlookers await the Judge’s decision, Pro-crypto attorney John Deaton has taken to X to provide clarity on what he believes could happen next. Countering claims that he and another pro-crypto attorney Fred Rispoli wanted the SEC to suck up to Anilsa Torres’ with its most recent filing, he made the following remark ; “That’s not it. In fact, I believe there’s a 70% chance she grants the relief requested, and I’ll discuss it more in detail tomorrow. What I was expecting wasn’t ass kissing. And know, I’m not being super critical of the lawyers who filed it. They’re much more experienced than I am in these matters and experience is the greatest teacher in life. In fact, the lawyer who signed on behalf of Ripple is a former SEC Director of Enforcement.” He detailed his expectations for the regulator’s lawyers, explaining that he had hoped that the regulator would acknowledge the role of the former leadership in what he regards as an over-surveillance of the crypto industry. The attorney laid out his expectations for the attorneys behind Ripple, stating that the crypto firm failed to highlight the disadvantages that new regulatory policies could have on the broader crypto market, despite the current court order placing competitor firms like Circle miles ahead of Ripple. Despite maintaining that the joint motion is more likely to be granted than it is to be rejected, Deaton remains convinced that a stronger case should have been made to “get a [the] judge to rescind her ruling that she firmly believes (whether right or wrong) is consistent with existing law instead of assuming she’ll grant it because you cite a couple cases for her to hang her hat on to grant it – IF she so chooses.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-15 17:35:57

The company announced that as of June 17, 2025, 03:00 (UTC+3), trading volumes between Alpha tokens will no longer be included in the Alpha Score calculation. This decision comes after some Alpha tokens, such as ZKJ and KOGE, experienced high price fluctuations recently. Binance explained that this volatility was caused by large investors withdrawing on-chain liquidity and the subsequent liquidation chain. The company stated that this change was implemented to protect fair competition in the market, ensure stability and reduce systemic risks that may arise from excessive concentration.

Here’s the Destination,https://timestabloid.com/coinbase-abruptly-moved-26-89m-xrp-heres-the-destination/,"In a significant on-chain development, Coinbase has moved 26.89 million XRP from its cold storage wallet to an institutional wallet tagged DT:1. The transfer, first flagged by crypto analyst Xaif on X, has triggered widespread speculation within the XRP community about what may be unfolding behind the scenes. Such large-scale movements are rarely random and often precede major institutional actions, particularly when they involve cold wallets, typically reserved for long-term asset storage. Institutional Wallet Activity Raises Eyebrows Cold wallets are designed to hold digital assets offline, reducing the risk of hacks and theft. Moving nearly 27 million XRP, worth over $58 million at current prices, from a cold wallet to an institutional address suggests a change in intent. Rather than simply storing these tokens, Coinbase may be preparing them for deployment in trading operations or over-the-counter (OTC) deals. XRP Demand Surge? Coinbase just moved 26.89M $XRP from its cold wallet to institutional wallet (DT:1) This kind of transfer often hints at rising institutional interest or upcoming trading activity. Something big brewing? #XRP pic.twitter.com/fKK3r5GWU9 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 15, 2025 The destination wallet, tagged DT:1, is widely understood to be part of Coinbase’s infrastructure for serving institutional clients. These wallets are not used for routine retail transactions; they’re typically reserved for facilitating large-volume transfers and fulfilling liquidity demands from hedge funds, market makers, and high-net-worth clients. This strongly suggests that institutional demand for XRP may be on the rise. What This Could Mean for XRP Xaif’s post highlighting the transaction has sparked curiosity about a potential price breakout or major institutional onboarding. Historically, large-scale transfers of XRP to institutional wallets have preceded major developments, such as partnership announcements, liquidity expansions, or the rollout of new financial products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although Coinbase has not issued an official statement regarding the purpose of the transfer, the move aligns with patterns seen in other cryptocurrencies just before heightened trading activity or strategic product launches. Coinbase may be preparing XRP liquidity to meet rising institutional demand or upcoming market events that require readily available assets. Final Thoughts While blockchain activity alone cannot confirm intent, it often offers early signals. The abrupt movement of 26.89 million XRP from a secure cold wallet to a known institutional address indicates that Coinbase is positioning for something beyond routine operations. Whether this leads to increased market activity, a new wave of institutional adoption, or both, remains to be seen. As Xaif aptly put it in his post, “Something big brewing?”—the signs certainly suggest so. The coming days will reveal whether this was merely a strategic reserve allocation or the beginning of a much larger institutional move into XRP.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $81 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $241.53 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $20.18 Market Cap $739.23Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $70.59 Million Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $20.52 24-h Low $19.86 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) $15.36 (-24.74%) 50-Day SMA $ 20.65 14-Day RSI 41.03 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $21.04 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: ENS under pressure: technical indicators signal further downside risk across timeframes TL;DR Breakdown : ENS is trading below mid-Bollinger Bands on both the 4-hour and daily charts, indicating bearish momentum RSI and MACD show weakening strength with sellers maintaining control across timeframes A drop below the $19.10 support level could lead to further downside unless a strong recovery emerges Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENS/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on June 15, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is exhibiting mild bearish momentum. The price has dropped below the mid-Bollinger Band at $21.43 and is currently hovering near $20.12, approaching the lower band around $19.18. This positioning suggests continued downward pressure unless a strong bounce occurs. The RSI stands at 43.88, reflecting weakening bullish momentum and indicating that sellers are gradually gaining control. If ENS fails to hold above the lower Bollinger Band, the price may slide toward the $16.00 support zone. A reversal would require a decisive break above the mid-band and an RSI move above 50. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENS/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is under bearish pressure. Price action has slipped below the mid-Bollinger Band ($20.61) and is nearing the lower band at $19.10, indicating downside continuation. The MACD line is in negative territory with a bearish crossover, while the Balance of Power is at -0.41, suggesting sellers are in control. If ENS breaks below the $19.10 support, further decline toward $18.00 or lower is likely. Any recovery would require a strong move above $20.61 with increasing volume. Until then, the short-term outlook remains bearish with limited signs of reversal. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $20.13 BUY SMA 5 $21.33 BUY SMA 10 $22.14 BUY SMA 21 $ 21.45 BUY SMA 50 $18.44 BUY SMA 100 $ 19.58 BUY SMA 200 $21.92 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 20.40 BUY EMA 5 $18.95 BUY EMA 10 $ 17.40 BUY EMA 21 $16.96 BUY EMA 50 $19.04 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.17 BUY EMA 200 $23.59 SELL What to expect from ENS? Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a bearish outlook. On the 1-day chart, the price has fallen below the mid-Bollinger Band ($21.43) and approaches lower support at $19.18, while the RSI at 43.88 suggests fading momentum. The 4-hour chart confirms this weakness, with price hovering just above $20.12 and MACD in negative territory, indicating continued selling pressure. The Balance of Power also favors bears. If support at $19.10–$19.18 fails, further downside toward $18.00 is likely. A bullish reversal would require reclaiming the mid-Bollinger zones with volume and RSI crossing above 50. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $100.37 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $241.53 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Name Service ENS Users Can Now Display Their .eth Names Across Web3 Apps Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has introduced an easy way for users to personalize their web3 identity by setting a primary ENS name—such as yourname.eth —instead of the default hexadecimal address. Users can do this by visiting app.ens.domains , selecting their preferred name, and confirming the update in their wallet. Once set, platforms like Uniswap, OpenSea, and Etherscan will display the user’s ENS name in place of the wallet address. Only one primary name can be linked per address, and while not necessary for transactions, it enhances user visibility across ENS-supported platforms. Want wallets or dapps to show yourname.eth instead of a 0x? → Go to https://t.co/5tArNzDa07 and choose your preferred name → Click “Set as primary name” → Confirm in your wallet Now every ENS-enabled wallet and dapp displays yourname.eth, not the hex. pic.twitter.com/11TzqzoGvi — ens.eth (@ensdomains) June 3, 2025 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has been integrated into SheFi’s curriculum, empowering Cohort 13’s 3,000+ members to personalize their crypto experience.

As investor interest continues to surge, two crypto presales have come into sharp focus: Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) and Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP) . Each offers distinctive paths forward, representing fundamentally different approaches to investing, decentralization, and long-term market engagement. Discerning investors need to carefully evaluate the underlying strengths, governance frameworks, liquidity structures, and symbolic messaging of each project to identify which offers the most robust potential. Symbolic Power and Narrative Appeal—Traditional Optimism vs. Revolutionary Vision Bitcoin Bull presents a straightforward narrative of traditional market optimism, leveraging bullish sentiments deeply rooted in Bitcoin’s historic performance. This simplicity and familiarity resonate with investors seeking secure, predictable associations, banking on Bitcoin’s proven market appeal and emotional resonance. Conversely, Neo Pepe Protocol boldly positions itself as a Revolutionary Crypto project through its distinctive narrative, the Memetrix. It emphasizes decentralization, rebellion against systemic financial oppression, and rejection of market saturation. Investors in Neo Pepe are not merely participating financially but are part of a significant cultural and economic movement. This visionary symbolism attracts those seeking impactful change alongside substantial financial returns. Presale Dynamics and Liquidity Strategies—Balancing Urgency with Stability Presale structures significantly influence investor decisions. Bitcoin Bull’s traditional, predictable approach offers minimal urgency, potentially limiting initial momentum and growth. Neo Pepe Protocol, however, employs a meticulously structured presale designed to amplify investor engagement and urgency: 16-Stage Escalation : Incrementally increasing token prices from $0.05 to $0.16, incentivizing swift investor action. Hourly Token Unlocking Post-Launch : Gradual token releases maintain sustained market engagement and prevent oversaturation. Additionally, Neo Pepe’s sophisticated auto-liquidity mechanism directly addresses volatility and enhances stability: Auto-Liquidity Generation : Every transaction contributes a 2.5% boost to liquidity pools. LP Token Burn : Immediate burning of liquidity provider tokens permanently locks liquidity, significantly stabilizing the asset. These combined presale dynamics and liquidity measures position Neo Pepe as a safer, yet aggressively growth-oriented investment opportunity, appealing especially to those prioritizing risk mitigation. Decentralized Governance—Investor Empowerment and Transparency Robust governance structures foster investor confidence and project integrity. Bitcoin Bull’s governance model remains opaque, potentially limiting investor insight and influence. Neo Pepe Protocol, in contrast, offers a comprehensive, transparent decentralized governance model designed explicitly to empower investors: Delegated Voting Power : Investors actively influence decisions through token delegation. Transparent Treasury Management : Community-driven oversight eliminates misuse concerns, ensuring funds are appropriately allocated. Mandatory Timelock for Decisions : Deliberate decision-making periods reinforce accountability and investor trust. This governance approach distinctly positions Neo Pepe as a compelling choice for investors demanding transparency, active participation, and collective stewardship. Comparative Market Context and Investor Outlook Amid a competitive presale environment featuring projects like Solaxy (SOLX), Antix (ANTIX), and Catslap (SLAP), Neo Pepe’s meticulous attention to liquidity, presale strategy, and governance transparency significantly differentiates it. This careful consideration distinctly surpasses Bitcoin Bull’s more conventional narrative and simpler tokenomics. For seasoned crypto investors, Neo Pepe Protocol clearly stands out by blending visionary symbolism, strategic presale momentum, innovative liquidity management, and transparent governance. These compelling elements not only minimize typical early-stage risks but also maximize long-term project viability and investor confidence. Conclusion—Why Neo Pepe Emerges as the Superior Investment Choice Ultimately, comparing Bitcoin Bull and Neo Pepe Protocol highlights stark contrasts in narrative depth, liquidity strategies, presale dynamics, and governance transparency. Bitcoin Bull’s straightforward, familiar approach provides initial comfort but lacks essential sophistication and investor empowerment crucial for sustained success. Neo Pepe Protocol emerges decisively as the smarter, more robust investment opportunity, uniquely combining ideological strength with operational stability and investor-focused governance. For investors seeking meaningful long-term value and active participation in a genuinely transformative project, Neo Pepe Protocol stands as a clear frontrunner, marking a significant step forward in crypto empowerment and decentralization. Investors interested in participating in this groundbreaking project should consider securing their tokens early by visiting Neo Pepe’s presale page—act now to join the forefront of crypto innovation and decentralization.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-15 18:06:02

This article highlights the most impactful price movements and explores which tokens appear poised for notable growth. These insights could offer valuable clues for crypto investors looking to navigate the market's next phases. Here's a closer look at the top movers. AB Coin Shows Explosive Growth Amid Altcoin Season AB recorded impressive gains in the past month and six months. The coin saw an increase of 105.55% over the last month, shifting minor movements into strong upward momentum. Over the past six months, AB experienced an extraordinary rise of 20,802.76%, indicating a strong and persistent bullish trend. A weekly increase of 47.65% further boosted confidence among traders and long-term holders. This performance demonstrates the coin’s capacity for rapid growth and highlights its attractiveness during a thriving altcoin season. AB’s current price moves between $0.0043 and $0.0116, with immediate resistance at $0.015 and another at $0.0223. The nearest support level sits around $0.0004, establishing a price floor at zero. The RSI reading of 78.64 indicates the asset may be overbought, but recent gains suggest bullish sentiment remains strong. The Momentum Indicator shows steady upward pressure, and traders should monitor movements between these key levels. A breakout above $0.015 could stimulate new buying, while a retreat below $0.0043 may present chances for long positions on pullbacks. The market currently lacks a definitive long-term trend, resulting in oscillating price actions. Uniswap Market Outlook: Rally Amid Long-Term Lows Recent UNI performance shows a one-month gain of nearly 16% with a brisk weekly increase of 13.5%, contrasting sharply with a six-month decline of over 55%. Price strength in the short term appears to be at work despite the daunting long-term trend, adding a note of optimism tempered by substantial losses over the past half-year. Current levels show prices trading between $4.62 and $7.58, facing nearby resistance at $9.12 and support at $3.20, with a key secondary resistance at $12.08 and a much lower support near $0.239. The market lacks a clear trend, as momentum indicators remain modest with an RSI close to 54, indicating a balanced yet indecisive state. Traders might look to capitalize on short-term movements by watching for bounce indications at $3.20 and potential breakouts near $9.12. Cautious entry and exit points are suggested until clearer volume and trend indicators emerge. Jito's Market Snapshot: Bullish Week Amid Six-Month Decline Last month showed modest gains with a weekly increase of nearly 8% and a monthly rise of over 4%. Six months ago, the coin suffered a steep drop of nearly 43%, marking a significant downtrend over this longer period. Price changes have been volatile, with short-term resilience offset by long-term weakness. The history reflects periods of recovery following major declines, while recent small upward moves hint at possible stabilization after an extended phase of bearish pressure. JITO 's current price range between $1.35 and $2.11 is shaping the battle between buyers and sellers. Immediate support lies near one $1.06, while resistance is tested around $2.56, with a secondary resistance near $3.32 and lower support at $0.30. The weekly gain of almost 8% signals that bulls are pushing in the short term, but low oscillator recommendations and a relative strength index of fifty-three suggest that the trend remains mixed and uncertain. Trading within these levels may involve watching a bounce at the support area or a breakthrough above the key resistance levels. Conclusion Over the past week, AB saw a significant rise, showcasing strong investor interest. UNI experienced steady growth, likely due to recent updates and positive sentiment. JTO had a minor dip but remained stable overall. These movements presented a mixed but largely positive trend for the crypto market, indicating cautious optimism.

This week, both coins displayed remarkable swings, but one emerged slightly stronger than the other. The article delves into the numbers, trends, and future potential, leaving the question: which coin is better poised for growth? Curious minds will find the answer within. Solana's Decline: Price Trends and Current Levels Solana experienced a notable decline over the last month, falling by around 13.54%, and a more significant drop of roughly 32.38% over the past six months. Price movements were characterized by steady losses as market sentiment turned negative, leading to continued selling pressure and a weakening outlook. The trend has been marked by a series of lower highs and lower lows, which accentuates the challenges for bullish sentiment to regain footing in recent periods. Currently, Solana is trading within a range between approximately $136 and $182, with key support near $115.84 that might act as a short-term base. Immediate resistance appears around $207.90, while a higher resistance level at $253.93 could hinder any sustained rally. Bearish momentum is indicated by the Awesome Oscillator at -11.638; however, the Momentum Indicator shows a slight positive reading of 1.86. The RSI at 39.86 suggests oversold conditions but remains below neutral. Traders may consider buying near support with tight stops or wait for a breakout above resistance to initiate long positions. Ethereum Market Trends and Key Price Levels Ethereum saw modest movement over the past month, with a slight drop reflecting short-term choppiness. Over the last six months, the decline has been more pronounced, indicating longer-term downward pressure that has influenced investor sentiment. The trading range in the most recent week hovered between approximately $1924 and $2962, suggesting that volatility is contained within a defined band despite broader bearish trends observed over the half-year period. Current pricing presents a scenario marked by critical support and resistance levels. Key support is established around $1319, while resistance comes in at approximately $3395, with a secondary resistance near $4434 and a lower level of secondary support at $280. The market shows no definitive trend, as indicators maintain balance. Bulls face the challenge of breaking above resistance for a bullish turn, while bears can exploit weakness below support. Trading ideas include buying on dips near support and considering profit-taking if prices rise to the first resistance level. Conclusion This week, SOL showed greater price swings compared to ETH . Both assets experienced notable movements, but SOL demonstrated more pronounced volatility. ETH remained relatively steady, showing smaller fluctuations in comparison. This analysis reveals that SOL took the lead in terms of volatility. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Focused on assets like gold, a multi-trillion-dollar market, Kaanch is capturing investor attention with its presale momentum and technological edge. Positioned to outpace established blockchains, Kaanch offers a compelling opportunity for those seeking high-growth investments in the evolving crypto market. Solana’s $200 Comeback Lags Behind Kaanch’s Explosive Potential Solana, trading at $145.84 with a 0.66% daily dip from its early 2025 peak of $260, is poised for a potential recovery to $200, driven by its robust DeFi ecosystem and 65,000 TPS capacity. However, Solana’s history of network outages and centralization concerns has sparked interest in alternatives. Kaanch Network, with superior scalability and reliability, is emerging as a stronger contender, offering investors a chance to capitalize on a platform designed for the future of decentralized finance. Kaanch’s 19800% Surge to $63: A Must-Buy Before It Skyrockets Kaanch Network, currently in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.32 per token, is projected to surge 19800% to $63 following its Bitmart listing at $30. With over $2,193,177 raised and a limited supply of 58 million tokens, the presale is moving quickly, with the next stage price doubling to $0.64. Investors can purchase tokens using ETH or USDT, earning up to 30% APY through live staking. Kaanch’s focus on gold tokenization, a multi-trillion-dollar market, positions it as a top Layer 1 blockchain, surpassing Solana’s recovery potential. Investors eager to seize this opportunity should head to the Kaanch presale website and buy into the fast-moving presale before prices climb. Outpacing Solana: Kaanch’s Unrivaled Speed and Scalability Kaanch Network offers a mind-blowing 1.4 million TPS and 0.8-second finality, which is far beyond what Solana can offer. Kaanch is supported by 3,600 decentralized nodes, which makes it safe and fast to execute transactions, making it suitable to support high-frequency trading and enterprise-level applications. It has almost zero gas fees, which makes it affordable to dApps, microtransactions, and payments, providing a developer-friendly platform that will lead to mass adoption. Kaanch infrastructure is audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, making it the most reliable blockchain to use by businesses and developers. Gold Tokenization: Kaanch’s Trillion-Dollar Edge Over Solana The fact that Kaanch is focused on real-world assets tokenization, starting with gold, opens a multi-trillion-dollar market, providing businesses and individuals with safe and fast transactions. In contrast to Solana, where the main focus is on DeFi applications, Kaanch interoperability with other blockchains, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain, enables regulated DeFi and digital identity applications. The project has a community-based governance and an easy-to-use staking dashboard, which puts the power in the hands of token holders, contributing to long-term development. As an investor, Kaanch is a must-have in your portfolio before it lists on BitMart and increases its presence in the market. BitMart Listing at $30: Don’t Miss Kaanch’s Meteoric Rise The upcoming BitMart listing of Kaanch’s KNCH token at $30 is set to propel its value and visibility, making it a critical moment for investors. With a projected 19800% surge to $63, Kaanch outshines Solana’s recovery trajectory, offering unmatched growth potential. Its technical superiority, audited contracts, and focus on gold tokenization position it as a top Layer 1 blockchain. Investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity should head to the Kaanch presale website and buy into the fast-moving presale to secure tokens at $0.32 before the listing drives prices higher.

These conflicts often inject short-term volatility across traditional and crypto markets, and Ethereum is no exception. While ETH has held relatively steady above $2,500 in recent weeks, the growing fear in macro markets is beginning to surface in price structure and sentiment shifts. This is a sensitive moment for traders: ETH sits on the edge of a critical range, and what happens next may hinge as much on external events as technical factors. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Ethereum’s daily chart shows a clear rejection from the $2,800 resistance area, which also aligns with the 200-day moving average and a bearish order block. After a strong relief rally from the $1,500 region earlier this quarter, ETH consolidated in an ascending channel pattern but is now likely to break below the lower trendline of that channel. This structure typically signals exhaustion in bullish momentum, especially when the market fails to push higher despite favorable short-term setups. The RSI has also dropped back under the 50 mark, reflecting bearish momentum. The price is now re-entering the mid-range zone, between $2,800 and $2,150. If Ethereum fails to reclaim $2,800 soon, the door will open for a possible move back toward the $2,150 support level, which coincides with the 100-day moving average and the top of the last major accumulation range. A bounce from there would be critical to preserve the broader bullish bias in recent months. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4H chart, the asset has broken down from the ascending channel it had been respecting for weeks. The rejection from the $2,800 order block created a sharp drop that left behind an imbalance (FVG) near the $2,600 zone, currently acting as short-term resistance. The structure now resembles a potential distribution phase, particularly if the price breaks below the channel without fresh buying pressure. The RSI also remains weak, hovering just below 50, and shows no signs of bullish divergence. There is also a notable lack of volume on recent bounces, suggesting that demand is drying up as macro uncertainty looms. If the channel breakdown occurs, ETH could retrace toward the $2,300 demand zone. Holding that area would be crucial, as losing it could invite a deeper correction toward $2,100, where stronger bullish interest likely awaits. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest (OI) on Ethereum derivatives has briefly reached its highest point over the past couple of years, exceeding $21B, before experiencing a marginal drop due to the liquidity caused by the tensions in the Middle East. What makes this development even more interesting is that this surge in OI is occurring while ETH is trading significantly lower than it did the last time OI was this elevated. This divergence typically signals a buildup of leveraged positions—both long and short—that are yet to be flushed out of the system. Historically, such OI-price divergence often precedes large-scale liquidation events. If the market can’t generate a clean breakout soon, a volatility spike triggered by the unwinding of over-leveraged positions could happen. This aligns with the growing geopolitical risk, which could catalyze a fast repricing if global investors move to risk-off assets. In other words, derivatives are flashing a warning. Even if the price looks calm, the undercurrent is anything but stable.

A Divergence Analysis,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/why-is-avalanche-avax-struggling-at-resistance-while-aave-finds-strong-support-below-a-divergence-analysis,"Avalanche faces hurdles at key levels, while AAVE shows resilience just below them. This piece delves into the contrasting performances of two prominent cryptocurrencies. The analysis will explore factors influencing AVAX's struggles and AAVE's robust support, revealing insights into potential growth opportunities for investors. Avalanche Price Trend: Past Decline and Present Key Trading Levels Avalanche experienced a marked decline over the past month, falling nearly 19.14% losing 8.04% in the past week. Over a six-month period, AVAX dropped a significant 61.17%, reflecting sizable bearish pressure. The price has shown volatility during this period with consistent downward movements. This performance highlights challenges faced by the coin in recent market cycles, emphasizing the impact of broader bearish trends on its price stability. Avalanche is currently trading within a defined range between $17.67 and $25.40, with immediate focus on the $29.98 resistance level and $14.52 support level. The Awesome Oscillator reading suggests ongoing downward influence, while the momentum indicator shows a slight indication of positive pressure. A Relative Strength Index of 39.14 indicates caution without being overtly oversold. No definitive trend is currently observed, as the price oscillates within established limits. Traders might consider entering near the $14.52 support level for stabilization signs, while the $29.98 resistance may serve as an exit point for short positions. Aave Market Snapshot: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Last month saw a notable upward movement with prices climbing by roughly 22.57% even as the coin registered a six-month decline near 27.96%. The coin experienced a modest one-week increase of 6.05%, indicating a recent burst in buying interest. The numbers show a clear short-term rebound that contrasts with the longer-term negative trend. AAVE current price sits within a range of roughly $179 to $298.70, with a significant support level identified at about $111.81. Resistance is observed at around $350.42 with a second barrier at approximately $469.73, which traders should consider for planning exits or entries. Short-term momentum indicators suggest bulls have taken control recently. However, the mixed trend indicates that neither bulls nor bears are fully dominant. Trading ideas involve watching for a sustained move above resistance or considering purchases near the support level if a pullback occurs. Conclusion AVAX is currently facing difficulty moving past its resistance level, leading to slower growth. On the other hand, AAVE finds strong support just below its resistance, showing more stability and upward momentum. The differences in their price movements highlight the varying investor sentiment and market conditions affecting each coin. This divergence suggests that while AVAX may encounter more hurdles, AAVE has a better foundation for potential growth. Both assets show unique challenges and opportunities in the current market landscape. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Despite bullish sentiment surrounding Binance Coin (BNB), many investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a decentralized lending protocol whose presale rally is drawing high volumes and delivering a faster return path for early supporters. With more than $10.55 million already raised in Phase 5 and over 12,000 holders onboarded, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering the kind of momentum many expected from more established tokens. The passive income mechanism that sets MUTM apart Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers something Binance Coin (BNB) does not—an ecosystem designed for decentralized, user-controlled lending that pays interest from actual borrower activity. Through two distinct models—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—users can generate passive income in ways that reflect their risk appetite and preferred strategy. In the P2C model, tokens like Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL) can be deposited into liquidity pools. As borrowing demand rises, the pool utilization increases, automatically lifting the APY for depositors. This is not hypothetical yield—this is income drawn directly from borrower interest paid on overcollateralized loans. For those who want more control and higher returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to participate in direct P2P lending. This model lets users lend under self-defined terms, including to borrowers using meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Pepe (PEPE)—assets that are usually neglected on centralized platforms. The flexibility here makes passive income generation not only accessible but scalable for active DeFi participants. At the current price of $0.03 per token, a $5,000 investment into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) equates to 166,666 tokens. If the price increases 30x—a figure that aligns with the traction and utility being built into the protocol—that same investment becomes worth $150,000. This level of return is attracting capital from projects where short-term gains are no longer guaranteed. While Binance Coin (BNB) remains a dominant force in crypto, investors chasing faster and higher returns are positioning into early-stage protocols like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where the growth curve is only beginning. mtTokens: liquidity and utility on demand Depositors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) receive mtTokens—a representation of their original deposit plus any interest accrued. For instance, depositing DAI earns mtDAI at a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens offer immediate liquidity and can be traded on secondary exchanges or reused as collateral within the Mutuum ecosystem. This functionality goes beyond traditional staking, enabling opportunities for reinvestment and income generation. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) expands its features, mtTokens will remain integral to the platform, allowing users to access liquidity and explore additional opportunities, such as using mtTokens as collateral to pursue new market strategies within the protocol. MUTM is the native utility token of the protocol. It is tightly connected to the success of the platform’s ecosystem. Users will benefit from the protocol’s profit-sharing model, where part of the revenue generated is used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This reward mechanism ensures long-term holding incentives while creating continuous buy pressure that supports price appreciation. Besides token buybacks, the team plans to redirect profits toward marketing, platform enhancements, and pool growth—all factors that reinforce the protocol’s flywheel. With a total token supply of 4,000,000,000 and a listing price of $0.06, early-phase holders stand to benefit significantly from both capital appreciation and yield opportunities. Upcoming launches, stablecoin innovation and layer-2 speed According to the Mutuum roadmap, a beta version of the platform is scheduled to go live around the time of the token listing. The protocol is also being developed with Layer-2 integration to ensure fast, low-cost transactions. This eliminates common friction points found in many DeFi platforms today and significantly improves the user experience. For traders and lenders accustomed to network congestion and high gas fees, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a much-needed technical advantage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not stopping at lending. The development of a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin will further enrich the ecosystem. Minted directly from on-chain collateral already within the protocol, this stablecoin will ensure full transparency and algorithmic balance without relying on fiat reserves. By combining transparent asset backing with programmatic supply adjustments, the stablecoin will offer borrowers a more stable and reliable option. At the same time, it opens up new opportunities for MUTM users to interact with a broader set of financial tools under the same DeFi umbrella. Security, compliance, and market confidence To support long-term confidence, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol has executed a CertiK audit. This audit included both static analysis and manual review, with a token scan score of 80.00. As regulatory clarity becomes a make-or-break factor for new DeFi entrants, Mutuum’s structured approach—including the formation of a dedicated legal and compliance team—further separates it from competitors rushing products to market without safeguards. Adding to the momentum is the ongoing $100K giveaway , which is drawing new participants and creating awareness around the project’s core utilities. With over 12,000 holders already onboard and tens of thousands actively following the presale updates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building more than a protocol—it is building a community-backed financial alternative. With a growing user base, clear roadmap, and deep utility, MUTM offers faster payback, stronger income mechanics, and an ecosystem engineered for growth. As capital begins rotating toward projects offering both innovation and returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands ready to lead.

Before the crash, ZKJ was trading at $1.90. It then nosedived 83% to around $0.32 as of press time, marking one of the steepest single-day drops for any major cryptocurrency project this year. The sell-off slashed Polyhedra’s market cap to just $93.8 million, an 83.7% collapse. ZKJ one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap How ZKJ crash unfolded According to on-chain data , the crash was triggered by a series of coordinated moves involving several large wallets. Liquidity was quietly drained from the ZKJ/KOGE trading pairs in the hours before the event. Traders began swapping KOGE for ZKJ, only to dump ZKJ back into the market immediately. Six whale wallets were at the storm’s center, offloading over 5.23 million ZKJ for $9.66 million. The sudden liquidity exit and intense selling pressure tanked the price, triggering a wave of forced liquidations across trading platforms. ZKJ whale transaction analysis. Source: Lookonchain In total, more than $99 million in ZKJ long positions were wiped out, accounting for 81.3% of all crypto liquidations. At least six individual traders were liquidated for more than $1 million each. Suggestions indicate the crash might have stemmed from a “perfect storm” of vulnerabilities, including front-running ahead of scheduled token unlocks, a mass exit by airdrop farmers cashing out, and widespread panic as the token’s price structure unraveled. In the aftermath, members of the 48 Club DAO, the creators of KOGE, blamed the meltdown on poor management. Outrage erupted across social media, with users demanding accountability and claiming they were “rugged from both sides.” $ZKJ nuked 85% in under an hour. $40M spread across insider wallets.

Investors and traders are now keenly watching for potential big moves. Will these digital currencies break out or continue to hover? Find out which of these coins could be primed for future growth in this detailed analysis. XRP Price Insight: Trends, Levels, and Trading Ideas XRP dropped by around 9.78% over the past month and saw a cumulative decline of 13.37% across the last six months. The price behavior has remained generally weak with a steady downward drift that hints at ongoing market caution. Price adjustments during these periods signal fading momentum and a lack of strong upward pressure. Market participants have witnessed a consistent trend of losses, suggesting that the coin may continue to face downward challenges until renewed buying support emerges. The coin currently trades between $1.95 and $2.53, with critical technical levels drawing interest from both sides. The closest resistance near $2.88 stands as a key barrier, while the immediate support level at about $1.73 acts as a price floor. A slightly negative Awesome Oscillator reading and an RSI around 42.99 depict a market at a crossroads. Bulls have room to push if the coin breaks above $2.88, whereas bearish traders may target a pullback toward the $1.73 support zone. Trading ideas include monitoring these levels closely; a confirmed move above resistance could signal a rally, while a drop beneath support might indicate a deeper dip. Cardano (ADA) Faces Persistent Bearish Trends Amid Range-Bound Activity Over the past month, ADA has declined by 17.454% and shows a total drop of 41.651% over the last six months. Price movements have largely ranged from $0.597 to $0.819, indicating ongoing downward pressure. Indicators such as a negative Awesome Oscillator and an RSI near 37.080 highlight weak performance. A slight tick up from the momentum indicator at 0.002 has not significantly changed the prevailing bearish signals. Overall, this period illustrates a coin struggling to gain traction, with market participants remaining cautious amid adjustments. Currently, ADA trades within a defined range between $0.597 and $0.819. Immediate levels include resistance at $0.952 and support at $0.508, with secondary resistance at $1.174 and lower support around $0.286. Bears dominate the environment, with the moving average recommendation at -0.8 suggesting caution. There is no clear trend, prompting traders to explore short-term range trading. Strategies might involve selling near the upper boundary or seeking entry signals from established support, while any decisive movement beyond these levels could provide clearer direction in a market leaning towards sellers. Conclusion XRP and ADA have shown minimal price changes over the past week. The stability may suggest an upcoming shift as traders anticipate new movements. Current market conditions remain a central focus for both cryptocurrencies. Market watchers are closely monitoring these coins for potential breakout signals. It is crucial to pay attention to any shifts in volume and interest, which could indicate imminent changes in their respective prices. Both XRP and ADA have strong communities and technology backing them, making them notable assets to observe closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But while BTC dominates headlines, it’s a little-known altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , that’s sending the biggest shockwaves through crypto communities. Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is quickly emerging as the top token of summer 2025, with early buyers chasing what analysts are calling a potential of getting to $2. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 12,000 investors have bought the token along with a total raise of $10.6 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is launched at $0.06. As traders search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 or what to buy before June ends, Mutuum Finance is becoming the breakout story of the season. Bitcoin Eyes New Highs Backed by Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains steady, trading around $107,803, with intraday highs near $110,277 and lows around $107,491. Institutional demand is driving the narrative, large inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury purchases continue to support BTC’s bullish outlook. Technical indicators suggest Bitcoin is carving out a bullish breakout, with its recent bull flag formation and a golden cross between the 50- and 200-day moving averages pointing toward a potential retest of its May peak near $112,000. Analysts from firms such as Bitwise and Bernstein have issued conservative 2025 targets of $200,000, citing macroeconomic tailwinds like easing inflation and further ETF expansion. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Past $10.6M Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum in presale. Phase 5 of the presale is surging as investors rush to grab tokens at just $0.03 before the next price hike, and with good reason. While meme coins come and go, Mutuum Finance is built on real fundamentals, real innovation, and real staying power. With over 12,000 early adopters already in and $10.6 million raised, this isn’t just hype, it’s a full-blown movement. At this price, Phase 5 is the final window to get in cheap. The next presale round jumps to $0.035, and the token is set to launch at $0.06, meaning investors who move now could lock in a 100% return before launch even begins. $100K Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance is rewarding early entry with token value and giving back in a big way. The project is running a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky investors will each walk away with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 MUTM holders are also being rewarded with exclusive bonus tokens in a competitive, real-time leaderboard that adds gamified excitement to the investment process. Mutuum Finance is also rewriting the DeFi rulebook with its hybrid lending protocol, a powerful fusion of peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. Last Call Before Prices Climb The momentum is real, and the presale is moving fast. With a fast-growing investor base, a clear roadmap, and serious innovation, Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the biggest DeFi breakouts of 2025. If you wait until the price hits $0.035 or watch it launch at $0.06, you’ll be chasing gains instead of securing them. Act now. Join the early believers. And don’t miss your shot at exponential returns, leaderboard rewards, and a shot at $10K in free tokens. Claim your MUTM tokens before the next price hike hits.

46084600,https://crypto.news/?p=14387574,1750012200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/46084600.jpeg,Quantum Countdown: How Bitcoin’s 15-year shield faces its biggest threat yet,https://crypto.news/quantum-countdown-bitcoins-15-year-shield-faces-threat/,"The Bitcoin network has been safe and stable for 15 years. However, elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC, was created in 1985 to protect Bitcoin, and concerns about its soon-to-be obsolescence intensify each year. The emerging technology of quantum computers challenges the network’s security. Crypto.news discussed the future of Bitcoin in the post-quantum era with Kapil Dhiman, the CEO of Quranium, a Layer 1 blockchain protocol optimized for post-quantum security, AI integration, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. How did you realize that quantum computers are a threat, and when did you start dedicating most of your time to finding a solution? Dhiman : During my consulting days at PwC, I began to see a recurring blind spot: quantum computing. While most of the industry was focused on scaling and interoperability, few seriously considered the existential threat that quantum computers pose to current cryptographic infrastructure, including blockchain. Early on, I realized that this wasn’t just a theoretical risk sitting decades away. The pace of advancement, especially with quantum advantage edging closer, meant that we needed to act now, not after the breach. By late 2023, it was clear to me that the digital world as we know it, from DeFi to identity systems, could be compromised without quantum-proof infrastructure. In early 2024, I joined forces with Zeeshan and Yaduvendra to co-found Quranium , a new Layer 1 built from the ground up to be quantum-secure, AI-native, and ready to protect the next era of the internet. Since then, this mission has been my whole focus. We’re not just building a blockchain. We’re building the digital shield for everything that’s coming next. What exactly is a Q-Day? How much time do we have? Dhiman : Q-Day is the term we use for the moment quantum computers become powerful enough to break widely used cryptographic systems, including RSA, ECC, and the algorithms securing most blockchains and online banking today. But unlike Y2K, it won’t be a neatly marked day on the calendar. It could happen quietly; a breakthrough in a lab, or worse, behind closed doors in the hands of adversaries. We might only realise it’s happened after the damage is done. That’s what makes it so dangerous: there’s no global countdown clock ticking toward Q-Day. So how much time do we have? That’s the unknown. Some estimates suggest by 2030. But even before the hardware arrives, the threat is real, thanks to “store now, decrypt later” (SNDL) strategies. Encrypted data is already being harvested today, just waiting for quantum power to catch up. The consequences could be enormous. Take Bitcoin: it’s acutely vulnerable. As I mentioned recently in WIRED , the only viable fix would be a hard fork, requiring 51% consensus across the network and a coordinated migration of funds. If quantum capability lands before that happens, Bitcoin could collapse overnight. It’s a ticking time bomb. You might also like: Exclusive: Crypto exchange ZBX aims to defeat ‘Q-Day’ with Naoris tech People who read about the crypto sector every day, usually associate the threat of quantum computing with cracking their wallets. But this threat stretches to other sectors as well. If the problem is ignored, can we see the banking system getting critically damaged? Or lots of personal data from messengers and social media platforms freely floating online? AI-backed systems going crazy and stuff like that? What is the worst scenario? Dhiman : You’re absolutely right. Most people in crypto worry about quantum cracking their wallets, but the threat goes far beyond that. If we ignore this problem, we’re not just discussing financial loss. We’re talking about the foundations of digital trust breaking down. Think about the systems that run our world today: banking, healthcare, messaging apps, cloud platforms, and AI services. They all rely on cryptographic systems that were never designed to withstand a quantum-capable adversary. If quantum computers can break widely used encryption like RSA or ECC, then yes, banks could be compromised, personal messages could be exposed, and deep systems like national IDs or military comms could be intercepted. It wouldn’t be just about money anymore. It would be about identity, privacy, and sovereignty. Worst-case scenario? Imagine an AI system trained on poisoned data or manipulated in real-time. Imagine diplomatic secrets leaked from old encrypted emails. Or financial systems manipulated quietly because the attacker had access for months before anyone even noticed. At the end of the day, this isn’t a tech issue; it’s a civilization-level trust issue. Given the possible implications, it seems that regulators worldwide should react to the emergence of quantum computing. Will the distribution of these computers be somewhat controlled? If this technology is that explosive, will it be as hard to obtain as nuclear weapons? Are regulators around the world working on it? Dhiman : That’s a great and very important question, and one that regulators are only just starting to grapple with. Quantum computing may not have the explosive visuals of nuclear weapons, but its impact could be just as far-reaching, especially in the digital realm. We’re talking about breaking encryption, compromising national security systems, and even destabilizing the trust models that underpin global finance and communications. Right now, quantum systems are expensive, centralized, and limited to a few governments, labs, and major tech players. So yes – there’s still some natural control around access. But that’s not going to last forever. We’ve seen it before with AI and other frontier tech. Once the tools get smaller, cheaper, and more available, the risk multiplies. That said, we’re starting to see regulatory moves. The U.S. has already imposed export controls on quantum technologies, and the EU, Switzerland, and other countries are following suit. There’s no global treaty yet, but there’s a growing awareness that this tech can’t remain ungoverned. Will access be as tightly controlled as nuclear weapons? Probably not. But we are moving toward what I’d call a managed chokehold; restrictions on exports, funding, and cloud-based access to quantum infrastructure. Think of it as governments trying to slow the spread while they play catch-up. That’s why readiness matters. Regulators can try to contain the technology, but it’s already out of the lab. The only real defense is upgrading our infrastructure. That’s the future we’re building toward at Quranium: quantum-secure by design, so we’re not waiting for the world to act; we’re already ahead of it. You told the Korea IT Times that opposing the quantum threat is about technology and global collaboration. Do you see this collaboration happening, and are you optimistic? Dhiman : Yes, I did say that, and I stand by it more than ever. Fighting the quantum threat isn’t just about rolling out better cryptography. It’s about aligning global priorities. Because let’s be honest, a quantum attack doesn’t respect borders. If someone breaks encryption in one part of the world, the ripple effects can go global in seconds. I’ve had the chance to speak with people across different regions, in Switzerland, the UAE, the U.S, South East Asia, and what gives me optimism is that there’s a real shift happening. Governments are investing in quantum readiness. Enterprises, especially in finance and identity, are starting to ask the right questions. We’re seeing more cross-border partnerships and collaborations form and Quranium is part of that conversation. We’ve co-hosted sessions like The Quantum Threat: Future-Proofing Finance in Singapore with PwC, and partnered with innovators globally to move this forward. South Korea is a great example. Their National Strategic Plan for Quantum Science and Technology initiative is entirely centered on international collaboration, not just to develop the tech, but to build a secure ecosystem around it. Their 2023 joint statement with the U.S. also laid out a clear plan for working together on quantum science and cybersecurity. When you pair that with efforts from the EU, India, and strategic bodies like the World Economic Forum and CSIS, you see a fragmented but growing fabric of collaboration. So am I optimistic? Yes, but cautiously. The momentum is there. The conversations are happening. But this can’t be a wait-and-watch moment. Quantum is moving fast and we need to move faster. If we get this right, we don’t just neutralize the threat, we unlock entirely new opportunities for secure, intelligent infrastructure on a global scale. Recently, BlackRock warned its customers about Bitcoin’s vulnerability associated with quantum computing. That was probably the first instance when a high-profile company voiced the problem. Do you see big players doing anything else about the quantum threat on top of raising awareness? What big companies on top of BlackRock and Google were discussing the problem? Dhiman : Yes, BlackRock’s statement marked a turning point. For a traditional asset manager of that scale to publicly warn about quantum threats, it sent a strong signal. It’s no longer just cryptographers or blockchain startups talking about this. The alarm bells are starting to ring in boardrooms. Beyond BlackRock, we’ve seen activity from companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. They’re not just developing quantum hardware, they’re investing in post-quantum security standards. Cloud providers, for example, are piloting quantum-safe protocols for enterprise clients. JPMorgan, Visa, and other financial giants are also researching how to future-proof sensitive systems. That said, there’s still a disconnect. Many efforts are siloed, focused more on innovation and research than on coordinated defense or industry-wide migration. Outside of BlackRock, we haven’t yet seen a collective commitment to adopt quantum-resistant systems. Especially in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin, where coordination is difficult, real change will take time. Have you had discussions with big influencers and what’s your opinion on their awareness and readiness to step in? Do influencers outside of the crypto community ring the alarm? Dhiman : As for influencers, awareness is rising in crypto circles. Accounts like Coin Bureau are helping to amplify the message and encourage community discussions around protocols like QRAMP (Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol). Outside crypto, though engagement is still scattered. Some commentators like tech commentator Chamath Palihapitiya mention quantum here and there, often reacting to headlines like Google’s progress, but there’s no deep push yet for systemic change. That’s why Quranium is leaning in, not only by building infrastructure ready for the quantum era, but by keeping the conversation going across industries and communities. The more we raise awareness now, the more time we buy to ensure the transition is smooth, secure, and inclusive. I’ve seen a survey by Quranium. It reveals that people holding crypto are well aware of the problem and they want to protect their funds but most of them have no idea how to do it. Can you describe transitioning from vulnerable wallets to quantum-proof wallets from the user’s perspective? What can be already done? Dhiman : That stat you mentioned, “78% willing to switch for quantum-safe security”, really jumped out at us too. It’s clear: the community wants protection, but most people don’t know how to get there. And that’s not their fault. The current wallet ecosystem just hasn’t given users any clear path forward. From a user’s perspective, transitioning to a quantum-secure wallet shouldn’t be complicated. At Quranium, we built QSafe with that in mind. It feels like any other modern wallet: easy to set up a familiar interface, but under the hood, it uses post-quantum cryptography by default. That means your keys, backups, and transactions are secured with algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks, like SPHINCS+ and ML-KEM. Users can already take action. With QSafe, for example, the process is simple: Create a wallet, secure your recovery phrase, activate post-quantum settings (built-in by default), and move assets over from your existing wallet. There is no need to wait for a protocol upgrade or a hard fork. For those still using vulnerable wallets, the first step is awareness, understanding what protects your assets, and whether your current provider is even thinking about the quantum threat. Unfortunately, the survey showed that most aren’t. What we’re seeing is a shift. People are moving toward using their wallets like banks. But unlike banks, we don’t get to rely on regulators or insurance to back us up. It’s self-custody, which means the responsibility is higher, but so is the need for better tools. The dormant bitcoins question. Who will be in charge of unlocking the stuck bitcoins? Will they end up being grabbed by quantum raiders? Dhiman : This is one of the most uncomfortable truths about the quantum threat and one that very few people want to discuss. Dormant bitcoins, especially those sitting in old wallets with exposed public keys and no movement for years, are essentially low-hanging fruit for quantum computers. If Q-Day arrives before a hard fork or a protocol-wide upgrade, those coins can be stolen without any chance of recovery. So who’s in charge of unlocking them? Technically, no one. These wallets don’t have active guardians or access controls beyond their cryptography. If that cryptography breaks and quantum computers can derive private keys from public ones, those funds are as good as gone. That includes Satoshi’s wallets, which hold about $100 billion worth of BTC. In that scenario, it won’t be “unlocking,” it’ll be looting. Quantum raiders, whether state-backed or rogue actors, could sweep those wallets. And the worst part? You won’t even know it happened until the coins start moving. The chain won’t raise any red flags because from its point of view, the attacker has a valid private key. Unless Bitcoin undergoes a hard fork to adopt post-quantum cryptography in time, which is a monumental task requiring global coordination, there’s no central authority to protect those dormant coins. That’s why we keep saying: the clock is ticking. Security by consensus is powerful, but when facing something like quantum, it has to be fast too. Will quantum computers serve to improve the security of the crypto sector or benefit it the other way? If so, what are the possible use cases? Dhiman : Quantum computing is a double-edged sword for the crypto sector. On one hand, it’s the single biggest threat to the cryptographic foundations most blockchains rely on, especially those using RSA and elliptic curve signatures, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Algorithms like Shor’s can break these within hours once we hit the 2,000–4,000 logical qubit mark, and based on current trajectories, that could happen by the early 2030s. But that’s just one side of the story. Quantum tech could also strengthen the crypto space if we’re prepared. Take quantum random number generation (QRNG): it creates truly unpredictable keys, which could reduce wallet-level vulnerabilities. JPMorgan and Quantinuum have already shown how this works in finance, and crypto could follow. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is another example. It’s being tested in places like China for ultra-secure communication over long distances. If applied to crypto exchanges or high-value wallets, QKD could add a layer of defense that current systems lack. Beyond security, quantum computing could optimize how smart contracts are written, tested, and patched, especially in DeFi, where vulnerabilities can cause cascading failures. It could also supercharge fraud detection systems, giving AI tools the boost they need to analyze transactions and flag suspicious behavior in real time. So yes, quantum could benefit crypto but only if we get ahead of the threat first. If we delay the transition to post-quantum cryptography, then all these benefits won’t matter because we’ll be too busy dealing with the fallout. It’s a race: proactive adoption turns quantum into an ally. Waiting too long turns it into a wrecking ball.

46085342,https://thecoinrise.com/owning-one-bitcoin-now-seen-as-the-new-american-dream/,1750012233,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/46085342.jpeg,Owning One Bitcoin Now Seen as the New American Dream,https://thecoinrise.com/owning-one-bitcoin-now-seen-as-the-new-american-dream/,"Bitcoin is quickly becoming a major goal for younger investors in the United States. Crypto market activity is holding firm despite rising geopolitical tensions. Notably, the price of Bitcoin currently stands above $105,000. It is showing resilience in the face of recent volatility caused by conflict in the Middle East. New Priorities for the Next Generation In a major development, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes owning one bitcoin is fast becoming the modern version of the American Dream. As reported by Coindesk, speaking on the Unchained podcast, Park explained that younger investors are moving away from traditional goals like home ownership. Instead, many are focused on owning a full bitcoin. According to him, they see it as a mark of financial freedom. According to Park, some even view it as a way to create lasting wealth across generations, calling it “retiring your bloodline. The emotional value attached to being a wholecoiner now goes beyond personal gain. It is also about securing a family legacy in a world where financial systems often feel unstable. It is worth noting that this view is not limited to individual investors. Leading asset management firms and major technology companies have also been favouring Bitcoin over traditional financial assets. For example, Strategy bought 1,045 BTC for $110.2 million between June 2 and 8 at an average price of $105,426. This brings its total holdings to 582,000 BTC, worth over $62 billion. Bitcoin Holds Steady After Geopolitical Jolt Bitcoin rebounded after a sharp drop below $104,000 triggered by Israel’s strike on Iran. Despite the shock, the leading cryptocurrency recovered quickly and is trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the last 24 hours. Analysts highlight the $104,000 to $105,000 range as a strong support zone, based on high-volume buying during the dip. Technical data showed the price moving between $104,480 and $105,696 before closing near its current level. However, a notable breakout followed recently with Bitcoin jumping from $105,486 to $105,550. This rebound suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin . Still overall market sentiment remains cautious. Traders are watching for a push toward the $106,000 mark, depending on continued buying strength. More Than an Asset — A Global Identity In the same podcast, Park also stressed that bitcoin’s global and neutral nature is part of its growing appeal. For many, it is not just a hedge or an investment. It is a statement of independence from centralised systems. As bitcoin remains above $105,000, its role in shaping financial identity continues to grow, especially among younger investors searching for stability and control. Still, Japanese tech company Remixpoint has recently expanded its Bitcoin treasury with a massive purchase of BTC. The firm recently added 56.87 BTC to its holdings, spending about ¥887 million, equivalent to about $6 million.

This law would allow companies behind these dollar-backed tokens to store reserves in banks, buy Treasuries, or lend money to banks the same way money-market funds do. The point is to regulate a fast-growing part of crypto that’s starting to bite into the traditional banking system. The real issue isn’t whether stablecoins remove money from banks—they don’t—it’s what kind of money gets left behind and who ends up holding the risk. When someone mints a stablecoin using real US dollars, the issuer has to put those dollars into reserves. That money isn’t lost. It moves into a bank account, into government debt, or into short-term lending deals called repurchase agreements. But here’s what changes: that money no longer sits in a low-risk, government-insured account under $250,000. Instead, it piles into massive, uninsured accounts that can vanish the second panic hits, making what used to be stable retail cash become volatile corporate cash. And that cash doesn’t stick around long when things go sideways. Stablecoins create pressure on deposits and insurance JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote that stablecoins are basically a digital form of money-market funds. In their words, “bank deposits are not ‘destroyed’ by such a change, but are simply transferred to other economic agents.” The problem isn’t disappearance, it’s exposure. What banks end up with is more risk. And that’s where it gets messy. Researchers at the European Central Bank called it out clearly: “Collecting deposits from stablecoin issuers transforms retail deposits that can serve as a stable source of funding for banks into volatile deposits that cannot.” That’s what scares regulators. Because if too many people move insured deposits into stablecoins, banks end up with fragile funding structures. And it’s already happened before. In March 2023, Circle Internet Group, the company behind USDC, tried to move more than $3 billion out of Silicon Valley Bank as it was collapsing. But the transfer didn’t settle before the FDIC took over, and to make matters worse, USDC dropped below $1 on multiple exchanges, losing its dollar peg. In its public filing, Circle confirmed that the dislocation only ended after regulators guaranteed all deposits at SVB. The biggest banks will survive, but smaller ones will take the hit Circle also said in its filing that it changed how it manages reserves, holding the “significant majority” of its cash with global systemically important banks, which include Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. These giants are built for liquidity, as they’re already required to hold enough high-quality assets to weather big swings, which gives them an edge when stablecoin issuers start moving billions around. But smaller banks aren’t built for that. If everyday savers start using stablecoins for regular spending and short-term savings, small banks are the first to feel it. Their biggest strength, government-insured retail deposits, gets eaten away. Their main advantage becomes a weakness. And there’s more. Some big banks are now discussing the possibility of issuing stablecoins themselves. The Wall Street Journal reported that major US banks are in early talks to jointly launch a stablecoin. That would pull even more power away from smaller institutions. If the same banks already dominating global finance start minting their own crypto-backed dollars, they won’t just be hosting reserves; they’ll be controlling the entire pipeline. Meanwhile, the ecosystem around stablecoins is growing. People are starting to earn yield just for holding these tokens. And there’s now a market for tokenized Treasurys, meaning people can earn returns on government debt without ever touching a bank. That puts even more pressure on banks to raise their interest rates, which eats into their profits. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The money was stolen from defrauded investors in the U.S. through a web of shell companies, offshore accounts, and digital asset wallets. Details of The Scheme The U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) secured guilty pleas from California residents Joseph Wong, 33; Jose Somarriba, 55; and 39-year-old Shengsheng He. Two Chinese citizens, Yicheng Zhang and Jingliang Su, also confessed to wrongdoing. In a press release published on June 9, the DOJ indicated that these individuals were part of a criminal network that received funds from U.S. victims under the pretense of investing in crypto. Their scheme operated by building trust through unsolicited social media interactions, text messages, phone calls, and online dating sites. Once contact was established, co-conspirators based overseas persuaded the targeted individuals to transfer money under the false belief they were investing in appreciating digital assets. However, the funds were being transferred to accounts controlled by the perpetrators. More than $36.9 million was moved from their U.S.-based holdings into a separate one at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas, registered under Axis Digital Limited. Somarriba and He co-founded Axis Digital and opened the Deltec account, with Su later joining them as a director. Together, they instructed the bank to convert the stolen money into USDT. The trio then sent the converted funds to a wallet controlled by unnamed people in Cambodia who ultimately forwarded them to unnamed people running “scam centers” in the region, including one in Sihanoukville. Meanwhile, Wong was managing a Los Angeles-based network of money launderers who created shell companies, opened U.S. bank accounts, and wired funds abroad. Zhang also opened and managed two of those capital obfuscation accounts. Suspects Await Sentencing Wong and Zhang each owned up to money laundering conspiracy and face a maximum of 20 years in prison. On their part, Somarriba, He, and Su admitted to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money services business, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years. They join three others who previously copped up to their crimes, including Daren Li, a former resident of Cambodia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who has been in U.S. custody since April 2024. Another associate, Lu Zhang, a Chinese national who managed a U.S.-based asset concealment network, pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy on May 13, 2024. This development follows a report by the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which revealed that Americans over the age of 60 were the most affected by crypto-related fraud. According to the law enforcement agency, more than 140,000 complaints linked to digital assets were recorded last year, leading to over $9 billion in losses.

In a statement , the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa says that 63-year-old Margo Ann Williams laundered $800,000 of proceeds from a scheme that was carried out between December 2022 and July 2023. According to evidence presented at the trial, the email accounts of the five victims – a Cedar Rapids church, two businesses, a non-profit and an individual – were hacked while they were in the process of making large wire and automatic clearinghouse (ACH) transfers. The victims received spoofed emails containing instructions to change the routing information for the wire and ACH transfers. Believing that the emails were from legitimate and trusted sources, the victims instructed their banks to wire the funds according to the supposed new payment instructions. The funds were rerouted to bank accounts that Williams controlled. She subsequently relocated the funds to other bank accounts under her control before transferring the money to two crypto exchanges and another person in Florida. The banks discovered William’s fraudulent activities and closed her accounts, but she kept opening new ones at other banks in an effort to keep the scheme alive. She earned approximately $25,000 from the operation and spent the funds on many personal purchases, including an Apple watch and a luxury bag. Williams, who claimed that she perpetrated the scheme at the direction of a famous British actor with whom she became romantically involved, was sentenced to four years in prison. She’s also ordered to pay $594,037 in restitution to her victims and must also serve a three-year term of supervised release following her imprisonment.

The factors driving this divergence offer insights into which cryptocurrencies may be poised for growth. A closer look at the dynamics behind each coin reveals surprising trends and potential opportunities in the crypto market. Toncoin Price Overview: Recent Declines and Key Level Analysis TON past performance shows a clear downturn during recent months. Price movements indicate moderate short-term pressure with a one-week decline of about 7.10% and a one-month drop of 3.74%. The coin experienced a significant downward slide over the past six months, falling by 51.22%. These figures reveal a prolonged bearish phase that has weighed heavily on Toncoin’s value, reflecting ample selling pressure and heightened market caution over an extended period. Current price action sees Toncoin trading within a range of approximately $2.79 to $3.61. Immediate resistance is noted at $4.06, with a second resistance level around $4.88. On the downside, key support is positioned at $2.43 and a deeper level near $1.61 is also in view. Market indicators, including an RSI at 41.35, lean towards continued bearish sentiment. Traders might consider a cautious approach, keeping a close watch on the support at $2.43 for buying opportunities in case of a rebound, and using the $4.06 resistance as a potential exit point if bullish momentum manages a brief recovery. Polkadot Price Analysis Amidst Recent Corrections Polkadot experienced a notable decline with a one-month drop of almost 21% and a significant six-month retracement nearing 57%. The coin’s journey over these periods reveals a sharp pullback that highlights the prevailing bearish sentiment in its recent history. Price action over the past month has been volatile, reflecting traders' cautious stance with adjustments in momentum. The half-year performance underscores a sustained downturn, suggesting that recovery might be gradual unless significant market catalysts emerge. Recent price behavior also indicates DOT is struggling to regain its footing after a brief consolidation phase. Currently trading in a range between $3.48 and $5.04, Polkadot is testing key levels that could shape near-term movements. The nearest support sits around $2.87 while a stronger floor exists at $1.31; on the upside, resistance appears at $5.99 with further hurdles near $7.55. Bearish indicators like a slightly below-neutral RSI around 37 and a minor negative momentum reading suggest sellers exert influence at this stage. Traders might consider short-term plays on pullbacks toward support, yet a break above resistance could shift the balance decisively. Cautious buyers may look for signs of stabilization near support before initiating positions while sellers continue to manage risk. Conclusion Toncoin (TON) is showing stronger performance than Polkadot (DOT) this quarter. Factors such as integration with major platforms and higher trading volumes are contributing to TON's rise. On the other hand, DOT's growth seems to have slowed down despite its strong foundation. This divergence highlights different market responses and investor interests. Both coins have their unique strengths, but TON is gaining more momentum currently. This analysis suggests a shift in market focus towards TON for now.

With its cutting-edge combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence, audited smart contract, and upcoming exchange listing, Ruvi AI represents a project focused on real utility and significant growth potential. Tron (TRX): Pioneering Decentralized Content Sharing Since its inception in 2017, Tron (TRX) has been a pioneering force in the blockchain space, aiming to decentralize the internet by empowering content creators. Its high scalability, capable of processing up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), has cemented its usability across sectors like entertainment and gaming. One of Tron’s standout achievements is its acquisition of BitTorrent, which has bolstered its ecosystem with decentralized file-sharing capabilities. Tron’s partnerships with major brands like Samsung have further elevated its profile and adoption. However, as more innovative projects emerge in the blockchain space, Tron faces mounting competition, particularly from projects with fresh ideas and broader applicability, like Ruvi AI. Cyberscope Audit Builds Trust and Transparency Key to Ruvi AI’s strategy is its commitment to transparency and security. The project has engaged Cyberscope, a respected name in blockchain security, to perform a thorough audit of its smart contract and platform. This proactive approach to building trust sets Ruvi AI apart from speculative projects. The audit ensures that Ruvi AI’s technology meets industry standards for safety and reliability, strengthening its position as a credible competitor to established platforms like Tron. For investors, this reassurance adds an extra layer of confidence in Ruvi AI’s long-term potential. Presale Success Signals Immense Potential Ruvi AI’s presale performance has been nothing short of remarkable. During Phase 1, priced at $0.010 per token, all available tokens sold out in just two weeks. Early supporters saw an immediate 50% return as the price increased to $0.015 in Phase 2, which is currently ongoing. With more than 1,600 holders contributing to $1.7 million in funding, Ruvi AI has rapidly gained traction among investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI has secured its first exchange listing and entered into a partnership with a significant trading platform, enhancing the token’s liquidity and accessibility. With more announcements expected in the near future, Ruvi AI’s ongoing momentum makes it one of the most talked-about investments in the market. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Ruvi AI is pushing the boundaries of blockchain by combining it with artificial intelligence to create a superapp capable of producing AI-generated content. Whether it’s text, videos, audio, or images, Ruvi AI’s platform has applications in multiple industries, from marketing to creative production and business automation. At the center of this innovative ecosystem is the $RUVI token. The token fuels transactions, staking rewards, governance features, and premium content access, making Ruvi AI a practical solution rather than a speculative asset. Its focus on real-world utility sets it apart from competitors and positions it as a transformative force in the blockchain space. Investment Scenarios with Extraordinary Returns Early supporters of Ruvi AI have access to structured VIP presale tiers that offer significant bonuses, translating to impressive ROI. Below are the possible outcomes based on the presale price of $0.015, a $0.07 listing price, and a projected $1 token price post-launch: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token).

This article explores the top three cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Solana, Ripple, and Zetachain. SEC ruling on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF looms Ripple ( XRP ) price will be a cryptocurrency to watch this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission delivers a ruling on Franklin Templeton ETF proposal on June 17. The most likely outcome is that the agency will postpone the ETF approval as it evaluates other proposals by companies like VanEck, Bitwise, and 21Shares. Most crypto traders believe that the agency, under Paul Atkins, will approve these ETFs by the end of the year. Polymarket odds of this approval have jumped to almost 90%. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF decision comes as the coin has remained in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. It has formed a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, pointing to a big breakout or breakdown in the next few weeks. One crypto pundit estimated that the coin will have a bullish breakout, which will align with Bitcoin price rising above the 8-year trendline that we covered here . XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 $275M token unlock could spark Solana rebound Solana ( SOL ) price has dropped by 21.7% from its highest point in May, meaning that it has moved into a local bear market. This crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of most of its meme coins. Solana price will be in the spotlight this week as the network will unlock tokens worth over $275 million on Saturday. These tokens represent about 0.36% of its float. Still, technicals point to a Solana price rebound, as it has formed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. This rebound will be confirmed if the token rises above the upper side of the descending channel at around $160.

It has plunged by over 80% from its highest point in 2024, partly because of its substantial monthly unlocks. These unlocks increase a token’s supply, which is risky, mainly when little demand exists. ZETA price will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth $8.6 million, representing 5% of the float. The daily chart above shows that the ZETA price has pulled back from a high of $0.3120 in May to $0.20 today. It failed to move below that support level three times since March, forming a triple-bottom pattern. Therefore, Zetachain price may bounce back this week if it holds the support at $0.20.

Since establishing a new all time high of $111,931 in late May, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed significant levels of selling pressure forestalling further levels of price discovery. Amidst this current market set up, popular trader with X pseudonym Trader Tardigrade continues to back Bitcoin’s bullish potential with another compelling price prediction. Bitcoin Bull Run Far From Over – Analyst In an X post on June 14, Trader Tardigrade shares a captivating analysis of the Bitcoin market hinting the flagship cryptocurrency still has room for more price gains based on historical price data. Using the BTC daily trading chart, Tardigrade notes the recent formation of a golden cross as the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crossed above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) amidst the asset’s recovery in the past two months. For context, the golden cross is one of the most common bullish formations that indicate extensive price rally ahead. It occurs when a short term moving average moves above long-term moving average indicating a potential shift from consolidation or downtrend into a strong uptrend. Since 2023, the three instances of the 50/200 SMA golden cross have yielded substantial price gains to the tune of 49%, 125% and 68%. Going by this price history, Tardigrade postulates the most recent golden cross tips Bitcoin to hit a market price of at least $152,000 representing a potential 44.7% gain from present market prices in a worse case scenario. However, in bullish circumstances, the analyst predicts the premier cryptocurrency could trade as high as $229,000 which reflects a possible 118% price increase from the asset’s current valuation. Tardigrade explains the feasibility of these predictions noting Bitcoin’s recent uptrend which has produced an estimated 47% from April lows. Notably, Bitcoin’s prices have boosted by 656% since the present market cycle commenced in late 2022. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, BTC is valued at $105,552 after a 0.20% gain in the past day. The flagship cryptocurrency also retains a green performance on longer timeframes with gains of 0.03% and 1.41% on the weekly and monthly charts. Despite these positive figures, Bitcoin’s recent price action has shown signs of fatigue, with narrowing profit margins reflecting a consolidation phase and sideways movement over the past week. However, this cooling momentum has not dampened investor appetite. Notably, the Bitcoin ETF market saw a strong rebound , registering net inflows of $1.37 billion last week, after two consecutive weeks of total net outflows valued at $286.81 million.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin golden cross|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-15 19:00:06

Prices have been bouncing between $61,000 and $104,000 for about seven months. That range looks a lot like the $31,000–$64,000 sideways move before the sharp drop in early 2022. Traders and analysts are split over whether history is about to repeat itself or if fresh demand will keep Bitcoin aloft. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Price Stuck In Familiar Range According to reports, Bitcoin’s stretch from $61k to $104k mirrors the 2020–2021 “distribution zone” when it traded between $31,000 and $64,000 for nearly a year. Back then, the slide came fast: Bitcoin peaked around $69,000 in November 2021, then sank to roughly $15,600 by November 2022. That was a nearly 78% plunge. Breakouts Keep Falling Flat Based on analysis from Michaël van de Poppe, Bitcoin tried and failed to stay above the $106k level this month. His chart showed a quick rejection at that barrier, triggering long‑side liquidations. The price slipped back to the $104k–$105k zone after the failed push higher. Traders see each unsuccessful breakout as a warning sign of distribution. November 2021 all over again? pic.twitter.com/lIA6QFhD9S — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 14, 2025 Risk Of Steep Slide According to veteran trader Peter Brandt, strong fundamentals often shine brightest right before a market top. He pointed out that if today’s setup leads to a similar 78% drop from the $105k band, Bitcoin could fall toward $23,600. His simple math recalls last cycle’s move from around $69k down to $15,500. Growing Demand Meets Technical Barriers Based on reports of spot ETFs and growing buys by institutions and governments, some believe the floor is firmer now. Huge investment flows into Bitcoin have never been higher. Yet technical hurdles remain. The inability to clear $105k makes some analysts cautious. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection Long Term Signals Still Bullish Trader Tardigrade noted that Bitcoin’s 50‑day and 200‑day simple moving averages recently formed a golden cross. In past cycles, that pattern led to gains of 50%, 125%, and 65%. It points to a possible rally if buyers step in around current levels. What It Means For Investors Bitcoin’s tug‑of‑war between caution and optimism is clear. On one side, pattern watchers warn of a big drop if support breaks. On the other, strong hands from big players may cushion any slide and spark a rally. Investors should keep an eye on $104k–$105k for signs of weakness or strength. A break below could open the door to a move toward $23,500. Conversely, a clean break above $106k might signal the next leg up. Regardless, volatility looks set to stay high, so risk management remains key.

As the digital asset sector matures, projects rooted in strong fundamentals and real-world utility are beginning to displace the fleeting, speculation-driven narratives that once dominated the space. This shift has drawn renewed focus toward platforms that deliver measurable value and long-term potential. Among these, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out with its bold vision of real-world asset tokenization and cross-chain aggregation. Backed by a well-structured presale, transparent economics, and a thriving ecosystem of early adopters, Qubetics is quickly positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to watch this year. At the same time, Helium (HNT) and Stellar are advancing their respective missions—each addressing systemic inefficiencies with focused technological solutions. Helium is transforming wireless infrastructure through a decentralized model, while Stellar continues to scale access to financial tools for underbanked populations across the globe. These are not experimental platforms; they are delivering impact. As 2025 unfolds, the relevance of Qubetics, HNT, and Stellar is becoming increasingly evident across both institutional and retail segments, placing them firmly among the top cryptos to watch. Qubetics Unlocks Global Access to Tokenized Real-World Assets Qubetics is pioneering a blockchain-powered marketplace designed to tokenize real-world assets and bridge traditional finance with decentralized infrastructure, positioning itself among the top cryptos to watch. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics connects multiple blockchains to deliver a streamlined environment where assets like real estate, intellectual property, equity, and commodities can be transformed into secure digital tokens. This model addresses a major gap in the market—granting everyday participants access to asset classes that were historically limited to private wealth circles and institutional capital. The tokenization process on Qubetics doesn’t merely represent ownership; it facilitates liquidity and accessibility. For instance, a real estate owner in Dubai can fractionalize their asset, offering digital shares to buyers across the globe. Similarly, a startup founder in Toronto can tokenize their patent and raise capital from a distributed network of early adopters. Every asset listed on the Qubetics platform is backed by robust compliance standards and smart contract protocols, ensuring that each transaction is secure, transparent, and efficient. This marketplace is engineered to operate as a central hub for tokenized assets while also functioning as a secondary exchange, allowing participants to buy, sell, and manage holdings with ease. By addressing long-standing challenges of illiquidity and transparency in traditional markets, Qubetics brings new energy to tokenized finance. With a scalable model and active development, it has become one of the top cryptos to watch, offering both relevance and future-proof utility in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Watch in 2025 The Qubetics presale has reached its final stage, offering a last-chance opportunity to purchase $TICS tokens at a fixed price of $0.3370 before listing at $0.40. With over $18 million already raised, more than 515 million tokens sold, and 27,900+ token holders onboard, Qubetics has demonstrated strong traction ahead of its exchange debut. Only 10 million tokens remain in this closing phase. The project recently restructured its tokenomics—reducing total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion and increasing public allocation to 38.55%. This move not only enhances scarcity but also reinforces Qubetics’ decentralized governance model. These critical metrics, alongside rising demand, make Qubetics a standout among the top cryptos to watch as it nears public trading. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale rate of $0.3370. That amount secures approximately 14,837 $TICS tokens. At listing, the value of that holding immediately rises to $5,934—delivering a 20% return before any market-driven growth occurs. With projections indicating a price surge to $5–$10 in the next cycle, that same $5,000 could grow to a range between $74,185 and $148,370. These figures are rooted in sound fundamentals, not speculation—backed by reduced supply, clear utility, and strong presale demand. This is why Qubetics is being widely recognized as the best crypto presale currently available, and why it’s rapidly gaining recognition as one of the top cryptos to watch heading into 2025. Helium (HNT): Building the Infrastructure for a Decentralized Wireless Future Helium has redefined how wireless networks operate by eliminating centralized intermediaries and replacing them with a global network of participant-hosted nodes. Through this decentralized wireless infrastructure, users can deploy “Hotspots” that provide network coverage in exchange for HNT tokens. This system enables a cost-effective and permissionless approach to coverage, particularly in underserved regions where telecom infrastructure is either weak or expensive. What makes Helium particularly relevant now is its strategic focus on 5G technology and data infrastructure. The network’s recent enhancements have significantly improved scalability, making it more capable of supporting devices that rely on mobile and IoT connectivity. The Helium Mobile initiative continues to expand, offering decentralized mobile data services to new markets. These enhancements demonstrate Helium’s commitment to real-world deployment and functional efficiency. By combining blockchain rewards with practical infrastructure, Helium is advancing a model that supports smart cities, logistics, and autonomous technologies. The demand for decentralized bandwidth and wireless accessibility is growing, and Helium remains ahead of that curve. Its adoption across geographies and sectors reinforces its status as one of the top cryptos to watch as blockchain continues to merge with real-world use cases. Stellar: Bridging Cross-Border Transactions with Transparent Blockchain Tech Stellar is a blockchain network designed to facilitate borderless financial interactions with minimal cost and maximum speed. It enables the issuance and transfer of digital representations of any currency, offering global accessibility and eliminating legacy inefficiencies in remittance and settlement processes. Stellar is particularly effective in economies where banking infrastructure is underdeveloped or difficult to access. The network’s infrastructure supports seamless asset tokenization and conversion between fiat and digital currencies, which has led to widespread adoption across fintech platforms and financial institutions. Stellar also incorporates compliance-ready architecture and a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol, allowing users to trade assets without intermediaries. These attributes make Stellar a go-to solution for both enterprise-level integration and everyday financial access. Through collaborations with major remittance companies and expanding adoption across Africa, South America, and Asia, Stellar has built a reputation for consistency and practical value. The network’s ability to support financial inclusion and institutional-grade security simultaneously makes it one of the top cryptos to watch heading into 2025. Conclusion: Qubetics, HNT, and Stellar Stand at the Forefront of Blockchain Utility In the current market, long-term relevance depends on utility, transparency, and scalability. Qubetics offers a full-scale tokenized asset marketplace supported by a well-structured presale and real-world integration. Helium introduces a decentralized network infrastructure reshaping global wireless connectivity, and Stellar streamlines financial access across borders with unmatched efficiency. Each of these platforms provides distinct, credible use cases that validate their growth trajectories. Their continued development makes them the top cryptos to watch in 2025 for those seeking forward-thinking, value-driven opportunities. For participants focused on maximizing potential in early-stage entries, now is the time to join this best crypto presale before the next price transition occurs.

Despite recent geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions, many analysts believe the bull market is far from over. Rather than signaling a top, the current pause is seen by many as the prelude to further upside. Well-known trader Alan Tardigrade is one of several voices pointing to an optimistic future. “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge,” he said in his latest market analysis on June 15. He believes this bullish chart pattern could lead the price to $170,000 in the near future. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Forecasts Tardigrade also noted that a golden cross — when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average — has reappeared on the daily chart. According to him, this pattern has historically boosted BTC by 49%, 125%, and 68% since early 2023. “If $BTC experiences its worst and best gains from this point, it could reach $152k and $229k. These targets are reasonable given the recent uptrend,” he explained. His analysis of weekly and daily timeframes suggests that Bitcoin’s bullish structure is still intact, even amid temporary slowdowns. Other Traders Echo Bullish Sentiment Other prominent figures in the trading community are voicing similar expectations. A trader known as BigMike7335 suggested on June 14 that a potential pullback to $92,000 could set the stage for a breakout to $270,000 by October. This would reflect a typical second-wave corrective move within Elliott Wave theory, followed by a strong continuation of the trend. Merlijn, another active trader, pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart. He believes a breakout from this formation could push BTC to $140,000 or more. “Neckline at $113K is the only thing standing in the way,” he told his followers. Warning Signs Still Present for Some While bullish sentiment dominates the trading discourse, some are issuing reminders of the market’s inherent risks. “The Bitcoin Standard” author Saifedean Ammous spoke candidly at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, warning that the asset’s history of sharp downturns cannot be ignored. “I just hope my message out there to everybody in this business is, Bitcoin has done -70% and -80% before, and it can do it again,” he said during an appearance on the Coin Stories podcast. Such comments serve as a cautionary note amid widespread optimism, particularly for new corporate buyers or institutions entering the market at current levels. With Bitcoin hovering near previous all-time highs, comparisons to the 2021 cycle peak have begun to circulate, prompting some to consider downside risks more seriously. Conclusion Despite concerns from a few corners of the market, the broader narrative among analysts and traders remains centered around significant further upside. Technical patterns, historical comparisons, and sentiment indicators continue to paint a picture of strength as Bitcoin prepares for another phase of price discovery.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-15 19:16:39

46087612,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746787,1750015800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46087612.jpeg,Not Yet On Everyone’s Radar – June’s Quiet Crypto Gainers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/not-yet-on-everyones-radar-junes-quiet-crypto-gainers/,"The crypto market has experienced heightened volatility since the start of June, slumping first, and then surging again a few days into the month. As the month approaches the midway point, there are several major crypto gainers that should be on your radar. One is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which analysts forecast gains of 2,454% on the low end of the forecasts. With this forecast, it could become one of your best investments this June. Let us look at some of the coins you should consider adding to your portfolio in June 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a relatively new market entrant that is currently in the presale phase. So far, the project has garnered a massive online following and has over 20k followers across all its social media channels. The large community gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an edge in the competitive presale market. Its large community will play an important role in helping to push the project to the masses. So far, it has been quite successful, raising over $10.6 million in the ongoing presale. It has already completed four phases of its presale and is currently progressing through phase 5, heading into phase 6. Tokens in phase 5 are selling for $0.03, with over 35% of the phase tokens already sold, barely two weeks after it began. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. The stepped increase in the presale prices started in phase 1, when the token price was $0.01. It is designed to ensure that the earliest supporters get the biggest benefits. For instance, phase 5 buyers will get a 100% ROI based on the $0.06 listing price, while phase 6 buyers will get a 71.43% ROI. Another incentive is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which has been a major boost in the performance of the presale. The Mutuum Finance plans to give away $10,000 to ten lucky winners in the giveaway. To qualify, the only requirement is a minimum $50 contribution in the ongoing presale. A Community-Focused Project The success of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not based purely on hype, but on the massive utility it aims to offer its community. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders deposit their assets in the pool and start earning interest payments. The interest rate at which they earn is based on the pool utilization rate. This utilization rate is based on the measure of the assets being actively borrowed from the pools versus the total assets in that pool. For borrowers, Mutuum Finance offers an opportunity to access high-quality assets without losing access to their assets. Once the value of their assets used as collateral goes up, they can repay their loan to gain access to the collateral. The commitment to its community is further emphasized by the buy-back program, where Mutuum Finance will purchase MUTM tokens off the market and distribute them to mtToken stakers in the safety module. These purchases will help boost the value of the tokens, boosting the profile of the project. Funds to purchase these assets will be sourced from protocol profits, a clear indication of the project’s commitment to growth. Besides buying MUTM tokens, the team plans to use funds to expand pools, improve safety, and for marketing purposes. That will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) grows its reach and benefits as many people as possible. The mtToken Technical Innovation The mtTokens are a unique concept developed by the Mutuum Finance team that grant holders access to instant liquidity for their assets. When a lender deposits assets in the liquidity pools, they receive mtTokens in exchange. These tokens represent the value of their assets, plus any interest accrued. The tokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, which means holders can use them to benefit from market opportunities in real time. At the same time, they provide a convenient means of navigating the protocol as holders do not need to actively claim or compound their gains. Instead, the value of the mtTokens is automatically updated based on the interest they accrue. Whale Involvement In Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has attracted the attention of both retail traders and whales in the crypto market. Some of the buyers in the ongoing presale are whales who made huge profits from the recent bull cycle. Seeking to expand their profits even more, they have turned to the MUTM token presale as a source of future growth. The influx of whales is driven by the bullish forecasts by analysts who state that MUTM tokens could gain 2,454% when they go live. For investors, a $450 investment in the presale could grow to $11,043, based on that forecast. With bullish forecasts and a clear roadmap for massive gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be your best purchase in the crypto sector in 2025.

46087542,https://crypto.news/?p=14388711,1750015800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/46087542.jpeg,Chart of the week: XRP rally to $7 likely with Ripple’s bullish announcements?,https://crypto.news/chart-of-the-week-xrp-ripple-bullish-announcements/,"Ripple is making progress in its long-drawn legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with plans for a $50 million settlement. A joint filing made the headlines following several updates on firms planning to raise funds to purchase XRP and hold it as a treasury asset. Experts examine whether it is a “pump and dump” tactic to exploit sidelined traders or whether XRP could rally toward a new high in 2025. Table of Contents XRP price forecast XRP derivatives analysis Ripple makes progress in SEC lawsuit, other catalysts What to expect from Ripple in 2025 Err on the side of caution, Matthew Sigel warns XRP traders XRP price forecast The XRP weekly price chart shows that the long-term outlook on the native token of the XRPLedger is mixed. While technical indicators suggest a likelihood of further consolidation, catalysts, and bullish developments surrounding Ripple, the XRPLedger and its stablecoin could fuel a bullish sentiment among traders and drive prices higher. The RSI reads 50, at the neutral level and MACD flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line, meaning there is an underlying negative momentum in XRP price trend. The altcoin faces resistance at a local peak of $2.6549 and could test liquidity at the $2 support, a key psychological level for XRP. XRP could rally 25% if it ends the consolidation and confirms an upward trend, testing resistance at $2.6549. The daily price chart shows that XRP is in a short-term downward trend and consolidates under the $2.6549 resistance. RSI reads 40, far under the neutral level, while MACD flashes its first red histogram bar after a series of green histogram bars in the past week. To test the $7 target, XRP would have to enter price discovery and climb towards the 272.2% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the $0.3823 low to the $3.40 peak. This is possible if the XRP price maintains a sustained upward trend and bullish momentum for the next few weeks, irrespective of volatility in altcoins and Bitcoin flash crashes.

However, there has been a massive increase in derivatives trade volume and options volume in the last 24 hours. The long/short ratio exceeds 2 on Binance and OKX, meaning there are more long bets than short bets, and derivatives traders expect a rally in XRP. However, over $20 million in long positions have been liquidated in XRP, while less than $2 million in shorts were liquidated, meaning the market is punishing bulls.

This could draw the long legal battle to an end and support a bullish thesis for XRPLedger and XRP adoption. 🚨NEW: The @SECGov and @Ripple have jointly requested a Manhattan District court to dissolve the injunction in their ongoing case and release the $125 million civil penalty held in escrow. They’re proposing that $50 million be paid to the SEC, with the remaining funds returned… pic.twitter.com/UopQuQNG5q — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 12, 2025 Two other key catalysts include Trump-appointed CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo’s idea of issuing government bonds for crypto assets like Bitcoin and XRP. The CFTC Chair believes that it is likely and shared his insights during a discussion at the XRPL Apex 2025 event in Singapore. With a large number of ideas being floated in the Trump administration about the US government’s acquisition and custody of cryptocurrencies, there is an interest in bonds backed by crypto. The final catalyst is related to crypto banking itself: a bank charter that could allow payment remittance firms like Ripple to get banking licenses. At an XRP Las Vegas conference, Greg Kidd, co-founder of Haka Yaka Ventures and owner of Vast Bank, told FOX Business’ Eleanor Terett that “he is working on a bank charter that could allow firms like Ripple to get banking licenses.” What to expect from Ripple in 2025 Developers at the XRPLedger, led by Ripple CTO David Schwartz announced at the Apex 2025 event that the chain has plans to launch an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain in Q2 2025. The sidechain would allow Ethereum smart contracts to enter the XRPLedger ecosystem, and the parallel-running blockchain would integrate the low-cost transaction capabilities of XRP’s native blockchain with the DeFi ecosystem of apps. The chain is currently being tested, ahead of the mainnet launch. Further testing and validator partnerships will most likely mark Q2 2025. A bridge will connect the side chain to XRP’s native blockchain, and a version of the altcoin, wrapped in XRP, will be the native gas token for the EVM side chain. The news of the technical development is likely the single most important driver of utility and adoption to the Ledger and XRP. At the same time, Ripple makes strides through its stablecoin partnerships and boosts the Ledger’s ecosystem. Err on the side of caution, Matthew Sigel warns XRP traders Despite bullish developments and headlines shining the spotlight on firms that announced plans to buy and hold XRP as a treasury asset, VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets, Matthew Sigel is not convinced. Sigel believes that the low-cap Nasdaq companies claiming they’ll buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of altcoins like XRP could be “pump and dump” schemes. These schemes are meant to inflate prices and benefit from the liquidity, leaving retail traders in the lurch to pocket large-scale losses. According to Sigel, VivoPower’s announcement, followed by Webus’s $300 million XRP reserve plan, could be temporary catalysts for XRP. Whether the low-market-cap firms raise the funds and purchase the tokens to hold in their treasuries remains to be seen.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $19.07 Market cap $8.04B Trading volume $183.4M Circulating supply 421.84M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $19.28 24-hour low $18.79 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 6.88% 50-day SMA $22.17 200-day SMA $24.15 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX remains bearish As of June 15, AVAX’s price rose by 1.01% in 24 hours and dropped by 18.20% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 23.67% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility is rising. The relative strength index is at 43.77 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing negative market momentum. It is considered oversold when the RSI value drops below 30. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is in consolidation as it moves sideways. Last month, it had risen to $26.84 before correcting. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 33.61. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility. Avalanche technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 18.12 BUY SMA 5 20.12 SELL SMA 10 20.62 SELL SMA 21 21.21 SELL SMA 50 22.17 SELL SMA 100 21.05 SELL SMA 200 24.15 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 21.31 SELL EMA 5 21.26 SELL EMA 10 20.65 SELL EMA 21 20.15 SELL EMA 50 21.33 SELL EMA 100 24.65 SELL EMA 200 27.78 SELL What to expect from AVAX price analysis next? The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with rising volatility, particularly in the short term, as it attempts to correct from the month’s low. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum. AVAX price prediction June 2025 For June, AVAX will trade between $14.56 and $21.05, with an average price of $18.83.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025.

According to the CEO, Byreal, built on the Solana network, offers a hybrid structure that combines centralized exchange (CEX)-level liquidity with the transparency of the DeFi world. Zhou argued in his statement that Byreal is not just another DEX, saying: “Byreal combines CEX-quality liquidity with the transparency of DeFi. This is a true hybrid finance example. There are also future projects underway where CEX and DEX will be launched together.” One of the most striking aspects of Byreal is its RFQ (quote on request) and CLMM (concentrated liquidity market maker) based routing system. Thanks to this structure, users will be able to execute MEV (maximum extractable value) protected transactions with low slippage. Ben Zhou also added: “We started from scratch and are now born on Solana. Byreal provides unified liquidity and high transaction speed. It was developed by a small but committed team and I am proud of it.” Binance recently enabled the buying and selling of listed altcoins on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges with its Binance Alpha feature. *This is not investment advice.

In a recent post on X, Bybit’s co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou, announced that the new platform was built on the Solana blockchain. He revealed that Byreal is combining the speed and liquidity of centralized exchanges with DeFi’s transparency. This advanced platform is designed to make trading easier and fairer. As Bybit expands its operations , this initiative is poised to strengthen its position in the fast-growing crypto landscape. Byreal Combines the Centralized and Decentralized Trading In a post, Zhou said Byreal is not just another decentralized trading platform. It uses a mix of two smart routing systems: Request for Quotation (RFQ) and Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM). This approach lets users get the best available prices before making a trade while keeping transaction costs low and price movements stable. RFQ checks for the best price across various sources before completing a trade. On the other hand, CLMM helps maintain deep liquidity pools by letting users provide liquidity more efficiently. Together, these tools make trades cheaper and faster, reducing the risk of manipulation from trading bots. Byreal Launchpad Aims for Fairer, Safer Token Starts Byreal will have a launchpad built to make token launches fair for all users, not just large-scale buyers. It will use tools like the Fairshare Engine and Smart Price Ladder to give everyone a better chance at getting new tokens. This setup helps prevent problems on other platforms, where bots or early buyers take over launches. This is similar to Pump.fun, a memecoin platform on the Solana network, which recently made a move that also tried to offer fair launches. However, the platform, now back to live streaming , faced many scams, with about 60% of wallets reportedly losing money. Byreal aims to fix this by using advanced tools to make token launches safer and fairer for everyone. Byreal: Backed by Bybit, Built on Solana Byreal runs on Solana, one of the fastest blockchain networks, known for its high DEX trading volume. With over $1.5 billion in decentralized trading volume, Solana gives Byreal the speed and power it needs. Byreal is more than just a trading platform. It is a full-on-chain liquidity network made to support new assets, traders, and use cases. It also features the Revive Vault, a system that offers yield options on tokens like bbSOL. The team behind this project says Byreal was built to bring real value back to decentralized finance and attract serious users and trusted projects. The testnet launches on June 30, with the mainnet expected later in Q3 2025. When rolled out, Byreal could help Bybit tap into a growing market of users who prefer non-custodial, transparent platforms.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , still priced at $0.03, is catching serious traction with early investors betting big on its DeFi utility and sky-high upside potential. The project has gained more than 12,000 investors who have contributed $10.6 million during the ongoing presale. While veteran meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to trade around $0.000013, its path to $1 has long been seen as more symbolic than probable. In contrast, Mutuum Finance’s low supply mechanics and viral momentum give it a realistic chance to surge, with some analysts forecasting a 44x ROI by year’s end. For those scanning the market for the next big crypto or the best cheap crypto to buy now, MUTM may be the token with actual $1 potential. Shiba Inu Holds Steady as Meme Coin Ecosystem Evolves Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000013, showing minimal movement on the day. Over the past month, SHIB has fluctuated to the $0.000014 price, supported by ongoing developments like the Shibarium Layer‑2 upgrade and token burn mechanisms aimed at improving scalability and reducing supply. Nevertheless, Shiba Inu continues to attract attention from its dedicated community and remains a staple in meme‑coin portfolios. Amid this market, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging, drawing interest for their potential DeFi utility and upside. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.6 million total sales and attracted more than 12000 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Certified Secure: USD-Pegged Stablecoin Validated by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Mutuum Finance is quickly outpacing legacy meme coins like Shiba Inu, raising over $10.6 million from 12,000+ early investors while still priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale. With a fixed launch price of $0.06, early buyers are positioned for 100% gains, and analysts project potential returns of up to 44x by year’s end. Unlike SHIB, whose path to $1 remains highly speculative due to its massive supply, MUTM leverages low supply mechanics, a Certik-audited DeFi infrastructure, and a collateralized stablecoin launch to build real momentum and lasting utility.

These days, several other companies are trying to follow in Strategy’s footsteps. As more companies go all-in on stacking Bitcoin, critics are raising concerns about the growing centralization of crypto treasuries. Currently, just 216 entities—101 of which are public companies—hold nearly 31% of the circulating BTC supply, with corporate treasuries alone accounting for approximately 765,300 bitcoins, or 3.7% of total supply (excluding lost coins). This trend shows no sign of slowing, with existing firms continuing to accumulate and new players entering the space. This prompts debate over the benefits and risks of corporate Bitcoin ownership. Read more: Anthony Pompliano plots $750m Bitcoin buy via SPAC merger: report The trend is in full swing A wave of high-profile crypto treasury launches is underway, led by figures like Jack Mallers with 21 Capital, David Bailey with Nakamoto, and most recently Anthony Pompliano with ProCapBTC, which is reportedly raising $750 million in equity and convertible debt to accumulate Bitcoin. Each new treasury announcement is met with bullish fanfare on Crypto Twitter, where influencers routinely frame the news as a catalyst for BTC price appreciation. Yet with such announcements now occurring almost daily, their actual impact is increasingly unclear. The familiar refrain of “this is not priced in” has become a cliché, while comment sections often reflect confusion over why Bitcoin’s price continues to fall despite seemingly bullish developments. FACT: ¥3.9 TRILLION SOFTBANK IS INVESTING BILLIONS IN A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUY MORE #BITCOIN THAN MICROSTRATEGY THIS IS NOT PRICED IN 🔥 pic.twitter.com/5vxwP4UUOK — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 7, 2025 Do Bitcoin treasuries pump BTC’s price? According to the Gemini research, the growing adoption among sovereign and regulated financial institutions led to decreased volatility in all time frames after 2018. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 made the trend even stronger. Despite the stabilization of the Bitcoin price, it doesn’t stop gaining value. The main difference is that now the price rises steadily without the frequent high-amplitude fluctuations it had in the past. According to Unchained, Bitcoin’s price is stuck between $100,000 and $110,000, and it will take a long time for it to exceed the $130,000 mark. People don’t pay attention to many things while reading bombastic announcements. One is a lack of retail interest, as the public tends to pay attention to Bitcoin when it hits an all-time high or at similar periods. Another reason for slower price movement is that Bitcoin treasuries not only buy BTC but dump it, too, as they need cash to repurchase shares. Additionally, the announcements usually display the full amount of the deal (i.e., “Pompliano to raise $750 million to invest in Bitcoin treasury”), whereas, in reality, these amounts are raised slowly; it may take several months to complete the deals. So it comes that the purchases made by Bitcoin treasuries are not what they may seem to be. Finally, the relentless accumulation of Bitcoin is pulling coins away from circulation, making a notable part of the supply dormant and somewhat purposeless for years. Bitcoin treasuries need this crypto to attract more investors and clients. However, it drives Bitcoin away from its initial role as an alternative electronic cash, and some in the crypto community raise critical voices directed at Bitcoin treasuries. This mass accumulation of Bitcoin by corporates & ETFs is getting very close to Satoshi's original vision of us never having to actually use the Bitcoin network. — Nic (@nicrypto) June 12, 2025 The ‘not your keys, not your coins’ attitude is alive and well Many Bitcoin enthusiasts prefer actually to own their bitcoins and don’t outsource all the hassle to corporations. Maximalists remind us that any entity does not control Bitcoin, and it is free to purchase, so there is no need for a company to buy and maintain Bitcoin on your behalf. Some criticize Bitcoin treasuries for not representing the spirit of Bitcoin, while others emphasize the troubled past of Bitcoin treasury frontmen. For instance, MicroStrategy had a questionable episode during the dot-com bubble era, whereas the company restated its profits, resulting in losses for the investors. The SEC accused the company of fraud. At the time, Saylor spoke about his plans to donate $100 million to the Internet university that will provide “free education for everyone on earth, forever.” This kind of evangelism may sound familiar to those who follow Saylor’s modern-day speeches , while he is more grounded when dealing with Bitcoin. What Magoo really means, is that bitcoin treasury companies need a professional Orange Washer An influencer already trusted by the plebs, who can toe the line between LARP'ing as a maxi, and shilling his stock as being superior to real BTC Aka, the used car salesman type https://t.co/nb9VuLJ66w — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 11, 2025 For some, Pompliano is an ambiguous candidate for helming the new mighty Bitcoin treasury. While Pompliano is a well-known and recognizable Bitcoin advocate, some remember his involvement in promoting fraudster crypto exchange FTX and its associated platform, BlockFi. Collapses of these platforms were painful not only for its users but also impacted the entire crypto sector, crashing the market and infusing cryptocurrency distrust among the community outsiders and, more importantly, regulators. So true. For example, I lost most of my savings after listening to your podcast and putting it into BlockFi. Completely changed my life! — GSx (@Wade24T) November 28, 2022 Some Bitcoin owners watch the performance of the treasury company’s stocks or ETFs and sell their bitcoins to buy these assets, hoping for quicker gains. Adam Back, a Blockstream CEO and the only person whose work is referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper urged his followers not to sell their bitcoins to buy ETFs or similar assets as they won’t be able to buy them back. some are selling their btc to ETFs and pubCos. dudes: HODL. you won't be able to buy them back before long. but also other users are buying, this is the way. — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 12, 2025 Then, what’s good in Bitcoin treasuries? The same person urging us not to sell bitcoins, Adam Back, explained that Bitcoin treasuries “are bringing forward the Bitcoin adoption curve.” $MSTR & $BTC Treasuries by @adam3us : ""They are basically an arbitrage between the fiat current [system] and the hyper-bitcoinezed future. And if you can buy #Bitcoin today and pay for it in 5 years or convert into equity you are bringing forward the Bitcoin adoption curve.."" pic.twitter.com/UAF4bmCZUC — Marco ₿attistoni (@Battistoshi93) June 2, 2025 Back pointed out that most people don’t have money and opportunities to acquire Bitcoin. In contrast, public companies have these opportunities to raise capital by selling their shares or vice versa. These companies don’t need free money to invest in Bitcoin as they can buy Bitcoin in advance and pay for it years later. “They are basically an arbitrage between the fiat [monetary system] and the hyper-bitcoinized future.” A more mainstream explanation is that shares and ETFs are easier to deal with for institutional investors than Bitcoin. So they don’t have to worry about the Bitcoin legal status and lack of the company around it. Instead, they can deal with a public company that offers some guarantees and is traded just like other public companies while exposing clients to the Bitcoin price appreciation. Generally speaking, these treasuries are helping TradFi traders and investors to benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation without having to deal with Bitcoin.

In their session, “Proof of Redemption: From (Prison) Bars to Bitcoin,” the duo introduced “Hash Over Cash” — a program that channels outdated mining equipment and donated hashpower into workforce reintegration and hands-on job training for formerly incarcerated individuals. Instead of relying solely on monetary donations, the initiative invites companies and individual miners to contribute used or broken ASIC rigs — or even temporarily redirect mining output. BitFord handles repair, resale, and routing of proceeds, while the Bitcoin Transformation Community leads reentry-focused training programs where participants learn real-world tech skills like diagnosing and refurbishing mining hardware. “Cash donations often get stuck in red tape,” Ford explained. But a pallet of old machines? That’s something companies can greenlight fast—and it still comes with a tax deduction.” With plans to scale nationally and early support from firms like Bldg 96, Hash Over Cash is positioning itself as a blueprint for sustainable impact in Bitcoin. We spoke with Ford to learn more about the program’s vision, its implications for social equity in crypto, and how mining can empower a new generation of Bitcoin builders. You might also like: Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst You and Justin Rhedrick introduced this at Bitcoin 2025. Why now? Timing matters. The Bitcoin and crypto industries are maturing, but there’s still a major access gap, especially when it comes to underserved communities and people impacted by the justice system. Justin and I connected through a shared belief that Bitcoin should be a tool for empowerment, not just speculation. He’s done incredible work on the education and reentry side, and BitFord has the infrastructure and access to hardware. I also understand from experience the challenges that people go through when they try to reintegrate For all these reasons, the partnership felt obvious. Now was the moment to turn good intentions into actual action. Can you share a moment from your own journey that made you realize how important workforce reintegration is? One moment that really stuck with me was when I was in a correctional facility and noticed how little access women had to anything related to crypto. Often they’re the ones that need Bitcoin the most because the fiat economy has turned its back on them. But they have no access to current tools, no concept of crypto’s real-world application. What they do have, though, is so much curiosity and motivation. It hit me that we don’t have a talent gap. We have an access gap. If we can bridge that, we unlock not only opportunity for individuals, but resilience for the ecosystem. What are the technical skills participants will leave with—and how do those translate into real jobs in the Bitcoin or tech space ? Participants will learn to diagnose, repair, and maintain Bitcoin mining rigs. That includes everything from identifying hardware failures to cleaning, testing, and optimizing ASIC machines. These are transferable skills, especially as more mining operations decentralize and need on-site tech support. But beyond mining, we’re giving people a gateway into hardware repair, logistics, and IT infrastructure work. These are roles that are always in demand. How do you vet or select program participants? Is there a focus on certain communities or regions? That part is led by Justin and the Bitcoin Transformation Community . They work closely with correctional education programs, reentry organizations, and community partners who understand the needs on the ground. Our focus is on those who are underserved by traditional workforce pipelines. Right now, we’re starting in TK, but the vision is national. You might also like: From cellblock to blockchain: Bitford Digital CEO Jill Ford wields Bitcoin to shake up TradFi How does this model scale? Could we see training hubs across multiple states or prison systems? Absolutely. That’s the plan. We’re already designing mobile training units that can be deployed in correctional facilities or reentry centers. The beauty of this model is that it’s modular. Wherever there’s access to equipment and willing partners, we can build a program. We also want to empower returning citizens to become trainers themselves, so the knowledge ripple continues. You mentioned public companies can move faster with hardware donations than with cash. What role do tax deductions play in motivating corporate donors? Tax deductions absolutely play a role. Donated hardware can often be written off faster and more cleanly than cash, especially if the equipment is already depreciated. For public companies, this is often easier to approve internally because it doesn’t come from a budget line. It comes from inventory. And we’re providing full documentation for those donations, making the accounting side seamless. That said, tax laws are complex and can vary. It’s crucial to consult with a qualified tax professional to determine the best approach for any given business situation. Any barriers that you have encountered in getting large mining firms to participate, and how are you addressing those? The biggest barrier is mindset. A lot of firms still think of ESG or social impact as a cost center, not a competitive advantage. We’re all about changing that narrative. This is about building long-term resilience not just for people, but for the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. The firms that get it are already signing on. For those who don’t yet, we’re showing them the upside: brand equity, tax efficiency, and a stronger, more decentralized network. What kind of career paths are you envisioning for BTC graduates? Short term, we’re preparing them for jobs in mining repair, logistics, hardware maintenance, and data center support. Long term, we want to open pathways to entrepreneurship. Imagine someone who was once incarcerated now running a node, managing a warehouse, or even launching their own repair shop. This isn’t about charity, per se, it’s about capacity building. What do you say to skeptics who may not understand why Bitcoin or mining is relevant to reentry or social impact? I always say: Bitcoin means freedom. That’s because Bitcoin is all about ownership, autonomy, and access. That’s incredibly relevant to people who’ve had their freedom restricted and are trying to rebuild their lives. Mining is one of the few tech sectors where you can learn real, in-demand skills without a four-year degree or perfect resume. It’s hands-on, it’s scalable, and it can serve as a bridge to something bigger. Trump’s strong support for domestic Bitcoin mining—including a call to make the U.S. the global mining capital—has run into resistance in rural areas that are directly impacted by noise pollution, environmental concerns, and industrial encroachment. Backlashes have occurred in New York (i.e., Dresden and Niagara Falls) and Granbury, Texas; Mining sites have led to public complaints, legal restrictions, and sound mitigation efforts. The story underscores a key irony: grassroots opposition to this administration’s pro-Bitcoin agenda is growing in the very places that helped elect him, raising questions about whether his crypto ambitions can succeed politically at the local level. What do you say to mining skeptics and the potential backlash of such initiatives? Look, skepticism is always healthy. But not all mining looks the same. We need to separate irresponsible practices from sustainable, community-led solutions. Our initiative is small-scale and deeply rooted in reuse and repair. We’re not dropping 10-megawatt facilities into quiet towns. We’re refurbishing hardware, training people, and building micro-opportunities that integrate with communities, not overrun them. If the future of mining is going to succeed in the U.S., it has to be local, sustainable, and accountable.

In a new episode of the All-In podcast, Palihapitiya says current forecasts of the US economy are overly negative and don’t factor in the potential development of two events. According to Palihapitiya, President Trump’s tariffs are likely on track to contribute an extra $300 billion in receipts to the US government’s current account in what he says is a big positive for the economy. The investor says that when factoring in the likelihood of at least 100 basis points in Fed rate cuts, the US is on track to save $300 billion as well – meaning a total of $600 billion in revenue boosts to the United States, providing a big jump to overall confidence in the American economy and markets. “We all thought that this was like a bogeyman that you weren’t allowed to touch it, and if you touched the stove, you’re going to get burned. The mathematical reality is that this is actually going to work out much better for us than we anticipated, and it’s going to be somewhere in the range of $300 to $400 billion of extra revenue per year. That’s a huge win. So why is that important? That then sets up this next cataclysmic thing that we’re going to see in the next 60 days, which is, what does Jerome Powell do? If Jerome Powell stays politicized, his incentive will be to keep interest rates where they are. If Jerome Powell looks at the conditions on the ground, especially when you start seeing inflation stay in the low 2s, and approach 2.0, the real thing that he’s going to be under tremendous pressure to justify is ‘Why are you not cutting?’ And just to give you a sense of how important that is, if we cut by a hundred basis points, that’s another $300 billion. In that case, that’s not money we get in, but it’s money we don’t have to spend. So if you add these two things together, we are in the next 60 days, going to have to reforecast the American balance sheet where this is, or we’re actually going to be able to positively forecast an extra $600 billion – $300 billion of incremental revenue and $300 billion of savings. If that happens, watch out. It means that every single risked dollar is going to run to America. Every single one.

In a recently resurfaced video shared by Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist on X, Kiyosaki urged investors to reconsider their savings strategy—specifically, to stop saving U.S. dollars and start investing in digital assets like XRP and Bitcoin. A Wake-Up Call to Investors In the video clip, Kiyosaki challenged conventional financial thinking and criticized what he described as a widespread, dangerous dependency on fiat currency. “Can’t you see what’s happening?” he said. “People will still rather save dollars. There’s a brainwash there. Why don’t you save XRP and Bitcoin? Why are you saving this [dollars]?” His remarks reflect deep concern about the long-term value of the U.S. dollar, especially as inflation remains persistent and central banks continue aggressive monetary expansion. For Kiyosaki, saving dollars is not just unwise—it’s a trap. A while back we had the rare opportunity to speak with Robert Kiyosaki. Discussing XRP, BTC, Gold & Silver. FYI: XRP was below $0.50 pic.twitter.com/zhMkTqiKK7 — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) June 13, 2025 Why XRP? Timing and Vision What makes Kiyosaki’s advice even more significant is the timing. When he voiced this perspective, XRP was still trading under $0.50. Fast forward to today, XRP has climbed to $2.17—reflecting rising investor confidence, institutional interest, and the benefits of Ripple’s expanding global presence. While Kiyosaki has long praised Bitcoin and precious metals like gold and silver, his inclusion of XRP was notable. It suggests a growing recognition of XRP’s utility in solving real-world problems, particularly in the global payments sector. From Criticism to Clarity Kiyosaki’s message isn’t just another speculative endorsement—it’s a warning rooted in decades of financial insight. He’s been consistent in highlighting the risks of inflation, central bank policies, and overreliance on paper currency. His advocacy for Bitcoin and now XRP reflects a belief that the financial future will be shaped by assets outside traditional banking systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP, in particular, is gaining momentum as Ripple continues to ink strategic partnerships with financial institutions, expands liquidity solutions, and integrates tools like RLUSD to support on-chain settlements. As adoption grows, Kiyosaki’s once-controversial advice looks increasingly prescient. A Message That Aged Well For investors who took his advice when XRP was below $0.50, the returns have already been substantial. Yet, for Kiyosaki, the message goes beyond profit—it’s about preserving wealth in a world where fiat currencies face growing instability. As XRP trades above $2 and crypto adoption accelerates, Kiyosaki’s appeal to “save XRP and Bitcoin” instead of dollars is no longer just contrarian—it’s becoming common sense for those watching the writing on the wall.
