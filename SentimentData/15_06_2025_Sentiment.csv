Speaking at the XRPL Apex event, Garlinghouse offered a forecast that, within the next five years, XRPL could facilitate as much as 14% of the total transaction volume currently processed by SWIFT, the widely used global interbank messaging system. Garlinghouse emphasized that the real challenge in cross-border payments lies in liquidity, not messaging. He pointed out that while SWIFT remains essential for moving information between financial institutions, its primary function is ultimately to support the transfer of actual monetary value. He argued that blockchain platforms like XRPL are better positioned to streamline this function through native liquidity and real-time settlement capabilities. Quantifying the 14% Projection Following the CEO’s statement, a user on X known as “XRPMillionaire” used xAI’s Grok to break down the implications. Based on SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion in annual transaction volume, 14% would represent $21 trillion processed by XRPL each year. This would amount to roughly $58 billion in daily transactions. If this market share were to be achieved gradually over five years, it would imply a steady increase of 2.8% annually, or approximately $4.2 trillion processed per year. Market Reactions and Price Estimates These projections have led to renewed optimism within the XRP community, especially regarding the potential for long-term value appreciation. Despite XRP trading at around $2.13 and still sitting below its all-time high set several years ago, many investors and analysts now see room for significant price increases if such utility materializes. Several valuation models have emerged in response to this outlook. One analysis projects a potential XRP price of $12 if liquidity demand rises in proportion to transaction volume. This estimate assumes the token would be used and recycled approximately 30 times per year, necessitating a liquidity base of around $700 billion to support the full $21 trillion annual volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other forecasts, which account for increasing institutional interest and the speculative nature of the crypto market, suggest that XRP could trade between $18 and $24 under favorable market conditions. However, some observers have called for a broader examination of the competitive landscape. If XRP were to capture 14% of SWIFT’s total volume, the question remains: which platforms or technologies will handle the remaining 86%? Projects such as Chainlink have already begun working directly with SWIFT, positioning themselves as potential players in the evolving financial infrastructure. While XRP’s capacity to handle trillions in annual payments remains speculative, Garlinghouse’s remarks and the subsequent analysis have provided concrete figures for what such a scenario might entail. The discussion now turns to whether XRP can effectively scale to meet these expectations and how it will compete in a landscape that is becoming increasingly crowded with blockchain-based solutions.

Worldcoin (WLD) is also gaining traction after crossing $1.18, helped by strong market volume. But beyond the charts, another name is turning heads for a different reason. BlockDAG (BDAG) isn’t just focused on price action—it’s building something broader. A large-scale US sponsorship is rumored to be in motion, and if confirmed, it could make BlockDAG one of the most widely recognized projects before even listing. The move would not only boost trust and visibility; it could bring BDAG into everyday conversation across countries and industries. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy in 2025, this mix of scale and timing is becoming hard to overlook. SUI Price Climbs Past $3.40 on ETF Buzz and Growing Demand The SUI price performance is seeing a solid recovery. From June 9 to June 11, SUI gained 7.9%, climbing back to $3.40. A key reason for the lift was Nasdaq’s 19b-4 filing to list a spot SUI ETF with 21Shares. That announcement helped push SUI through the $3.55 resistance line, turning it into support. Volume surged to $930 million in 24 hours, and SUI’s Total Value Locked now stands at $1.77 billion, showing strong usage in DeFi and gaming. The SUI price also broke out of a descending channel, with EMA crossovers and bullish momentum supporting targets of $4.50 and above if the trend continues. WLD Moves Past $1.18 as Breakout Signals Grow Worldcoin (WLD) posted a 5.4% rise on June 10, moving from $1.11 to $1.18. This came just as Google Cloud’s partnership with OpenAI made headlines, helping boost trader interest. Volume jumped by 38% to $208 million. Technicals also support the move. WLD has cleared its 50-period EMA and is now sitting in a breakout range between $1.05 and $1.15. The MACD is signaling strength, and RSI near 62 adds to the bullish case. Chart patterns show a rising wedge and triangle formations that point to a potential surge. If WLD clears $1.20–$1.24, targets between $1.28 and $1.60 could come into play. Support at $1.05–$1.10 remains strong, making this one of the better-positioned breakout plays at the moment. BlockDAG’s US Push Could Redefine What a Presale Can Do BlockDAG has already raised $303 million and sold 22.6 billion coins. It’s currently in Batch 29 of its presale, priced at $0.0276. Those who bought during Batch 1 have already earned a 2,660% return. But the latest twist? A special extended offer now allows users to buy at just $0.0018 for six more days. With the launch price set at $0.05, this window offers a potential ROI of 2,678%. That alone is a major draw. But it’s what’s happening outside the price chart that’s capturing attention. A rumored US-based sponsorship deal could soon take BDAG’s reach global. Widespread branding and televised exposure could turn BDAG into a name recognized even beyond the crypto world. Most projects chase attention after they launch. BlockDAG is flipping that model by building mass appeal in advance. It’s already backed by a CertiK audit, is EVM-compatible, and supports zero gas fees through its DAG-based infrastructure. Its X1 Miner app has attracted over 2 million users in more than 150 countries. Features like Buyer Battles and referral streaks make it not just easy to use, but addictive. BlockDAG isn’t just checking boxes. It’s rewriting how crypto connects with people. If the sponsorship is confirmed, BDAG won’t just launch, it’ll arrive already embedded in culture. That’s what makes it such a strong pick for anyone watching for the best crypto to buy right now Final Thoughts SUI is making progress with renewed institutional interest and a push from ETF news. WLD is showing signs of breaking higher on technical strength and narrative momentum. But for those looking beyond chart patterns, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for something more powerful. With $303 million raised, a special $0.0018 entry point, over 22.6 billion coins sold, and a listing price of $0.05, the upside is clear. The 2,678% ROI window is only open for six more days. Add to that a US sponsorship on the horizon, and BDAG is shaping up to be a serious player. It’s not just another presale. It’s an early-stage opportunity with real-world branding and user traction, setting a new standard for what crypto launches can achieve. For those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG may already be leading the way.

As the broader crypto space navigates renewed attention and shifting capital flows, select assets are standing out not for noise, but for solid infrastructure and development momentum. Among the top cryptos to invest in for short term, Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Cosmos are leading discussions across the space. With Qubetics offering a truly integrated multi-chain experience through its application, and the added traction around its token presale, this project has become a critical contender for short-term upside. Meanwhile, XRP continues to demonstrate its relevance through international payment corridors and growing adoption among traditional finance institutions. At the same time, Cosmos is rapidly advancing blockchain interoperability, attracting developer interest and on-chain liquidity. These three digital assets are building strong foundations for immediate relevance in the current cycle, making them standout picks among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Qubetics Multi‑Chain Wallet: The Future of Web3 User Experience At the center of Qubetics ‘ appeal is a breakthrough in digital asset management—the Qubetics Wallet. This product is designed as a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with support across mobile and desktop operating systems. As a key component of Qubetics’ broader ecosystem, this application empowers users to manage, transact, and interact with assets across major blockchain networks from a single interface. In a fragmented environment where most users juggle multiple wallets or custodial platforms, Qubetics offers an unprecedented level of utility. The wallet supports native $TICS tokens and is compatible with iOS, Android, and web-based systems. From small business operators handling cross-border payments in stablecoins to NFT creators selling digital collectibles across marketplaces, Qubetics provides seamless, secure access with no dependency on third parties. As digital asset adoption increases globally, the demand for self-custodial, interoperable tools will only rise. Qubetics is positioning itself at the center of that trend, building real-world use for its application, and validating its place among the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in for Short Term Gains Qubetics has officially reached the final stretch of its public token sale, entering Stage 37 with strong momentum. Priced at $0.3370, the Qubetics presale has already raised over $18 million, selling more than 515 million $TICS tokens to a growing community of 27,900+ holders. With only 10 million tokens remaining at this final price, the window to secure entry before the listing is quickly narrowing. Once the presale concludes, $TICS will list at $0.40—offering a built-in 20% return to those who join now. What makes this presale even more strategic is Qubetics’ updated tokenomics: a dramatic supply cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion and a public allocation increase to 38.55%, reinforcing both scarcity and decentralization. With this balance of financial upside and community-driven design, Qubetics is rapidly being positioned as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term performance. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale rate. At $0.3370, that amount secures around 14,837 $TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this holding immediately rises to $5,934—a gain of $934 before any post-launch appreciation. For those aiming at more aggressive returns, projections ranging between $5 to $10 per token suggest that same $5,000 could scale up to as much as $74,000–$148,000 during the next market cycle. This combination of immediate ROI and high upside potential is why Qubetics is now being recognized as the best crypto presale currently live—and why it’s dominating discussions around the top cryptos to invest in for short term growth. XRP: Expanding Institutional Utility in Global Payments XRP continues to gain relevance as a solution for institutional-grade cross-border transfers. Its utility-driven design enables near-instant settlements, low fees, and minimal counterparty risk—factors increasingly valued by banks, fintech firms, and payment processors. The XRP Ledger is also integrating smart contract capabilities, allowing tokenized assets and programmable finance to live directly on the chain without requiring external solutions. Recent developments have further solidified XRP’s case as one of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Its presence in Asia-Pacific payment channels is expanding, and partnerships with financial platforms have increased XRP’s daily volume across regulated corridors. Regulatory clarity is also improving, providing a more favorable outlook for adoption in regions that previously held back institutional engagement. As financial platforms scale up the use of on-chain tools, XRP remains well-positioned to serve both compliance-driven needs and next-generation payment architecture. Cosmos: Redefining Blockchain Interoperability with IBC Cosmos is one of the most compelling infrastructure-layer projects making waves in today’s market, due in large part to its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Cosmos enables secure, standardized communication between independent chains, solving one of crypto’s most persistent technical challenges. The architecture allows sovereign blockchains to interact without sacrificing scalability or governance, creating a truly interoperable network of networks. Recent updates to Cosmos Hub and its expanding validator set are drawing attention from both DeFi builders and application-layer protocols. Interchain accounts, smart routing, and shared security features now allow protocols to operate across ecosystems more efficiently. As a result, protocols that once relied on Ethereum or Solana for liquidity and composability are beginning to consider Cosmos for its flexibility and development-ready environment. This unique positioning places Cosmos comfortably within the top cryptos to invest in for short term, particularly for those tracking growth in cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. Conclusion Qubetics, XRP, and Cosmos each present a unique value proposition for short-term participants seeking informed exposure. Qubetics stands out with its web3 aggregator model and a high-impact Qubetics presale, offering structured growth and compelling ROI scenarios. XRP continues to lead the institutional payment narrative through expanding real-world partnerships and regulatory momentum. Cosmos is delivering on its promise of true cross-chain operability, attracting forward-thinking protocols and community members alike. Among all available opportunities, these three digital assets earn their place on the shortlist of the top cryptos to invest in for short term. Participants seeking immediate utility and future scalability should strongly consider joining this best crypto presale while opportunity remains.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00006717 to $0.00007676. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000125 with an average price of $0.00012. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine.

Bonk price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.00001468 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 1.42 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators favor sellers, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000125, which is approximately 691% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its value decreased to $0.00001468. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent depreciation. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000020. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000125 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

The ruling was issued on Wednesday by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and stems from a long-running digital asset fraud scheme involving the fraudulent sale of a virtual currency known as My Big Coin (MBC). The court’s decision includes a $19.3 million civil monetary penalty and an additional $6.4 million in restitution for customers who were deceived by misleading claims about the coin’s value and backing. According to the CFTC’s official press release , from January 2014 to June 2017, the defendants falsely promoted MBC as a fully functional digital currency backed by gold and actively traded on established platforms. In reality, the currency lacked any such support or market presence. Over $6 million was collected from at least 28 customers under pretenses, while the funds were largely misappropriated by co-defendant Randall Crater, who was previously convicted and sentenced to more than eight years in prison for his central role in the scheme. The court’s latest order resolves the commodities regulator’s civil enforcement claims against Gillespie, Roche, and the two Nevada-based My Big Coin companies. It also imposes a permanent trading ban on the defendants, barring them from participating in any CFTC-regulated markets or registering with the agency. Crater, the primary orchestrator of the fraud, was earlier sentenced in a separate criminal case and ordered to forfeit and repay more than $7.6 million In a statement, the agency said. “The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.” The post Court Slaps My Big Coin: Founders Hit With $25.8M Penalty for Defrauding Crypto Investors appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-14 21:32:27

Analyst Says ETH Needs To Hold Above This Support",https://bitcoinist.com/can-ethereum-price-return-to-4000-eth-this-support/,"The Ethereum price was on a tear at the start of this week, breaking above the $2,800 level for the first time since February 2025. However, the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran hurt risk assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum bearing most of the downward pressure in the crypto market. The price of Ethereum fell from above $2,800 toward the psychological $2,500 level, reflecting a significant break from the altcoin’s recent bullish progress. However, historical price data shows that the Ethereum price might be just fine so long as it stays above the $2,500 support. Is A Return To $4,000 Possible For Ethereum Price? In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Rekt Capital explained the current setup of the Ethereum price after its latest decline and the potential implications on its future trajectory. According to the online pundit, the second-largest cryptocurrency has established the $2,500 zone as a significant support cushion. After a rough first quarter of the year, the price of Ethereum experienced an explosive start to May, rising back above the $2,000 mark. However, the altcoin had struggled to break above $2,800 before this past week, typically settling above the $2,500 support after facing rejection at this resistance level. According to Rekt Capital, the Ethereum price has shown a strong degree of stability above the $2,500 level over the past five weeks. The crypto analyst noted that if this trend continues, the altcoin’s value could witness a significant surge and return to around the $4,000 region. Rekt Capital highlighted that holding the $2,500 as support has facilitated extended Ethereum price rallies toward $4,000 in the past. As shown in the chart below, the price of ETH made a strong move to the $4,000 zone in late 2024 after hovering around $2,500 throughout August to October. The last time the price of Ethereum was at $4,000 was in mid-December 2024, preceding an almost 60% crash in early parts of the year. A return to this cycle peak for ETH could mark the beginning of a fairly anticipated altcoin season. As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,577, reflecting an almost 3% decline in the past 24 hours. Ethereum Dominance Reaches Five-Year High In a separate post on X, Rekt Capital revealed that the Ethereum Dominance has been climbing over the past few days. The latest data indicate that the altcoin has now achieved 10% market dominance for the first time since 2020, continuing its uptrend. If this positive trend continues and the altcoin’s market dominance continues to improve, investors could see the Ethereum price go on an impressive upside run. Moreover, this could also mean diminishing Bitcoin dominance and an improved likelihood of seeing an altseason this cycle.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH Price|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-14 22:00:06

The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Trump’s Token Windfall According to the disclosure, Trump’s income line reads “$57,437,927.” It doesn’t say if he sold tokens, earned staking rewards, or used another method. But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details The disclosure also notes his past digital ventures. He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

Industry experts have highlighted how this technical upgrade could benefit digital assets like XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM). XRP and XLM are designed to work well with modern systems. Experts say they could become a larger part of global payments and transform how money moves worldwide. Global Financial Systems Are Moving to ISO 20022 Standard ISO 20022 allows financial institutions to send payment information clearly and in a structured. It improves data quality, increases transparency, and helps systems across countries collaborate more easily. In a video shared on X, the payments company Stronghold showed how it is using ISO 20022 along with blockchain technology . A company spokesperson explained that this combination improves how money is moved and makes the process more reliable and efficient. Stronghold is already using ISO 20022 messaging in real financial projects. This shows that blockchain and traditional systems can work together, rather than compete. Notably, it was revealed that all Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payments moved to ISO 20022 in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced plans to adopt the standard in July. This move will replace the outdated Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM). Meanwhile, SWIFT has announced that it will fully transition to ISO 20022 by November. This global shift is poised to change how traditional and digital financial systems work together. XRP and XLM Are Built for This Change It was spotlighted that digital assets like XRP and XLM are better suited to connect with banks and payment systems. These digital currencies are fast, low-cost , and built to follow rules and standards, making them a good match for ISO 20022-based systems. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also recognises XRP and XLM as digital assets with strong potential to play key roles in future financial networks. As more banks switch to ISO 20022, they may turn to these for faster, safer, and cheaper payments. Stronghold Taps Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger for Real-World Use In a separate video clip , Stronghold’s CEO, Tammy Camp, explained that the company uses tools like Ripple, Stellar, and Interledger to link fiat money with digital systems. These technologies help bridge traditional and blockchain-based finance. They are connected through simple APIs, allowing different platforms to communicate and work smoothly. This setup helps Stronghold move money between banks and blockchain networks in real time. It also shows how XRP and XLM can support regular financial services without causing disruption.

BlockDAG, now in batch 29 of its presale, has raised more than $302 million directly from the public. There were no hedge funds, no private rounds, no seed investors—just organic momentum powered by retail users. While major chains like Ethereum and Solana depend on insider funding, BlockDAG has chosen a community-first path. This is more than a presale. It’s a full rejection of the old model. And the numbers show it’s working. This is truly the people’s crypto. No VC Funding, No Privileges — Just Genuine Demand BlockDAG stands out not just because of the amount raised, but because of how it raised it. Most big projects depend on private sales backed by Silicon Valley and hedge funds. BlockDAG opened its doors only to the public. There were no special discounts for insiders or influencers. No early unlocks for private buyers. Everyone joined on the same terms with full transparency. This removes the usual advantage held by big funds, putting community first. The public responded strongly. With over $302 million raised purely from retail support, BlockDAG reached a level of momentum that many VC-backed projects never achieve. Ethereum and Solana: Built by Few, Owned by Few To see why BlockDAG is different, consider the usual model. Ethereum’s early supply heavily favored insiders and developers, giving them large long-term gains. Solana also benefited from big VC backers like a16z and Alameda, creating wide gaps between public buyers and early insiders. This VC-driven setup shaped today’s market—powerful chains controlled by a few, with latecomers often priced out of meaningful returns. While marketed as decentralized, their token distributions tell a different story. BlockDAG changes that story. The People’s Chain: Powered by $302 Million in Public Support Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG has sold over 22.6 billion coins. Its active community engages publicly on Telegram, Discord, and through the X1 mining app, which has more than 1.5 million users worldwide. The X1 app lets anyone mine BDAG coins from their smartphones, creating a peer-to-peer, scalable onboarding method without needing institutional backing. This grassroots approach is succeeding. Rather than chasing institutional interest or hype, BlockDAG grows from real user activity—no boardrooms, no private deals, just people. A New Chapter for 2025: Community Capital Over Venture Capital Crypto is shifting. Users want chains without hidden power behind “decentralization.” Many claim to be open but block access through high fees, opaque governance, or limited early entry. BlockDAG breaks this pattern. This isn’t a token promising “community” while serving VC exits. It’s a network funded by everyday users, shown in real time by presale growth and app engagement. Supporters aren’t betting on hype—they’re building the future. Ethereum’s power still rests with whales and Layer-2 intermediaries. Solana leans on ETFs and institutional interest. BlockDAG has 1.5 million phone miners spreading the word organically. Why BlockDAG Is Ahead While others depend on big partnerships and VC money, BlockDAG sticks to execution: Over $302 million raised with zero VC backing 1.5 million+ active X1 miners 22.6 billion+ coins sold Currently in batch 29 at $0.0276 Tools and apps live before exchange listings BlockDAG isn’t aiming to be another “Ethereum killer” or a meme fad. It builds user-level utility first and scales organically. Its batch presale rewards early supporters fairly, with transparent demand-driven pricing and no artificial scarcity or hidden unlocks. Final Word: Crypto Needs Users, Not Kings The market doesn’t need another Solana or Ethereum. What it truly needs is a project that reflects the people who support it, use it daily, and believe in its future. BlockDAG shows what happens when the gatekeepers are removed, allowing the public to take the lead. This approach raises more than just funds—it builds lasting trust and a genuine community. While other projects chase headlines and institutional deals, BlockDAG focuses on steady, organic growth with real users at the center. This foundation positions it strongly for long-term success and sustainability in crypto market.

AI chips are currently being positioned as the backbone of the next wave of global computing and defense technologies. Every disruption in supply chains matters for companies intending to capitalize on this technology, and Taiwan is standing firmly in the way of China’s innovation. Taiwan rolls out export ban on China Taiwan has blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) and restricted both companies’ access to crucial chip-building technologies. The decision was published by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. Under the new rules, both Huawei and SMIC, along with several of their subsidiaries in Russia, Japan, and Germany, have been added to an updated “strategic high-tech commodities entity list,” which requires them to have government approval for any Taiwanese company to export goods or technologies to them. Taiwan’s updated restrictions specifically target the infrastructure and materials necessary for advanced chip production, including plant construction technologies and manufacturing equipment. According to a Bloomberg report in 2023, this restriction will compromise Huawei and SMIC’s ability to continue developing their network of covert chip plants. The network of chips is located across southern China and has reportedly been receiving support from some Taiwanese companies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s most advanced chipmaker, previously ceased business with Huawei in 2020 in compliance with U.S. export restrictions. Now, the rest of Taiwan’s high-tech industry will be expected to follow suit under domestic law. This may halt Huawei and SMIC’s efforts to replicate or replace the kind of high-performance chips that Taiwan exports to firms like Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions disrupt chip markets In early 2025, Taiwan’s newly inaugurated President, Lai Ching-te, made headlines for describing China as a “foreign hostile force.” Lai’s administration also launched a suite of measures aimed at countering Beijing’s infiltration tactics and its political influence operations on the island. Beijing has repeatedly asserted that Taiwan is part of its sovereign territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve what it calls a “peaceful reunification.” It appears that, due to the unlikelihood of outright military conflict in the short term, Taiwan and China are escalating their tensions via the tech industry. Both Huawei and SMIC have spent years trying to work around the export bans of the United States and its allied countries. In 2023, the companies stunned U.S. lawmakers with a surprise 7-nanometer chip, made entirely in China. But analysts have since questioned the scalability and efficiency of the chip, especially now that the companies lack consistent access to foreign equipment and materials. Neither Huawei nor SMIC has commented at the time of reporting. The Taiwanese government did not make an official public announcement either. The listing was only revealed through changes posted on an official website.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-14 22:15:35

While some market participants remain convinced that altcoin season—a period when Bitcoin is outpaced by the majority of alternative coins in the crypto market—is underway, others remain unfazed, certain that altcoins will continue to bleed . Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson is part of the former group, whose sentiments about the altcoin market are more bullish than bearish. In a recent “ask me anything” live session on YouTube, the Cardano boss responded to a viewer who quizzed him on the state of the altcoin market, particularly curious to know if altcoin season was “cancelled for 2025.” Maintaining optimism for the months ahead, Hoskinson remarked that July and the months preceding it could see altcoins record a notable price run.”The second half of 2025 is going to be great for altcoins,” Hoskinson asserted. Three altcoins are going head-to-head against Bitcoin Interestingly, Bitcoin appears to be recovering quickly after failing to sustain momentum above the $110,000 price mark. The new development indicates a build-up of buying pressure likely triggered by renewed interest from market players. While this could validate the sentiment that the leading cryptocurrency will continue to outperform altcoins, alternative coins could also very possibly secure larger gains in the long term. Despite sustaining mild intra-day losses, three altcoins have outpaced Bitcoin over the last 7 days. Ether, SOL, and DOGE are leading what looks like an altcoin comeback. While Bitcoin, currently trading at $105,516 at press time, has only managed to sustain 3.87% in gains over the last 7-days, ETH, SOL and DOGE are up 7.94%, 6.10%, and 5.65% respectively.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|SHIB|SHIBA INU|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|DOGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:25:29

As if to make up for Q1’s underwhelming performance, Ether bulls have been up and working of late, with the price value of $3,000 appearing more attainable in the near term.

Notably, Ethereum’s Open Interest—the total number of outstanding (open) contracts yet to be settled—has hit a new all-time high, exceeding $40 billion for the first time.

These investors accumulated during consolidation and now will potentially form a strong support zone.” Glassnode wrote, adding that ETH is well on its way to $3,420 if the $2,700 and $2,760 support levels hold up strongly.

Στόχος; Πιο απλές, πιο οικονομικές και πιο παγκόσμιες πληρωμές με τη δύναμη των crypto. Χαρακτηριστικά και οφέλη για τους εμπόρους και πελάτες Με τη νέα αυτή δυνατότητα, το να πληρώνεις με κρυπτονομίσματα γίνεται πιο απλό από ποτέ. Οι πελάτες θα μπορούν να ολοκληρώνουν τις αγορές τους πληρώνοντας με USDC, ένα ψηφιακό «δολάριο» που παραμένει σταθερό στην αξία του. Από την άλλη πλευρά, οι έμποροι θα συνεχίσουν να λαμβάνουν τα χρήματά τους στο τοπικό τους νόμισμα, χωρίς περίπλοκες μετατροπές, win-win! Και για να κάνει την εμπειρία ακόμα καλύτερη, η Shopify σχεδιάζει να προσφέρει και 1% επιστροφή χρημάτων στους πελάτες που επιλέγουν να πληρώσουν με USDC, ένα έξτρα bonus που αναμένεται να ενεργοποιηθεί αργότερα μέσα στο 2025. Από τεχνικής πλευράς, όλο αυτό βασίζεται σε ένα ανοικτό κώδικα που σχεδίασαν μαζί Shopify και Coinbase. Αυτός ο κώδικας σκοπεύει να δώσει λύσει σε ζητήματα που αφορούν καθυστερημένες χρεώσεις και υπολογισμό φόρων, μέχρι και διαχείριση επιστροφών. Όλα είναι ενσωματωμένα στο υπάρχον σύστημα παραγγελιών, χωρίς επιπλέον κόπο για τον έμπορο. Γιατί η Shopify εμπιστεύτηκε το Base της Coinbase Όταν η Shopify έψαχνε την κατάλληλη υποδομή για να φέρει τις crypto πληρωμές στο παιχνίδι, το Base της Coinbase ξεχώρισε αμέσως. Γιατί; Επειδή είναι γρήγορο, οικονομικό και ασφαλές. Το Base αποτελεί μια λύση Layer-2 πάνω στο Ethereum και μπορεί να διαχειρίζεται πολύ περισσότερες συναλλαγές με πολύ χαμηλότερα κόστη. Αυτό το κάνει ιδανικό για χρήση σε μία τεράστια ηλεκτρονική πλατφόρμα όπως η Shopify, όπου κάθε δευτερόλεπτο και κάθε σεντ μετράει. Κανείς πελάτης δεν θέλει καθυστερήσεις ή έξτρα χρεώσεις και το Base προσφέρει ακριβώς αυτή την εμπειρία. Πέραν από το κομμάτι της τεχνολογίας, η Shopify δείχνει ξεκάθαρα ότι θέλει να προωθήσει το Web3 στο λιανικό εμπόριο. Και με τα stablecoins όπως το USDC να γίνονται πλέον καθημερινό εργαλείο για πληρωμές, το timing δεν θα μπορούσε να είναι καλύτερο. USDC στο Checkout; Δες με ποιο πορτοφόλι το κάνεις πράξη Κι αφού οι πληρωμές με USDC γίνονται πλέον mainstream, το επόμενο φυσικό βήμα είναι να έχεις και το κατάλληλο πορτοφόλι για να τα φυλάς! Εδώ έρχεται το Best Wallet , ένα ασφαλές και εύχρηστο πορτοφόλι για τα κρυπτονομίσματά σου. Τι είναι; ένα mobile app που σου δίνει τον πλήρη έλεγχο των crypto σου, με πλήρη διαφάνεια, χωρίς μεσάζοντες και χωρίς κρυφές παγίδες. Υποστηρίζει πάνω από 1.000 νομίσματα από 60+ blockchains, και σου επιτρέπει να τα ανταλλάσσεις εύκολα μέσω του ενσωματωμένου DEX. Και αν δεν έχεις crypto; Μπορείς να αγοράσεις με κάρτα ή τραπεζικό έμβασμα! Είναι δωρεάν, γρήγορο και φτιαγμένο για όσους θέλουν απλότητα, ασφάλεια και ανωνυμία! Το μέλλον των Stablecoins στο ηλεκτρονικό εμπόριο Μέχρι πρόσφατα, τα stablecoins, όπως το USDC ήταν απλώς ένα εργαλείο για όσους ασχολούνται με το crypto trading, όμως τον τελευταίο χρόνο η προσφορά τους αυξήθηκε κατά 54% και πλέον έγιναν κομμάτι των καθημερινών συναλλαγών. Και δεν μιλάμε μόνο για νεοφυείς επιχειρήσεις του Web3: μεγάλα ονόματα του χώρου όπως η PayPal και η Grab έχουν ήδη ενσωματώσει τα stablecoins στις υπηρεσίες τους για πληρωμές και τώρα ακολουθεί και η Shopify! Η δυνατότητα να πληρώνεις με ένα σταθερό, ψηφιακό δολάριο που λειτουργεί παντού, χωρίς την παρέμβαση τραπεζών, είναι κάτι που μπορεί να διευκολύνει ριζικά τον τρόπο με τον οποίο αγοράζουμε και πουλάμε online.",Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-14 22:45:45

Analyst Maps Out 3 Explosive Price Targets Using Rare Technical Signal",https://zycrypto.com/xrp-at-2-today-13-tomorrow-analyst-maps-out-3-explosive-price-targets-using-rare-technical-signal/,"Whether altcoin season is in motion remains a topic of debate amongst market participants, although XRP is emerging as one of the few altcoins poised to hit a new price high soon. Ripple’s XRP, the 4th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, might be preparing for an explosive run as market experts continue to outline bullish case scenarios for the altcoin. Cryptocurrency analyst EgragCrypto, known on X as EgragCrypto, predicts that the altcoin could soar to never-before-seen levels, notably $6.7, $13, and $27, if certain technical hurdles are surmounted. In an XRP technical chart shared with his followers on X, the analyst highlights 3 key areas using colored circles purple, red, and white to represent notable technical movements. While the purple circle, which historically follows a bullish uptrend, marks the start of a bullish rally observed across different market cycles, the red circle denotes an incoming market crash. This downward movement often occurs when the 21 EMA goes below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, a trend that is later preceded by a market pump, likely to get rejected by both moving averages. The analyst asserts that the move marks the arrival of a bear market. Conclusively, the white circle points to the 21 EMA avoiding a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on a weekly timeframe—an occurrence recorded only once, leading to a 1,200% surge in XRP’s price value. Laying out his bullish stance, the analyst wrote the following; “It’s simple. We still have one leg which will be an epic, fast, and short-lived move that will hype everyone up, claiming we’ll never go back and that utility will take us to the moon. But remember such moves have rarely continued in one direction, if ever, happened in the past and probably won’t in the future. If you’re well-off and don’t need to sell, stay patient. But if not, don’t come crying to my DMs when things don’t go as planned.” The analyst stated that should XRP surge by 1,200% from its current price of $2.24 or sustain a 600% gain in the near term, the altcoin will be valued at $27 or $13, respectively. Meanwhile, a 300% upsurge, which marks a quarter of the 2017 market rally, would value the asset at $6.70. XRP is trading at a press time price of $2.14, with 0.37% in 7-day gains.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-14 22:51:31

However, a new contender, Ruvi AI , is rapidly emerging as a high-potential alternative. With over $1.7 million raised , 150 million tokens sold , and predictions of an astonishing 13,100% ROI , Ruvi AI is gaining spotlight attention. But what truly sets it apart, and how does it stack up against Cardano? Here’s a closer look at why analysts are so optimistic about Ruvi AI. Why Analysts Draw Comparisons Between Ruvi AI and Cardano Cardano built its reputation by addressing key blockchain scalability and efficiency issues, a first for the industry when it launched. Similarly, Ruvi AI is making waves for its ability to tackle real-world challenges by integrating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) . Its solutions span industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance , bringing wide-ranging utility that extends far beyond traditional crypto applications. Where Cardano excels in creating a stable and scalable ecosystem, Ruvi AI adds another dimension by tapping into demand for practical, AI-driven solutions. This focus not only ensures Ruvi AI’s relevance but also positions it to thrive in a competitive landscape. Presale Success Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has garnered significant attention, with over $1.7 million raised and 150 million tokens sold during the current phase. This robust demand reflects growing confidence among investors and signals that Ruvi AI is more than just speculative noise. A standout feature of Ruvi AI is its structured growth model , which brings transparency and predictability to its token pricing. Unlike other tokens that soar or crash based on market whims, Ruvi AI is designed to steadily grow in value. When the presale concludes, tokens will increase to $0.07 , giving early investors a clear pathway to immediate returns. Analysts project even greater gains, predicting Ruvi AI could reach $1 post-listing , equivalent to a remarkable 66x return for presale participants. Maximize ROI With Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI takes its presale one step further by offering exclusive VIP investment tiers . These tiers reward early investors with generous bonuses, ensuring that participants at all levels can amplify their gains. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers make Ruvi AI appealing to both cautious first-timers and seasoned whales alike. Building Trust Through Transparency and Security A major differentiator for Ruvi AI is its commitment to transparency and safety . The project is being independently assessed through an upcoming third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the most respected blockchain security firms. This ensures that Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is secure and reliable, an essential factor for responsible investors. Adding to its appeal is Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange , which guarantees ample liquidity and seamless trading for token holders following the presale stage. Together, these moves solidify trust in the platform and give Ruvi AI’s investors peace of mind. Real-World Applications Ensure Long-Term Demand Unlike purely speculative tokens, Ruvi AI delivers tangible value through real-world applications, ensuring ongoing demand. Key sectors benefiting from Ruvi AI’s solutions include: Marketing Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools provide businesses with enhanced customer targeting, campaign optimization, and elevated audience engagement. Entertainment By enabling personalized content recommendations and secure, blockchain-backed transactions, Ruvi AI is reshaping how content is consumed and monetized.

While Ripple has not confirmed such a move, the rumor has reignited discussions about the company’s evolving role in the global financial system. JackTheRippler’s post was accompanied by a visual breakdown demonstrating how Ripple’s infrastructure already mirrors the core functions of a modern digital bank. In the illustrated process, a sender’s bank connects to a third-party liquidity provider to replenish its XRP holdings. It then accesses RippleNet and xCurrent for pre-transaction verification, including exchange rates and transfer costs. Once the conditions are accepted, the bank executes the cross-border payment using XRP in real time. On the receiving end, the bank uses a separate liquidity provider to convert the XRP into local currency, completing the transaction seamlessly. This end-to-end flow highlights Ripple’s technical capacity to operate like a bank, even without a license. It has led many to ask whether formal regulatory approval is simply the next phase in Ripple’s institutional evolution. RUMORS: @Ripple will obtain a banking license and transform into a bank! #XRP pic.twitter.com/MfDPYel2Ed — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 14, 2025 The Banking Charter Possibility This rumor aligns closely with earlier developments reported by Timestabloid. Former Ripple board member and entrepreneur Greg Kidd revealed during a one-on-one interview with FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett at the XRP Las Vegas conference that he is developing a specialized banking charter. The charter is designed for digital-first companies that manage deposits and payments without engaging in lending or operating physical branches. Kidd emphasized that his proposal was theoretical and not linked to any official plan by Ripple. However, he made it clear that the goal is to reshape the financial system by making it more inclusive. This charter could enable companies like Ripple to acquire a form of banking license tailored to their business model, allowing them to provide core financial services without taking on the full regulatory load of traditional banks. Ripple’s Larger Ambitions In another earlier report , Timestabloid highlighted analysis by Stellar Rippler, a well-known crypto commentator, who claimed that Ripple is not just aiming to become a bank; it is preparing to operate at the very foundation of the global financial infrastructure. According to Stellar Rippler, Ripple’s goal is to rival traditional financial institutions, even central banks, by redefining how money moves across borders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While this may sound bold, it is grounded in observable developments. Ripple currently provides payment and liquidity solutions in more than 70 countries. Its suite of tools, including RippleNet, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), and its RLUSD stablecoin, positions it as a critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology. If Ripple does pursue a banking license, it would no longer need to rely on intermediary banks or third-party settlement networks. It could offer direct, real-time, cross-border payments powered entirely by blockchain, something legacy institutions have struggled to achieve. A Strategic Silence? Ripple has not commented on these rumors, but the silence could be strategic. The company remains entangled in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and may be waiting for regulatory clarity before making any significant structural changes. Still, Ripple’s direction is unmistakable. It is no longer just a fintech startup. It is building infrastructure, securing partnerships with central banks, and offering services that resemble, if not already exceeded, those of traditional banking institutions. Whether or not it becomes a licensed bank, Ripple is shaping the future of digital finance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This resistance has not deterred long-term holders or analysts, many of whom remain confident that XRP’s underlying utility in cross-border payments could drive substantial gains in the future. Some analysts believe that if XRP is adopted as a key tool for international money movement, its value could climb significantly. These projections are based not on short-term speculation but on the asset’s potential role in global liquidity frameworks. Assessing the Cross-border Liquidity Market A critical factor in these forecasts is the estimated size of the cross-border liquidity pool. While exact figures are not readily available, economists often use M2 money supply data to frame the conversation. M2 includes cash, checking deposits, and other liquid financial assets, and offers a broad view of potential capital deployment. According to a macroeconomic analysis published in April 2025 by analyst Marty Party, the collective M2 money supply of the U.S., China, Japan, and the European Union stood at approximately $83.37 trillion. However, only a fraction of that total is typically designated for cross-border use. Historical data from the Bank for International Settlements suggests that banks allocate roughly 10% to 15% of M2 for international reserves and claims. This implies that the global cross-border liquidity pool may fall between $8 trillion and $12 trillion, with $10 trillion serving as a reasonable mid-range estimate. Calculating XRP’s Value at 25% Liquidity Share To determine XRP’s potential value if it facilitated 25% of the estimated $10 trillion in cross-border liquidity, an analysis was conducted using OpenAI’s ChatGPT model. At the time, XRP was priced at $2.23 with a circulating supply of about 58.82 billion tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the first scenario, where XRP is required to fully back the $2.5 trillion needed for 25% of global liquidity, each token would need to represent a portion of that amount. Dividing $2.5 trillion by the total circulating supply yields a price estimate of approximately $42.50 per XRP. Token Velocity and Adjusted Price Scenarios The second approach incorporates the concept of token velocity, how often a token is used in transactions within a year. If XRP is reused five times annually, then only $500 billion worth of XRP would be required to support $2.5 trillion in flows. This would translate to a token price of about $8.50. The model also evaluated other turnover rates. At a velocity of 10, XRP’s price would drop to around $4.25. Conversely, if the token turned over just twice a year, the required locked value would increase, raising the estimated price to $21.25. These scenarios highlight how XRP’s future price could vary significantly depending on the level of institutional adoption and how efficiently the token circulates. While theoretical, the models offer insight into XRP’s potential valuation if it becomes a core asset in the global financial infrastructure.

The prominent altcoin currently trades around $2,567 following a slight recovery but remains some distance off the week’s high of $2,871. Amidst all these recent developments, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment has shared a positive report hinting at a bullish ETH future. ETH Whale Holdings Grow By 3.72% In 30 Days In an X post on June 14, Santiment provides valuable insights into Ethereum whales’ behaviors. The credible analytics firm reports that all 6,392 of such investors holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have significantly increased their holdings over the past month compared to retail investors. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash – Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast In adding data to this claim, Santiment further shares that ETH whales have acquired 1.49 million ETH, worth $38.26 million, in the past 30 days, boosting their total holdings by a significant 3.72%. Generally, whale accumulations are bullish signals that indicate an asset’s strong potential for long-term price appreciation. Therefore, ETH’s recent whale activity is likely to encourage significant levels of retail investment that could incite a price rally. Interestingly, CoinMarketCap data shows the altcoin has recorded a 2.38% decline over the past month. The token’s price has largely oscillated within a range of $2,400 to $2,800, reflecting indecision in the market amidst external pressures and a lack of clear bullish catalysts. Ethereum whales have conducted this accumulation spree during a period of market uncertainty, indicating strong investor confidence regardless of the present market situation. Ethereum Price Overview At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,536 following a price gain of 1.18% in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 3.82% on its weekly chart after a notable brief price ascent above $2,800. According to data from CoinCodex, the general ETH market sentiment is bullish while the Greed & Fear Index stands at 61 (Greed). This report is well reflected in the reported accumulation trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Stress As Israel-Iran Conflict Shakes Sentiment – ETH/BTC Support In Focus The CoinCodex team predicts Ethereum will maintain its range-bound movement in the short term, as indicated by projections of $2,825.11 in five days and $2,767 in a month.

Tron (TRX) has recently surged 12% following a new stablecoin launch on its blockchain. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making progress with upgrades to Shibarium, its Layer-2 network. Both have sparked renewed interest. Yet, amid this, another project stands out with deeper traction. BlockDAG, an emerging presale initiative, is nearing the $300 million mark. It has already secured $303 million in funding and attracted over 2 million active users through its X1 mobile mining app. In a space often dominated by flashy headlines and speculation, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing that a more grounded, user-first approach can outperform even long-established coins. TRX Jumps 12% on Stablecoin Buzz TRX rose 12% after a new USD₮ stablecoin launched on its blockchain. The coin benefited from media attention tied to the new dollar-pegged coin. This trend sparked higher network activity and boosted TRX’s market cap. Even so, this rise may be short-lived. TRX has experienced similar spikes before, which have faded once the initial buzz subsided. Its reliance on politically linked headlines leaves questions about long-term stability. Until network usage or developer growth matches these price moves, TRX’s momentum may not persist. Shiba Inu Builds Utility With Shibarium Shiba Inu continues development on Shibarium, its Layer‑2 network, aiming to improve speed and cut transaction costs. The update is designed to streamline validator operations and improve performance. These upgrades may help SHIB move beyond meme status, offering real-world use cases. Even though the Shibarium network has promise, past congestion and early bugs slow adoption. Community sentiment remains positive, yet market gains have been modest. If the improvements hold strong, SHIB may gain traction. For now, it’s in technical rebuild mode, offering potential upside but no breakout yet. BlockDAG: $303M Raised, 2M Users, and No Empty Hype While TRX enjoys attention from news cycles and SHIB focuses on rebuilding its tech, BlockDAG is gaining steady ground through real progress. It isn’t relying on famous names or viral trends to grow. So far, BlockDAG has raised $303 million in its ongoing presale, with over 22.6 billion coins sold. More than 2 million users are already active on its X1 mobile mining app. BDAG is set to launch at $0.05 and is priced at $0.0276 in Stage 29, but right now, $0.0018 buys you in. With over $303 million raised, this gap won’t last long. BlockDAG stands out because of its user-first approach. The X1 app lets people mine directly from their phones, with no need for expensive setups or complicated tools. This simple entry point has attracted users worldwide and built strong engagement, even before the coin launches. There’s no involvement from venture capital firms, no early access for insiders, and no private deals. Every contribution comes from the public. This clear structure helps build trust, especially at a time when many in the space are tired of centralized control. BlockDAG isn’t chasing stories. It’s setting the pace. And even before its official launch, it’s already outpacing many projects that are fully listed. With clear results and growing traction, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the leading crypto to watch this year. Final Verdict TRX may earn attention through stablecoin news and SHIB may build long-term utility via Shibarium. But those models depend on external momentum and delayed results. BlockDAG is different. With $303 million raised, 22.6 billion coins sold, 2,660% ROI for Batch 1 holders, over 2 million active users, a retail‑only presale, and limited batches, it is showing substance and scale now, not promises later. The frozen $0.0018 price remains available for another six days, while batch 29 continues at $0.0276. In a crowded market, BlockDAG delivers actual metrics and a working app before any coin launch. It is quietly emerging as the clear standout to follow in 2025.

Jamie Selway, a veteran financial services executive, will begin serving in the role on June 17th, per a new press release from the regulator. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins says Selway will help “ensure the agency’s regulations balance costs and benefits.” The SEC has adopted a more crypto-friendly stance under Atkins, who has sought to distance the regulatory agency from the high-profile enforcement actions overseen by Gary Gensler, the previous chair. Gensler launched legal battles against numerous crypto firms, including industry giants Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Ripple, Uniswap Labs and Consensys. Since Gensler stepped down in January, many of those cases have been closed. Atkins said last month that the SEC’s “legacy rules and regulations” don’t contemplate the novel use cases of blockchain technology. “In order for the United States to be the ‘crypto capital of the planet’ as envisioned by President Trump, the Commission must keep pace with innovation and consider whether regulatory changes are needed to accommodate on-chain securities and other crypto assets. Rules and regulations designed for off-chain securities may be incompatible with or unnecessary for on-chain assets and stifle the growth of blockchain technology. A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.

The deadly strikes against Iran on Friday, June 13, said to have killed at least 78 people, were praised by Donald Trump as “excellent” with promises of “more to come.” Speaking on the victims of the Israeli attack, UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani detailed: “The overwhelming majority of them [were] civilians, including women and children.” Bitcoin for bombs, Satoshi inverted “Pro-bitcoin” Trump pretended to be for peaceful resolution of the so-called Iranian nuclear issue until mere hours before the strike, posting to Truth Social: “We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue!” However, some Israeli officials have been quoted saying this was a deception designed to lower Iran’s guard. “We had a clear U.S. green light,” one of them allegedly told Axios . Similar comments by “senior Israeli officials” were also made to The Jerusalem Post. Source: Truth Social. Whatever the truth is, if there is any left in the poorly written drama called mainstream news these days, one thing is clear to O.G. bitcoiners: Politicians and bankers make wars, and innocent people on both sides are slaughtered to enrich them. As Major General Smedley D. Butler famously declared in War Is a Racket: “Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die … No one told them that dollars and cents were the real reason. No one mentioned to them, as they marched away, that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here.” Image: Pixabay. Bitcoin was originally meant to fix this. The genesis block gives us a hint with its headline message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.” Crypto was meant to separate money and state , and as early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver once said , it was meant to potentially “undermine every government on the entire planet’s ability to wage war.”Now, BTC is held largely in the hands of the same murdering psychopaths from whom we were meant to take the power back. Blackrock, which invests heavily in defense companies profiting from war, had roughly 575,810 BTC in their Bitcoin ETF as of March . The United States government holds about 200,000 BTC that we know about.Even the individual whales, like Michael Saylor, are strongly pro-state and pro-fiat money. Saylor, who privately holds well over 17,000 BTC, has called Trump “pro-crypto” and criticized advocates of permissionless use and privacy.States and their crony banks. State-embedded mega-corporations. The trend is clear. These entities now hold persuasive amounts of crypto not to be used as permissionless, peer-to-peer electronic cash but for purposes of socioeconomic control and power.Another example is crypto’s unprecedented use for directly purchasing weapons and military supplies in the Ukraine/Russia conflict. As for major centralized exchanges, they are regulated via statist legal systems. So, in essence, if the U.S. continues helping Israel in its war on everyone around and in funding terror cells like Hamas, BTC will be right there behind the cause. Source: bitcointreasuries.net . How to take crypto back in 2 steps While the masses rant and cheer like it’s a football game for either “Israel” or “Iran” to destroy the other, everyday people like you and I will be killed like dogs in the streets, in their houses, in hospitals and schools and while sleeping, in both countries. Bitcoin was supposed to “fix this.”Even “Bitcoin Jesus” Ver, the original voice of Bitcoin Not Bombs, now says he wants to help Trump “make America great again.” Maybe he hasn’t connected the dots yet on Trump’s warmongering, though that’s hard to imagine. Maybe it is (somewhat understandably) a desperate bid to regain his freedom, as he is currently being held by the U.S. Department of Justice on bogus charges. Or maybe there’s another, more disappointing explanation.Regardless, it makes bitcoiners who got into crypto for the prospect of freedom and peace reel with bewilderment. Was any of this ever real in the first place? Were we put on by state interests somehow? Perhaps Satoshi’s creation has just been co-opted. Luckily, it doesn’t matter either way if the tech works. It seems to me crypto still can bring us the separation of money and state. But we’ve got to focus on two things: uncaptured networks that can work for instant, permissionless cash transactions, and most importantly, understanding the true, inviolable source of freedom — self-ownership.The truth is, no government on earth cares for the people it professes to rule. Not Israel, not Iran, not the United States. This is a bitter pill but should be quite obvious, given the evidence. Further, no state is anything but a grouping of single individuals, no better than you or I. States aren’t some abstract, all-powerful deity, though they would have us believe them to be so (much like the old man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz). At the highest levels, even with Israel and Iran, there is a fraternity in the shadows. The enmity played out in the news keeps you distracted. Image: Pixabay. When we come to understand that we own ourselves, that our lives, bodies, and property acquired by non-violence are ours, it makes no sense why some “special” individuals should arbitrarily be able to rule us violently, appoint themselves masters over us, force us to kill strangers in another country we have nothing against personally, or extort money from us via “taxes” to pay for bombs and all other kinds of evil refuse.Like decentralized payment protocols, decentralized networks of societies and communities can order their own lives and make their own sensible rules. They already do. Bitcoin and crypto present a way out of this mess if combined with the above Voluntaryist ethos. Networks like Bitcoin Cash, which are fast, efficient , censorship-resistant, and cost next to nothing to use, can help individuals take their economic freedom back, little by little.Developing privacy tech makes this more possible than ever. How? By refusing to finance violence in whatever small or large way possible until a critical mass of non-compliance is reached. In the same way, individuals can wake up and simply refuse — one by one — to become soldiers to kill and die for Trump, Netanyahu, Ali Khamenei, violent religion, or anyone else who thinks murder is “excellent.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-15 00:39:27

Dogecoin (DOGE), long considered a meme favorite, still hovers near the $0.20 range and shows resilience, but the real buzz is around an emerging DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is in phase 5 of its presale. Over 10.5 million has already been raised and more than 12,000 investors have joined. With June winding down and momentum building across crypto, this might be the top token of the summer you’ll wish you grabbed early. If you’re still wondering what to buy before June ends, you may not want to sleep on this one. Dogecoin Edges Near $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.20, up about 1% on the day. The token recently bounced off support near $0.176, climbing into the $0.190 resistance zone, and has since held steady around $0.197 Indicators on the 4-hour chart show a breakout above a descending trendline, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum, although DOGE remains capped by overhead pressure near $0.3. With major cryptos rising in tandem, DOGE is regaining attention as a potentially stabilizing meme token, while other plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to draw interest at lower price points. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Blazing Ahead, Secure Tokens at $0.03 Before They Double Mutuum Finance is heating up fast in the DeFi market, now in Phase 5 of its presale with tokens priced at only $0.03, 100% from a listing price of $0.06. That means early Phase 5 investors stand to gain 2x once MUTM launches in addition to a post-launch 74x run. With over $10.5 million raised and a growing community of 12,000+ investors, MUTM is proving itself a rising star in decentralized finance. Plus, the next presale round jumps to $0.035, meaning if you buy now, you lock in an instant 16.67% profit before prices climb. Mutuum’s Hybrid Lending Model Mutuum Finance’s edge lies in its innovative hybrid lending system that merges two powerful DeFi models. In peer to contract (P2C), users place their stablecoins, for example, USDT, into smart contracts, which give them easy income from the interest generated. In P2P, borrowers and lenders talk directly, agree on loan terms, and stay private, since they do not need agents to connect them. This unique combination gives users the best of decentralization, control, and competitive yields, a real game changer in crypto lending. Leaderboard Gamification Sparks Community Excitement and Rewards Top Holders Mutuum Finance is driving engagement with a leaderboard system spotlighting the top 50 MUTM holders in real time. Those in the top spots will receive bonus tokens, turning investment into a thrilling, competitive experience that rewards loyalty and strategy. Certified Secure & Future-Proof Mutuum Finance’s open-source smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by Certik, boosting investor confidence in the project. In addition, Mutuum is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum designed to avoid the risks of algorithmic stablecoins’ collapse. This stablecoin is going to hold the ecosystem together by improving stability and security for the system’s users and future institutional members. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $10.5M+ from 12,000+ investors. Now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03, launch price is $0.06, a 100% ROI. Real DeFi use, Certik-audited, and high upside.

At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications.

46036186,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746919,1749949850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46036186.jpeg,Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/amazon-pours-13b-into-aussie-ai/,"Amazon.com Inc. will invest A$20 billion ($13 billion) in Australia between 2025 and 2029 to expand its data center infrastructure, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global firm. The prime Minister welcomed Amazon Web Services’ investment to expand data center infrastructure in Sydney and Melbourne, calling it the largest-ever tech investment in the country by a global provider. He emphasized the project’s role in strengthening Australia’s AI capabilities, creating skilled jobs, and supporting high-performance computing infrastructure. The funds will boost cloud computing capacity and support Australia’s growing demand for artificial intelligence, Amazon said in a statement. The investment will center around its existing Sydney and Melbourne data centers. Albanese met with Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman on Saturday in Seattle ahead of the G-7 summit in Canada, where the deal was highlighted as a milestone in digital cooperation . Garman highlighted the company’s commitment to helping Australian organizations leverage generative AI. He said the investment will strengthen data infrastructure, increase renewable energy use, and support Australia’s ambition to become a global AI leader. Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres welcomed the investment in an interview with Sky News Australia, calling it a “very significant” step for the nation’s digital infrastructure. “It’s in Australia’s interests to lean into the opportunity,” Ayres said. “We must be makers of the technology as well as takers.” Amazon powers AI growth with major clean energy push in Australia As part of the expansion, Amazon will also build three new solar farms in Victoria and Queensland to power the growing infrastructure and support its clean energy goals . Amazon will commit to buying a combined capacity of more than 170 megawatts across these farms. Amazon operates eight solar and wind energy projects across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, which help power its Australian data centers and fulfillment facilities. Once all 11 of its planned renewable energy projects are online, they are expected to produce over 1.4 million megawatt-hours of clean energy annually—enough to power approximately 290,000 Australian homes each year. Between 2020 and 2022, Amazon invested an estimated A$467 million in renewable energy projects in Australia. In 2024, Amazon was Australia’s third-largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and remains the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally. As per a study by Accenture, Australian organizations migrating compute-heavy AI workloads to AWS can reduce carbon emissions by up to 94% compared with on-premises data centers. This is because of AWS’s infrastructure hardware, power, cooling, and carbon-free energy procurement efficiencies. AWS powers Australia’s AI ambitions with expanding cloud footprint The investment aligns with the Australian government’s goal to boost productivity and economic growth through AI-driven innovation. It will equip hundreds of thousands of Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and partners with advanced cloud and AI tools, enabling large-scale innovation while ensuring compliance with local data residency and regulatory standards. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources estimates that AI and automation could add up to A$600 billion to Australia’s GDP annually by 2030. AWS’s presence in Australia began in 2012 with the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. This was followed by the opening of the AWS Asia Pacific in 2023, including the country’s first AWS Local Zones in Perth. In April 2024, AWS established Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed generative AI service, in the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. Moreover, in July 2024, the Australian Government linked with AWS to provide a “Top Secret” AWS Cloud to deliver cloud innovation in national security and defense and enhance the nation’s defense and intelligence capabilities.
