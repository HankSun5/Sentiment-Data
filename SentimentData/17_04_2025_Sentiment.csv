Several countries are adjusting to recent tariffs imposed by the United States, with a key focus on China and the European Union. In the wake of rising tensions, industry analysts have rolled out a growth plan for Bitcoin and other altcoins. Arthur Hayes Backs Bitcoin Recovery In a recent social media post, Hayes stated that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will give Bitcoin the necessary ingredients for a bull recovery in its response to Trump’s tariffs. This might be the case if China devalues its currency, leading to fund flows to the crypto market. According to him, China has fueled fund flows through this in 2013 and 2015. “ If not the Fed then the PBOC will give us the yachtzee ingredients. CNY deval = narrative that Chinese capital flight will flow into $BTC. It worked in 2013 , 2015, and can work in 2025. Ignore China at your own peril.” Other digital asset executives also hinted that China will likely devalue the yuan to limit the impact of the tariffs. Globally, the central bank’s move to devalue local currencies propels consumers to digital assets to protect value. This goes to Bitcoin’s use case as a store of value amid global trade tensions. Several financial consumers have turned to crypto in the last two years to safeguard their assets. As a result, Bitcoin recorded growing numbers signaling heightened global adoption. The influx of new users to the market spiked institutional interest , leading to an overall increase in price and trader sentiment. For Hayes and most bulls, a recovery is inbound to send BTC to previous levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price had increased by 1.6% to $84,425. Big Banks Shine Hope For Crypto A slew of financial institutions increased the odds of a recession in the United States and hinted at more policy rate cuts. Following massive outflows from the U.S. stock market, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs noted that rate cuts are imminent as the Feds look to avert an economic meltdown. Traditionally, rate cuts have spiked Bitcoin price, leading to similar trading patterns in altcoins.

The panel discussion centered on yieldcoins or, essentially, the rising of cryptocurrencies that can generate yield through holding, staking or lending, like stablecoins. “Well, nine-to-five banking hours don’t work, right? There are implementations right now of payment systems that are going to come to market very soon, that are a good combination of both yield-bearing instruments as well as stabletokens,” David said. According to David, the need for stablecoins stems from the fact that the traditional US banking infrastructure doesn’t support round-the-clock transactions. “And this industry, as we all know, is a 24-hour industry.” KYC for stablecoins Know Your Customer procedures were a significant topic at the panel. One representative from Figure Markets said that everyone who owns a yield-bearing stablecoin would have to be KYC-ed for tax reasons. But David pointed out that stablecoins have several use cases beyond yield generation, including payments. “Using this stable token to buy a cup of coffee is not something that really should require AML or KYC for somebody.” Nick Carmi, head of exchange at Figure Markets, suggested that part of the solution could be a trust-based KYC system that allows users to carry their credentials across platforms. KYC is a process used by financial institutions to verify a user's identity. It's meant to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illegal activities by ensuring users are who they claim to be. Currently, users must complete separate KYC checks for each financial institution or service they use, creating friction and frustration — especially for those navigating multiple platforms or exploring different crypto ecosystems.

Stebbing expects collaborative and open protocols for future Dogecoin Layer 2 projects. Timothy Stebbing, a product lead at the Dogecoin Foundation, has highlighted how he thinks the meme lord should evolve in the future. In an X post, Stebbing opined that the age of Dogecoin (DOGE) layer 2 is at hand. As a result, he has cautioned users to anticipate good and bad changes. Moreover, the introduction of layer two chains on the Dogecoin network will open up floodgates for scammers amongst legitimate businesses. “The L2s will provide smart contracts, new mechanisms for payment, identity systems, tokenization of real-world assets.. an entire ecosystem, a new financial system will be born here,” Stebbing noted . Stebbing highlighted that the L2 chains on the Dogecoin network work together and embrace competition through open protocols. “Build open protocols, collaborative and welcome.. then innovate and win via your points of difference, stand above the crowd on your merits, but lift others up with you,” Stebbings concluded. Impact on Dogecoin Network The meteorite growth of the Ethereum (ETH) network is heavily influenced by its layer two networks led by Base and Arbitrum. The introduction of Layer 2 chains on the Dogecoin network will be a huge game changer on the dog-themed memecoin. Moreover, institutional investors will seamlessly tokenize real-world assets led by stablecoins, which will significantly improve the memecoin’s liquidity and utility. The introduction of the L2 chains on the Dogecoin network may influence a shift towards the proof of stake (PoS) from its current proof of work (PoW) consensus method. Moreover, the Ether core developers have proved that the PoS is more cost-efficient and still secure for optimizing DeFi developments at scale.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|ARB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-16 22:47:31

After a strong upward move fueled by improved market sentiment, the current pullback signals a potential pause rather than a full reversal. The $1.97 zone now stands as a critical support level, previously acting as resistance during XRP’s recent climb. If buyers step in with strength and volume begins to rise, this dip could prove to be a strategic entry point for those eyeing the next breakout. Key Support Holds At $1.97 – Is XRP Building A Base? XRP’s pullback to the $1.97 level has brought attention to the critical support zone that may serve as a foundation for the next leg up. Despite broader market fluctuations, price action has shown resilience around this area, with buyers stepping in to defend the level. Historically, $1.97 has acted as a pivotal point during previous rallies and corrections, increasing its significance as a potential accumulation zone. Related Reading: XRP Price Pulls Back: Healthy Correction or Start of a Fresh Downtrend? The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is beginning to flash early signs of a potential bullish reversal for XRP. After the recent dip to $1.97, the MACD line is showing signs of converging toward the signal line, hinting that bearish momentum may be losing steam. This subtle shift often precedes a reversal and suggests that buyers are gradually regaining control. Should the MACD complete a bullish crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it will reinforce the argument for a rebound. When paired with XRP’s position above key support, such a signal could confirm that market sentiment is tilting in favor of the bulls. A strengthening MACD histogram, reflecting diminishing downside pressure, would further validate this shift and add weight to the case for an upward move in the coming sessions. Bulls On Standby: What Needs To Happen For A Breakout Several key conditions must be met before momentum shifts decisively in the bulls’ favor as XRP’s price action nears the $1.97 support zone. First, XRP needs to firmly establish $1.97 as a solid base, with multiple successful defenses of this level reinforcing buyer confidence. A rebound from this zone would signal underlying strength and provide the first step toward an upside breakout. Related Reading: XRP Must Break Above $3 To Invalidate Bearish Pattern And Flip Bullish – Analyst Secondly, volume needs to step in. A breakout without a noticeable increase in trading volume risks being a false move. Sustained buying pressure would confirm that market participants are positioned for a trend reversal. Additionally, a decisive break above nearby resistance levels such as $2.25 or higher would invalidate the current consolidation phase and open the door for further gains. Lastly, indicators like the RSI and MACD must align with the bullish narrative. A rising RSI, without entering overbought territory, and a bullish MACD crossover would solidify the technical foundation for an upward move.

Presale stages, in particular, attract attention due to the promise of strong communities and ideas that may deliver solid gains later. In 2025’s second quarter, BlockDAG (BDAG), Rollblock (RBLK), Solaxy (SOLX), and LightChain AI (LCAI) are earning a spot among the best-performing crypto coins. Each brings a distinct approach to the table and has sparked growing interest from early supporters. Some focus on revolutionizing the gaming sector or making blockchain links smoother, while others tackle speed and performance on existing chains. These four projects highlight that even a shaky market can still reveal quality picks for those keeping track of rising projects. BlockDAG (BDAG): Scaling via Parallel Block Processing With its DAG-based system, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a strong candidate among the best-performing crypto coins of the year. Unlike traditional blockchains, BDAG allows several blocks to process simultaneously, tackling ongoing congestion issues. The presale has already brought in over $214 million, selling more than 19.2 billion BDAG coins. The price has grown from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 by Batch 27. Early backers have seen a 2,380% return, showing the rising confidence in the project. Preparations for its mainnet are underway, with a roadmap that combines infrastructure development with user education. The BlockDAG Academy and global hackathons are set to welcome both learners and builders to the platform. This multi-angle strategy focused on growth, engagement, and community presence makes many market followers believe BDAG’s value could surge once the mainnet goes live. Among the best-performing crypto coins, BDAG is building its place through both vision and structure. Rollblock (RBLK): Aiming for Fair Play in Gaming Rollblock (RBLK) enters the list of best-performing crypto coins by targeting the fast-growing gaming segment. Built on Ethereum, it aims to provide transparent transactions and a secure gaming experience that discourages manipulation. The gaming field is crowded, and for Rollblock to lead, it must stay fresh with new content. However, its clear stance on fair gaming could win over dedicated players who value openness. If it keeps pace with its roadmap, it might find a strong place in blockchain gaming. The chance to earn rewards through a secure setup could appeal to many in the entertainment niche, making RBLK a noteworthy name among upcoming crypto platforms. Solaxy (SOLX): Layer-2 Fix for Solana Delays Solaxy (SOLX) stands out by aiming to improve Solana’s performance, especially during network congestion. That vision helps position it among the best-performing crypto coins for those backing Solana’s core speed while recognizing its flaws. Using a “roll-down” structure, Solaxy works to keep transaction confirmations quick while boosting scalability. Even though critics question if it can perform under heavy traffic, the $28.5 million raised during its presale signals strong belief. With Solana’s name adding weight and Solaxy’s mission to improve reliability, this combination could catch the interest of developers and everyday users alike. If it delivers on its performance goals, SOLX might become a go-to choice for improved blockchain efficiency. LightChain AI (LCAI): Bringing AI into Blockchain Speed LCAI earns a spot among the best-performing crypto coins by merging AI and blockchain technology. It uses AI protocols to streamline processing, reduce delays, and solve speed issues often seen on older blockchain systems. Its presale offers special staking plans, giving participants a role in securing the network while earning passive returns. LCAI’s algorithm-driven cost-cutting sets it apart from more traditional projects. If its AI features gain traction, LCAI could stand strong in areas such as smart contracts and DeFi. For those tracking new crypto tech, this AI-powered model offers a fresh take on scaling and automation. Wrapping Up 2025’s Best Performing Crypto Coins! To wrap up, BlockDAG focuses on speeding up transactions with a well-structured path toward the mainnet. Rollblock promises fair gameplay for the gaming crowd. Solaxy aims to support Solana’s performance with added reliability, and LightChain AI enhances blockchain power through artificial intelligence. Each project brings different strengths that may appeal to different segments of the market. While all four deserve a look from those interested in best-performing crypto coins , BlockDAG draws attention for its clear roadmap, educational initiatives, and strong engagement. Those seeking future-ready projects with growth and community at their core might find BlockDAG to be a strategic pick before its full launch later this year.

Hackers Create Fake Government Cryptocurrency The cyberattackers put up a number of posts on Powell’s authenticated account stating “$HCC” was “a people-powered digital currency putting people’s power to the blockchain.” Powell, the leader of the House of Commons and Manchester Central’s representative, has close to 70,000 followers on the platform. Certain messages added the formal House of Commons logo to give the scam the air of legitimacy. Powell’s office said they “pursued steps promptly to lock in the account and delete deceptive posts” after they became aware of the breach. Recent letters In Series Of Top-Profile Account Takeovers This attack follows a pattern of similar hacks targeting public figures with large follower counts. BBC journalist Nick Robinson fell victim to a similar scheme earlier this year when hackers used his account to promote a fake cryptocurrency called “$Today.” Robinson reported clicking on what he thought was a legitimate email from the social media platform, which gave hackers access to his account.

In this widespread scam, perpetrators create worthless cryptocurrencies, artificially pump up their price, persuade others to invest, and then sell their shares for profit before the price crashes. Even though the scam targeted a high-profile government official’s account, the scam was relatively unsuccessful. The imposter coin attracted only 34 transactions, with the scammers making around £225 in profits. Growing Trend In Account Hacking Action Fraud also reports that there has been a high incidence of social media and email account hacking in 2024 to date, at 35,343. Security experts say they suspect most attacks start with emails that have a link to fake websites that pilfer passwords or gain unauthorized system access. Minister’s X account hacked to promote crypto scam https://t.co/uXl5KE8n3l — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) April 15, 2025 Passwords can also be accessed via data breaches where users’ information is hacked and put on sale online. It takes scammers just a few hours to create and roll out counterfeit cryptocurrencies, and then they move swiftly once they have access to an account. The UK Parliament official said they “take cyber security extremely seriously” and give members advice on how to manage online safety, but refused to disclose specific information on their cybersecurity practices. Action Fraud advises people to safeguard their accounts by registering two-step verification and adopting hard, different passwords of three randomly chosen words. Powell has been a leader of the House of Commons since Labour came to power in the summer. Her work entails scheduling the government’s legislative programme and safeguarding the rights of backbench MPs.

The platform’s permissionless, fast, and customizable launch process seeks to attract creators and developers seeking seamless on-chain token creation and immediate trading. Raydium’s move to launch LaunchLab is part of a broader industry shift toward decentralization, innovation, and fierce competition. Raydium, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana by cumulative volume, announced the launch of its anticipated token creation platform, LaunchLab on Tuesday — directly challenging the dominance of Pump.fun. This development follows months of speculation after early signs of the platform’s creation surfaced last month. LaunchLab marks a major evolution for Raydium, which had previously maintained a close working relationship with Pump.fun before pivoting to build its launch infrastructure. A few weeks ago, Pump.fun launched its own DEX called PumpSwap, indicating an intensifying rivalry between two major players in the Solana ecosystem. Raydium Fires Back at Pump.fun with LaunchLab LaunchLab provides seamless on-chain token creation with direct integration into Raydium’s automated market maker (AMM), allowing tokens to begin trading immediately on the exchange after launch. Introducing LaunchLab, Raydium's all-in-one token launchpad. Built for Creators, Developers, and the Community https://t.co/yZVzShVZSJ More info pic.twitter.com/r6s1DAegWf — Raydium (@RaydiumProtocol) April 16, 2025 It allows third-party platforms to set custom transaction fees and supports a referral program that rewards users in SOL. With this new platform, Raydium has moved from being a backend liquidity provider for meme coin launches to offering its launchpad infrastructure. The platform offers two modes: a customizable launch feature for more complex projects and a simplified “JustSendIt” mode. In the latter, users can launch a token and, once 85 SOL is raised through a bonding curve, liquidity is automatically migrated to a Raydium pool, LP tokens are burned, and trading continues without interruption. The process is designed to be fast and permissionless, with no migration fee and minimal friction. The platform’s trading fee structure includes a 1% base fee, 50% of which goes to a community pool, 25% to $RAY token buybacks, and 25% to infrastructure and operations. Creators can also opt in to earn 10% of trading fees from their token’s AMM pool after launch, a move intended to incentivize long-term development and sustainability. LaunchLab also introduces a referral program that pays 10 basis points of swap volume to wallets that refer new users, automatically airdropping SOL to incentivize platform growth. For developers, LaunchLab offers integrated token visibility across multiple terminals and apps, designed to streamline distribution from day one. Pump.fun’s PumpSwap Heats Up Solana DEX Wars as Trading Activity Soars Raydium’s new LaunchLab is important in the Solana DEX ecosystem, as Pump.fun’s freshly launched PumpSwap rapidly gains ground. Launched on March 20 , PumpSwap shows Pump.fun’s bold move to control its trading flow, ending its reliance on Raydium. Raydium previously handled secondary market activity for meme coins that hit a $69,000 market cap. Introducing PumpSwap, Pump’s new native DEX beginning NOW all coins that complete their bonding curve will migrate directly to PumpSwap PumpSwap enables – instant migrations – 0 migration fees (down from 6 SOL) – more liquidity – creator revenue sharing (coming soon) & more pic.twitter.com/T9BkmmaVVS — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) March 20, 2025 Since debuting, PumpSwap has quickly become a powerhouse. According to DeFiLlama , the platform processed $2.5 billion in trades last week, with a 40% week-over-week surge from $1.8 billion. Cumulatively, PumpSwap has cleared nearly $100 million in trades since launch.

Moscow thinks this will help police confiscate coins during their investigations. Per the Russian newspaper Vedomosti , “two sources close to” the Government Commission on Legislative Activity say the body has approved a bill drafted by the Ministry of Justice. The Russian state-run media agency TASS also says it has seen the ministry’s bill. Russian Crypto Law Incoming? The Vedomosti sources said the commission would send the bill to the State Duma “in the near future.” The Ministry of Justice in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Ministry of Justice Tomsk/RuTube/Screenshot) At present, crypto-related terms are not defined in either the Criminal Code or the Criminal Procedure Code. Police and public prosecutors have complained that this “greatly complicates” their investigations in crypto-related cases. A Complicated Process In 2020, lawmakers approved a bill that allows courts to recognize crypto as intangible property in bankruptcy cases. Since then, lawmakers have also amended laws that allow courts dealing with counter-terrorism and corruption cases to recognize the property status of crypto. But in more general criminal cases, crypto has no legal status whatsoever. Storage platforms and tools like crypto wallets also have no legal definition. This fact reportedly further complicates matters for Russian police and prosecutors. The newspaper quoted Vladimir Gruzdev, Chairman of the Board at the Association of Lawyers of Russia, as explaining that the crypto confiscation process is currently extremely complicated. Gruzdev said that, currently, coins can only be seized with the help of “a specialist,” who can “guarantee the correct handling of such a specific type of property.” The lawyer said that police can seize physical hardware wallets. But when they need to confiscate crypto held in “hot” online wallets, they need to instead “transfer coins to a special address-identifier to ensure its safety.” Russian justice ministry officials at a regional-level meeting. (Source: Ministry of Justice Tomsk/RuTube/Screenshot) Lawyers Respond to Minsitry Proposals TASS quoted Gruzdev as explaining further: “The draft law assumes recognition of [cryptoassets] as items subject to confiscation, and also establishes the procedures for these actions. The draft law should bring clarity to the current legislation. Because, for a long time, there has been no clarity in issues related to the legislative regulation of crimes involving [cryptoassets].” While other lawyers welcomed the move, some raised questions. Maria Bakakina, an adviser to the criminal law practice at Sokolov, Trusov, and Partners, said: “The question immediately arises: What legal mechanism have courts previously used to seize cryptocurrency?” Indonesia won’t allow Russian planes to be stationed on its territory, Australia’s Defence Minister Richard Marles said, following earlier reports that Moscow had requested permission to access a provincial base https://t.co/YJMIi7Tb0G — Bloomberg (@business) April 16, 2025 The newspaper gave the example of a case from 2022, when a district court in St. Petersburg seized control of 24 crypto wallets. Prosecutors claimed a the time that the wallets contained stolen Ethereum (ETH) coins. Others warned that lawmakers and government ministries must verify the “technical readiness” of Russian law enforcement agencies before approving the bill. Daniil Markhiyev, managing partner at Daniil Markhiyev and Partners, said: “Guarantees are needed to protect the rights of law-abiding individuals [in crypto cases]. This will ensure that third parties who are not associated with criminal activity do not suffer as a result.” Russia says it is not easy to agree on a peace deal with the US, El Salvador’s Bukele says he will not return the man the US mistakenly deported, and more.

43426152,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150045,1744846216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: Court Grants Ripple Relief with SEC Lawsuit Appeal Pause,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/court-grants-ripple-sec-appeal-pause/,"In a stunning turn of events in the long-standing legal saga between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a U.S. court has just given a significant nod towards potential respite for Ripple. Are you following the rollercoaster of the Ripple SEC lawsuit pause ? Buckle up, because things just took another interesting twist! Let’s dive into the latest development that has the crypto world buzzing. Court Approves Joint Motion: What Does a Ripple SEC Lawsuit Pause Mean? For those closely monitoring the Ripple SEC lawsuit , the news is significant: a U.S. court has officially approved the joint request from both Ripple and the SEC to put a hold on the appeal process. This information, confirmed by former federal prosecutor James K. Filan via a post on X (formerly Twitter), marks a temporary ceasefire in their ongoing legal battle. But what exactly does this Ripple SEC lawsuit pause entail? Joint Request Approved: Both parties, SEC and Ripple, jointly requested the court to put the appeal in abeyance, and the court has granted this request. This indicates a level of agreement, at least on procedural matters, between the two sides. Appeal Held in Abeyance: ‘Abeyance’ means temporary suspension. The appeal is not dismissed, but it’s put on hold. Think of it as pressing the pause button on a movie. Status Report in 60 Days: The SEC is mandated to submit a status report to the court within 60 days. This means we can expect further updates and insights into the situation in approximately two months. Why is SEC Ripple Appeal Abeyance Happening Now? The question on everyone’s mind is, why now? Why are the SEC and Ripple agreeing to a pause in their appeal process? While the exact motivations aren’t explicitly stated, we can infer a few possibilities regarding this SEC Ripple appeal abeyance : Focus on Other Matters: Both the SEC and Ripple might have strategic reasons to temporarily shift their focus. For the SEC, this could involve other regulatory priorities or ongoing cases. For Ripple, it might be about consolidating their legal position or focusing on business operations amidst regulatory uncertainties. Potential Settlement Discussions: A joint motion could subtly suggest a willingness, or at least an openness, to explore settlement possibilities outside the immediate pressure of an active appeal. Pausing the appeal might provide space for behind-the-scenes discussions. Strategic Repositioning: Both sides might be re-evaluating their strategies after the initial summary judgment. A pause allows them time to analyze the legal landscape and potentially adjust their approach for the appeal or future proceedings. XRP Lawsuit Update: What Does This Mean for XRP Holders? For the XRP community, every development in the XRP lawsuit update is closely watched. This news of a paused appeal could be interpreted in several ways. Is this a positive sign? Is it neutral? Or does it hint at further complexities? Potential Positives: Reduced Immediate Legal Pressure: The pause could be seen as a temporary easing of pressure on Ripple and, by extension, XRP. The active appeal process carries uncertainty, and a pause provides a breather. Hope for Resolution: Some might interpret this joint motion as a precursor to settlement talks. A settlement would likely be viewed positively by XRP holders as it could remove a significant cloud of regulatory uncertainty hanging over XRP. Points to Consider: Temporary Nature: It’s crucial to remember that this is a pause, not an end to the legal proceedings. The appeal is in abeyance, meaning it can be reactivated. SEC Status Report: The 60-day status report from the SEC will be critical. It could provide more clarity on the reasons for the pause and potential future steps. Uncertainty Remains: While potentially positive, the underlying legal uncertainty surrounding XRP and crypto regulation, in general, persists. Crypto Regulatory Relief or Just a Temporary Pause? The broader implications of this crypto regulatory relief , or lack thereof, are also worth considering. Does this pause signal a shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation? Is it a sign of potential leniency, or simply a tactical maneuver in a complex legal game? It’s likely too early to definitively say if this marks a significant shift in crypto regulatory relief . However, it does raise questions: Aspect Possible Interpretation Joint Motion Suggests a degree of procedural cooperation, potentially opening doors for communication beyond litigation. Pause in Appeal Reduces immediate legal pressure on Ripple and the crypto market sentiment related to the case. SEC Status Report Will be crucial in understanding the SEC’s perspective and future intentions. For the crypto industry, the outcome of the Ripple case is pivotal. It’s not just about Ripple and XRP; it sets precedents for how digital assets are regulated in the U.S. and potentially globally. Any perceived crypto regulatory relief , even temporary, can be seen as a positive development by market participants. Court Approves Ripple Motion: What’s Next? With the court approves Ripple motion for a pause, all eyes are now on the upcoming 60-day status report from the SEC. This report will be a key indicator of what to expect next. Will it reveal a change in the SEC’s stance? Will it hint at settlement possibilities? Or will it simply be a procedural update? In the meantime, here are some actionable insights for those following this case: Stay Informed: Keep tracking updates from reliable sources, including legal experts and reputable crypto news outlets. Manage Expectations: Avoid overreacting to short-term news. The legal process is complex and can have unexpected turns. Focus on Fundamentals: For XRP holders, while legal developments are important, also consider the fundamental value proposition of XRP and Ripple’s technology. Conclusion: A Pause for Breath in the Ripple SEC Saga The court’s approval of the joint motion to pause the appeal in the Ripple SEC lawsuit is undoubtedly a noteworthy development. It offers a moment of respite and raises intriguing questions about the future direction of this high-profile legal battle. Whether this pause leads to a settlement, a strategic repositioning by either party, or simply a procedural break remains to be seen. For the crypto community, it’s a reminder of the ongoing complexities of navigating regulatory landscapes and the ever-evolving nature of digital asset regulation. The 60-day status report will be the next key milestone in this fascinating and impactful case. Stay tuned, as the Ripple vs. SEC story is far from over, and the next chapter could be just around the corner.

Aljarrah shared a chart showing the significant returns an early investor would have realized by holding XRP from $0.25 to its current level of $2.14. In his post, he stated that a $100,000 investment made at $0.25 would now be worth $856,000, representing a 756% return. According to Aljarrah, this performance outpaces the returns of all hedge funds and even Bitcoin holders over the same period. He also noted that these gains occurred without real-world utility priced in and a blow-off top. This comment reflects the sentiment that XRP’s value remains disconnected from its intended utility in cross-border finance, which many believe has yet to be fully realized by the market. If you had invested $100,000 into XRP at $0.25, Today, you’d be sitting on $856,000 at $2.14 That outperforms every hedge fund & Bitcoin holder A return of 756% in less than 5 years.

After years of lateral movement, XRP broke above the $2 mark in late 2024, driven by Donald Trump’s November election victory and the announcement of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation . This caused a break above the long-term resistance at $1.96, and this level has continually served as support since then. The asset subsequently rose to a multi-year high of $3.39 in January, and while it has experienced some turbulence, it has largely remained above $2. This price movement is particularly notable given the backdrop of legal uncertainty XRP faced due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which began in late 2020. Despite those challenges, XRP has maintained support, and its price moved well beyond its pre-lawsuit trading range before the SEC agreed to withdraw its appeal . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The price action confirms that confidence in the asset remains strong among investors and traders, particularly those aligned with its broader use case in the financial system. XRP Outperforms Bitcoin Another notable feat highlighted by Aljarrah is that XRP outperformed Bitcoin during this period. Bitcoin traded around $33,000 in January 2021 and is currently trading at $85,760, representing an increase of only 159.8%. Comparing Bitcoin’s all-time high of $109,114 only shows a growth of 230.64%, while XRP’s peak of $3.39 is 1,256% higher than its initial level of $0.25. Multiple notable experts have predicted that XRP will flip Bitcoin , and its track record shows that it is capable of significantly more growth than the top digital asset. XRP’s fast settlement capabilities, low transaction costs, and positioning as a bridge currency are increasing its adoption, and massive price growth may be just around the corner.

43426452,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150046,1744846812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Startup Deck Secures $12M to Simplify Web Data Access,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-startup-deck-data-access/,"In a groundbreaking move for AI data access and web integration, Deck, a Montreal-based startup, has successfully raised $12 million in Series A funding. Positioning itself as the “Plaid for the rest of the internet,” Deck is on a mission to revolutionize how we interact with online data. Imagine a world where accessing data from any website is as seamless and secure as connecting your bank account to an app using Plaid. That’s the ambitious vision Deck is bringing to life, and investors are taking notice. What is ‘Plaid for the Internet’ and Why Does it Matter for User-Permissioned Data? Plaid has become synonymous with secure and user-friendly bank data access. It acts as a bridge, allowing applications to connect with your bank accounts with your explicit permission. Deck aims to extend this concept far beyond the financial realm, tackling the vast expanse of the internet. But why is this so crucial, especially when we talk about user-permissioned data ? The Data Silo Problem: Much of our valuable data is locked away in various online accounts – utility portals, e-commerce backends, payroll systems, and government services – often without easy ways to access or share it securely. API Limitations: While APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) facilitate data sharing, they are not universally available. A staggering 95% of platforms lack comprehensive APIs, creating a significant data accessibility gap. Manual Data Handling is Inefficient: Currently, accessing data from these non-API platforms often involves manual, time-consuming processes. Deck seeks to automate and streamline this, making data readily available for various applications and uses. Deck’s core value proposition lies in simplifying and securing web data extraction , giving users control over their information across the internet. Deck’s AI-Powered Solution: How Does it ‘Plaid-ify’ the Web? Deck’s technology leverages AI website integration to act as intelligent data agents. Here’s a breakdown of how it works: AI-Driven Automation: When a user grants permission to connect an account, Deck’s AI agents take over. They intelligently log in, navigate the website, and extract the necessary data, mimicking human interaction but with superior speed and reliability. Script Generation for Reusability: The system doesn’t just extract data once. It generates scripts to maintain live, reusable connections, minimizing ongoing AI involvement and ensuring efficient data access. Seamless Integration: Deck acts as a bridge, simplifying the complex backend processes of authentication, data normalization, consent management, rate limiting, and anti-bot protection. This allows developers to focus on building applications rather than wrestling with data extraction intricacies. In essence, Deck is creating an infrastructure that makes accessing data from any website as straightforward as using an API, even when no API exists. This has massive implications for businesses seeking to streamline operations and enhance user experiences. From ‘Plaid for Canada’ to Global Web Data Revolution The founders of Deck are not new to the data connectivity landscape. Yves-Gabriel Leboeuf, Frederick Lavoie, and Bruno Lambert previously founded Flinks, a company hailed as the “Plaid for Canada,” which was acquired for a substantial US$140 million. This prior success underscores their deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the data access space. Their motivation for Deck stemmed from a recurring pain point they observed across industries post-Flinks acquisition: data accessibility. Entrepreneurs struggled with: Trapped Sales Data: Millions in sales intelligence locked within cumbersome distributor portals. Inaccessible Royalty Data: Difficulties in accessing music royalty data, hindering artists from claiming billions in unpaid royalties. Personal Experience: Even the founders themselves faced data access frustrations, highlighting the pervasive nature of the problem beyond the financial sector. This realization fueled the creation of Deck, aiming to solve the fragmented and fragile state of data access across the entire web. Use Cases and Industries Poised for Transformation While Deck initially focused on utility companies, connecting to over 100,000 providers globally, its potential applications are vast. Consider these sectors that could be transformed by seamless AI data access : Financial Services: Beyond traditional banking, think of streamlined KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, automated financial reporting from various platforms, and more efficient business verification. E-commerce: Accessing sales data from diverse marketplaces, automating inventory management, and gaining deeper customer insights from various online touchpoints. Healthcare: Securely aggregating patient data from different healthcare providers and portals (with proper consent), improving care coordination and research. Supply Chain and Logistics: Real-time tracking of shipments and inventory across various platforms, enhancing supply chain visibility and efficiency. Government Services: Simplifying citizen access to government data and services, streamlining bureaucratic processes. Deck’s technology essentially unlocks data trapped in online accounts across virtually any industry where data is critical but inaccessible through traditional APIs. Performance-Driven Pricing and User Consent at the Forefront Deck’s pricing model is designed to be performance-driven, meaning clients are charged based on “successful” API calls. This approach offers several advantages: Cost-Effectiveness: Clients only pay when the data extraction is successful, ensuring value for money. Scalability: The model supports scalable data access solutions, accommodating varying data needs and volumes. Transparency: Performance-based pricing provides clear and predictable costs. Furthermore, Deck emphasizes user-permissioned data access, mirroring the principles of open banking and data portability. They rely on explicit user consent for data collection, aligning with global trends towards greater data ownership and control. Deck also employs proprietary technologies to circumvent anti-bot measures, ensuring reliable and ethical data extraction.

Recent reports from JPMorgan are painting a mixed picture for Bitcoin miners , especially as we navigate the ever-shifting landscape of digital currencies. Early April brought some unexpected turbulence, with certain mining operations feeling the squeeze more than others. Let’s dive into the details and understand what’s driving these market fluctuations. Why Are Some Bitcoin Miners Experiencing Underperformance? According to a recent JPMorgan analysis, not all Bitcoin miners are created equal, especially when it comes to weathering market pressures. The report highlights a stark contrast in performance within the sector during the first two weeks of April. Miners with significant exposure to high-performance computing (HPC) seem to be bearing the brunt of recent challenges. Which miners are in the hot seat? Bitdeer TeraWulf IREN Riot Platforms These companies, identified by JPMorgan as having substantial HPC operations, reportedly underperformed in early April. But what exactly does HPC exposure have to do with it? Decoding HPC Exposure and Its Impact on Mining Stocks HPC, or High-Performance Computing, refers to powerful computing systems designed to tackle complex problems. While beneficial in many sectors, it appears that for some Bitcoin miners , this focus may have become a vulnerability in the current market climate. The exact reasons for this underperformance related to HPC exposure aren’t explicitly detailed in the report, but we can infer some potential factors: Increased Operational Costs: HPC infrastructure can be expensive to maintain and operate, potentially leading to higher overheads, especially when mining profitability is squeezed. Market Sentiment: Investors might be perceiving HPC-heavy miners as less agile or more capital-intensive in a fluctuating market, impacting their stock valuations. Resource Allocation: Companies heavily invested in HPC might have resources tied up in infrastructure that could be less flexible in adapting to rapid market changes compared to miners with more streamlined operations. Mining Stocks: The Outperformers and the Laggards While some mining stocks faced headwinds, the JPMorgan report also shone a spotlight on companies that bucked the trend. In a period where many struggled, two names stood out: MARA Holdings CleanSpark These were the only miners tracked by JPMorgan that managed to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) itself during the first half of April. This raises an important question: What are MARA and CleanSpark doing differently? Potential factors contributing to their outperformance could include: Efficient Operations: These miners might have more streamlined and cost-effective mining operations, allowing them to maintain profitability even when market conditions tighten. Strategic Asset Management: They could be employing more effective strategies in managing their Bitcoin holdings and hedging against market volatility. Lower HPC Dependence: It’s possible these outperformers have less reliance on HPC infrastructure compared to the underperforming group, making them more resilient to the current market pressures. The Pressure Cooker: Rising Hashrate and Falling Bitcoin Prices The JPMorgan report points to two key factors squeezing Bitcoin miner profitability across the board: rising network hashrate and a decline in Bitcoin prices. Understanding Hashrate Hashrate is a crucial metric in the Bitcoin network. It represents the total computational power being used to mine Bitcoin and process transactions. A rising hashrate generally indicates a more secure and robust network, but it also means increased competition for miners. As more miners join the network or existing miners ramp up their operations, the difficulty of mining increases. This means each miner gets a smaller slice of the block reward pie for the same amount of effort. The Double Whammy: Hashrate Up, Rewards Down According to the report, daily block rewards for miners experienced a significant 12% drop from March. This decrease, coupled with a generally softer Bitcoin price in early April, creates a challenging environment for mining profitability . When Bitcoin prices dip, the value of the rewards miners earn also decreases in fiat terms. Let’s break down the impact in a simple table: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Miners Rising Network Hashrate Increased mining difficulty, reduced individual miner rewards. Declining Bitcoin Price Lower value of block rewards in fiat currency, reduced revenue. Combined Effect Significant pressure on mining profitability , especially for less efficient operations. Market Cap Contraction and Valuation Concerns The overall market capitalization of the 13 U.S.-listed miners tracked by JPMorgan saw a 2% decrease, settling at $16.9 billion. This indicates a general cooling off in investor sentiment towards the sector, or at least a recalibration of valuations in light of the challenging conditions. Perhaps even more concerning is JPMorgan’s observation that miners are currently trading at their lowest valuation relative to rewards in over two years. This suggests that the market is pricing in continued pressure on mining profitability and potentially anticipating further difficulties for the sector. Are investors losing faith in the short-term prospects of mining stocks ? Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors So, what can we glean from this JPMorgan report? Here are some actionable takeaways: Diversification Matters: The contrasting performance of miners highlights the importance of diversification within the crypto mining sector. Not all miners are equally positioned to succeed in varying market conditions. Efficiency is Key: Miners with efficient operations and lower overheads seem better equipped to weather profitability squeezes. Keep an eye on operational metrics when evaluating mining stocks . Monitor Hashrate and Price: Track network hashrate trends and Bitcoin price movements closely. These are crucial indicators of the overall health and profitability of the mining industry. HPC Exposure: While HPC is powerful, consider the potential implications of heavy HPC reliance for Bitcoin miners in volatile markets. It might not always translate to superior performance. Valuation Watch: The low valuation relative to rewards could present either a buying opportunity for the long-term believer or a warning sign of deeper troubles ahead. Further research is crucial. Navigating the Bitcoin Mining Maze The early April underperformance of certain Bitcoin miners , as highlighted by JPMorgan, serves as a valuable reminder of the complexities and nuances within the cryptocurrency market. While the overall market cap experienced a slight dip, the divergence in performance between miners with and without heavy HPC exposure underscores the importance of careful analysis and strategic investment. As hashrate continues to climb and Bitcoin prices fluctuate, the ability of miners to adapt, optimize operations, and manage costs will be paramount to their survival and success. The crypto mining landscape is ever-evolving, demanding continuous learning and informed decision-making.

In its report , trade in goods is expected to contract by 0.2%, which differs from its projection at the start of the year, when the WTO projected that trade would continue to grow, increasing by 2.7%. The new forecasts show a major drop from last year’s good trade, which grew by 2.9%. North America is expected to experience a major decline in goods trade this year, with the forecast projecting a 12.6% decline. The WTO added that there’s a risk that the decline will increase by 1.5% should the paused tariffs come back into action and the impact of the aftermath of uncertainty in trade policies. Tariff decisions bring pain Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, WTO’s director general, shared her concerns on the matter, saying, “I am deeply concerned by the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, including the U.S.-China standoff.” She pointed out that the paused tariffs helped to ease the pressure, but the uncertainty that comes with it threatens to hinder global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, the most vulnerable economies in particular. Okonjo-Iweala spoke on the long-established link between trade and economic expansion, noting that disruptions in global trade flow can spill over into financial markets and broader economic sectors. “We must ask ourselves: how do we safeguard the poorest countries from these shocks?” she added. According to the WTO, this new estimate is based on measures put in place at the start of this week, which considers the tariffs already in operation and the ongoing 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs for select countries other than China. According to the report, the revised projection of a 0.2% contraction is nearly three percentage points lower than the organization’s “low tariff” baseline scenario, illustrating how significantly the global trade environment has shifted. The U.S. and China make up the bulk of the global trade Ralph Ossa, the WTO’s Chief Economist, told reporters that the ongoing trade dispute between China and the United States is expected to result in a “drastic contraction” in trade between the two economic giants. He also echoed the director general’s sentiments on the ripple effect it will have on other global markets. The report also notes that the effects of recent trade policy shifts are likely to vary widely across regions. Asia and Europe are reportedly contributing positively to global trade, although their impact has diminished. For example, Asia’s contribution to global trade growth has been halved to 0.6 percentage points under current conditions. Moreover, the change in U.S.-China trade is expected to trigger “significant trade diversion,” according to the WTO, raising concerns that third markets may face increased competition from Chinese exports seeking alternative destinations.

While some projects float on hype, a few are building with purpose. Right now, three names are dominating that discussion: Polkadot, SUI , and BlockDAG . Polkadot’s long-term roadmap is packed with promise, but monthly forecasts reveal volatility—some even hint at sub-$1 levels. SUI crypto? It just took a 20% nosedive and is now scraping its lowest level in six months. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pulling off something the others aren’t: real-time traction . With over 1 million users actively mining on the X1 app , and presale returns already clocking a 2,380% gain , BDAG is converting momentum into actual value. Fast. Polkadot Price Forecast: Innovation Is There, but Can the Price Keep Up? Polkadot’s roadmap for 2025 is packed: DOT 2.0, Elastic Scaling, and new cross-chain features that aim to boost utility. Some analysts forecast a rise to $10–$12 by year-end, but these predictions depend on major adoption and sentiment shifts. Still, the Polkadot Price Forecast isn’t without risk. Monthly projections reveal volatility, with some dipping below $1 , even under optimistic models. It’s not a question of vision—Polkadot has that in spades. The real challenge? Convincing the market to wait for long-term returns while faster-moving tokens rewrite growth expectations overnight. SUI Crypto Drops 20%—Signal to Buy or Warning to Bail? SUI crypto just plunged 20% in 24 hours, falling below $2 and marking a new low not seen since October 2024. With an RSI of 31.69 and a near-oversold Money Flow Index , the usual indicators flash “buy”—but this time, the charts aren’t convincing. A descending channel is forming, and the Bull Bear Power indicator shows bears firmly in control. If SUI breaks below the 0.236 Fibonacci level, it could collapse toward $1 or even $0.45 . Oversold doesn’t always mean upside—sometimes, it’s just the calm before another drop. BlockDAG’s 1M+ Miners Aren’t Guessing—They’re Banking Daily BDAG Yields While others wait for catalysts, BlockDAG is generating action. Its X1 Miner App is now used by over 1 million people —not for test runs, but for real, daily BDAG mining. No fancy rigs. No high-power setups. Just a phone and up to 20 coins a day —mined quietly and effortlessly. But this isn’t about the app’s simplicity. It’s about what it taps into: a Layer 1 network that’s already delivered a 2,380% presale surge , with price targets of $1 in 2025 , $20 in 2027 , and $30 in 2030 . Every phone tap is stacking coins that could soon be worth serious money. So far, $214 million has been raised without a single VC. Over 19.2 billion BDAG tokens have been sold, and users still have a direct entry point through their smartphones. It’s crypto mining for the masses—no wallets, no gas, just download, tap, and stack. This isn’t experimental. It’s smart accumulation before BlockDAG’s mainnet goes live and BDAG hits exchanges. Because once liquidity opens, daily taps become daily yield , and each mined coin becomes part of a bigger payday. One Delivers, Two Wait for a Comeback Polkadot is preparing for long-term gains, but its path depends on adoption and patience. SUI crypto has hit oversold territory—but without technical strength, any rebound is uncertain. Both have potential, but neither are generating value right now. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already producing results . With over 1 million daily miners, a $214M presale, and an ecosystem scaling faster than expected, it’s turning attention into action—and action into earnings. With projected price levels of $1 in 2025, $20 in 2027, and $30 in 2030 , every BDAG mined today could represent massive future profits. For those holding back, each unmined day is another missed chance. For those mining now? It’s already started paying off. The verdict?

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 783,000 followers on the social media platform X that Sei ( SEI ) may increase more than 100% its current value if it breaks through a key resistance level. “SEI starts to show momentum. The Bitcoin pair has a strong bullish divergence on the higher timeframes and the USD pair faces a crucial resistance. Breaking through $0.20 opens up a continuation towards $0.30-$0.35.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SEI is trading for $0.17 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is in a consolidation phase that may lead to an explosive move to the upside. “Bitcoin is stuck in the final range. Another test of $87,000 and we’ll likely break upwards to the rally of a new all-time high.” Bitcoin is trading for $83,800 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lastly, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may be kicking off an uptrend if the price of gold peaks, based on ETH’s historic inverse correlation with the precious metal. “A good start of the week, as ETH is +4% against Bitcoin. The ultimate question whether it will sustain or not, last months it has been giving back the returns in the days after. What to monitor? Gold peaking or not. If that’s the case, then we’ll see more strength on ETH.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X The analyst also says that ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is flashing bullish, having entered oversold territory. The RSI is a momentum oscillator used to determine whether an asset is oversold or overbought. The RSI’s values range from zero to 100. A level between 70 and 100 indicates that an asset is overbought. The 0 to 30 level range indicates that an asset is oversold. “It’s been a bear market for 1,225 days for ETH, as, in this period, gold did a 2x. The lowest RSI on the weekly candle for ETH as well.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ETH is trading for $1,589 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours.

Momentum is shifting, and despite all the chatter, a few projects are starting to break away from the rest. BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Avalanche aren’t just holding on—they’re actively building and gaining attention for it. In a market full of hype cycles and fading trends, these four are hitting real milestones that could shape the story going into 2025. Let’s take a closer look at what they’re doing right. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A Fast-Rising Star Backed by Numbers BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos to buy , and its performance speaks volumes. The project has already raised over $214 million in its presale—all without relying on VC funding. Its token price has surged from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27, delivering a 2,380% gain to early buyers. What sets it apart? BlockDAG uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure instead of a traditional blockchain. That design enables multiple transactions to run at the same time, offering faster speeds and better energy efficiency. Paired with a more streamlined version of Bitcoin’s mining method, it’s built for performance. The network is already live in beta, giving developers a head start to test apps. On the security side, an audit by Halborn is complete, and Certik is working on another, reinforcing trust as the ecosystem expands. As the mainnet nears and listings on up to 10 major exchanges get closer, many analysts believe a $1 price in 2025 is realistic. Some even project more beyond that. BlockDAG may not be mainstream yet, but it’s checking all the boxes for serious long-term potential. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Building Speed & Strength for DeFi Hyperliquid (HYPE) is carving out a space in DeFi with a custom-built Layer-1 chain using the HyperBFT consensus mechanism. It’s designed to process decentralized finance operations with speed and efficiency, and the growing numbers prove it’s working. The project now holds over $160 million in total value locked—a strong signal of early adoption. HYPE tokens were distributed via a well-received airdrop to loyal users last year. Today, the token trades around $12.28 with a market cap of roughly $4.1 billion. Analysts believe HYPE could reach $27.34 if adoption picks up and on-chain activity remains steady. That upside has put it on watchlists as one of the top cryptos to buy going into 2025. 3. Sui (SUI): Built for Web3, Backed by Major Players Sui (SUI) is a next-gen Layer-1 network built by former Meta engineers using the Rust language. It aims to deliver fast, scalable solutions for Web3 developers. It’s already caught the attention of major players like a16z, Binance Labs, Franklin Templeton, and Coinbase Ventures, giving it a strong foundation to grow. SUI currently trades at about $1.97 and carries a market cap of over $6.2 billion. Depending on future adoption, some forecasts point to a price of $11.50 in 2025, while more conservative estimates hover closer to $2.06. Either way, Sui’s technical depth and backer support make it a solid contender among the top cryptos to buy this year. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Focused on Gaming & Growing Fast Avalanche (AVAX) has built a reputation for fast, efficient blockchain performance, and it’s now diving deep into the gaming world. Its subnet architecture allows for tailored chains, and that’s proven especially useful for hosting games like Shrapnel, Spellborne, Bloodloop, and Off the Grid. Backed by investment heavyweights like Pantera Capital, a16z, and Coinbase Ventures, Avalanche is also home to an expanding memecoin ecosystem. AVAX is currently priced around $16.34, with a market cap of approximately $6.79 billion. Analysts see potential for the token to hit $22 in 2025, particularly if the gaming push pays off. This unique angle keeps Avalanche in the discussion as one of the top cryptos to buy this cycle. Why These 4 Projects Stand Out From Avalanche’s push into gaming to Sui’s Web3 focus and Hyperliquid’s DeFi speed, each project on this list is solving real problems—and doing it with momentum. These aren’t just whitepapers and promises; they’re building live systems and attracting growing user bases. But one name rises above the rest: BlockDAG. It’s hitting major milestones fast—a working beta network, over $214 million raised in presale, and strong security audits, all without outside funding. With a 2,380% price jump already locked in and more batches selling out quickly, BDAG is gaining traction as the top crypto to buy now . If you’re looking for real growth potential instead of just buzz, these four projects deserve attention—but BlockDAG is shaping up to lead the charge.

Here’s What The Chart Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/pepe/pepe-price-to-bounce-796/,"PEPE’s price action has been relatively quiet in the past few weeks. The meme coin has been quietly going through a continued wave of selloffs amidst the volatility in the wider crypto market. However, an interesting technical analysis shows that the chart structure of PEPEUSDT is pointing to a massive move to the upside, one that could send the token soaring by as much as 796% before the end of 2025. As the broader crypto market continues to move sideways, crypto analyst MasterAnanda identified a short-term higher low forming around support levels, which could act as the launchpad for a major PEPE price breakout. Short-Term Higher Low Points To Strong Accumulation Zone The bullish outlook on PEPE is based on the repeat of a similar price formation that played out in 2024 before its run to new price highs and eventually its current all-time high of $0.00002803. According to the price chart shared by the analyst on the TradingView platform, PEPE initially traded in a descending channel between May to September 2024 before eventually breaking out of the channel. After breaking out of the channel, PEPE went on a brief uptrend and another downside which led to the creation of a lower low, before eventually going on an extended rally that peaked in December 2024. Related Reading: PEPE Price Breaks Ascending Triangle To Target Another 20% Crash Notably, it seems the same structure is showing up again on the PEPE price chart, specifically on the daily candlestick timeframe. In the analysis, MasterAnanda marks April as the period where PEPE bottomed out within a descending channel. Since then, two distinct highs and two clear lows have shaped what appears to be a reversal structure. Most notably, a new higher low is beginning to form a pattern that, according to previous price action, could precede a bullish wave. The analyst labels this as a important stage, especially for spot traders who are positioning for long-term growth. Although there could be weakness in the short term, which could result in one last shakeout or another downside wick, the analyst noted that this shouldn’t worry spot investors. It may offer a final opportunity to accumulate before momentum builds toward a new cycle high. On the other hand, leveraged traders are advised to proceed with caution and risk management, given the potential volatility during the build-up to the breakout. Fibonacci Levels Show 480% To 796% Rally Target The chart highlights a significant confluence around Fibonacci extension levels, with the 1.618 Fib level suggesting a possible 480% move and the more ambitious 2.618 extension pointing to a 796% upside. Interestingly, MasterAnanda noted that the numbers are huge. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Price Must Break This Resistance Level For 150% Surge Toward ATHs Although these targets are just projections, they align with the previous rally seen in late 2024. If this prediction structure holds, the next rally could push PEPE beyond the 1.618 Fib level at $0.0004264, surpassing all prior highs and printing a new all-time high in 2025. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.00000708, down by 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

Imagine applying that same principle to Artificial Intelligence. Microsoft researchers have just dropped a bombshell, announcing a revolutionary new AI model that’s not just powerful, but also incredibly efficient. Dubbed BitNet b1.58 2B4T, this groundbreaking model is designed to run smoothly on CPUs, even the ones in your everyday devices like Apple’s M2 chips. What does this mean for the future of AI and its potential intersection with crypto? Let’s dive deep into this exciting development. Unveiling BitNet: The Hyper-Efficient AI Model Microsoft is making waves with its latest creation, BitNet b1.58 2B4T. But what exactly is a “bitnet,” and why should you care? Think of bitnets as the streamlined athletes of the AI world. They are designed for maximum performance with minimal resources. Here’s the breakdown: Compressed Models for Lightweight Hardware: Bitnets are essentially compressed AI models. This compression is key because it allows them to run on hardware that isn’t necessarily top-of-the-line, like standard CPUs. Quantization for Efficiency: Traditional AI models often use complex “weights” – the internal settings that guide the model’s learning. To make these models more versatile, these weights are often “quantized.” Quantization reduces the number of bits needed to represent these weights, making the model lighter and faster. The 1-bit Innovation: BitNet takes quantization to the extreme. Instead of using the typical range of values for weights, it compresses them down to just three: -1, 0, and 1. This radical simplification is what makes BitNet models incredibly memory and computationally efficient . Imagine the implications for applications in the crypto space! Faster, leaner AI could power more responsive and accessible decentralized applications, improve blockchain analytics, and even enhance security protocols without requiring massive server farms. BitNet b1.58 2B4T: A New Milestone in AI Accessibility Microsoft’s BitNet b1.58 2B4T isn’t just another bitnet; it’s the largest one yet, boasting 2 billion parameters. Parameters, in this context, are essentially the same as the “weights” we discussed earlier. Here’s why this is significant: Scale and Performance: This model, trained on a massive dataset of 4 trillion tokens (think 33 million books!), demonstrates that even at a large scale, the efficient AI model approach of BitNet holds strong. Outperforming Similar Models: According to Microsoft researchers, BitNet b1.58 2B4T isn’t just holding its own; it’s outperforming traditional AI models of similar size. It surpasses models like Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, Google’s Gemma 3 1B, and Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 1.5B on key benchmarks. Speed and Memory Advantage: Perhaps the most impressive aspect is speed. BitNet b1.58 2B4T is reportedly twice as fast as other models of its size in some tests, all while using significantly less memory. This is a game-changer for deploying AI in resource-constrained environments. For crypto enthusiasts, this opens up possibilities for integrating sophisticated AI functionalities directly into wallets, decentralized exchanges, and other platforms, without the need for heavy infrastructure. Think about faster transaction processing, more intelligent smart contracts, and enhanced user experiences, all powered by lightweight AI . The CPU Advantage: Democratizing AI Processing The ability of BitNet b1.58 2B4T to run on CPUs is a core part of its appeal and a potential paradigm shift. Why is running on a CPU so important? Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness: CPUs are ubiquitous. They are in our laptops, desktops, and even smartphones. Unlike GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are often specialized and expensive, CPUs are readily available and more affordable. This drastically lowers the barrier to entry for running advanced AI models. Wider Deployment Opportunities: Because CPUs are so common, BitNet models can be deployed across a much wider range of devices. This is crucial for applications that need to be accessible to a broad user base, including many within the cryptocurrency community who may not have access to high-end hardware. Energy Efficiency: CPUs are generally more energy-efficient than GPUs for certain types of tasks, especially when dealing with models like BitNet that are designed for efficiency. This aligns with the growing focus on sustainability in both AI and crypto spaces. Imagine a future where running complex AI algorithms is as commonplace as running any other software on your computer. BitNet on CPU brings us closer to that reality, making sophisticated AI more accessible to everyone, not just those with access to powerful GPU clusters. Challenges and the Path Forward for BitNet and AI Accessibility While BitNet b1.58 2B4T is a significant step forward, there are challenges to consider: Framework Dependency: To achieve peak performance, BitNet b1.58 2B4T currently requires Microsoft’s custom framework, bitnet.cpp. This framework has hardware limitations and, notably, does not yet support GPUs, which are the dominant force in AI infrastructure. Compatibility Hurdles: The reliance on a specific framework and limited hardware compatibility presents a challenge for widespread adoption. For BitNet to truly take off, broader hardware support and potentially more versatile frameworks are needed. Performance Trade-offs: While BitNet is efficient and fast, it’s important to remember that it doesn’t “sweep the floor” with all rival models in terms of raw performance. It holds its own and excels in efficiency, but in scenarios where absolute top performance is paramount and resources are abundant, other models might still be preferred. Despite these challenges, the promise of AI accessibility through models like BitNet is undeniable. The future likely holds further developments in bitnet technology, including: Expanded Hardware Support: Efforts to broaden compatibility to include GPUs and a wider range of CPUs are crucial. Framework Development: Creating more open and versatile frameworks that support bitnets could accelerate adoption and innovation. Optimization and Scaling: Continued research into further optimizing bitnet architectures and scaling them to even larger and more complex models will be key to unlocking their full potential. BitNet: A Glimpse into the Future of Lightweight AI Microsoft’s BitNet b1.58 2B4T is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a glimpse into a future where AI is more democratized, accessible, and efficient . By proving that large-scale AI models can run effectively on CPUs, BitNet challenges the conventional wisdom that powerful AI requires massive computational resources. For the cryptocurrency world, this breakthrough could pave the way for more integrated, responsive, and user-friendly decentralized applications. As AI continues to evolve, innovations like BitNet will be instrumental in shaping a future where AI is not just powerful, but also sustainable and within reach for everyone.

Sounds like fantastic news, right? Well, buckle up because while the numbers look amazing on the surface, a deeper dive reveals a less rosy picture for the future, especially as we look towards 2025. Is this a fleeting moment of exuberance before a potential downturn? Let’s unpack the latest PitchBook report and see what’s really going on in the world of venture capital and startup funding . Is Record Startup Funding a Mirage? On the face of it, the numbers are undeniably impressive. Startups globally raked in a whopping $91.5 billion in venture capital during the first quarter of this year, according to PitchBook. That’s not just a small bump; it’s an 18.5% leap from the previous quarter and the second-highest quarterly investment figure in the last decade! Check out these key highlights: Massive Growth: Q1 saw an 18.5% increase in venture capital compared to the last quarter. Decade Highs: This is the second-strongest quarter for startup investment in ten years. Headline Number: $91.5 billion poured into startups in just three months. However, before you start popping champagne bottles, let’s hear from Kyle Stanford, PitchBook’s lead U.S. venture capital analyst. He’s been watching this market for 11 years, and he’s currently sounding the alarm bells. Why? Because beneath the surface of these record numbers, there are some serious concerns brewing, particularly about the 2025 outlook . Why is the 2025 Outlook So Awful Despite Record Funding? Stanford’s pessimism isn’t about the present; it’s about what he sees coming down the pipeline in 2025. The Silicon Valley playbook relies on a cycle of investment, growth, and exits – ideally through IPOs or major acquisitions. These exits generate returns for investors and founders, who then reinvest that capital back into the startup ecosystem. It’s a virtuous cycle when it works. The expectation was that 2025 would be the year of significant exits. But, as Stanford points out, several factors have thrown a wrench into these plans: Market Volatility: The stock market is experiencing significant turbulence, partly due to geopolitical factors and economic uncertainties. Recession Fears: Concerns about a potential recession are looming, fueled by global economic policies. IPO Hesitancy: Startups are wary of launching IPOs in a depressed market where stock prices are vulnerable. As Stanford bluntly put it to Bitcoin World, “Liquidity that everyone was hoping for doesn’t look like it’s going to happen with everything that’s gone on the past two weeks.” We’re already seeing the impact, with companies like Klarna and Hinge reportedly reconsidering or postponing their IPO plans due to the current market turbulence. The Uneven Distribution of Venture Capital: OpenAI’s Mammoth Round Another critical point Stanford raises is that the headline startup funding numbers are masking some underlying weaknesses. A huge chunk of the Q1 investment – a staggering 44% of the $91.5 billion – went to a single company: OpenAI, with its massive $40 billion funding round. Let’s break down where the money actually went: Category Percentage of Total Q1 Funding OpenAI (Single Company) 44% Top 9 Other Companies (>$500M Rounds) 27% Remaining Startups 29% As you can see, a significant 71% of the total venture capital in Q1 was concentrated in just ten companies. While these are undoubtedly innovative and impactful businesses, this concentration highlights a critical issue: many other startups are likely facing a much tougher fundraising environment. “Those deals are really masking the challenges many founders are going through,” Stanford warns. Down Rounds and Startup Shutdowns: What’s on the Horizon? For a while now, analysts and investors have been predicting a shakeout in the startup world, ever since the era of zero interest rate policies (ZIRP) ended in 2022. While some startups have indeed failed, many others managed to survive by cutting costs and benefiting from a surprisingly resilient economy. However, this might be a temporary reprieve. The concern is that 2025 outlook remains bleak. If a recession hits, these startups, already operating on tight margins, could face a severe revenue crunch. This could lead to: Down Rounds: Startups forced to raise funding at valuations lower than previous rounds. Acquisitions at Discounts: Companies being acquired for significantly less than their perceived worth. Startup Shutdowns: Ultimately, some startups may be forced to close down completely. Stanford emphasizes that startups were pinning their hopes on a 2025 market recovery. Instead, a potentially worsening economy could accelerate the demise of many struggling businesses. The record startup funding in Q1 might be a last hurrah before a more challenging period.

According to the agency in a statement to CNBC on Monday, the CBP has collected over $500 million since April 5 under the new reciprocal tariffs, contributing to more than $21 billion in total tariff revenue from 15 presidential trade actions implemented since Jan 20, 2025. The update comes after a 10-hour glitch in the finance system The statement from the CBP regarding how much it has raised follows a glitch in the finance system that lasted a total of ten hours. The glitch prevented U.S. importers from inputting a code that would have spared freight that was already on the water from getting slammed with higher duties. This should have impacted the revenue stream, but according to the CBP’s statement, even during the glitch, its average $250 million/day revenue stream remained “uninterrupted.” The statement directly contradicts what Trump, famous for his embellishments, has said about the revenues. According to the 47th American president, the United States is currently raking in at least $2 billion per day from tariffs, including revenues directly resulting from his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. He reportedly made the statement repeatedly even though the most recent data released on Monday by the Treasury Department confirms the department’s daily statement of total deposits listed under “Customs and Certain Excise Taxes” as $305 million. All tariffs are collected by U.S. Customs at the point of entry. New trade policies for the pharmaceutical industry expected amid tariff wars In early April, the Trump administration saw fit to impose steep sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries it does business with. Then, while the world adjusted to the new development, the administration took a step back hours later, temporarily lowering most tariff rates to a universal 10%, except for tariffs on China, which it ratcheted up citing its retaliation as the reason. Meanwhile, the administration maintained sector-specific tariffs on the automotive industry and is expected to announce new trade policies for the pharmaceutical industry. In the meantime, China continues to resist. When the U.S. significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports, with rates reaching at least 125% on all goods, including a 90% levy on packages under $800 previously exempt under the “de minimis” rule, China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating from 34% to 84%, and then to 125% effective April 12, 2025. pic.twitter.com/gF04Nqoyvb — Chinese Embassy in US (@ChineseEmbinUS) April 16, 2025 China’s Commerce Ministry says the country is prepared to “fight to the end,” but it may be willing to forget the drama if Trump is ready to “completely cancel” his tariffs regime, and “return to the right path of mutual respect”.

Dubbed “Operation Avalanche,” this initiative highlights the growing global effort to combat crypto scam activities and safeguard the burgeoning digital asset space. But how did they do it, and what does this mean for you and your cryptocurrency holdings? What Exactly is an Ethereum Phishing Scam? Before diving into the details of Operation Avalanche, let’s understand the mechanics of an Ethereum phishing scam . Imagine receiving an email or a message that looks legitimate – perhaps from a popular crypto platform or even a decentralized application (dApp) you use. This message might urge you to “verify your wallet,” “update your security settings,” or claim you’ve won a reward. Sounds enticing, right? However, clicking on the link embedded in such a message leads you to a fake website – a near-perfect replica of the real platform. Here’s where the trickery comes in: Fake Approval Requests: These websites are designed to trick you into approving malicious transactions that drain your Ethereum wallet. Often, these are disguised as harmless requests to connect your wallet or approve a small transaction. Blind Signing Exploits: Sophisticated phishing scams exploit “blind signing,” a feature in many crypto wallets. When you blindly sign a transaction, you are essentially authorizing it without fully understanding its details. Scammers use this to get you to approve transactions that transfer your assets to their wallets. Emotional Manipulation: Phishing scams often play on emotions like fear (of losing access to your account) or greed (the promise of free crypto) to cloud your judgment and rush you into making mistakes. The result? Your hard-earned Ethereum vanishes into the pockets of cybercriminals. This is precisely what “Operation Avalanche” aimed to stop. Operation Avalanche: A Bold Strike Against Crypto Scams “Operation Avalanche” wasn’t just a lucky break; it was a meticulously planned and executed joint effort. The U.S. Secret Service and Canadian authorities spearheaded this operation, demonstrating a robust collaboration to tackle the rising tide of crypto scams . Here’s a breakdown of what made this operation a success: Joint International Effort: The partnership between U.S. and Canadian law enforcement is a crucial aspect. Cybercrime knows no borders, and this joint operation highlights the necessity of international cooperation to combat it effectively. Multi-Agency Collaboration: Beyond just law enforcement, “Operation Avalanche” involved a diverse range of stakeholders, including financial regulators, local police departments, cryptocurrency platforms, and blockchain analysis firms like The Block. This multi-pronged approach was vital for tracing funds, identifying victims, and shutting down the scam network. Proactive Victim Warning: A key element of the operation was not just disrupting the scam but also proactively warning potential and actual victims. By identifying compromised wallets and alerting users, authorities aimed to minimize further losses and raise awareness about cryptocurrency security . Focus on Ethereum Approval Phishing: The operation specifically targeted Ethereum approval phishing scams, recognizing the prevalence and financial impact of this particular type of fraud within the Ethereum ecosystem. Why is Cryptocurrency Security More Important Than Ever? The success of “Operation Avalanche” is a victory, but it also serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present threats in the crypto world. Cryptocurrency security should be your top priority if you are involved in digital assets. Here’s why: Decentralization and Responsibility: Unlike traditional banking, cryptocurrency operates on a decentralized system. This means you are solely responsible for the security of your digital assets. There’s no central authority to reverse transactions or bail you out if you fall victim to a scam. Irreversible Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are typically irreversible. Once funds are sent, they are gone. This makes it crucial to be extra vigilant and double-check every transaction before approving it. Growing Sophistication of Scams: As the crypto space matures, so do the tactics of scammers. Phishing scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it harder to distinguish legitimate requests from fraudulent ones. Staying informed and adopting robust security practices is essential for digital asset protection . High-Value Targets: The increasing value of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals. A successful phishing scam can result in significant financial losses, as highlighted by the $4.3 million stolen in this case. Actionable Insights: How to Protect Yourself from Crypto Phishing Scams Learning about “Operation Avalanche” is informative, but how can you translate this knowledge into practical steps to enhance your digital asset protection ? Here are some actionable insights: Security Measure Description Benefit Verify Website URLs: Always double-check the website address in your browser’s address bar. Phishing sites often use slightly altered URLs that are easy to miss at first glance. Prevents you from landing on fake websites designed to steal your credentials or trick you into signing malicious transactions. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Activate 2FA on all your crypto exchange accounts, wallets, and related services. Adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords, making it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they obtain your password. Use Hardware Wallets: Store your cryptocurrencies offline on a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets keep your private keys offline, making them virtually immune to online phishing and hacking attempts. Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Messages: Be wary of emails, messages, or pop-ups asking for your private keys, passwords, or to approve transactions urgently. Legitimate platforms will rarely, if ever, ask for such sensitive information through these channels. Helps you identify and avoid phishing attempts that rely on urgency and emotional manipulation. Learn About Blind Signing Risks: Understand the risks associated with blind signing and carefully review transaction details before approving them, especially for unfamiliar platforms or requests. Reduces the risk of unknowingly approving malicious transactions that drain your wallet. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest cryptocurrency security threats and best practices. Follow reputable crypto news sources and security blogs. Empowers you with the knowledge to recognize and avoid emerging scam tactics. The Future of Crypto Security: Lessons from Operation Avalanche “Operation Avalanche” is more than just a successful bust; it’s a valuable case study in the ongoing battle against crypto scams . It underscores the importance of proactive measures, international collaboration, and continuous vigilance in the digital asset space. As the crypto landscape evolves, so too will the tactics of cybercriminals. However, operations like this demonstrate that law enforcement and the crypto community are also adapting and innovating to protect users and maintain the integrity of the ecosystem. The fight against Ethereum phishing scam and other forms of crypto fraud is far from over. But with increased awareness, enhanced security practices, and collaborative efforts like “Operation Avalanche,” we can collectively build a safer and more secure future for cryptocurrency.

News emerging from a Wall Street Journal report, highlighted by Walter Bloomberg, indicates that the U.S. government is engaging in trade negotiations with over 70 countries. The objective? To establish a united front aimed at limiting China exports through these nations. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader financial markets, this development signals a potentially significant period of volatility and strategic realignment. What exactly does this mean, and how could it ripple through the global economy and potentially touch the crypto space? Decoding the US Strategy to Limit China Exports At its core, this U.S. initiative appears to be a strategic move to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on China exports . The specifics of these trade negotiations remain somewhat under wraps, but the sheer scale – involving over 70 countries – suggests a comprehensive and coordinated effort. Let’s break down what we understand so far: Broad Coalition: Negotiating with 70+ countries signifies a major diplomatic and economic undertaking. This isn’t a bilateral agreement, but a multilateral approach aimed at creating a substantial bloc. Targeting Exports: The focus on limiting China exports suggests a desire to curb China’s economic influence in key sectors and potentially encourage businesses to relocate or diversify production outside of China. Geopolitical Implications: This move has profound geopolitical implications. It could be interpreted as an escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China and could reshape global alliances and trade relationships. Economic Restructuring: Success in these trade negotiations could lead to a significant restructuring of global supply chains, impacting businesses, consumers, and economies worldwide. Why is the US Pursuing this Aggressive Trade Policy? Several factors likely underpin this assertive US trade policy . Understanding these motivations is crucial to grasping the potential long-term impact: National Security Concerns: A key driver is likely national security. Reducing dependence on a single nation, especially for critical goods and technologies, is seen as vital for national security and resilience. Economic Competition: The U.S. and China are engaged in intense economic competition. Limiting China exports can be viewed as a strategy to level the playing field or regain a competitive edge in certain industries. Supply Chain Resilience: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains. Diversifying away from concentrated sources like China is seen as a way to build more resilient and robust supply chains. Human Rights and Ethical Concerns: While less explicitly stated in the immediate news, human rights and ethical concerns related to manufacturing practices in some regions might also play a role in the broader strategy of diversifying supply chains. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Limiting China Exports This US trade policy , if successful, presents both potential benefits and significant challenges on a global scale. Let’s examine both sides: Potential Benefits: Supply Chain Diversification: A major benefit is the potential for more diversified and resilient global supply chains. This could reduce vulnerability to disruptions caused by geopolitical events, pandemics, or natural disasters concentrated in a single region. Boost to Other Economies: As companies seek alternatives to China exports , other countries could see a boost in manufacturing and export opportunities. Nations in Southeast Asia, India, and Latin America could potentially benefit. Reduced Reliance on Single Source: For individual nations and businesses, reducing over-reliance on a single source for critical goods can enhance economic security and reduce risks. Significant Challenges: Global Economic Disruption: Restructuring global trade on this scale will inevitably cause disruption. Supply chains will need to be reconfigured, which can lead to temporary shortages, price increases, and economic uncertainty. Increased Costs: Moving production and sourcing away from established centers like China could lead to higher production costs, which could be passed on to consumers in the form of inflation. Geopolitical Tensions: This US trade policy could further escalate geopolitical tensions with China, potentially leading to retaliatory measures and broader global instability. Implementation Complexity: Coordinating trade negotiations with 70+ countries is a massive undertaking. Ensuring consistent policies, enforcement, and managing diverse national interests will be incredibly complex. Impact on Global Trade and the Crypto Market The ramifications of these trade negotiations are far-reaching and will undoubtedly impact global trade . Here’s how this could potentially intersect with the cryptocurrency market: Economic Uncertainty and Safe Havens: Periods of economic uncertainty often see investors flock to assets perceived as safe havens. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as such. Increased volatility in traditional markets due to trade tensions could drive interest in crypto. Inflationary Pressures: If supply chain shifts lead to increased costs and inflation, cryptocurrencies, often touted as inflation hedges, might gain traction. Decentralization Narrative: The move towards economic decoupling and regionalization could strengthen the narrative around decentralization, a core tenet of many cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Transactions: In a world with potentially shifting trade blocs, cryptocurrencies could become more appealing for cross-border transactions, offering an alternative to traditional financial systems that might be affected by trade barriers and sanctions. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is also sensitive to broader economic downturns. A significant global recession triggered by trade wars could negatively impact all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Shifting Trade Landscape For investors, businesses, and individuals navigating this evolving global trade landscape, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Developments Closely: Stay informed about the progress of these trade negotiations and the reactions from various countries and economic blocs. News outlets like the Wall Street Journal and financial news services are crucial sources. Diversify Investments: Diversification is key in times of uncertainty. Consider diversifying investment portfolios across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with trade volatility. Assess Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Businesses should assess their supply chain vulnerabilities and explore diversification options to reduce reliance on potentially affected regions. Consider Crypto’s Role: Evaluate the potential role of cryptocurrencies in your investment strategy, considering their potential as hedges against economic uncertainty and inflation, but also acknowledging their inherent volatility. Conclusion: A New Era of Global Trade? The U.S. initiative to negotiate with 70 countries to limit China exports marks a potentially pivotal moment in global trade . While the full implications are yet to unfold, it’s clear that the world is entering a period of significant economic and geopolitical realignment. For those in the cryptocurrency space and beyond, understanding these shifts and adapting to the evolving landscape will be crucial. This is a story that will continue to develop, and staying informed and agile will be paramount in navigating the changes ahead.

XRP, trading around $2.3, is benefiting from renewed institutional interest and clearer regulatory standing. ADA, at $0.64, is backed by steady ecosystem growth and expectations of long-term scalability. But the biggest dark horse is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The presale for the altcoin MUTM is currently ongoing, with tokens being sold at $0.025, and the platform has raised $6.8 million to date. Over 8,300 investors are taking part, and many expect the price to increase to $0.03 in the upcoming phase. Investors in this stage could see up to a 140% return when the token’s anticipated launch price of $0.06 is reached. As bullish sentiment rises, these three could be at the front of the next breakout wave. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Behemoth in the Making Mutuum Finance transforms the decentralized lending world through its exceptional dual borrowing system which drives broad market adoption. Mutuum Finance gained support from over 8,300 investors during its presale period which has resulted in raising $6.8 million for the project. Early adopters who participate in Phase 4 will benefit from monumental gains because the token price is $0.025 but Phase 5 will bring it to $0.03. According to experts MUTM has the potential to reach more than $5 by the end of this year beginning at its initial offering price of $0.06 due to its innovative lending system which addresses the growing requirements of DeFi platforms. The game-shifting model of Mutuum Finance drives its increasing popularity because it operates as a solid token although undervalued. A dynamic leaderboard showing the top 50 MUTM holders has been introduced by MUTM. Token holders who succeed at keeping their position will receive bonuses that enhance both their position value and long-term commitment to MUTM. The rising interest of investors in projects focused on utility instead of hype showcases MUTM’s ability to demonstrate profitable substance-based cryptocurrency initiatives. Disrupting DeFi Lending with a Two-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi lending landscape with its innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model is enabling users to earn passive income by lending their USDT through automated liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. The P2P model, meanwhile, is enabling users to conduct direct transactions among themselves without the need for intermediaries, providing users with greater control over their assets. By incorporating these two systems, Mutuum Finance streamlines its decentralized operations and offers investors lucrative opportunities to maximize their gains. In a bid to boost its user numbers, Mutuum Finance is actively rolling out attractive incentive programs. The platform has allocated $100,000 to reward ten lucky investors with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There is also a referral program that offers rewards for bringing in new users to the platform. Early adopters enjoy exclusive privileges, including priority access to staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates that further their engagement with the community. A Secure and Trusted Financial Ecosystem An innovative collateralized USD-backed stablecoin through Mutuum Finance will become available on the Ethereum blockchain when it launches. The stablecoin possesses long-term price stability because its collateral value exceeds the currency amount it represents unlike insolvent algorithmic solutions. Mutuum Finance implements strict smart contract auditing and public financial mechanics through which users can identify numerous faults that affected DeFi projects previously. Mutuum Finance establishes security features that guarantee its network and systems will be trusted by investors. As the crypto market gains momentum, XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are set to rise in 2025. MUTM, currently priced at $0.025, has raised $6.8 million in its presale, attracting over 8,300 investors. With a projected price increase to $0.03, early buyers could see 140% returns by launch at $0.06. MUTM is poised to be a major DeFi player, don’t miss out.

A mere 7% of those polled showed confidence that SHIB would at some point in the future surpass DOGE, and these few stalwarts predicted it could occur as soon as 2026. The other 14% were uncertain about SHIB’s fate. The overwhelming rejection of Shiba Inu’s ability to replace DOGE as the leading meme coin mirrors wider market opinion regarding the two tokens. Supply Issues Present Major Hurdle For Shiba Inu Huge challenges in the SHIB token supply are one potential consideration preventing overtaking Dogecoin, Dr. Sathvik Vishwanath, Unnocoin’s jurisdictional head, disclosed. Consider the circulating supply of SHIB at 589.25 trillion versus just 148.82 billion for DOGE: the supply gap is massive. Vishwanath said that despite Shiba Inu’s excellent tokenomics and solid community support, the massive token supply keeps SHIB from taking over DOGE’s market cap. Huge Disparity In Current Market Position At present, Dogecoin is at the eighth position among cryptos with a market cap of $24.60 billion, while Shiba Inu holds 17th place with a market capitalization of $7.3 billion. SHIB would have to increase its worth by 240% to reach DOGE’s current rank by assuming that Dogecoin’s price remains constant, and both tokens share the same circulating supply.

According to IntoTheBlock, with whales dominating, SHIB daily trade volume rose to 224 billion tokens in 24 hours. Inflows from large-holders increased from 96 billion SHIB on April 13 to over 224 billion on April 14. This rise in interest from major investors could be a sign of changing sentiment as whales will set up before they anticipate a move in prices. This isn’t the first time these cryptocurrencies have seen conflicts regarding superiority. In 2021, Shiba Inu briefly dethroned Dogecoin when its market cap touched $39 billion. Alas, this victory was short-lived as DOGE quickly reclaimed the title of the number one meme coin.
